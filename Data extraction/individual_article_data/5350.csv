0,Introduction,"Most of the current energy sources mainly come from fossil fuels. However, excessive fossil fuel utilization causes emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and CO) resulting in global warming and acidic rain that affects the earth's climate, weather conditions, vegetation and aquatic ecosystems [1]. Considering the global warming and environmental pollution, there is increasing interest in hydrogen which promises to be a good substitute for fossil fuels. Hydrogen is one of the most promising alternative energy for sustainable green energy production because of its clean, efficient, renewable, and non-polluting characteristics [2–4]. The conversion of polysaccharides or organic wastes to hydrogen has been performed via either fermentation [5,6] or photosynthesis [7,8]. The former is generally preferred, because it does not rely on the availability of light sources and the transparency of mixed liquor [9]. Fermentative hydrogen has been studied for a large group of pure fermentative bacteria, such as Bacillus [10,11], Clostridium [5,6,12–15], Enterobacter [16], Thermotoga [14,17], and Actinomycetes [18]. The hydrogen yield with these pure cultures ranged from 0.53 to 2.52 mol H2/mol substrate. However, maintaining the pure cultures under reactor operating conditions are very challenging, therefore, for industrial applications the mixed cultures are preferred as they are more practical to use, easier to control and may have a broader choice of feedstocks [19]. The major challenge for biological hydrogen production is the preparation of large amount of active, stable and efficient hydrogen producing inoculum. For efficient performance, the functional natural microflora is the greatest interest in practice [20,21]. The inoculum preparation by microbial isolation with conventional plating technique is complicated, time consuming and only a small fraction of naturally occurring microflora could be cultivated. In certain cases, the key functional strains are unculturable by conventional plating technique therefore the symbiotic association and/or mechanism involved in naturally co-existing microbes corresponding to the biological hydrogen production cannot be detailed. In the literature, dilution to extinction approach has been used for the isolation of pure culture and functional consortia and the success depends upon retaining the functional strains in used dilution. In addition, enrichment by acid incubation is the commonly used technique for screening hydrogen producing bacteria [22,23]. Recently, Adav et al. [24] employed concentration to extinction approach to isolate functional hydrogen producing consortium from lignocellulosic biomass. Oh et al. [18] tested the sludge baking and sludge acidification to eliminate methanogenic bacteria, however, methane production was reduced but not totally prevented. Inoculum enrichment by heat pre-treatment is a simple and effective method to repress the hydrogen consuming bacteria such as methanogens and homoacetogens, and initiates the spore germination of Clostridium by altering their germination receptors [25,26]. The natural forest soil ecosystem significantly differs from the sludge environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to comprehensively compare the effect of heat pre-treatment temperatures on the isolation of functional hydrogen producing consortia from forest soil and evaluate the hydrogen production and metabolites at different glucose concentrations. The microbial community of the isolated functional consortium was identified and the possible role of the strains was illustrated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of functional consortium,"2.1 Isolation of functional consortium Soil samples from Tatachia Mountain forest, Taiwan were collected and enriched by heat pre-treatment method. In brief, soil samples were spread on aluminum trays in 1 cm thickness and oven dried at 65, 80, 95, 105 and 120 °C for 1 h to kill the vegetative and methanogenic bacteria. After 1 h heat pre-treatment, the biogas produced by the heat pre-treated soils contained only hydrogen and carbon dioxide, without detectable methane. Enriched soil samples were then sieved through 2 mm sieve and used within one day or stored in plastic bottles in a refrigerator (4 °C) till further use."
3,Hydrogen production with functional consortium,"2.2 Hydrogen production with functional consortium Hydrogen production was conducted in 200 mL serum bottles containing 100 mL of synthetic media [23] having the following composition (g/L): 3.8 NH4HCO3; 0.125 K2HPO4; 2.0 Na2CO3; 0.005 CuSO4·5H2O; 0.1 MgCl2·6H2O; 0.015 MnSO4·4H2O; 0.00125 CoCl2·6H2O; 0.025 FeSO4·7H2O; and glucose 0, 10.0, 15.0 or 20.0 at pH 6.5. One g of heat pre-treated soil was added into each serum bottle. The serum bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum seals and the headspace air was displaced by nitrogen gas to generate the anaerobic condition. The cultures were placed in a shaker-incubator at 30 °C and 150 rpm. The volume and the composition of the biogas, glucose concentration and soluble metabolites were measured at specific time intervals. Three control bottles (blank) without the addition of substrate and three bottles with non-treated soil were also prepared. The batch test was performed in triplicate to ensure data quality."
4,"DNA extraction, PCR, DGGE, and sequence analysis","2.3 DNA extraction, PCR, DGGE, and sequence analysis Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using 16S rDNA was performed for bacterial community analysis. A 5 mL of mixed cell culture was harvested by centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min and DNA was extracted as described previously [27]. 16S rDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers P1 (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and P2 (5′-ATTACCGCG GCTGCTGG-3′). The GC clamp of 40 base pairs was attached to primer P1 [28]. The PCR-amplified products were checked by gel electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose. The DGGE of PCR products was performed with a DCode universal mutation system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were applied to 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with 35–65% denaturating gradients. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 120 V at 60 °C for 14 h. The dominant bands were excised and re-amplified, and the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR-amplified 16S rDNA was sequenced using the ABI Prism model 3730 (version 3.2) DNA sequencer."
5,Chemical analyses,"2.4 Chemical analyses Gas production volume was measured and released periodically to minimize the possible inhibition effects of accumulated hydrogen on the tested strains [29,30] using sterile syringes. Gas composition was determined periodically by injecting 0.3 mL of headspace gas using a gastight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) into a gas chromatography (Shimadzu 14A GC, Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with a TCD (thermal conductivity detector) and FID (flame ionization detector) with nitrogen as carrier gas. Injector, column and detector temperatures were set at 100 °C, 90 °C and 120 °C. High purity methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases (Scott Specialty Gases, Plumsteadville, PA) were used as standards. Glucose was analyzed in filtered (0.45 μm) samples by anthrone-sulfuric acid method using glucose as a standard [31]. The volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols in the filtered samples were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography (Ecom LCP 4100 Pump, C18 column, LCD 2083 detector) with 25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 2.3 adjusted by phosphoric acid) as the mobile phase. Biomass was estimated by drying the samples at 105 °C according to Standard Methods [32]. The cumulative hydrogen production profiles were fitted with the modified Gompertz Eq. (1) (1) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P is the maximum hydrogen production (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the incubation time (h). The cumulative hydrogen data were fitted with Gompertz equation using Sigma plot (version 7.0)."
6,Results,
7,Isolation of hydrogen producing functional consortium,"3.1 Isolation of hydrogen producing functional consortium The hydrogen production at different initial glucose concentrations using soil inoculum obtained by heat pre-treatments was presented in Fig. 1 . The produced biogas consisted of hydrogen and carbon dioxide and free of methane in all pre-treated soil inoculum during 70 h of batch fermentation. At 10–20 g/L glucose concentration, untreated soil inoculum produced maximum 25–55 mL hydrogen. For the pre-treated soil inoculums 177–205 mL hydrogen was produced from a 10 g/L initial glucose concentration. This value increased to 252–318 mL with an increase in glucose concentration. The DGGE profile of the soil pre-treated inoculum suggested microbial diversity changes (Fig. 2 ). The dominant bands in the DGGE gel were excised, extracted, amplified and sequenced. The strains sequence similarities were determined using NCBI blast and presented in Table 1 . The bands 1, 3, 5, 6, 13 and 16 were common in all pre-treated soil inoculum but with varying relative intensities (Fig. 2). The bands 1, 3, 5, 6, 13 and 16 belonging to Clostridium sp. BL-26, Clostridium diolis strain W1, Clostridium sp. FRC-Cl1, Clostridium taeniosporum strain 1/k, Cohnella thermotolerans and Clostridium chromoreductans, respectively. The bands 8, 11 and 15 belonging to uncultured Clostridium sp., Clostridium beijerinckii and unidentified strain, respectively, were clearly visible in 105 °C pre-treated soil inoculum. Although, DGGE band patterns at 80 and 95 °C were similar, hydrogen yield was higher at 95 °C which may be due to some unknown mechanism. Detailed analysis on the roles and interactions of constituent strains in the mixed culture remain difficult. The different heat pre-treated soil inoculum produced hydrogen and was also functional. However, cumulative hydrogen production, hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield were comparatively higher with 95 and 105 °C pre-treated soil inoculum. Considering hydrogen production data at different glucose concentrations presented in Table 2 , DGGE profile, mixed culture at 95–105 °C were considered potential functional inoculum obtained by soil pre-treatments. Fig. 3 illustrates that hydrogen producing bacteria at 65, 80, 95, 105 and 120 °C were mostly composed of rod shaped Clostridium sp."
8,Hydrogen production at different glucose concentrations,"3.2 Hydrogen production at different glucose concentrations The glucose fermentation batch tests with initial glucose concentration 10–20 g/L were presented in Fig. 4 . After lag time of 15–20 h, biogas and hydrogen production increased significantly, reached at its peak and then decreased. The hydrogen content in the biogas ranged between 55 and 65% when 65 °C heat pre-treated soil inoculum was used, while it ranged 58–73% with functional consortium. The hydrogen production rate ranged 940.05–1358.38 mL H2/L/day with 65–80 °C pre-treated soil inoculums and 1243.71–1576.92 mL H2/L/day with functional consortium. The cumulative hydrogen of 2971.48–3146.37 mL H2/L, hydrogen production rate of 1551.67–1576.92 mL H2/L/day and hydrogen yield of 1.92–1.93 mol H2/mol glucose was obtained at initial glucose concentration 15 g/L using obtained functional consortium at 95–105 °C and was higher than other used glucose concentrations. At higher glucose concentration (20 g/L) hydrogen production was reduced due to substrate inhibition. The cumulative hydrogen production ranged from 1585.23 to 2527.78 mL H2/L was obtained for 120 °C at different glucose concentrations. The hydrogen yield at 10, 15 and 20 g/L glucose with 65 and 80 °C pre-treated inoculum were 1.47–1.56, 1.58–1.67 and 1.52–1.63 mol H2/mol glucose; while the corresponding values with the functional consortium were 1.73–1.74, 1.92–1.93 and 1.83–1.84 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively."
9,Soluble metabolites,"3.3 Soluble metabolites Table 3 lists the production of main soluble metabolites and alcohol during glucose fermentation at different glucose concentrations. The major soluble metabolites in the pre-treated soil inoculums were ethanol, acetate, formate, lactate, propionate and butyrate. Ethanol accounted 23.42–24.69% of total metabolites at 10–15 g/L glucose concentration with 65 °C pre-treated soils as inoculum. The ethanol-type fermentation was observed with 65 °C pre-treated soil inoculum with high ethanol/acetate ratio of 1.98. The increase in soil pre-treatment temperatures resulted decrease in ethanol concentration. Notably, considerable higher production of formate was observed with the functional consortium. The lactic acid was detected only at lower glucose concentrations in all pre-treatments."
10,Discussion,"The present study used soil pre-treatment approach to isolate the functional hydrogen producing consortium from soil. The strains identified in all the pre-treated soil inoculum were hydrogen producing Clostridium strains. In earlier reports, Clostridium spp. was presumed to be hydrogen producers [22,33,34]. Based on this assumption, some researchers have attempted to manipulate the microbial community by heat treatment of the inoculum to eliminate non-spore forming methonogens [30,35]. The present study, experimentally showed soil heat pre-treatment approach successfully cultivated spore forming Clostridium consortia and eliminated non-spore forming bacteria. The maximum hydrogen yield obtained in the present study was 1.93 mol H2/mol glucose and was comparable to those reported in literature demonstrating the applied soil pre-treatment scheme able to isolate potential hydrogen producing microbial consortium. Although, soil ecosystem is very diverse and contain hydrogen producing strain [36]; soil as such (non-treated) produced very low hydrogen. While soil pre-treatments significantly enhanced hydrogen production potential compared with untreated soil emphasizing the importance of soil pre-treatments. Kawagoshi et al. [23] studied effect of conditioning for variety of inoculums on fermentative hydrogen production and found no hydrogen production when refuse compost and kiwi grove soil were used as inoculums without conditioning. The isolated functional consortium demonstrated higher cumulative hydrogen productions, hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield than those using 65 and 80 °C pre-treated soil inoculums. The presence of three additional strains (bands 8, 11 and 15) in the mixed culture at 105 °C could explain the higher hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield. The higher temperatures were needed for the efficient spore germination of these strains. The microbial strain C. beijerinckii (band 11) could be a key functional strain that yield higher hydrogen (2.52 mol H2/mol glucose) and also utilizes variety of carbon and nitrogen sources to produce hydrogen [6]. The hydrogen production yield of C. beijerinckii strain, isolated from anaerobic sludge was 2.52 mol H2/mol glucose [6] and was comparatively higher than 1.1–1.9 mol H2/mol glucose by Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 [12], 1.08 mol H2/mol glucose by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC8249 [37], 1.20–1.42 mol H2/mol glucose by C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum ATCC 207021 [15]. The hydrogen content in the biogas produced by functional consortium was higher (58–73%). Similarly, Oh et al. [18] reported 57–72% hydrogen content in the biogas during biological hydrogen production using sludge baking technique. Porwal et al. [11] noted 63–70% hydrogen content in the produced biogas with thirty-five bacterial strains isolated from diverse environmental sources. Thus, the functional inoculum isolated by soil pre-treatment technique yielded high hydrogen content in the produced biogas; reducing further hydrogen purification cost and hence has the commercialization potential. Organic loading usually plays a crucial role in the efficiency of the hydrogen production [38]. The comparison of hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yields at 10–20 g/L glucose concentrations revealed efficient hydrogen production at 15 g/L glucose. The maximum hydrogen yield was 1.93 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose obtained at 15 g/L glucose with functional consortium was comparable to 1.61 mol H2/mol glucose obtained with heat treated soil inoculum in continuous flow bioreactor [36]. The maximum yield reported for pre-treated activated sludge was 1.60 mol H2/mol glucose at 65 °C [26]. The highest hydrogen yield from heat conditioned digested sludge has been reported to be 1.40 mol H2/mol of glucose [23]. When anaerobic sludge pre-treated at 80 °C was used to investigate effect of cultivation temperatures (33–41 °C), hydrogen yield ranged between 0.97 and 1.67 mol H2/mol glucose [39]. However, the sludge environment differs significantly from natural soil ecosystem, thus heat pre-treatment conditions and hydrogen production capabilities vary considerably. Natural variability of bacterial cultures in sludge and soil coupled with complex hydrogen production mechanism does not facilitate comparison. The fermentation metabolites produced by the functional consortium were acetate, ethanol, formate, lactate, propionate and butyrate. At low pre-treatment temperatures, ethanol-type fermentation was noted while increase in pre-treatment temperature leads to decreased ethanol production but increased acetate and formate yields. At higher pre-treatment temperatures, metabolic pathways shifted from ethanol to acetate–formate type. The higher content of formate in the metabolite could yield higher hydrogen yield due to typical hydrogen production pathway proposed by Tanisho et al. [40]. Using glucose, a maximum of 2.0 mol of H2 could be produced with butyrate as the main product and 4 mol of H2 with acetate as the major byproduct [41]. In conclusion, the functional hydrogen producing consortium obtained by soil heat pre-treatments has maximum cumulative hydrogen, hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield. The soil heat pre-treatments temperatures showed changes in the microbial diversity as revealed by DGGE profile. The optimum glucose concentration for efficient hydrogen production using pre-treated soil was 15 g/L glucose. The proposed soil heat pre-treatment approach is feasible to isolate natural functional hydrogen producing Clostridium consortium."
