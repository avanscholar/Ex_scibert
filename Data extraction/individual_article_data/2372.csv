0,Introduction,"The development of hydrogen production technologies requires identification of potential markets and the constraints associated with those markets [1]. The markets partly define the requirements for the production technologies as well as potential partners to commercialize new hydrogen production technologies. Markets can be divided into those markets with large centralized demands for hydrogen and markets with decentralized demands for hydrogen. It has been estimated [2] that in a hydrogen economy, half the cost of hydrogen to small distributed users may be associated with production and half associated with the distribution and storage of hydrogen. A small-scale hydrogen production technology can be significantly more expensive than centralized hydrogen production and still be the low-cost technology for smaller users if hydrogen distribution and storage costs are reduced. At the same time, a small-scale hydrogen production technology must be significantly less expensive than a large-scale production technology if it is to economically supply hydrogen to a large user because of the cost of collecting and shipping the hydrogen to the large user. The two markets are only partly coupled because of the cost barriers of hydrogen distribution and storage. This paper describes potential high-volume centralized hydrogen markets for large-scale hydrogen production systems and some of the constraints associated with those markets. There are two technologies where only large production facilities are economic and thus most easily couple to these markets. • Nuclear energy: Nuclear power plants produce heat that can be used directly or converted to electricity for the production of hydrogen. All of the production options convert water to hydrogen and oxygen. Four classes of options are under development: traditional electrolysis ( electricity + H 2 O [ liquid ] → H 2 + O 2 ); high-temperature electrolysis ( electricity + H 2 O [ steam ] → H 2 + O 2 ); hybrid cycles ( electricity + heat + H 2 O → [ cyclic chemical reactions ] → H 2 + O 2 ); and thermochemical cycles ( heat + H 2 O → [ cyclic chemical reactions ] → H 2 + O 2 ). The near-term option is electrolysis. The longer term options involve using heat to convert water to hydrogen and oxygen. Because heat is less expensive than electricity (avoided cost of converting heat to electricity with associated losses), these advanced processes have the long-term potential of lower production costs (see other papers in this issue of IJHE). The distinctive characteristic of this technology is the large-scale production of hydrogen and oxygen. • Fossil fuels with carbon dioxide sequestration: Hydrogen can be made by steam reforming of fossil fuels that produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. There are very large economics of scale associated with steam reforming and carbon dioxide sequestration. The US Department of Energy FutureGen project [3] is initiating a demonstration project to produce hydrogen with sequestration of the carbon dioxide. The energy output will be equivalent to a 275MW(e) plant and is expected to sequester one million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Only hydrogen is produced, no oxygen is produced. For non-carbon-dioxide-emitting hydrogen production technologies (nuclear, renewables, and fossil fuels with carbon dioxide sequestration), potential restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere are an important factor in the potential size of future markets. With the Kyoto Accord now in effect in most of the world (except the United States and Australia), there are growing incentives to reduce greenhouse gas releases. Such incentives already exist in some countries. For example, Norway taxes carbon dioxide emissions and thus creates a strong incentive to minimize these releases [4]. In any scenario where there are restrictions on carbon dioxide releases to the atmosphere, extraordinary demands for hydrogen will likely exist if non-greenhouse hydrogen production technologies are available at reasonable costs."
1,Markets,"Existing and potential hydrogen markets were identified and characterized as shown in Table 1 . • Transportation (Vehicle)—Section 3: Transportation requirements can be met with different fuels. Each fuel requires different amounts of hydrogen in the production process and has different economics of scale. • Industrial—Section 4: The two major industrial markets for hydrogen are fertilizer production and steel. All nitrate fertilizers require hydrogen in their production processes. Some but not all steel production processes require hydrogen. These are large-scale facilities that match large-scale hydrogen production systems. • Electrical—Section 5: Hydrogen is a candidate for electrical production, particularly for production of peak electricity. • Commercial—Section 6: Hydrogen is being considered for commercial applications in buildings with the co-production of electricity and heat. Each market is characterized by several parameters that impact the choices of preferred hydrogen production technologies (Table 1). • Feedstock: Different feedstocks are used to produce transport fuels. When feedstocks (tar sands, shale, coal, etc.) are available in concentrated form, large production facilities are favored. In contrast, feedstocks such as biomass are dispersed and have high shipping costs. Production facilities starting with these feedstocks will be smaller because it is uneconomic to ship these feedstocks to large centralized processing facilities. The size of the fuels production facility, in turn, defines the size of the hydrogen production plants. • Carbon dioxide production: Releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere may ultimately be limited. Transport fuels release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by two routes [5]: (1) production of the transport fuel and (2) consumption of the transport fuel. If liquid fuels are made from crude oil, most of the carbon dioxide is from burning the gasoline. However, if liquid fuels are made from coal with traditional processes, more carbon dioxide may be released in making the liquid fuels than in burning the liquid fuels. Table 1 shows the relative amount of carbon dioxide released from the fuel production process versus carbon dioxide released in the consumption of the fuel. • Oxygen use: Some markets require both oxygen and hydrogen. Markets that require oxygen favor nuclear hydrogen production technologies that produce oxygen as a byproduct. • Heat use: Some process applications require hydrogen and heat. This encourages co-location of the hydrogen production plant with the application. • Existing market: If the hydrogen is used in an existing market, the technology and market are understood. For new hydrogen applications, there are technical and economic uncertainties. • User size: Large hydrogen users favor large-hydrogen production systems (all else being equal) to avoid hydrogen collection and storage systems from small hydrogen production systems. Small users may favor small production systems to avoid the cost of hydrogen distribution systems from central hydrogen production facilities. • Steady-state: Some applications are constant users of hydrogen, while others require variable delivery. • Storage and distribution: Different applications have very different needs for a supporting hydrogen storage and distribution system."
2,Transport markets,"About 40% of the US energy demand is met by oil that is converted primarily to liquid fuels. Today's transportation system depends upon liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet) because of their high energy density by weight and volume and their ease of use. The world is exhausting its resources (Fig. 1 ) of the light crude oils [6] used to make liquid fuels with consumption of oil exceeding discoveries of oil. The large-scale drilling into all the world's sedimentary basins (except Antarctica) where oil is found supports the perspective that it is unlikely that new major oil providences will be found. There are many alternative transport fuel futures. Almost all of the options require the large-scale use of hydrogen. These options have been defined into three broad categories based on how the hydrogen is used: liquid fuels, CO2-free liquid fuels, and direct hydrogen fuels."
3,Traditional liquid fuels,"3.1 Traditional liquid fuels Liquid fuels can be made from hydrogen and any source of carbon (crude oil, heavy crude oil, tar sands, oil shale, coal, etc.). Liquid fuels have been traditionally made from light crude oils, a process that does not require hydrogen. However, liquid fuels in the future will increasingly be produced from other feedstocks with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. Today liquid fuels are also made from heavy oils (many countries), tar sands (Canada), and coal (South Africa). In a refinery, these lower-grade feeds are converted to liquid fuels by adjusting the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the feedstock. Liquid fuels are typically hydrocarbons that have ratios of hydrogen to carbon atoms of 1.5–2. Heavier feedstocks have lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. Coal may have a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio as low as 0.6. The hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in various feedstocks is adjusted to produce liquid fuels by adding hydrogen or removing carbon. Hydrogen is traditionally made by steam reforming of fossil fuels where the fossil fuel plus water is converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere. The various methods for removing excess carbon (thermal cracking, etc.) from a heavy feedstock to produce liquid fuels ultimately release that carbon as carbon dioxide. With traditional fossil technologies, both adding hydrogen and removing carbon from the feedstock for liquid fuel production releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from the fuel production facility. The greenhouse impacts of using liquid fuels are dependent upon the feedstock. Fig. 2 shows the greenhouse gas releases per vehicle mile when using diesel fuel in an SUV [5]. Greenhouse gases are released during (1) fossil fuel extraction and production; (2) the conversion and refining into diesel fuel; (3) the transport and distribution of that fuel, and (4) use of the fuel. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is released. If diesel fuel is produced from light sweet crude oil, most of the greenhouse impacts are from burning the fuel in the vehicle. If the diesel fuel is made from coal, the greenhouse gas releases from the coal liquefaction process exceed greenhouse gas releases from burning the diesel fuel. In a business-as-usual future, greenhouse gas emissions per vehicle mile will increase as we exhaust light crude oil resources and use alternative feedstocks to make our liquid fuels. Alternatively, if economic hydrogen is available from non-greenhouse-emitting sources for liquid fuel production and the energy for the fuel processing does not release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions from liquid-fuel production per unit of liquid fuel for any feedstock can be the same or lower than that from light sweet (low sulfur) crude oil. Furthermore, if non-greenhouse-emitting hydrogen sources are available, the carbon in the carbon dioxide that would have been released to the atmosphere can be converted to liquid fuels. The liquid fuels yield per unit of crude oil, tar sands, oil shale, or coal is increased [7]. Liquid fuels production per unit of light crude oil can be increased by adding hydrogen. Gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels are characterized by their performance in engines. No fixed hydrogen-to-carbon ratio is associated with each fuel. Typical refineries that convert light crude oil to liquid fuels are hydrogen neutral, neither consuming nor producing hydrogen. However, if low-cost hydrogen were available or there were penalties for carbon dioxide releases to the environment, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of fuels could be increased toward a maximum hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of ∼ 2. In effect, the quantity (energy content) of liquid fuels produced per unit of crude oil or the equivalent transportation service provided per unit of crude oil is increased by 10% to 20% with corresponding decreases in greenhouse gas emissions. Many experts believe that conventional oil production will peak in this decade and then decrease. The shortfalls in production will initially be offset by conversion of heavy oils and tar sands into liquid fuels [8]. The amount of synthetic crude oil that can be produced from these low-grade deposits far exceeds those of all conventional oil deposits combined. Some perspective on the scale of operations can be obtained by examining the Alberta, Canada, tar sands developments [8]. Production is being raised from its current level of 1,000,000barrels/day of synthetic crude oil to 2.5 millionbarrels/day by 2010. Since1996, $23 billion has been invested to increase production. An additional $37 billion in new plants and expansions has been announced. Most of the new world-class hydrogen plants are being built to support these facilities. If these tar-sand deposits are fully developed and natural gas is used to produce the required heat and hydrogen, the natural gas requirements will be 2–3 times the total projected Canadian natural gas reserves. The hydrogen demand of heavy oil and tar sands facilities represents the primary factor in the current growth in demand for hydrogen [1]. The processing operations are similar to traditional refinery operations. If traditional technologies are used, greenhouse gas emissions per vehicle mile will increase relative to light crude oil. All of the demand is at a few very large facilities. This market is the largest near-term market for high-volume centralized hydrogen production technologies. Liquid fuels can also be produced from coal and many other feedstocks using other processes. In World War II, the Germans built large-scale facilities to convert coal to liquid fuels to replace imports of fuel. In 1955, South Africa started the first Sasol synthetic fuel plants that convert coal to liquid fuels using the German Fisher-Tropsch process. This complex was ultimately expanded to produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day. New coal liquefaction facilities are being built today in China. There are two classes of coal liquefaction processes [9]: direct and indirect. The direct processes hydrogenate coal directly to produce liquids. The best of these processes have an efficiency of about 65%, which implies that about a third of the energy in the coal (and effectively one-third of the coal) is used to overcome these unavoidable process inefficiencies. Depending upon the coal, some fraction of the remaining coal is used to make hydrogen; thus, perhaps half of the carbon in the original coal is a component of the final liquid fuel. The indirect processes convert carbon, oxygen, and water into synthesis gas—a mixture of hydrogen, CO, and CO2. The syngas is then converted to liquid fuels. All existing commercial plants use indirect processes: the output of indirect processes is insensitive to the feedstock, the capital costs per unit of production are lower, the processes are technologically easier, and the products contain higher fractions of high-value liquid fuels. Fisher–Tropsch is the most widely used indirect method for the production of liquid fuels. There are three major reactions in production of liquid fuels from carbon sources (coal, etc.) using the indirect Fischer–Tropsch liquefaction process [7]: Oxidation of carbon: (1) 2 C + O 2 → 2 CO . Water–gas-shift reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 . Fischer–Tropsch: (3) ( n / 2 + m ) H 2 + m CO → C m H n + m H 2 O . These processes are important because any chemically reduced carbon-containing feed (coal, garbage, natural gas, sewage sludge, biomass, etc.) can be converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The Fischer–Tropsch process is also being used on an increasing scale to convert natural gas into liquid fuels. There are also several other indirect processes. For example, New Zealand [10] converts the synthesis gas into methanol (CH3OH), which in turn is converted to liquid fuels. These processes can be considered black boxes, carbon, oxygen, and water go into the process and liquid fuels and carbon dioxide exit the process. The carbon is used (1) as a chemical feedstock to provide the carbon in the liquid fuel; (2) as a fuel to provide energy for the processes, and (3) as an energy source and chemical reducing agent to produce hydrogen. With heavier feedstocks such as coal (lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratio), a larger fraction of the feedstock is used to make hydrogen and heat with the byproduct production of carbon dioxide that is released to the atmosphere. If coal is the feedstock (Fig. 2), more carbon dioxide is released in the coal liquefaction process than in burning the liquid fuels. If outside sources of hydrogen become available, the hydrogen can replace the hydrogen produced within these processes and thus (1) increase liquid fuels production per unit feedstock and (2) reduce carbon dioxide releases from the fuel production facility. The liquid-fuels market strongly favors large-volume centralized production of hydrogen because refinery operations are very large scale operations. If all other factors are equal, nuclear hydrogen with its byproduct production of oxygen [7] will be favored for conversion of shale oil and coal to liquid fuels."
4,Carbon-dioxide-neutral liquid fuels,"3.2 Carbon-dioxide-neutral liquid fuels Traditional liquid fuels are made from fossil fuels. However, there are liquid fuel systems that do not require fossil fuel feedstocks and do not result in net emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Liquid fuels [11,12] can be made from water and carbon dioxide extracted from (1) the atmosphere or (2) the ocean. The hydrogen from water is used (1) as the hydrogen input to make the liquid hydrocarbon fuels and (2) as an internal energy source to drive the process of producing the fuel. The indirect liquid fuels processes described above can be used to convert the hydrogen and carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. Given unlimited hydrogen, this option provides unlimited liquid fuel. No greenhouse impacts occur because the carbon dioxide is recycled from the atmosphere or seawater. Most of these studies have assumed that the hydrogen is produced through electrolysis. Detailed studies [13] have examined alternative methods for recovery of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and ocean. At the time of the studies, the preferred atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-recovery method was the use of aqueous potassium carbonate (K2CO3) solution for absorption and stripping of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. About 80% of the total energy input required to produce the liquid fuel is used in the processes to produce hydrogen from water. If a high-temperature nuclear reactor is assumed to have 50% efficiency in the conversion of heat to electricity with hydrogen made by electrolysis, about 30% of the thermal energy produced by a nuclear reactor is converted into liquid fuels. This technology has several implications: • Liquid-fuel costs: This option provides unlimited liquid fuels with no greenhouse impacts as long as the hydrogen and electricity come from non-greenhouse energy sources. If there is a non-greenhouse source of energy, it caps the potential costs of liquid fuels because the raw materials (water and atmosphere) are available in unlimited quantities. • Hydrogen economy: From an economic perspective, this technology places an upper economic limit on the allowable costs for using hydrogen directly as a transport fuel compared with using liquid fuels. The production costs of liquid fuels using hydrogen and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are higher than the production of hydrogen. However, the costs of distributing and storing liquid fuels are much lower than the cost of distributing and storing gaseous hydrogen. Either approach can provide the fuel for the transport system without increasing atmospheric greenhouse concentrations. Economics will likely determine the preferred option. Economics would strongly favor large-scale hydrogen production systems. No oxygen is required in these processes. Biomass is used to produce liquid fuels such as alcohol by fermentation. This is potentially a non-greenhouse liquid-fuel source because the carbon dioxide used to make the biomass comes from the atmosphere. However, the quantities of liquid fuel that can be produced are limited by available biomass and the efficiency of converting that biomass into liquid fuels. For example, the conversion of corn to ethanol results in roughly a third of the carbon from the original corn in the ethanol, one-third in the by-product animal feed (a valuable byproduct), and one-third in the carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere from respiration of the yeast that converts the corn to ethanol. In all of the biomass systems, a significant fraction of the energy produced is required to grow, harvest, and process the biomass to produce liquid fuels [5]. The liquid fuel production (measured in the energy content of the liquid fuel per unit of biomass) can be increased by a factor of three or more by using the biomass and hydrogen to produce liquid fuels. There is the option of using biomass primarily as a non-greenhouse-generating carbon source to make liquid fuels rather than primarily as an energy source. There are multiple production options. • Alcohol: One variant of this option has been investigated by Bruce Energy Center of Ontario Hydro and Integrated Energy Development Corporation. The concept was to produce hydrogen through electrolysis of water using electricity from the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Tiverton, Ontario, Canada, and to collect carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant. The carbon dioxide would then be converted into liquid fuels and chemicals using existing technology [14]. This type of liquids fuel production is partly distributed because of the cost to collect and transport biomass to a central fuel plant location. • Hydrocarbon fuels: An alternative to producing alcohol from biomass (primarily cellulose—C6H10O5)—is to convert the biomass into a hydrocarbon fuel. Most biomass contains significant quantities of oxygen. It can be thought of as a partially oxidized hydrocarbon. The energy value per unit of carbon in a liquid fuel can be significantly increased by hydrogenation processes (directly or indirectly) that remove that oxygen while producing a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The size of biomass facility is limited by the cost of transporting biomass to a central processing facility. There are economics of scale in the production facilities but the larger the facility, the longer the transport distances for collecting the biomass. Thus, the facility sizes are intermediate in size and may or may not favor large-scale hydrogen production technologies. Hydrogen is proposed as the ultimate transport fuel for cars, trucks, and buses because of its non-polluting characteristics and because it enables the use of highly efficient fuel cells to convert chemical energy to electricity. There are several systems that deliver hydrogen to the vehicle engine but that do not require: (1) hydrogen distribution systems to the vehicle refueling station and (2) vehicle on-board hydrogen storage. These systems use some type of chemical hydrogen carrier. The production of that hydrogen carrier does require large quantities of hydrogen but the hydrogen is only used at centralized fuel production facilities—a non-oil version of a refinery. These hydrogen use options would thus have the same characteristics and requirements for hydrogen production as a liquid fuels plant. Two examples are provided. Ammonia (NH3) is a potential hydrogen carrier. Ammonia, the primary fertilizer in the world, is made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen from the atmosphere. Almost 12 million tons of hydrogen is consumed yearly in ammonia production [1]. It is transported by pipeline and truck as a liquid under pressure and could be used to fuel a vehicle. On-board the vehicle, the ammonia can be dissociated into hydrogen and nitrogen. However, there has been relatively little interest in this form of hydrogen storage because of (1) the requirements to store ammonia as a liquid under pressure and (2) the toxicity of ammonia. Recent work [15] has experimentally shown that ammonia can be stored reversibly in metal ammine complexes such Mg(NH3)6Cl2 and Ca(NH3)8Cl2. Hydrogen is 9.1wt% of the magnesium compound and 9.7wt% of the calcium compound—both compounds exceed the US Department of Energy 2015 hydrogen storage goals of 9.0wt% hydrogen in a hydrogen storage system. For the magnesium system, 4 of the 6 ammonia molecules are released during heating the compound from 350 to 500 ∘ C with the last two ammonia molecules released below 620 ∘ C . Hydrogen can also be reversibly stored as part of certain liquid chemical compounds. One example is the dehydrogenation of liquid methylcyclohexane with a catalyst aboard a vehicle to produce methyltoulene and three hydrogens. The methyltoulene is returned to the refinery where hydrogen is added to produce methylcyclohexane. In this system, the hydrogen is only about 6% of the weight of the methylcyclohexane; however, all the organics are liquids that simplify transport relative to sold reagents. Most hydrogen carrier systems favor high-volume centralized production of hydrogen. These systems generally do not require oxygen in the production process."
5,Hydrogen auto and truck transport systems,"3.3 Hydrogen auto and truck transport systems Hydrogen gas is proposed as the ultimate transport fuel for cars, trucks, and buses [2]. This can be considered the ultimate end state of hydrogen development if the various technical barriers are eliminated. In these scenarios, the hydrogen demand is highly distributed, varies with time, and requires a massive distribution system. The requirements for the production system may be significantly different than markets with centralized demand for hydrogen."
6,Aircraft,"3.4 Aircraft Aircraft fuel requirements are different than those associated with other forms of transportation because of volume, weight, and performance requirements. The technical constraints indicate that the fuel options are liquid hydrocarbon fuels or liquid hydrogen. The European Union [16] funded a consortium of 35 partners from the aviation sector, led by Airbus Deutschland, to conduct a systems analysis of hydrogen-fueled aircraft—the CRYOPLANE project. This consortium examined a wide range of aircraft from business jets to large long-range aircraft such as the new jumbo Airbus A380. The key issue was to model the liquid-hydrogen fuel system. Per unit energy, liquid hydrogen has four times the volume of jet fuel; therefore, the fuel tanks must be four times larger. Analysis showed that because of the larger external surface area of the aircraft needed to accommodate the fuel tanks and the resultant greater air resistance, the energy consumption would increase by 9% to 14%. This is in contrast to use of hydrogen in cars and trucks where the energy consumption is expected to be significantly less for hydrogen compared to traditional liquid fuels. Overall operating costs would increase by 4% to 5% based on fuel alone. It was also concluded that the engines would be equally efficient, the aircraft would have safety equivalent to that of current aircraft, and the environmental impacts would be substantially less (i.e., no carbon dioxide emissions). Further development is needed; however, such an aircraft system could be implemented within 15–20 years of a decision to use hydrogen as a fuel. If this hydrogen market develops, much of the market is suitable for large-scale centralized hydrogen production systems because most of the demand for aviation fuel is concentrated at a relatively few large airports."
7,Industrial markets,"There are thousands of industrial users of hydrogen. Most users use relatively small quantities. However, there are two industrial markets where the facility size matches the output of centralized high-volume hydrogen production systems."
8,Ammonia and other chemical applications,4.1 Ammonia and other chemical applications Ammonia production (fertilizer) consumes about half the hydrogen produced today and is the primary chemical industry use of hydrogen. Ammonia is currently made where there is inexpensive natural gas that provides inexpensive hydrogen and shipped to the customer. The low cost of shipping ammonia favors very large ammonia production plants with very large demands for hydrogen.
9,Direct reduction of iron ore,"4.2 Direct reduction of iron ore In the production processes for converting iron ores into iron and steel, carbon, primarily in the form of coke, has been traditionally used to reduce the iron oxides to iron metal. However, in the last several decades, there has been increasing production of iron using the direct reduction iron (DRI) process. In 1998, about 4% of the primary iron in the world was produced by the DRI process with rapid growth in iron production. In the DRI process, syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) made from natural gas is used to reduce iron ores to iron. The major chemical reactions are as follows: (4) Fe 3 O 4 + CO → 3 FeO + CO 2 , (5) Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 → 3 FeO + H 2 O , (6) FeO + CO → Fe + CO 2 , (7) FeO + H 2 → Fe + H 2 O . The DRI process has lower capital costs than alternative methods used to produce iron but requires a low-cost source of hydrogen. The primary market for DRI is to provide a purified iron feed for electric arc furnaces (EAFs) that produce various steel products. EAFs have lower capital costs than traditional steel mills and are environmentally cleaner operations than blast furnaces. Over a third of the world's steel production uses this process. It is predicted that by 2010 up to 45% of the world's steel may be made with EAFs. Historically, scrap metal has been the traditional feed for EAFs. However, there are two constraints: the availability of scrap metal and the various difficult-to-remove impurities (copper, nickel, chrome, molybdenum, etc.) that are present in the lower-grade scrap metal. Blending clean DRI-process iron with scrap metal dilutes the impurities below the level that affect product quality. (Traditional steel-making processes using coke result in iron with a high carbon content and various other impurities from the coke.) Iron production is potentially a significant existing market for hydrogen. If low-cost hydrogen were available, the DRI process would replace other methods of iron production. The economics of DRI relative to other processes (and the potential demand for hydrogen) depend upon three factors. • Technological developments: The continuing improvements in EAF technology in terms of reduced production costs and increased capabilities to produce higher-quality steel have expanded the market share of this technology. That, in turn, creates the demand for more high-purity iron by the DRI process as traditional sources of scrap metal are exhausted. • Environmental protection: Traditional steel processes use coal and generate large quantities of pollutants. Clean air requirements strongly affect the economics of these competing processes. • Hydrogen costs: The process is used where there is low-cost natural gas for hydrogen production near iron deposits. A variant of this option was studied in Japan between 1973 and 1980. The “Nuclear Steelmaking Project” conducted major engineering tests and designed a 500-MW(t) reactor. This project was the start of the Japanese high-temperature reactor program."
10,Intermediate and peak electricity production,"The demand for electricity varies daily, weekly, and seasonally. As a result, the market price of electricity varies by an order of magnitude as a function of time. To meet this demand, the utilities buy lower-capital-cost peaking power units, typically gas turbines that burn natural gas. In addition, utilities have developed storage devices so that they can buy electricity during times of low demand and low cost and sell the electricity during times of high demand and high prices. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates the Raccoon Mountain pumped-hydro storage facility. This facility pumps water up the mountain when low-cost power is available. During times of high power demand and high-priced electricity, the water direction is reversed to produce electricity. This facility has a rated capacity of 1530MW(e). The variability of the price of electricity creates the potential for a large hydrogen market aimed at producing electrical power at those times of day when the price of electricity is at its maximum. Ahydrogen intermediate and peak electrical system (HIPES) using nuclear hydrogen [17,?] has been proposed that consists of three components (Fig. 3 ): • Hydrogen production: A nuclear power plant with an associated hydrogen and oxygen (optional) production plant to produce hydrogen and oxygen at a constant rate to minimize the production costs. • Hydrogen storage: One or more underground facilities for the low-cost storage of hydrogen and oxygen (optional). Underground caverns, depleted oil and gas fields, and aquifers are the traditional approaches to the low-cost storage of natural gas to meet seasonally variable natural gas demand. About eight trillion cubic feet of natural gas can be stored in approximately 400 existing underground facilities in the United States (half of this quantity as a buffer gas to maintain high pipeline pressures). In countries such as Great Britain, salt caverns have been used for many decades for the low-cost storage of hydrogen. Underground storage is the only known low-cost technology for storing compressed gases; however, the storage economics demand very large facilities. This storage characteristic favors large-scale centralized hydrogen production. • Peak electric production: Large banks of fuel cells (or other systems) convert hydrogen to electricity during periods of high demand for electrical power and associated high prices for electricity. For every megawatt of steady-state hydrogen production, there would be several megawatts of fuel cells. While hydrogen is produced at a constant rate, the fuel-cell electrical production is highly variable—from zero to many times the rate of energy production from the reactor when the price of electricity is high. The economic feasibility of HIPES is based on: (1) the low-cost of large-scale bulk storage of hydrogen and (2) projected costs and efficiencies of fuel cells or other technologies to convert hydrogen to electricity. The goal of fuel cell developers is to reduce the capital cost for hydrogen fuel cells to < $ 100 / kW (e) with efficiencies of about 70%, compared with costs of $500/kWe for gas-turbine plants burning natural gas with efficiencies of about 50%. This use of fuel cells allows PENS to have a very large capacity to produce peak electrical power compared with the steady-state output of the reactor. The capital costs of fuel cells per kilowatt electric may be further reduced by the use of oxygen rather than air. However, the ultimate product, electricity, is sold at times of peak demand for premium prices. HIPES, as an electric energy storage system, has the unique capability to economically store very large quantities of energy as compressed hydrogen over periods of weeks or months to address weekly and seasonal variations in electric demand. This is not a viable option for other peak electric systems such as pumped hydro systems where the cost of energy storage over time becomes excessive. In the United States, the potential market exceeds 100GW(e) equivalent on a steady-state basis if the peak and much of the intermediate load are replaced by HIPES. There are several variants of this concept using various hydrogen production and electricity production technologies—all dependent upon the low-cost storage of hydrogen and oxygen on a large scale. There are strong economic incentives to produce and store hydrogen and oxygen because the combination allows for major reductions in the capital costs of the electricity production system. For fuel cells and several other hydrogen-to-electricity technologies, the equipment size shrinks and the efficiency increases with the use of oxygen rather than air. However, there are major technical challenges in large-scale oxygen storage. This hydrogen application favors nuclear hydrogen with its co-produced oxygen relative to steam reforming of fossil fuels for hydrogen production. HIPES, if successful, may be an enabling technology for a nuclear-H2 renewables economy. The fundamental problem for large-scale use of renewables is to match electricity production to electricity demand. Were there no electricity storage problem, wind or solar would become economic wherever their production cost is below the price of electricity, not the cost of electricity plus energy storage. HIPES may be an enabling technology to meet electricity demand when a significant fraction of the electricity is produced with renewables and the renewable electrical output does not match the consumer demand. The ability to economically store hydrogen for days, weeks, or months provides a bridging mechanism for the large variability of many renewable energy sources. Renewables can be used for hydrogen generation; however, recent system studies [19] indicate that current solar technologies are better suited for production of electricity directly for the electrical grid than hydrogen production."
11,Commercial markets,"If highly economic hydrogen production is achieved, hydrogen may be used to generate electricity, hot water, building heating, and building cooling. This is a distributed market with relatively small hydrogen consumption in individual facilities. This market does not favor large-scale hydrogen production techniques."
12,Conclusions,"The development of hydrogen production systems requires an understanding of the markets to provide: (1) technical requirements for the hydrogen production processes (purity, pressure, quantities, use of oxygen byproduct, etc.); (2) define and develop technologies to use the hydrogen, and (3) a basis for forming partnerships to commercialize the technology. Because the cost of delivered hydrogen depends upon the production, storage, and transport costs, some markets will prefer high-volume centralized production of hydrogen while other markets prefer small-scale decentralized production of hydrogen. There are two potentially major markets for hydrogen produced by large centralized hydrogen production systems: transportation and peak electricity production. In both of these markets, there is the potential for use any byproduct oxygen. There are several smaller markets that would require high-volume centralized hydrogen production facilities: ammonia production, iron production, and aircraft fuel."
