0,Introduction,"As a promising energy carrier, hydrogen has been widely studied for its application in fuel cells in decades. Hydrogen can be produced from alcohols, which can be obtained via fermentation of renewable resources, for example, the conventional resources of sugar and starch, and the alternative resources of cellulosic bio-mass as well [1]. There are three main routes to produce hydrogen from alcohols: steam reforming (SR), auto-thermal reforming (ATR), and partial oxidation (POX) [2–4]. The SR process can extract hydrogen from both ethanol and water, but a high heat input is required because SR is a strongly endothermic reaction. For POX, despite its self-sustaining for heat, the hydrogen yield is compromised and by-products cannot be ignored, especially at a lower temperature [2]. ATR, which consists of both endothermic steam reforming and exothermic oxidation processes, can be self-sustaining for heat without big loss in hydrogen yield [2–4]. Ni-based alumina-supported catalysts are active in ATR of ethanol, but the activity and stability need to be improved. As shown in our previous work [3], one concern is the reduction of nickel oxide: In these Ni-based alumina-supported catalysts, Ni existed mainly in a spinel phase of NiAl2O4, which is less reducible than NiO; Another concern is the oxidation and/or sintering of Ni metal in the Ni/Al2O3 during ATR test. This irreversible deactivation by oxidation and/or sintering can be attributed to the oxygen in ATR: Oxygen is consumed in the leading edge of the fixed-bed, and the local temperature may reach 1000 °C or above [5]. Thus, the leading edge of catalyst can be oxidized and sintered, and the frontline of reaction will be pushed downstream over time; eventually, all catalyst in the fixed-bed would be deactivated [3]. To address these concerns, additives, e.g., iron, cerium, zirconium, magnesium, etc., were introduced to improve the activity and the structural/electronic stability of these Ni-based catalysts [3,6]. Considering the above points, another candidate, manganese, which showed effectiveness in SR of ethanol [7,8], was introduced in this ATR process as an additive. The manganese-promoted catalysts were tested in ATR of ethanol for hydrogen production, and were characterized to find the relationship between structure and reactivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The catalysts were prepared by wet-incipient impregnation. The aqueous solution of nickel nitrate and manganese nitrate (Alfa Aesar, AR) was prepared firstly, and then impregnated onto a gamma-alumina (Alfa Aesar, AR). The impregnated samples were then dried at 110 °C for 16 h, and calcined at 650 °C in Air for 4 h. The samples with loadings of Mn2O3 (mass fraction) of 0, 5%, 10%, and 15% were represented as NAM00, NAM05, NAM10, and NAM15, respectively. The loading of NiO (mass fraction) is 15%, while Al2O3 is as the balance. Another Ni-free catalyst of AM15 with 15% Mn2O3 (mass fraction) over Al2O3 was prepared as well."
3,Catalytic performance test,"2.2 Catalytic performance test The ATR of ethanol was carried out in a quartz tubing fixed-bed reactor with a 4.0 mm inner diameter. Catalysts (100 mg, grain size of 20–40 mesh) were loaded and reduced with a H2/N2 mixture at 650 °C for 4 h firstly; the water-ethanol mixture was fed by a liquid pump and vaporized at 150 °C, then mixed with oxygen and nitrogen using a stainless steel tubing with heat cable, and introduced into the fixed-bed reactor at a molar ratio of C2H5OH: H2O: O2: N2 as 1: 3: 0.5: 1.5 (N2 as the internal standard gas). The effluent was analyzed online using a Shimadzu GC 2014 gas chromatography with Porapak Q, Molecular sieve 5A and Q-Plot columns via TCD and FID detectors. The conversion of the ethanol, the selectivity to carbon-containing products, and the H2 yield were defined as follows: (1) X ethanol = F ethanol in − F ethanol out F ethanol in (2) S i carbon-containing product = F i carbon-containing product n i . ( F ethanol in − F ethanol out ) (3) Y H 2 = F H 2 produced F ethanol in In the above equations, F i,in or out is the molar flow rate of the i species at the inlet or at the outlet of the reactor, and n i is the stoichiometric factor between the carbon-containing products and the ethanol. The mass balance of carbon and hydrogen typically has an error margin of ±3%."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured at −196 °C by nitrogen adsorption experiments on a Nova 1000e automatic adsorption instrument (QuantaChrome Instruments). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X’Pert Pro MPD) equipped with a graphite monochromator for Cu K alpha radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed over Ni-based catalysts (100 mg each) in a fixed-bed reactor with 5.0% H2/N2 at 10 °C/min, and the uptake of hydrogen was recorded by a thermal conduction detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by an Ultra DLD spectrometer (Kratos, UK) using Al K alpha radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energies were calibrated relative to the C1s peak from the carbon contamination at 284.6 eV."
5,Results and discussion,"The Ni-based catalysts were tested in ATR of ethanol, as shown in Fig. 1 . A poor performance was observed over NAM00: the conversion of ethanol started at 100%, but declined over time to 85.3% at 30-h; the H2 yield declined as well from 2.91 mol H2/mol ethanol at the beginning to 1.85 mol H2/mol ethanol at 30-h. The reason for such variation can be found in the transformation of ethanol in the ATR process. In the ATR process, ethanol can be transformed via two pathways: 1) either by being transformed to C2H4 through the dehydration of ethanol and then being further transformed to C2H6, 2) or by being transformed to CH3CHO via the dehydrogenation of ethanol [2,3]. CH3CHO can be further transformed to CH4, CO, and CO2 with water and oxygen via decomposition, reforming, water-gas shift reactions (WGSR), and partial oxidation (POX). Accordingly, the dehydrogenation pathway favors C1 products and also favors a higher H2 yield [2,3]. Over the NAM00 catalysts, the products of the ethanol dehydration pathway cannot be ignored: the selectivity to ethylene reached 5.1% and the selectivity to ethane hit 2.2%, respectively. On the other hand, for the ethanol dehydrogenation pathway, the intermediate product of CH3CHO emerged at the beginning and reached 7.8% over time. For C1 products, the selectivity to the carbon dioxide declined from 60.4% to 40.2% over time, and the selectivity to CO increased from 27.9% to 36.2%. The selectivity to methane around 7.7%–10.9% was found in the product gas. This variation in carbon-containing products explains the decrease of H2 yield over NAM00 in ATR. Over the NAM05 catalyst (not shown in Fig. 1), the conversion of ethanol reached 100% initially, but decreased to about 75.5% at 30-h, while the H2 yield emerged near 3.15 mol H2/mol ethanol, but decreased to 1.43 mol H2/mol ethanol in the end. A better performance was found over NAM10: the conversion of ethanol reached 100% and remained stable in the 30-h test, and a higher H2 yield near 3.1–3.2 mol H2/mol ethanol was observed as well. The ethanol dehydration route was constrained: neither ethylene nor ethane was found in the product gas. For the ethanol dehydrogenation route, acetaldehyde disappeared and was further converted to C1 products: the selectivity to CO2 remained stable around 59.3%–61.6%, the selectivity to CO was near 26.9%–28.9%, and the selectivity to methane varied within 10.2%–12.5%. With more manganese in the NAM15, the conversion of ethanol declined at 16-h and hit 91.3% in the end, and the H2 yield dropped to 1.95 mol H2/mol ethanol. The reason for this variation is that the intermediate product of acetaldehyde emerged at 16 h and reached 39.7% at 30-h, and the derived C1 products of CO2, CO and CH4 declined in the mean time. The appearance of acetaldehyde indicates that the activity for transforming acetaldehyde to C1 products was losing in NAM15 during ATR test. The reason can be attributed to the excess Mn that coated a portion of surface Ni species, which are active to transform acetaldehyde to C1 products [2], while the remaining surface Ni species may have been deactivated and lost the activity to transform acetaldehyde during the ATR test. As a result, the acetaldehyde remained in the gas, and the derived C1 products were decreased accordingly, as shown in Fig. 1(C). To find the reactivity of manganese in ATR of ethanol, AM15 was also tested. As shown in Fig. 1(D), a very poor activity in terms of both the conversion of ethanol and the H2 yield was found, and this result suggests that manganese can be used as an additive, instead of an active component. To find the structure-reactivity relationship, characterizations were conducted. The surface area (SA) of NAM00 was 158 m2/g. With loading of Mn, the SA deceased slightly to 156 m2/g over NAM05, to 147 m2/g over NAM10, and to 146 m2/g over NAM15. To further figure out the structure of NAM00 and NAM10, XRD patterns were recorded, as shown in Fig. 2 . For the calcined NAM00 in Fig. 2(A), there are peaks of spinel phase of Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 [9]. For comparison, AM15, which was prepared by impregnation of manganese on Al2O3, shows typical peaks of Mn2O3. Over the NAM10 with both Ni and Mn, besides the spinel peaks of Al2O3 and NiAl2O4, the peaks of ilmenite-type NiMnO3 [10], instead of Mn2O3 in AM15, were emerged at 36.6°, 33.7° and 24.6°. To confirm the formation of NiMnO3 and find the reducibility of catalysts, TPR was conducted over these catalysts. To find the reduction behavior, the unsupported samples of NiO (7 mg) and Mn2O3 (15 mg) were prepared by calcinations of nitrate salts at 650 °C for 4 h, and tested in TPR. As shown in Fig. 3 (1), the NiO can be reduced near 453 °C, while the Mn2O3 phase can be reduced from about 330 °C to the peak of 538 °C, as shown in Fig. 3(7). Only a peak emerges at about 785 °C over the NAM00 (Fig. 3(2)), which can be attributed to the reduction of NiAl2O4, according to [9,11]. Over the supported Mn2O3 over Al2O3 in AM15 (Fig. 3(6)), there are two different peaks emerging at 403 °C and 485 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Mn2O3 by two steps of Mn2O3→Mn3O4 → MnO, respectively, and the temperatures are lower than that of unsupported Mn2O3 [12]. With the introduction of Mn and with increasing content in NAM05, NAM10, and NAM15, there is another peak emerging near 335 °C and becomes stronger, which can be attributed to the reduction of NiMnO3. Meanwhile, the reduction peak of NiAl2O4 near 780 °C becomes weaker, indicating that there is less NiAl2O4. This variation in TPR could be attributed to reduction of more ilmenite-type NiMnO3 specieswith less NiAl2O4 species, and also suggests that the reducibility of Ni in these Mn-promoted catalysts has been improved, as compared with NAM00, and can be further confirmed. As shown in Fig. 2(B), the catalysts were reduced at 650 °C for 4 h and screened with XRD. For the reduced NAM00 without Mn, weak peaks of Ni0 are observed at 44.4°, 51.9°, and 76.4°. The spinel phase of NiAl2O4 still remained, and this result suggests that the NiAl2O4 cannot be completely reduced at 650 °C, and is consistent with the result of TPR. For the reduced AM15, the phase of Mn2O3 disappeared, and a phase of MnO emerged instead, which suggests that the Mn2O3 cannot be reduced to Mn0 at 650 °C [12]. The XRD pattern of NAM10 shows very weak peaks of Ni0, compared with that of NAM00. Considering the improved reducibility of the NAM10 indicated by TPR, there could be more Ni0 atoms in NAM10 via reduction of both NiMnO3 and NiAl2O4. One possible explanation for the weak Ni0 peak in XRD is that these Ni0 species may exist in amorphous state, but need to be further confirmed. To confirm the catalysts' reducibility and the Ni0 species, the XPS of Ni 2p3/2 were recorded over these reduced Ni-based catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4 . For NAM00 in Fig. 4(A), three peaks emerged at 851.6 eV, 855.8 eV, and 860.8 eV, which correspond to the characteristic peaks of Ni0, Ni2+, and the shakeup peak of Ni2+, respectively [13]. This result confirms that only a portion of nickel species was reduced to Ni0, as indicated by XRD and TPR. Based on a quantitative analysis of XPS, about 11.9% of nickel was reduced to Ni0 in NAM00. For the reduced NAM10 (Fig. 4(B)), the peak of Ni0 at 851.6 eV was intensified, which indicates that the reducibility of NAM10 did be improved, and about 30.3% of nickel existed as Ni0. This improvement in reducibility could be attributed to the phase of NiMnO3, and is also consistent with the result of TPR; meanwhile, the weakened peaks of Ni0 in XRD could be attributed to the amorphous Ni0 species. To find the effect of Mn on durability of the Ni-based catalysts in ATR tests, spent catalysts were screened with XRD, as shown in Fig. 2(C). The peak of Ni0 in NAM00 disappeared after a 30-h ATR reaction, and this suggests that the Ni0 species in NAM00 were not stable in the oxidative atmosphere of ATR. With Mn in NAM10, the weak peaks of Ni0 remained visible. To confirm the existence of Ni0 in the spent catalysts, XPS were also used to screen these spent catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4(C), the Ni0 peak disappears in NAM00, confirming the disappearance of XRD peaks of Ni0. The peaks of Ni0 remained in NAM10 (Fig. 4(D)), confirming the stability of Ni0 species in NAM10. As shown in Fig. 2(C) of XRD and Raman spectra (omitted here), there is only trace of carbon found over the spent NMA10 after a 30-h ATR test, which suggests that Mn can effectively relief the coke deposition. Based on the results of characterization, one can find that nickel existed in a spinel phase of NiAl2O4 in NAM00; about 11.9% of NiAl2O4 was reduced to Ni0 at 650 °C, while Ni0 is considered as the main active component in ATR [2]. Because the Ni0 spices in NAM00 were not stable in the oxidative atmosphere of ATR, these Ni0 species were oxidized over time, as indicated by the disappearance of Ni0 peaks in XRD and XPS. Consequently, the activity of NAM00 in ATR decreased gradually, and the hydrogen yield decreased from 2.91 mol H2/mol ethanol to 1.85 mol H2/mol ethanol in a 30-h test. With Mn in NAM10, an ilmenite-type phase of NiMnO3 was formed, as indicated by XRD. The reducibility of nickel in NAM10 was then increased, and more nickel (about 30.3%) was reduced to Ni0, as indicated by XPS and TPR. Therefore, the NAM10 showed a higher performance in terms of both ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield at the beginning of ATR test. Meanwhile, with promotion of Mn, the Ni0 species remained stable and was still visible in both XPS and XRD. As a result, the performance of NAM10 remained stable and a hydrogen yield of 3.1–3.2 mol H2/mol ethanol was observed during the 30-h ATR test at 600 °C."
6,Conclusions,"Nickel-based Al2O3-supported catalysts was prepared by wet-incipient impregnation and tested in ATR of ethanol. The NAM00 catalyst, in which Ni existed in a spinel phase of NiAl2O4, showed a poor durability and a low hydrogen yield near 1.85 mol H2/mol ethanol in a 30-h test. The reason can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni0 in the oxidative atmosphere of ATR. The NAM10 with Mn showed a better performance in ATR of ethanol: the conversion of ethanol reached 100% and a higher H2 yield remained stable near 3.1–3.2 mol H2/mol ethanol at 30-h. This improvement in reactivity can be attributed to the promotion effect of Mn: With manganese in NAM10, an ilmenite phase of NiMnO3 was formed, and the reducibility of NAM10 was improved, thus there were more Ni0 over the surface of catalysts, as indicated by TPR and XPS. Moreover, these Ni0 species were stable in the ATR, as suggested by XRD and XPS over the spent catalysts, and resulted in a stable performance in the 30-h ATR test."
