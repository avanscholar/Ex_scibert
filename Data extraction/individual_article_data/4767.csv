0,Introduction,"During electrodeposition of a number of metals from aqueous solution, parallel reaction can take place. Usually it is a reduction of hydroxonium or solvent molecules (water). Hydrogen evolution often accompanies the formation of loose metal deposits from aqueous solutions at current densities significantly exceeding limiting diffusion current. Such deposits are widely used for porous and composite materials [1] in the form of metal powders and for metallic foams [2–5]. In cases of metallic foams, hydrogen acts as a template. Under galvanostatic conditions hydrogen evolution occurs simultaneously with metal ions discharge. Evolving hydrogen significantly affects the growth and morphology of the dendritic deposits as noted in many papers [6–14]. The effect of hydrogen is usually associated with electrolyte convection by gas bubbles at the interface [8–10]. Such convection contributes to an increase in the concentration of discharged ions and a decrease in diffusion limitations. According to authors, focused on electrodeposition of metal foams [3–5,15–20], hydrogen bubbles formed during electrolysis screen part of the electrode, therefore, the metal is deposited on the surface, free of gas bubbles. As a result, the actual current density of the metal ions discharge is much higher than the current density calculated to a smooth surface. This affects the morphology of metal deposits [15]. It is noted [16–20], that the number and size of the deposit's pores depend on the intensity of formation and release of hydrogen bubbles, as well as on their break-off diameter. The effect of hydrogen on the loose deposits formation depends on hydrogen volume (i.e. the fraction of current required for its discharge). Most authors [7–10,21] use the average current efficiency of hydrogen or metal over the entire period of electrolysis as a parameter characterizing the intensity of hydrogen evolution. In [22] authors used the concept of the differential (instantaneous) current efficiency. It was shown that during electrodeposition of dendritic deposits, the current efficiencies of metal and hydrogen change. Redistribution of the rates of partial reactions (i.e. hydrogen evolution and metal deposition) leads to a change in the morphology and properties of the loose deposits during electrolysis [22]. Unlike smooth electrodes with a constant surface, hydrogen evolution during the formation of loose deposits is associated with a change in the surface area available for the discharge of hydrogen ions. The surface area on which the discharge of hydrogen ions occurs, changes during deposit growth. The reason of this change is exclusion of the surface in the depth of pores from the electrochemical process due to the voltage drop in electrolyte. In addition, hydrogen bubbles screen both individual pores and surface area. These effects lead to oscillations of potential, and, as a consequence, to a change in the porosity and structure of the deposit. Data on the real characteristics of the hydrogen evolution process such as its intensity, active area and changes of these parameters during the growth of the dendritic deposit are practically absent. At the same time, the study of the hydrogen evolution process during formation of the dendritic metal deposits is necessary for estimating its effect on the morphology and physical characteristics of the deposits. The aim of this work is to study the hydrogen evolution process during the formation of loose deposits of zinc, copper and nickel and to evaluate the effect of hydrogen on the properties of these deposits."
1,Experimental,"In this work, hydrogen evolution processes during electrodeposition of zinc, copper and nickel loose deposits were chosen. Electrodeposition was carried out under galvanostatic conditions. Compositions of electrolytes for the dendritic metal electrodeposition are presented in Table 1 . All solutions were prepared in the same way: using doubly distilled water and high grade chemicals. The chosen systems have significant differences in kinetic parameters of the compact metal electrodeposition [23], and hydrogen evolution parameters [13,14,24]. According to R. Winand classification [23], zinc refers to normal metals, that have high exchange current density, copper – to intermediate metals, and nickel – to inert metals with low exchange current density. Also, particle morphology of these dendritic deposits differs substantially [25]. Loose metal was deposited at a current I exceeding the limiting diffusion current I d on smooth electrode by 6-fold (K d = I / I d = 6 – depletion factor). All experiments were carried out at a temperature of 25 0С. To prevent the change of pH near the electrode surface during the dendritic metal deposition, solutions with high concentration of indifferent electrolytes were used. Dendritic nickel deposits were obtained from electrolyte containing 0.62 M ammonium chloride which provided high buffer capacity [1,26]. In addition, intensive stirring of electrolyte with evolving gas bubbles also contributed to maintenance of a constant pH. The working electrodes for loose zinc electrodeposition were made of zinc wire (99.9% Zn), and for copper and nickel deposition copper wire (99.9% Cu) with a diameter of 1.5 mm was used. The sizes of rod-type working electrodes and conditions of galvanostatic regime are presented in Table 2 . The inactive part of the working electrode was isolated with PTFE tape. Prior to measurements, the electrode's surface was polished with a small grain grit paper, cleaned with soda solution and thoroughly rinsed with distilled water. For the loose nickel electrodeposition, copper wire was preliminarily coated with 9 μm nickel layer from the Watts bath [27]. Plates of the corresponding metal were used as counter electrodes. A silver chloride electrode served as the reference electrode during nickel electrodeposition. During copper and zinc deposition, potentials were measured against non-polarized copper and zinc electrodes in working solutions, respectively. All potentials in the paper were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode reference scale. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using Solartron 1280C electrochemical station with IR compensation in electrolyte. Fig. 1 shows the cathodic polarization curves obtained on smooth electrodes in electrolytes for metal deposition. In case of copper and zinc, hydrogen began to evolve noticeably after the plateau of limiting current and had no effect on the value of limiting diffusion current. The cathodic polarization curve on nickel presents a total curve of nickel and hydrogen reduction. For determination of nickel limiting diffusion current, partial curve of nickel ions reduction was calculated. Nickel current at corresponding potential was determined as difference between the current on the total polarization curve (i tot(E)) and hydrogen evolution current in the supporting electrolyte (i H2(E)): i Ni(E) = i tot(E) – i H2(E).(1) The values of limiting current density of studied metals were determined by the plateau on experimental polarization curves. Despite similar concentration of discharging ions of studied metals, limiting diffusion currents differ. This could be associated with the different values of diffusion coefficient (diffusion coefficient is about 2.5 times higher for copper compared with zinc [22]), distinctions in electrolyte composition and viscosity. The latter leads to the difference in diffusion layer thickness. For hydrogen evolution studies on copper, zinc and nickel electrodes, polarization curves were obtained in corresponding supporting electrolytes (Table 1). c: 1 – total curve of nickel and hydrogen reduction, 2 – polarization curve of hydrogen in the supporting electrolyte, 3 – partial polarization curve of nickel reduction. The setup used for the loose metal electrodeposition allowed us to record deposit growth on video camera, perform electrochemical measurements and collect evolving hydrogen [22,28]. For hydrogen collection electrode was installed under the funnel connected with burette filled with electrolyte. Electrolyte volume through which gas bubbles went up was about 10 ml. According to different sources, hydrogen solubility in electrolyte [29–31] and in metallic nickel [29] is low, and was not considered in this work. The initial electrode length (H) and diameter (d 0) were measured before electrolysis. In the process of electrolysis, a change in the thickness of the electrode with the deposit was recorded, taking into account the zoom-in of the video camera. Then, the thickness of loose layer (y) was calculated. Taking into account changes in y, the overall deposit volume (V dep) was calculated at any instant of time (t): (2) V dep t = π d 0 + 2 y t 2 4 − π d 0 2 4 H The measured volume of the gas (V H2) was corrected to standard conditions (Т 0 = 273 K, Р 0 = 760 mmHg) considering water-vapour pressure, and current efficiencies of hydrogen (CeH2) and metal (CeMe) were calculated: (3) Ce H2 t = 2 V H2 t F / vIt , (4) Ce Me t = 1 – Ce H2 t , where F is the Faraday's constant, A s mol−1; v = 22,400 cm3 mol−1 is the molar volume of the gas under standard conditions. When determining the hydrogen current efficiency under conditions of loose nickel deposits formation, part of the gas spent on the nickel hydride formation was considered. Therefore, nickel current efficiency was determined by the mass of deposited metal, and hydrogen current efficiency in this case was calculated as CeH2(t) = 1 – CeMe(t). The volume of hydrogen evolved during nickel deposition was calculated from Eq. (3). Taking into account CeMe, the mass of the the copper and zinc deposits obtained during the time period of electrolysis (t) was calculated according to Faraday's law: (5) m dep t = A Me It zF Ce Me t , where A Me is the atomic mass of metal, g mol−1; z is the number of electrons. The differential current efficiency of hydrogen (CeH2 d) during electrolysis was determined by the change in the volume of gas (ΔV H2), evolved during a short time interval Δt: (6) Ce H 2 d = 2 · ∆ V H 2 t F / ϑI ∙ ∆ t For characterization of the change in the deposit properties along the thickness of the loose layer, differential porosity (βd dep) was used. It was calculated by change in the deposit mass (Δm dep) and volume (ΔV dep) for a short time interval: (7) β dep d = 1 − Δ m dep Δ V dep ∙ ρ Zn , where ρZn is the density of compact zinc, g cm−3. Microstructural studies of the deposits were carried out using a Mira 3 LMU scanning electron microscope at the Collective Use Center of the IHTE of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. After electrolysis, the deposits were rinsed with distilled water and ethyl alcohol, then separated from the electrode and dried."
2,Results and discussion,"The experimental data on the change in layer thickness (y) of dendritic deposits of zinc, copper, and nickel in time are presented in Fig. 2a. The y–t dependencies for all the studied metals can be approximated using an empirical Eq. [22]: (8) y t = y 0 1 − exp − t τ 0 . Coefficients y 0 and τ0 were determined by minimizing the sum of squared deviations Ф [22,32] of the experimental data from those calculated by the empirical Eq. (8): (9) Ф min y 0 , τ 0 = ∑ i y i − y ^ i 2 → min . Here y i is the experimental value of the deposit layer thickness at a point of time t i , y ^ i is the deposit thickness calculated using Eq. (8) at the same time, i = 1…n is the order number of measurement y. Calculations were made with the use of standard procedures of minimizing functions available in the Microsoft Office Excel. Coefficients values are given in Table 3 . The growth rate of loose deposit (Fig. 2b) was calculated using the equation obtained via differentiation of Eq. (8): (10) dy dt = y 0 τ 0 exp − t τ 0 . The ratio of empirical coefficients y 0/τ0 describes deposit growth rate at initial period of time [22]. During the copper and zinc electrodeposition (Fig. 2b) the growth rate of the loose deposit is maximum at the initial period of electrolysis, and then it decreases in time. After a while, the active elongation of the dendrites ceases. The inhibition of the active growth of copper and zinc dendrites in time coincides with a decrease in the absolute value of the potential and the termination of its oscillations (Fig. 3 ). The growth rate of the dendritic nickel deposit at the same level of diffusion limitations (K d = 6) is significantly lower than that of zinc and copper deposits (Fig. 2b), and changes slightly in time. Oscillations of the potential (Fig. 3) are caused by the screening effect of hydrogen bubbles, which block part of the electrode surface. A decrease in the surface area available for electrochemical processes leads to an increase in the current density and a negative potential shift. When bubbles detach from the electrode, the surface increases and a positive potential shift occurs. Potential oscillations on chronopotentiograms (Fig. 3) are caused by the periodic release of hydrogen bubbles which screen the surface. In the initial period, a significant decrease in the potential's absolute value is observed. At the same time a large number of small hydrogen bubbles are released. These bubbles intensively mix the near-electrode layer [33]. Further, according to the chronopotentiograms of the zinc and copper electrodeposition, a slow decrease in the cathode potential is observed. This decrease leads to an increase in the size of hydrogen bubbles and the amplitude of the potential oscillations. At the end of the chronopotentiometric measurements, potential shifts (Fig. 3, curves 1 and 2) to the plateau of limiting current up to the values at which rate of hydrogen evolution becomes negligible and oscillations cease. The chronopotentiogram of nickel electrodeposition is characterized by a monotonous change in the potential with a constant frequency and amplitude of oscillations (Fig. 3, curve 3). The amplitude of the potential oscillations during nickel electrodeposition is significantly lower, than during copper and zinc deposition. In works [34–38] on modeling the electrodeposition process of the loose metal deposits, the potential measured during electrolysis is usually considered, assuming that the reduction of metal ions proceeds under the mixed activation–diffusion control. If the metal electrodeposition at current exceeding the limiting diffusion current is accompanied by hydrogen evolution, the potential at high currents will be determined by the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. During electrolysis, the surface of the loose deposit increases. This leads to a decrease in the hydrogen current density and a decrease in the hydrogen overvoltage (i.e. to a positive potential shift). A change in the electrode potential, for its part, encourages the reduction of the diffusion limitations and the redistribution of current between the discharge of metal ions and hydrogen evolution. In prolonged zinc and copper electrodeposition after the cessation of visible hydrogen evolution, the branches of dendrites on the deposit growth front become thicker, and nearby branches coalesce to compact metal «shell» [22]. When setting current exceeding the limiting diffusion current of metal reduction, the concentration of metal ions inside the loose deposit is close to zero, therefore, the discharge of hydrogen ions occurs in the supporting electrolyte. Using the potentials measured during the growth of dendritic metal deposits (Fig. 3), the values of hydrogen overvoltage in the corresponding supporting electrolytes were calculated (Fig. 4 ): (11) η H2 = E – E eq , H2 . The value of the hydrogen equilibrium potential (E eq,H2) was calculated according to the Nernst equation considering the activity of hydrogen ions in the supporting electrolytes (Table 4 ). Fig. 4 shows correlation between overvoltage values relative to the equilibrium potentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the corresponding supporting electrolytes and chronopotentiograms of the studied metals (Fig. 3). It should be noted that this correlation is not a parallel transfer of all the curves by a constant value, but a shift in the curves on values corresponding to the equilibrium potentials of the hydrogen electrode in each studied solution. Therefore, the potential of metal electrodeposition is determined by the hydrogen evolution reaction. Given this, it is possible to calculate the deposit surface area on which hydrogen evolution occurs. In order to make these calculations, one needs to know the Tafel slopes and the fraction of current necessary for hydrogen ions discharge. In the reference literature, the parameters of the Tafel equation for various metals in acidic or alkaline solutions can be found [39]. These data are estimated values that cannot be used to describe the hydrogen evolution kinetics in electrolytes of various compositions. In addition, the parameter values depend on the nature of the metal and on the state of its surface. For determination of the kinetic parameters of hydrogen reduction, cathodic polarization curves on smooth electrodes were obtained in supporting electrolytes (Fig. 5 ). The curves were obtained on the same electrodes on which loose metals were deposited. The background electrolyte was used because deposition of loose dendritic metal occurs at currents far exceeding the limiting diffusion current on the plane surface. Under these conditions, metal deposition occurs only at the tips of dendrites by the mechanism of spherical diffusion [40,41]. Therefore, the concentration of the discharging ions in the depth of the loose deposit is close to zero. Hydrogen is mainly evolved in the depth of loose deposit, where solution composition corresponds to the background electrolyte. When determining hydrogen discharge parameters, sections on the polarization curves that corresponded to potential range of the loose deposits formation were considered (Fig. 3). The dependency of the overvoltage on the current density during hydrogen reduction (η < 0) can be described by the Tafel Eq. [24], presented in the following form: (12) – η H2 = − E – E eq , H2 = a + b ln i H2 . (13) where a = − b · ln i 0 H 2 . The experimental curves are linear dependencies in semilogarithmic coordinates, so it is possible to determine the a and b kinetic parameters (Table 4). The obtained values describe the kinetics of hydrogen evolution in the region of loose metal deposition potentials. Parameter b in Tafel equation depends on hydrogen evolution mechanism, and its value changes in rather low range, but a parameter depends significantly on the nature of metal, the solution composition and the surface state [42]. The values of hydrogen exchange currents calculated from Eq. (13) (Table 4) correspond to conditions of loose metal deposition, i.e. to the region of high overvoltage and background electrolytes with different composition. For the hydrogen evolution on copper in 1 M H2SO4, the values of the hydrogen exchange current density (Table 4) correspond up to an order to the data of C. C. Vaduva et al. i 0 = 4.38∙10−8 A сm−2 [43]. In case of hydrogen evolution on zinc and nickel, our data (Table 4) are comparable with the literature data for solutions with similar composition: hydrogen exchange current density on nickel was i0 = 2.51∙10−7 A сm−2 in 0.001 M HCl (pH = 3) [44], and on zinc hydrogen exchange current density was 8.36∙10−6A сm−2 in 8 M KOH [13]. Еxchange current densities obtained under studied conditions do not pretend to the values for pure metals, despite these values can be used for the systems under study. The maximum absolute value of overvoltage, which is measured in the moment of turning on, is determined by the specified value of current and kinetic parameters of hydrogen evolution. In this work, the limiting diffusion current densities for zinc, nickel and copper had the following values: 160 A m−2, 240 A m−2 and 360 A m−2, respectively. The surface areas of the electrodes were close, therefore, at K d = 6, the specified current for copper was much higher than that for zinc and nickel (Table 2). Thus, despite the highest current, the absolute value of the hydrogen overvoltage on copper was minimal. This confirms the above mentioned suggestion that the kinetic parameters of hydrogen evolution at the same values of the depletion factor (K d) have a significant effect on the potential of the loose metal electrodeposition. The change in the intensity of the hydrogen evolution process during electrolysis can be quantitatively evaluated by the value of the differential current efficiency (CeH2 d) of hydrogen (Fig. 6 ). During the deposition of copper and zinc loose deposits, a decrease in the differential current efficiency of hydrogen was observed. After a decrease in overvoltage (Fig. 4), the differential current efficiency of hydrogen tends to zero (Fig. 6). A synergistic effect takes place. This effect is caused by two interrelated processes. Firstly, an increase in the electrode surface with loose deposit leads to a decrease in the hydrogen evolution current and an increase in the metal electrodeposition current. An increase in the discharge current of metal ions, for its part, encourages a further increase in the surface and a decrease in the overvoltage of hydrogen evolution. In case of electrodeposition of nickel, the current efficiency of hydrogen remains almost constant. It should be noted that when setting a current 6 times exceeding the limiting diffusion current of the discharge of copper and zinc ions on the initial surface, the hydrogen current efficiency on these metals does not exceed 9–12% in the first 15 min of electrolysis. The reason of such a sharp drop in current efficiency is associated with the above-described synergistic effect. The surface growth is caused by the discharge of metal ions mainly on the tips of irregularities, and then, on the tips of the dendrite branches at the deposit growth front under spherical diffusion conditions [1,22]. (14) i Me = i sph = zFDC 0 / r . Here i Me is the current density of metal ions discharge on the tips of dendrites, i sph is the limiting current density of spherical diffusion, r is the radius of the tips of dendrites. Due to the small radius of the tip of the dendrite branches (r < 1 μm), the value of limiting spherical current density is several orders of magnitude higher than the limiting current density on a flat surface. Because of this, the discharge current of metal ions is large, despite the small surface area of the tips on which metal discharge occurs: (15) I Me = i Me ∙ N ∙ S tip , where I Me is the current of metal ions discharge, N is the number of the dendrite branches tips at the deposit growth front, S tip is the surface area of the dendrite branches with radius r. The rate of the loose metal deposit growth can be represented in accordance with the Faraday's law by the differential equation: (16) dy dt = V Me zF i Me , where V Me is the metal molar volume. Fig. 7 shows microphotographs of zinc, copper and nickel deposits obtained under comparable conditions. Electrodeposits of all metals were obtained at currents exceeding the limiting current on a smooth surface by 6 times. Such current indicates an excess rate of the side process, which is the evolution of hydrogen, over the discharge current of metal ions on a smooth electrode. Electrolysis time was 10 min. Dendritic particles of the studied metals differ in shape (Fig. 7): flat zinc dendrites, three-dimensional dendrites with pyramidal tips of copper, nickel dendrites with tips in the form of spherulites. The form of the dendrites is determined by the nature of metal [23] and depends on the electrolyte composition [9,10,12,21,45–47]. The radius of the dendrite tips at constant K d increases in a row: copper, zinc, nickel. Therefore, current density on the tips (Eq. 14) and growth rate of loose deposits (Eq. 16) decrease (Fig. 2b) in a row: copper, zinc, nickel. As the deposit grows, depending on the nature of the metal and the morphology of dendritic particles (Fig. 7), the total increase in the deposit area occurs, and the surface area available for the hydrogen discharge changes diversely. The calculations showed that during electrodeposition of loose metal, the current density and the effective area for the hydrogen ions reduction change. On the basis of experimental curves of changes in the hydrogen overvoltage during electrolysis (Fig. 4) and taking into account the kinetic parameters of hydrogen reduction (Table 4), the current density i H2 was calculated using formula (17): (17) i H 2 = exp − E − E eq , H 2 + a b , A cm − 2 The current density of the hydrogen ions discharge (Fig. 8 ) is maximum in the first minutes of electrolysis and then it decreases due to the development of the loose deposit surface. Hydrogen bubbles block part of the electrode surface. A decrease in the surface area, available for electrode processes, leads to an increase of hydrogen current density and to the potential shift to negative area. When bubbles detach, surface area increases, and potential shifts to positive area. By the end of visible hydrogen evolution during the deposition of copper and zinc dendritic deposits, i H2 was 2.2 ∙ 10−6 and 0.0017 A cm−2, respectively. During the deposition of nickel dendritic deposits, when the intensity of hydrogen evolution changes slightly, the current density of the discharge of hydrogen ions reaches a constant value of 0.016 A cm−2 after 50 min. The values of the hydrogen evolution current density obtained by Eq. (17) allowed calculating via numerical integration the amount of gas released on a unit of surface for the time t from the start of electrolysis: (18) v H 2 t = v 2 F ∫ 0 t i H 2 d τ . Calculated values v H2 (t) and experimental data on the volume of hydrogen evolved during electrolysis change simultaneously (Fig. 9 ). This indicates the possibility of determining the loose deposit surface area where hydrogen evolution occurs from the experimental data. Differentiation of the experimental (V H2 − t) and calculated (v H2 − t) dependencies, shown in Fig. 9, allowed determining the effective area of hydrogen evolution: (19) S H 2 t = Δ V H 2 / Δ t Δ v H 2 / Δ t , where ΔV H2 is the hydrogen volume measured during time interval Δt, Δ(v H2 ) is the change of v H2 (t) values, calculated by current density (Eq. 18), Δt is the time interval during which current density is considered constant. Fig. 10 shows that changes in the effective surface of hydrogen evolution on different metals differs. During the electrodeposition of loose copper deposit, it rapidly increases. The shape of the S H2 –t curve on zinc is similar to that on copper deposit, but the numerical values of the surface area are much smaller. At the end of the growth of copper and zinc deposits, when low volumes of hydrogen are released, surface calculation fails to be performed. During the electrodeposition of loose nickel deposit, the current density of hydrogen evolution remains quite high, and hydrogen current efficiency is constant over the electrolysis. The rate of the dendritic nickel deposit elongation is low, therefore, the development of the deposit occurs gradually, and S H2 monotonically increases during electrolysis (Fig. 10). The reason is the morphology of nickel dendrites (Fig. 7c), which form denser aggregations compared to copper and zinc dendrites. A comparison was made between the surface area on which hydrogen (S H2) is released and the total surface of the dendritic deposit (S dep) of zinc and copper, determined via impedance spectroscopy [48]. After 5 min of electrolysis, the surface area of loose zinc and copper deposits were 172 cm2 and 323 cm2, respectively, which are several orders of magnitude higher than the calculated effective area of the hydrogen ions discharge. The obtained results indicate that hydrogen ions discharge occurs not on the entire surface of the dendritic deposit, but only on a part of it. Apparently, the released gas bubbles lead to a statistically high value of surface screening and make a substantial part of the loose deposit area inactive to electrochemical processes. The proportion of the screened surface depends on the intensity of hydrogen evolution. As the deposit grows and the intensity of hydrogen evolution decreases, the degree of the surface screening decreases and the surface area, on which the discharge of hydrogen ions is possible, increases. Theoretically, the whole surface becomes accessible for the discharge of hydrogen ions, but due to the decrease in overvoltage, no visible hydrogen evolution is observed on copper and zinc. As shown above, during the formation of the loose metal deposits, the amount of evolved hydrogen changes, but the morphology of dendrites forming the deposit remains constant for a certain metal. However, during the growth, physical properties of the dendritic deposit, such as density and porosity, change. These parameters are interrelated, but it is the porosity that substantially depends on the intensity of hydrogen evolution and leads to a decrease in density. Fig. 11 shows the calculated curves of the change in porosity along the thickness of the layer of dendritic of copper, zinc, and nickel deposits. The porosity of loose zinc and copper deposits is high, reaching 98%, during the period of active deposit growth and intensive hydrogen evolution, as evidenced by the data presented in Fig. 11. When the intense elongation of the dendritic copper and zinc deposits stops and the visible evolution of hydrogen bubbles ceases, the porosity decreases due to the coalescence of branches and the formation of spherulites of a compact metal on the surface of the deposit growth front. An analysis of the changes in the differential porosity of the deposits (Fig. 12 ) revealed a decrease in the dendritic deposits porosity of all the studied metals with a decrease in the hydrogen evolution rate during the electrolysis. At the same value of hydrogen evolution current density, the porosity of loose nickel deposits is significantly lower than that of copper and zinc. As already noted, this occurs due to the features of metal crystallization and the morphology of dendritic particles forming the dendritic deposit. The specific features of hydrogen evolution on nickel allow obtaining deposits that are close in properties to the foams (Fig. 13 ). The reason for the deposition of metal in the form of a loose deposit is the presence of high diffusion restrictions on the substance delivery to the electrode [1,40,41]. Therefore, in the powder production, loose dendritic metal electrodeposition is carried out at currents higher than the limiting diffusion current. At the same time, loose metal deposition for a number of metals such as copper, nickel, zinc is accompanied by hydrogen evolution. The intensity of hydrogen evolution, the size of hydrogen bubbles, and the duration of their residence on the electrode surface determine the degree of screening of the surface, and, thereby, affect the porosity of loose deposits. These parameters depend on the composition of the solution and the potential of the electrode, on which, in turn, the surface tension at the metal / solution interface depends. Our results showed for the first time that for all metals, the deposition of loose deposit of which is accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen, the potential in the electrolysis process, which determines the formation of the deposit, is determined by the parameters of hydrogen evolution on this metal. Summarizing the data obtained on the hydrogen evolution during the formation of loose deposits of the three studied metals, it can be noted that the morphology of dendritic particles and the growth rate of the deposit are determined by the nature of metal. Furthermore, the properties of the loose deposit (changes in porosity along the thickness of the deposit) depend on the intensity of hydrogen evolution during electrolysis."
3,Conclusions,"1. During the formation of loose zinc, copper and nickel deposits, the electrode potential is determined by the kinetic parameters of hydrogen evolution on the deposited metal. 2. Based on the kinetic parameters of hydrogen evolution, the dynamics of the change in the surface area available for the discharge of hydrogen ions during the deposition of dendritic zinc, copper and nickel deposits was determined. 3. A synergistic effect during the electrodeposition of loose copper and zinc deposits was discovered. It benefits the rapid decrease in the current density of discharge of hydrogen ions and explains the high current efficiency of copper and zinc under high diffusion limitations. 4. The morphology of copper, zinc and nickel dendrites depends on the crystallization features of these metals, and the porosity changes during electrolysis and is determined by the rate of hydrogen evolution."
