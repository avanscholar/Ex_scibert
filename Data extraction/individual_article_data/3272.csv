0,Introduction,"Incorporation of inorganic nano-fillers into the polymer system results in the production of new composite materials with enhanced properties and better performance than its constituents. Polymer–inorganic nanocomposites can be used in various applications such as optical, medical, and electrical [1]. Chitosan is one of the significant natural resource with many advantages, including low cost, biodegradable, biocompatible, environmentally safe, and easy of modification [2]. It can be used in many applications like water treatment, medical products, membrane formation, and agriculture [3]. In addition, it has a very large number of NH2 and OH groups, that makes it very interactive with other materials [4,5]. Nonetheless, there are some difficulties associated with using pure chitosan films due to its limited mechanical stability [6]. Therefore, mixing chitosan with other polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) contributes to receiving homogeneous composites acquired better properties than its components. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), is a semicrystalline polymer has numerous attractive characteristics such as high chemical stability, good biocompatibility, mechanical strength, hydrophilicity, non toxicity, biodegradability, and excellent film formation capabilities. It has reactive OH groups, which makes it easily to interact with other polymers and allowed it to form polymer blends and composites. It can be used in packaging, electrical insulators, biomedical industries, and many other applications [7,8]. Blending of two polymers like PVA and chitosan offers a new material that is used in various applications like antibacterial activity, dye removal, electronic devices, and pharmaceutical applications. Owing to the presence of OH groups in PVA resulted in hydrogen bond formation with the OH and amine groups in chitosan [6]. What's more is the incorporation of inorganic fillers into this polymer matrix may enhance the characteristic properties of polymer blend. Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) are one of the most important transition metal oxides that have many properties when reacting with polar surface materials and used in many applications because of their high thermal and chemical stability, environmental benignity, antibacterial activity, and industrial application [9]. While many works synthesized NiO, only a few reports studied the dye removal and antibacterial properties of NiO based films [10–12]. The adsorption properties of the prepared films were studied using the methyl orange (MO) as a target pollutant. In particularly, MO is non-biodegradable, deteriorates the photosynthetic process of aquatic organisms through reducing light transmittance, and has a toxic and carcinogenic effect. It was reported that the exposure to MO will cause many health problems for humans, including heart rate increase, vomiting, and tissue necrosis [13]. Accordingly, the removal of this coloring pollutant taken a good interest from researchers. Pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, are organisms that cause severe infectious diseases for humans, thus there is a critical need to develop efficient agents to fight these infectious pathogens. Herein we will focus on antibacterial agents. Bacteria can be classified according to staining to Gram+ (cell wall ~20–50 nm) and Gram− (cell wall <20 nm), and depending on the presences of oxygen to aerobic and anaerobic, and based on the morphology to Cocci, Basilli, and Spiralla. Specifically, eating contaminated food with bacteria like Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhi causes severe health problems [14,15]. There is no work until now synthesized nanocomposite film consists of NiO NPs and chitosan and PVA for studying the antibacterial and dye adsorption properties as will be presented here. Various amounts of NiO NPs (0.5, 1.5, 3, 5 wt%) were impeded in polymer blend of chitosan/PVA using easy casting method. The effect of the incorporation of NiO NPs into the chitosan/PVA matrix was studied using XRD, FESEM, ATR-FTIR, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and dielectric measurements. The dye adsorption performance of the modified films was evaluated relative to the unmodified one. Additionally, four bacteria strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and, Salmonella Typhimurium were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposite films."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Extra pure PVA (Alpha Chemika, India) with molecular weight 115,000 [>94%]. High molecular weight chitosan (Alamia company for chemicals) with molecular weight ranges from 140,000 to 220,000 and 81.2% degree of deacetylation. NiO nanoparticles (Sigma Aldrich) with purity 99.8%. Methyl orange (MO, 98%) was purchased from the S D Fine-Chem Limited. The chemicals are used without further purification."
3,Preparation of chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposite films,"2.2 Preparation of chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposite films Desired amount of chitosan was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water and acetic acid under vigorous stirring at 70 °C until complete solubility to form solution A. PVA powder was dissolved in distilled water at 70 °C until homogenous solution B was obtained. Add solution A to solution B (50/50 wt/wt%) under vigorous stirring to get a homogenous solution of chitosan/PVA. After that NiO NPs with weight percentages of 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 5 wt% were added to the PVA/chitosan solution under sonication and then was casted in a petri dish for drying at 40 °C for 24 h to get nanocomposite films. Pure chitosan/PVA film was prepared for comparison following the same steps without the addition of NiO nanoparticles."
4,Method of characterizations,"2.3 Method of characterizations XRD measurements were performed using PANalyticalX'Pert Pro that operate at 45 KV using target Cu-Kα with secondary monochromator Holland radiation at λ = 0.1540 nm. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) JEM-2100F (Jeol) was used to estimate the shape and size of NiO by dropping NiO ethanol solution on a carbon-coated copper grid. The surface morphology of the films was studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 250 FEG). Two pieces of each film were cut with a knife then a gold layer was sputtered; one put horizontally for top view and the other put vertically for the cross section view. ATR-FTIR measurements were performed using Bruker VERTEX 80 (Germany) combined Platinum Diamond ATR, comprises a diamond disk as that of an internal reflector in the range 4000–400 cm−1 with resolution 4 cm−1 and an accumulation of 50 scan. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were analyzed using Jasco V-630 UV-VIS (Japan) spectrophotometer. AC conductivity was performed by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) type (concept 40) novocontrol high-resolution alpha analyzer supported by Quatro temperature controllers."
5,Antibacterial activity studies,"2.4 Antibacterial activity studies Antibacterial properties of the synthesized NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films (0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 wt% NiO) in comparison to the unmodified chitosan/PVA were examined by agar well diffusion method. The wells (8 mm diameter) were cut using a sterile cork borer on Muller Hinton agar (MHA, India). 24 h young culture of four bacteria strains including, two Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus 6538 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli 8739 and Salmonella Typhimurium 14028) were swabbed with a sterilized cotton swab on the surface of the prepared Muller Hinton agar. Owing to the very low diffusion of the active compound in agar media the synthesized NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films were dissolved in DMSO. After that 100 μl of these solutions were loaded into each well and left for 2 h at 4 °C until the compounds were diffused [16,17]. Then the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Finally, the diameter of the zone of inhibitions was measured in millimeters to estimate the antibacterial activity of various samples against the chosen bacterial strains."
6,Dye adsorption studies,"2.5 Dye adsorption studies Methyl orange (MO) dye was chosen as an urgent contaminant to study the adsorption properties of the prepared chitosan/PVA and NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films. The prepared samples were immersed into 5 mg/L MO solution and about 3 mL of the dye solution was collected each 30 min. The decrease in dye concentration was estimated by monitoring the change in the MO characteristic peak at 464 nm using Shimadzu 2401 UV–Vis spectrometer. The effect of the NiO amount (1.5, 3, and 5 wt%), contact time up to 150 min, and adsorbent dose (40, 80, and 100 mg) on the decolorization of MO was presented."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization studies,"3.1 Characterization studies Powdered NiO nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and HRTEM. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1(a), indicated that NiO nanoparticles are spherical. From this micrograph, the particle size histogram was drawn as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is clear that the size of the particles in the range from 4 to 14 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, Fig. 1(c), shows that the nanoparticles have highly crystalline structure. The XRD pattern of NiO presented in Fig. 2 . It has diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.1°, 43.2° and 62.7° [18,19]. The average crystal size (S) of NiO nanoparticles was estimated by using Scherrer formula [20]: (1) S = 0.9 λ βcosθ where λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle. The average crystal size of NiO NPs was found to be ~6 nm. It is noticed that the calculated crystalline size from the XRD data is in agreement with the particle size obtained from HRTEM. The XRD patterns of various NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films in comparison with that of pure chitosan, PVA, chitosan/PVA films illustrated in Fig. 2. Pure chitosan film shows a very broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.3°, which revealed the amorphous nature of chitosan [21,22]. Pure PVA film has characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.7°, 22.9° and 40.5° [23,24], which indicated the semicrystalline nature of PVA. The XRD pattern of chitosan/PVA film shows only one diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.5°, whereas the other diffraction peaks of both PVA and chitosan are disappeared. This can indicate the compatibility and miscibility between the two materials, which may be attributed to the interaction between NH2 group in chitosan and OH group in PVA as will be confirmed from the FTIR analysis. For the XRD patterns of chitosan/PVA sensitized with different weight percentage of NiO NPs, there is a shift toward higher theta degree with increasing weight percentage of NiO NPs and its broadening is decreased compared to pure chitosan/PVA film. In addition, increasing NiO NPs percent in polymer matrix up to 5 wt%, resulting in the appearance of additional peaks at 2θ = 37.9° and 43.8°, which are attributed to NiO. The obtained results proved the incorporation of NiO NPs into the nanocomposite films. The surface morphology of pure chitosan/PVA film and NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite film (5 wt%) was examined by FESEM. The FESEM images were taken for the top surface of the films and for the cross section as shown in Fig. 3 . As seen from Fig. 3(a), the unmodified chitosan/PVA film has homogenous and smooth surface. On the other hand the nanocomposite film, Fig. 3(d), has bright particles on its surface, which are attributed to the presence of NiO particles. Fig. 3(b) and (c) show the cross section images at different magnification for chitosan/PVA, whereas Fig. 3(e) and (f) show the cross section images at different magnification for chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposite film (5 wt%). It is clear that the modified film has a more porous structure in comparison to unmodified film, which has dense structure. Fig. 4 shows Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) of PVA, chitosan, chitosan/PVA and chitosan/PVA doped with different weight percentage of NiO NPs. PVA has bands at 3316 cm−1 and 1327 cm−1 which are assigned to the stretching vibration of O–H group and bending vibration of C-O-H, respectively. Bands at 2945 cm−1 and 2914 cm−1 are related to C–H group asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, respectively. The vibration of residual of acetate group of both CO and C–H wagging is observed at 1728 cm−1 and 1244 cm−1, respectively. The bending and wagging vibrations of C–H group are seen at 1426 cm−1and 1375 cm−1, respectively. The crystalline part of PVA (C–O stretching vibration) is observed as a shoulder at 1144 cm−1 while the amorphous part of PVA (CO stretching vibration) is observed at 1085 cm−1. The C–C stretching vibration is seen at 845 cm−1 [25–27]. Chitosan has a band at 3457 cm−1attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H and N–H group. The C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations are seen at 2924 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1, respectively. The bands of amide I and amide II that are characteristic bands of chitosan are observed at 1628 cm−1 and 1536 cm−1, respectively. The –OH of the primary alcoholic group is observed at 1395 cm−1. The asymmetric stretching vibration of the bridge oxygen of glycosidic bonds is observed at 1144 cm−1. The C–O group that attributed to secondary and primary O–H group is appeared at 1065 cm−1 and 1025 cm−1. The N–H out of plane vibration is seen at 659 cm−1 [28–30]. For chitosan/PVA, there is a shift for the vibration of O–H group to 3262 cm−1. The change in the position of the wavenumber of O–H indicated the hydrogen bond formation between chitosan and PVA. Also, there are a shift in the bands at 1728 cm−1 and 1628 cm−1 to 1734 cm−1 and 1644 cm−1, respectively. The changing of positions of the amide I band can be due to the emergence of new compounds with different groups of carbonyl. There are new bands appeared at 600 cm−1, 561 cm−1 and 522 cm−1. Also, it can be observed that the transmittance of most bands is stronger than that for chitosan and PVA beside the change in the location of the bands [31]. All these results confirmed the compatibility and miscibility between PVA and chitosan. In case of chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposites films, there are clear bands appeared at 600–700 cm−1 and their intensity were increased with increasing the NiO NPs content. Based on literature [32], these bands are assigned to the stretch vibration mode of Ni–O. Furthermore, the intensity of the N–H out of plane vibration band at 600 cm−1 is decreased with increasing the amount of NiO NPs. These results indicated the presence of NiO NPs into the modified films and also its interaction with the polymer matrix. Fig. 5(a) shows UV–Vis spectra of NiO NPs. It is seen that NiO has an absorption peak at ~325 nm [33]. It was reported that NiO is a direct bandgap semiconductor, therefore (αhʋ)2 was drown against hʋ for band gap estimation and its value was ~3.1 eV as shown in Fig. 5(b). This value agrees with that reported previously [34]. Fig. 6 shows UV–Vis spectra of chitosan/PVA sensitized with different weight percentage of NiO NPs along with pure chitosan/PVA. There is a peak at 204 nm in Fig. 6(a), which is related to n-π* and π-π* of CC and CO indicating the presence of the residual of acetate group [35]. For chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposite films, it was found that with increasing the weight percentage of NiO NPs, there is a red shift from 204 nm to 220 nm. Moreover, at higher doping level, there is a new peak appeared at 310 nm which attributed to Ni–O. These results confirmed the incorporation of NiO NPs in the nanocomposites films, consequently the optical properties of the polymer matrix were enhanced. The variation of the absorption coefficient (α) with photon energy (hʋ), is a special parameter that offering the most useful optical information for material classification and it is determined using the following equation [36]. (2) α = 2.303 A d where A is the absorbance and d is the thickness of the film. Fig. 6(b) shows the relation between absorption coefficient and photon energy. As seen that, α shows a steep rise near the absorption edge and at the region of high α a straight line relationship is noticed. The increase of the absorption near the edge because of production of neutral excitations and/or the transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Intercept the extrapolation to zero absorption with the axis of photon energy gives the absorption edge value and its values are listed in Table 1 . It is obvious that the absorption edge value decreased with increasing the NiO NPs in the polymer matrix. This proved that the modified films become acquired the photocatalytic property owing to the NiO sensitization. Thus, these composites may be used as a photocatalytic material for water treatment. The optical energy band gap of the prepared films is estimated from the absorption spectra near the absorption edge and it is determined using the following relation [37,38]: (3) αhʋ = B hʋ − E g n where B is constant, Eg is the optical band gap, and n is exponent depends on the nature of electronic transition and it takes values ½ for direct transition and 2 for indirect transition. Fig. 7 shows the relation between (αhʋ)2 and (αhʋ)½ against hʋ for the prepared films. Eg values are summarized in Table 1. As seen both values of direct and indirect band gap are decreased with increasing the filler contents and this is attributed to the change in the structure of the polymer nanocomposite and it is significantly associated with the creation of localized states in the band gap. Dielectric properties are complex function of bulk permittivity, conductivity, frequency, and the constituent's arrangement. The dielectric permittivity (ε*) is defined as follows [39,40]: (4) ε ∗ = ε ′ − iε ″ (5) ε ̍ = C p d / ε o A (6) ε ̎ = D ε ̍ where ε ̍ is the dielectric constant, ε ̎ is the dielectric loss, εo is the permittivity in free space, Cp is the capacitance, d is the film thickness, A is the electrode area, and D is dissipation factor. The variation of log ε ̍ and log ε ̎ against log f (frequency) is seen in Fig. 8 . As seen that with decreasing frequency, both ε′ and ε″ are increased for all samples. This can be assumed to be due to the tendency of dipoles to align themselves in the direction of the electric field, and this may be due to the interfacial space-charge polarization effect of the studied samples. When the frequency of the field reversal increases, the arrangement of the space charge carriers in a takes an infinite time to orient their axis parallel to the applied field. After certain frequency, the space charge carriers can't align with the field results in the reduction in values of ε̍ and ε̎ and being independent to the frequency [40]. It is clear that values of ε′ and ε″ are decreased compared to pure polymer matrix (chitosan/PVA). This may be attributed to the decreasing of hopping electron of NiO NPs inside chitosan/PVA chain and trapped its motion Because of their nucleating actions, nanofillers are well known for promoting the crystallization of polymers. Because of the faster nucleation process, increased nanosized NiO loading blocks chitosan/PVA chains mobility. The agglomeration of nanoparticles results in the formation of nanoclusters of various sizes, which promotes relative crystallinity. Furthermore, the formation of complexes as a result of NiO nanoparticle loading impacts molecular mobility, resulting in molecular ordering and hence relative crystallinity of polymer nanocomposites. Less polymers is possible to fill the increasingly tiny interstitial gaps between the nanoparticles as relative crystallinity rises [41,42]. The plotting of AC electrical conductivity of chitosan/PVA and chitosan/PVA incorporated with different weight percentage of NiO NPs versus log f at room temperature is seen in Fig. 9 and it is calculated from the following relation [43]: (7) σ = ω ε o ε ̎ where ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2лf). It can be seen that, the increase in conductivity is not appreciable and tends to have a constant value at low frequencies, approaching it to DC values. Also, it is clear that the conductivity of measured samples is decreasing with the incorporation of NiO NPs compared to chitosan/PVA blend. This may be resulted from the formation of thin immobile nanolayers resulting from the interaction of NiO NPs and PVA/chitosan chains and leads to restrict the mobility of polymeric chains and hinder the movement of free charges inside the material. The interaction of nanofillers with the polar groups of the polymer characterizes polymer nanocomposites. The complex formation in NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposites is dominated by Ni2+ cations with OH molecules of the chitosan/PVA polymer. Because of the intra-chain effect, Ni2+ cations linked to multiple OH molecules in the polymer chain causes stiffen of the polymer chain and act as momentary cross-links due to the inter-chain effect. Also, the O−2 anion has a similar effect with polymer. These interactions induce structural rearrangement inside the polymeric matrix, resulting in reorientation of amorphous polymeric chains [42]. Thus the Ac conductivity decreased and this agreed with XRD results which reflect the increasing of crystallinity of polymer nanocomposite system."
9,Antibacterial activity,"3.2 Antibacterial activity Disk diffusion method was used for studying the antibacterial activity of the synthesized NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films (0.5, 1.5, 3, 5 wt%) in comparison with the unmodified chitosan/PVA was studied using 2 Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus 6538 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987) and 2 Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli 8739 and Salmonella Typhimurium 14028). Because the diffusion of the active compound in agar media is very low so the film was dissolved in DMSO, which has zero effect on the bacteria. A blank disk containing only DMSO was tested as a negative control in a previous work so we didn't test it again. Additionally, Fatima et al., and Andleeb et al., presented that no inhibition zone was observed for DMSO so they used DMSO as a solvent for antibacterial activity studies [44,45]. Fig. 10 shows photographic images of the agar plats after 24 h. It is known that increasing the diameter of the zone of inhibition indicating higher antibacterial activity. According to Ahmed et al., the antibacterial activity mechanism of heavy metal oxides is owing to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide ion, and hydroxyl ion) in addition to the release of heavy metal ions (Ni2+ ions). These ROS can damage the cell components, including nucleic acid, proteins, DNA, lipids, and carbohydrates. What's more is that both hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical penetrate membrane of the cell causing undesired reactions and affecting on the biological processes of the cell, consequently prevent cell growth and led to cell death. Additionally, the metallic ions are attracted to the membrane of the cell due to the presence of the thiol groups (–SH) onto the protein outer cell membrane thus damage the bacterial membrane [46–51]. The diameters of the inhibition zones for all films toward four bacteria strains are drawn in Fig. 11 . The results of antimicrobial tests indicated that the synthesized NiO/chitosan/PVA films shown better antibacterial efficiency than pure chitosan/PVA toward all the tested bacteria. Generally, it is observed that the antibacterial ability gradually increased with increasing the NiO content. Additionally, the inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli) was better than that of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), as shown in Fig. 11. Interestingly, that the inactivation zone of the nanocomposite film in case of S. Typhimurium and E. coli reached ~28.1 and ~26.5 mm, respectively. Whereas, the inhibition zone for NiO–CeO2–ZnO [52], NiO [15], CdO–NiO [15], CdO–NiO–Fe2O3 [46] was 11, 20, 20, and 13 mm, respectively, against E. coli. These results indicating that the prepared composite membranes have higher inhibitory effect in comparison with the literature."
10,Dye adsorption experiments,"3.3 Dye adsorption experiments 3.3.1 The effect of NiO amount The adsorption efficiency of chitosan/PVA film sensitized with various weight percentages of NiO (1.5, 3, and 5 wt%) was evaluated in comparison with pure chitosan/PVA film using MO dye as a type of organic water contaminant. 80 mg of each membrane was introduced into 20 mL of 5 mg/L MO solution. Fig. 12 shows the UV–Vis spectra of MO solution during the adsorption process in the presence of various membranes. In case of the unmodified chitosan/PVA film, Fig. 12(a), the intensity of the characteristic peak of MO at 464 nm gradually decreases with the passage of time. It is noticed that the incorporation of only 1.5 wt% NiO, Fig. 12(b), causes a sharp decrease in the MO peak intensity, especially in the first 30 min of adsorption time. Similarly, after 30 min of contact time the modified membrane contains 3% NiO, Fig. 12(c), shows a sharper decline in the peak intensity relative to 0% and 1.5% NiO. Whereas, hybridization with 5 wt% NiO led to the most significant decrease in the MO characteristic peak as illustrated in Fig. 12(d). Fig. 13 shows the MO removal percentage in the presence of pure chitosan/PVA and chitosan/PVA films hybridized with various amounts of NiO (1.5, 3, and 5 wt%) after 90 min of contact time. The adsorbed percentage of MO dye is calculated the following equation. (8) % Adsorption = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 % where, C0 is the initial dye concentration and Ct is the dye concentration at selected time t (min). After 90 min of adsorption, the removal percentage of MO was 40% using unmodified chitosan/PVA film as an adsorbent material. From Fig. 13, it is obvious that the incorporation of NiO significantly increases the MO removal percentage. The nanocomposite film contains 5 wt% NiO has the best adsorption properties in comparison with all films. Its dye removal efficiency reached 86%, which is more than two times higher than that of the unmodified membrane. 3.3.2 The effect of adsorbent dose The variation of MO removal efficiency in the presence of various doses (40, 80, 100 mg) of chitosan/PVA and NiO/chitosan/PVA/composite films was evaluated as presented in Fig. 14 . It was reported in the literature that increasing the adsorbent amount increases the decolorization of the dye [53–55]. Herein, for all membranes as the adsorbent dose increased from 40 mg to 80 mg as the dye removal efficiency was enhanced. However, more increase in the dose up to 100 mg causes unnoticeable changes in the dye removal percentage. This is may be due to the presence of unsaturated adsorption sites in the film [56]. Moreover, using excess amounts of the adsorbent material represents as an economic loss. Thus, 80 mg is the optimum adsorbent dose used in other experiments. 3.3.3 The effect of contact time on MO removal The impact of increasing adsorption time from 0 to 150 min on the dye removal percentage was studied in the presence of 80 mg of chitosan/PVA film sensitized with 5 wt% NiO as adsorbent material as shown in Fig. 15 . It is clear that the first 30 min of adsorption process causes a boost increase in the dye removal percentage. With increasing the contact time up to 60 and 90 min, the adsorption efficiency increased steadily. This trend can be explained as follows; in the early time of adsorption process all the adsorption sites in the membrane are available, consequently led to a fast decrease in dye concentration until reach a saturation state at 90 min. However, there is no noticeable change in the decolorization efficiency with increasing adsorption time to 120 and 150 min. These results are supported by other works [57–60]."
11,Conclusion,"The synthesized chitosan/PVA/NiO nanocomposite films with a dual functionality, removal of toxic dye and antibacterial properties, were prepared for the first time. Chitosan/PVA doped with different amounts of NiO NPs (0.5, 1.5, 3, 5 wt%) were studied using XRD, HRTEM, FESEM, ATR-FTIR, UV–Vis spectrophotometer, and Ac conductivity measurements. The antibacterial activity and dye removal of the prepared sample are investigated. The XRD and conductivity measurements proved that addition NiO NPs increases the crystallinity of nanocomposite system compared to pure chitosan/PVA. ATR-FTIR results affirmed the structural change in blend sample by the addition of NiO NPs. XRD and FTIR data confirmed the loading of NiO in chitosan/PVA membrane. Values of absorption coefficient and band gap indicated that addition of NiO NPs change the structure of chitosan/PVA, decreased the band gap, and creates localized states in the band gap. The Ac conductivity was decreased compared to polyblend sample because of the addition of NiO NPs. The results of antimicrobial test indicated that the NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite films have better activity toward gram negative bacteria. The removal of MO dye tests showed that the NiO/chitosan/PVA nanocomposite membrane exhibited more than 2 times higher decolorization efficiency than pure chitosan/PVA membrane owing to the adsorption properties of the NiO impeded in the membrane. The prepared films may be used in food backing owing to its significant inhibitory effect against bacteria."
