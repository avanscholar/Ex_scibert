0,Introduction,"In recent years, the energy crisis and environmental pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels have increasingly prompted people to seek clean and renewable energy [1–3]. Hydrogen is considered to be the ideal energy carrier and alternative fuel in the future because it is clean, renewable, effective, environmentally friendly, and easy to store and transport [4,5]. Up till now, various techniques such as water electrolysis, the thermochemical process from fossil fuel, anaerobic fermentation of biomass, and organic waste and photocatalytic water splitting by semiconductors have been employed to produce commercial hydrogen [6–9]. Among these methods, 95% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuel, which is not only uneconomical but also dissatisfied with an environmental request [10]. Generally, heavy metal ions and organic pollutants are introduced into aquatic environments due to the combustion of fossil fuel [11]. Especially, organic sewage possesses carcinogenicity and toxicity, which shows a great permanent menace to human health [12]. Therefore, it is of profound significance to establish a system to realize highly concentrated wastewater treatment with simultaneous alleviation of the energy crisis. The semiconductor photocatalytic hydrogen production (energy photocatalysis) and photocatalytic pollutant degradation (environmental photocatalysis) is a widespread concern. Semiconductor photocatalysis, as one of the less polluting, resource-efficient, and sustainable photocatalytic techniques, has received recent attention because it can simultaneously tackle the environmental contamination and the energy crisis through photocatalytic redox performance using solar energy. In the photocatalytic redox process, photocatalysts not only lead to generate the actively free radicals (such as OH, O2 −, h+ and so on) degrading organic contaminants into H2O and CO2 but also produce the excited electrons which can result in hydrogen evolution from water splitting by utilization of solar energy [13–15]. Given the backdrop above, exploring photocatalytic materials has become one of the most promising technologies. Since Fujishima and Honda found that water was irradiated through sunlight light to generate hydrogen on TiO2 electrode [16], TiO2 has been widely applied in wastewater treatment and the removal of pollutants from water due to the advantages of appropriate positive valence band (VB), easy preparation, stable structure, eco-friendly and cost-effective [17]. The TiO2 conduction band (CB) is higher than the redox potential of water (−0.23 and 0 V vs. NHE, respectively) [10]. Therefore, by promoting electrons in TiO2 CB through UV light irradiation, it is possible to reduce H2O to H2. However, TiO2 nanomaterials have some fatal drawbacks including a high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and no visible light response. By adjusting the morphology of the photocatalyst, the electron transport efficiency and visible light response can be improved. Particularly, highly one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) can promote directional charge transport and orthogonal electron-hole separation, thus improve the photocatalytic performance [18]. Also, co-catalysts, such as rare metal nanoparticles (e.g., La, Gd, Er) [19], which aid charge separation and transfer by forming heterojunction on TiO2, can also be used to further improve the performance of TiO2 based photocatalysts. In these years, constructing the multicomponent TiO2 based photocatalysts such as SnO2 [20], WO3 [21], BiOI [22], ZnO [23,24], Ag2O [25], SrTiO3 [26], Cu2O [27], MoS2 [28,29], ZrO2 [30], SnS2 [31], CdS [32], BiVO4 [33], Bi2MoO6 [34], g-C3N4-RGO [35], CuO [36], CoOx [37], SrIn2O4 [38], and ZnIn2S4 [39] has been used to solve this problem [40]. Among these TiO2 based composites, Bi-based photocatalysts have attracted considerable attention because of their unique electronic structure and excellent performance [41,42]. (Sr0.6Bi0.305)2Bi2O7 (SBO), an emerging Bi-based semiconductor photocatalyst has roused considerable concerns in the academic field [43,44]. The prominent features of SBO including the appropriate bandgap, mixed valent states of Bi (Bi3+ and Bi5+), the pyrochlore-type crystal structure, and the existence of a small number of vacancy point-defects enable SBO highly efficient photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic reaction [43]. Given the backdrop above, SBO has become a strong candidate in photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the heterojunction of TiO2 with SBO has been rarely reported. The advantages of extending the new application of SBO/TiO2 nanocomposites remain to be researched systematically and profoundly. Further experimental research and theoretical analysis are necessary to expound the potential edges and feasible synthetic methods of SBO/TiO2 heterojunction materials. Herein, we reported a simple one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize the SBO/P25 heterostructured nanocomposites. The design of the SBO/P25 photocatalytic system shows obvious heterostructure which improves the photocatalytic performance in simultaneous photodegradation of MB aqueous and hydrogen generation by photocatalytic water splitting and provides good recycling potential (Fig. 1 ). The SBO/P25 with a matched bandgap structure resulted in fast photogenerated charge separation and a wide absorption range of visible light. The photocatalytic mechanism was explored with a chain of characterizations including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and UV–vis DRS. The present work is expected to provide new strategies for the application of heterostructured nanocomposites in solar energy conversion and environmental purification."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Analytical reagent grade NaBiO3·2H2O, Sr(NO3)2, TiO2 (P25), NaOH, Methylene blue (MB), methanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and used as received without further purification. All the solutions were prepared or adjusted with deionized water."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts Based on our previous research, the SBO nanoparticles were synthesized [43]. Briefly, Sr(NO3)2 and NaBiO3·2H2O were dissolved in distilled water to obtain a solution A and B under sonication with a stirring for 30 min. Then Solution A was mixed with solution B and then a stable brown-yellow suspension was obtained. The thermal oxidation of mixed suspension was carried out in a 100 mL hydrothermal autoclave and the synthesis conditions like 160 °C hydrothermal temperature, 6 h hydrothermal time, and the pH value of 9 were used. The prepared SBO was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and further dried at 60 °C for 12 h. SBO/P25 nanocomposite photocatalysts were prepared using a simple one-step hydrothermal method described in Fig. 1. The weight ratio of SBO to P25 was controlled to be 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 10, 15 and 25 wt%, respectively. For clarity, the obtained samples were represented as x-SBO/P25, where x corresponds to the weight ratio of SBO to P25."
4,Characterizations of photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterizations of photocatalysts The crystalline phases of the as-prepared SBO/P25 nanocomposites were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance, Germany). The morphologies of SBO/P25 nanocomposites were observed by Quanta 450 FEG scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental analysis and FEI Tecnai G20 transmission electron microscope (TEM). Thermo Fisher Nicolet 6700 was used to collect the FT-IR spectra of SBO/P25 nanocomposites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi, Thermo Fisher) of samples was detected by using Al Kα radiation (1486.7 eV). The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) of the as-prepared SBO/P25 nanocomposites were characterized with a UV–Vis spectrometer (Puxi TU-1901, Beijing). The intermediate products and structures of MB before and after photocatalytic reaction over SBO/P25 nanocomposites were studied by the NMR spectrum recorded on AVANCE NEO (Bruker, Germany)."
5,Determination of photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Determination of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activities of the bare SBO, P25, and SBO/P25 nanocomposites were characterized through the photodegradation of Methylene blue (MB) solution under ultraviolet (UV) or visible light irradiation at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm) was carried out to get a visible light source. Briefly, 100 mL of MB solution with a concentration of 10 mg/L was poured into a quartz beaker containing 0.2 g of photocatalyst powder. Before irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between MB solution and photocatalyst. During visible light irradiation, 3 mL of the suspension was taken out at a given time interval and immediately filtered to remove the catalysts. The concentration of MB was investigated by recording the variations of the characteristic absorption peak of UV–vis spectrophotometer (Puxi TU-1901 UV–Vis, Beijing) with deionized water as the standard sample. Furthermore, the stability and repeatability of the photocatalysts were examined by cycling experiments under the same conditions. To measure the photocatalytic activity of SBO, P25, and x-SBO/P25, the rates of the photocatalytic degradation of MB was determined with the following Eq. (1) [44]: (1) P h o t o d e g r a d a t i o n r a t e = ( C t - C 0 ) C 0 × 100 % Herein, C0 was the initial concentration of MB and Ct was the concentration of MB at a certain time interval of the photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic process can be expressed as the following Eq. (2) [45]: (2) l n C 0 / C = k t Herein, k is the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constant."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation The hydrogen evolution experiment was carried out in a sealed quartz flask at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp (Perfectlight, PLS-SXE 300, Beijing, China) was used as a light source to trigger the photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment. In a typical hydrogen evolution experiment, 0.1 g of photocatalysts were dispersed in an 80 mL methanol aqueous solution containing 25 vol% of methanol. Before irradiation, the whole H2 evolution system together with the quartz flask was fully degassed to remove air using a vacuum pump for 30 min. The hydrogen output was measured by gas chromatography (GC-7806, Beijing) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a 5 A molecular sieve column. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas during the process of hydrogen production from photocatalysts. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) for H2 evolution was also measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. The average intensity of irradiation was measured as 1.5 W m−2 (CEL-FZ-A spectroradiometer) and the irradiation area was controlled at 28.26 cm2. The QE was calculated according to the following equation (3): (3) QE = 2 × R H 2 I × 100 % where R H 2 and I represent the H2 evolution rate and the rate of absorption of incident photons, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and composition of catalysts,"3.1 Structure and composition of catalysts The phase structures of the prepared photocatalysts were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), XRD pattern with peaks for (222), (400), (440), (622), (444), and (662) planes appearing at 2θ = 28.05°, 32.50°, 46.63°, 55.30°, 57.99°, and 75.17°, manifests the successful preparation of the cubic SBO pyrochlore structure with space group Fd-3m (JCPDS NO. 81-2460). Besides, all of the characteristic diffraction peaks of P25 can be indexed to the anatase phase (JCPDS NO. 84-1285) and rutile phase (JCPDS NO. 21-1276), which is in accordance with previous studies [46]. When x is less than 10, the characteristic diffraction peaks of SBO cannot be observed from the XRD pattern of SBO/P25 nanocomposite, which may be due to the low content and high dispersion of nano-SBO. Meanwhile, for SBO/P25 composites, the intensities of all the characteristic diffraction peaks of TiO2 are decreased with the increasing of SBO content. As shown in Fig. 2(b), especially, the peaks of TiO2 in 10-SBO/P25 are relatively not sharp in comparison with other SBO/P25 with lower SBO content. This means that TiO2 in 10-SBO/P25 has a decreased crystallinity and higher SBO content in SBO/P25 composites would deteriorate its photocatalytic performance. In addition, it can be observed from Fig. 2(b) that the shift of diffraction peaks is neglectable, indicating that the nano-SBO exists as a separate crystalline phase instead of being incorporated into the crystal lattice of TiO2. The grain size (D, nm) is estimated with the following Eq. (4) [47]: (4) D = K λ β c o s θ Herein, K of cubic SBO is 0.943, and that of spherical TiO2 is 0.89, λ (Cu Kα) is 0.154 nm, β is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and θ is the diffraction angle for the hkl planes of X-ray [13]. The grain size of pure SBO and TiO2 is about 50.5 nm and 14.0 nm respectively, while the grain size of SBO and TiO2 in SBO/P25 composites are about 30.2 nm and 14.0 nm respectively, which proves that the existence of TiO2 in hydrothermal treatment limits the growth of SBO crystal surface. These results demonstrate that the SBO/P25 nanocomposites have been successfully prepared. XPS and FT-IR were employed to determine the elemental composition and surface chemical states of SBO/P25 composites. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), Bi 4f, Sr 3d, O 1s and Ti 2p can be readily observed in the fully scanned spectra, indicating the presence of SBO and P25 in SBO/P25 composites. As displayed in Fig. 3(b), the Bi 4f7/2 (or Bi 4f5/2) peak can be well deconvoluted into two bimodal peaks at the binding energy of 158.1 and 159.1 eV (or at 163.7 and 164.5 eV), which is attributed to Bi3+ and Bi5+ in SBO and confirms the mixed valence states (Bi3+ and Bi5+) in the SBO catalyst being consistent with the results of Bi2O4 based system [48]. XPS peaks of Sr 3d found at 133.6 eV and 135.2 eV in Fig. 3(c) are respectively attributed to electron binding energy of Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2, confirming the presence of Sr2+ in SBO [26]. Moreover, it must be pointed out that the intensities of XPS peaks of Bi 4f and Sr 3d are relatively weak due to the low SBO content in 0.4-SBO/P25 composites. Fig. 3(d) shows that the O 1s spectra of 0.4-SBO/P25 can be fitted into two peaks, including the lattice oxygen of Ti-O/Bi-O bonds (530.0 eV), and the chemisorbed oxygen species (531.5 eV) [34]. In Fig. 3(e), the peaks centered at 458.7 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.4 eV (Ti 2p1/2) are ascribed to Ti4+ in TiO2 [49]. The measured FT-IR spectra of SBO, TiO2, and 0.4-SBO/P25 composite were shown in Fig. 3(f). It can be found that in 0.4-SBO/P25 nanocomposite there is no characteristic peaks of SBO due to the lower content of SBO. Two absorption bands at about 3435 and 1635 cm−1 are assigned to the O-H stretching vibration and O-H deforming vibration of liquid water, respectively [43,50]. The absorption band below 1250 cm−1 is due to the Ti-O-Ti vibration and the absorption band near 660 cm−1 corresponds to the Ti-O bending vibration, which is similar to the previously measured results [51,52]. Moreover, the modes at about 1382 cm−1 probably confirm the presence of adsorbed trace NO3 − since nitric acid is used in the manufacturing process [53]. The 1475 cm−1 absorption peak may be due to the absorption of two phonons at 857 cm−1 and 585 cm−1 which should be derived from the vibration mode of lighter atoms [54]. Characteristic peaks of SBO at 857 cm−1 and 585 are assigned to the Bi-O stretching vibration and bending vibration, respectively [43]. According to the discussion on the measured XPS and FT-IR spectra, the prepared 0.4-SBO/TiO2 shows the presence of SBO and P25, suggesting the successful coupling of SBO with TiO2 in composites."
9,Morphology analysis,"3.2 Morphology analysis The morphology and composition analysis of SBO, P25, and 0.4-SBO/P25 nanocomposites were observed by FE-SEM and shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) depicts that P25 consists of spherical particles with a diameter range of 14–36 nm, which is consistent with that reported in previous reports [55]. FE-SEM image presented in Fig. 4(b) shows that SBO is composed of large irregular particles with a wide range of size distribution from about 0.1 to 0.7 μm. It can be found from Fig. 4(c) that although the size and shape of P25 particles are almost not changed in 0.4-SBO/P25, not only the size of SBO particles becomes small and is in a narrow distribution range of 0.1–0.16 μm, but also SBO particles anchoring some P25 particles show the cuboid-like morphology. Thus, during the synthesis of SBO/P25 composite, the addition of P25 can change the shape of SBO particles and also inhibit the growth of SBO particles. The EDX elemental mapping in Fig. 4(d) shows the homogeneous presence of Ti, O, Bi, and Sr. The results further demonstrate that the as-prepared nanocomposites are composed of SBO and P25. TEM was used to further investigate the morphology of 0.4-SBO/P25 nanocomposites. It can be seen from the left inset shown in Fig. 5 (a) that the sizes of TiO2 and SBO nanoparticles in 0.4-SBO/P25 composites are about 24 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The HR-TEM images presented in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively, correspond to the expanded areas marked as blue circle in Fig. 5(a) and (b), which clearly shows that the smaller TiO2 nanoparticles are tightly attached to SBO and the heterojunctions are successfully fabricated in 0.4-SBO/P25 nanocomposites. The crystal plane spacing with about 0.3178 nm corresponds to the (222) plane of the pyrochlore-type SBO. The crystal plane spacings with about 0.2371 nm and 0.3247 nm can be assigned to the (004) plane of anatase phase of TiO2 and the (110) plane of rutile phase of TiO2, respectively. Moreover, Fig. 5(d) clearly shows that the formed heterojunctions exist not only between P25 and SBO but also between anatase and rutile phase in the prepared SBO/P25 composites. Multi-heterojunctions help to prevent the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs at their interface, further improving the H2 evolution from water splitting and the degradation of MB."
10,Photocatalytic properties of SBO/P25 catalysts,"3.3 Photocatalytic properties of SBO/P25 catalysts The photocatalytic performance of P25, SBO, and SBO/P25 catalysts were estimated by the photodegradation of MB under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in 90 min. From the plots of C/C0 versus irradiation time presented in Fig. 6 (a), we can find that the concentration of MB exhibits almost no change only in the presence of P25 and SBO powder. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity for all x-SBO/P25 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 10, 15, 25 wt%) composites, is obviously higher than that of pure P25 and SBO, and the photocatalytic degradations of MB are 87.6%, 94.4%, 95.5%, 93.6%, 85.5%, 79.5% and 69.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, the sample obtained by mechanically mixing of P25 and SBO do not display significant photocatalytic activity, implying that heterojunctions in SBO/P25 composites can improve the photocatalytic removal efficiency of organic pollutants in water. Our measured results show that 0.4-SBO/P25 has the best photocatalytic performance in comparison with other SBO/P25 composites. When the content of SBO is lower than 0.4 wt%, the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs may be relatively low. But too much SBO content can also hinder the electron transfer across the interfaces of SBO/P25 heterojunction, and the photocatalytic performance of the composite does not reach the maximum. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the 0.4-SBO/P25 sample under ultraviolet light irradiation is the same as that under visible light irradiation, implying that the SBO/P25 photocatalyst has high catalytic performance in the visible light region. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) kinetics model was used to investigate the reaction kinetics of MB photodegradation by calculating the apparent pseudo-first-order constant k [30]. The calculated values of k of different catalysts are presented in Fig. 6(b). The k of MB on x-SBO/P25 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 10, 15, 25 wt%) are 0.019, 0.026, 0.034, 0.025, 0.015, 0.014 and 0.012 min−1, respectively. The inset of Fig. 6(c) shows the color change of the MB dye before and after degradation. It can be seen that the color of the MB completely disappears after 90 min irradiation. In order to further study the photodegradation mechanism of MB on the SBO/P25 composites, the trapping experiments were performed to better understand the contribution of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and radicals. In general, benzoquinone (BQ) is a typical scavenger for O2 – radicals, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is an effective scavenger for holes (h+), and isopropanol (IPA) is a usual scavenger for OH radicals [56,57]. In our experiments, 0.005 g of BQ, 0.005 g of EDTA, and 0.02 g of IPA were added to the photodegradation system of MB in the presence of SBO/P25 photocatalysts, respectively. Fig. 6(d) shows that both BQ and IPA have weaker inhibition of MB photodegradation than that for EDTA, illustrating that h+ radicals are the primary active species in the photodegradation of MB in the presence of SBO/P25 photocatalysts. To evaluate the stability and recyclability of photocatalysts, the cycle test for the photodegradation of MB with SBO/P25 photocatalysts was performed under visible-light irradiation. There is no significant loss in photocatalytic activity after the cycle test in Fig. 6(e). Therefore, the measured results confirm that SBO/P25 has good stability and recyclability, and is conducive to the long-term degradation of organic pollutants. The components of SBO/P25 are not subject to photocorrosion and the heterojunction structure is stable during the photocatalytic process. This fact can be further supported by XRD patterns in Fig. 6(f). These results confirm that SBO/P25 has high stability in the photocatalytic process, promoting its practical application in the future. More studies on the P25 based heterojunctions for photodegradation of organic contaminants are summarized in Table 1 ."
11,Photocatalytic H2 production,"3.4 Photocatalytic H2 production Hydrogen produced from the water was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of pure TiO2, SBO, and SBO/P25 composites under the irradiation of sunlight simulated by Xenon light. In the present study, 100 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed into an aqueous solution containing 25 vol% of methanol as sacrificial. From the experiment (Fig. 7 (a, b)), it can be found that pure SBO exhibits negligible H2 production rate due to the rapid recombination of carriers and commercial P25 presents a low photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution (0.43 mmol h−1 g−1). Surprisingly, photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution has a tremendous enhancement when SBO nano-particles are combined with P25 nano-particles to form the interface of heterojunctions. To verify if a novel SBO/P25 heterojunctions can help improve the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, we also conducted a similar study over pure SBO and P25. When the content of SBO is 0.1% to 0.4%, the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production is increased to 3.18 mmol h−1 g−1 which is 7.40 times as much as that of P25. However, the further increase in the content of SBO will lead to a decrease in the photocatalytic H2 production rate. Two possible reasons should be considered to explain this phenomenon. On one hand, excessive TiO2 will shield the SBO from the incident light. On the other hand, the extra non-active TiO2 covering on the surface of SBO nanoparticles may destroy the surface-active centers. Fig. 7(c) presents the current signal spectra of 0.4-SBO/P25 after 6 h of hydrogen production, possessing the peak time of H2 at around 0.374 s. As presented in Fig. 7(d) and (e), the overall hydrogen production rate over pure anatase after 6 h is just 0.09 mmol h−1 g−1. Compared with the hydrogen production rate of 0.4-SBO/P25, the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of pure anatase is negligible. The hydrothermally treated P25 (anatase/rutile) shows a significant hydrogen production rate (1.50 mmol h−1 g−1), implying that the hydrothermal reaction can form the heterojunctions between the anatase and rutile phase which facilitates the rapid separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of SBO/P25 heterojunction composites was much higher than that of commercial P25, pure anatase, and hydrothermally treated P25, implying that SBO/anatase/rutile heterojunction composites can enhance the photogenerated carrier separation to the greatest extent [58]. Therefore, the SBO/P25 composites show better photocatalytic performance. To investigate the stability of SBO/P25 photocatalysts, the photocatalytic cyclic H2 evolution experiments were conducted. Fig. 7(f) demonstrates that the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of SBO/P25 composites does not decrease significantly during four consecutive 6 h reaction processes. As the reaction proceeds, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate tends to be stable, especially after 6 h reaction. However, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is inhibited by the addition of methanol, implying that the decrease of photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is not due to the deactivation of photocatalyst, but due to the consumption of sacrifice reagent. The experimental results show that the 0.4-SBO/P25 sample has high stability in the H2 evolution process, which will promote its practical application in the future. Photocatalytic H2 evolution by other studies of TiO2 heterojunctions is summarized in Table 2 ."
12,Electronic and optical absorption properties of SBO/P25 catalysts,"3.5 Electronic and optical absorption properties of SBO/P25 catalysts The typical UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of bare SBO, P25, and SBO/P25 with different mass ratios are shown in Fig. 8 . The pristine P25 has a distinct absorption edge in the range of 400 nm (Fig. 8 (a)), which corresponds to the band-gap energy of 3.07 eV and is similar to the previous results [63]. The absorption edges of SBO/P25 have significantly red-shifts compared with pure P25, which shows that the SBO/P25 nanocomposites possess the outstanding visible light response. The visible light absorption property of P25 after coupling with SBO is further enhanced in the visible light range of 400–800 nm owing to the wide spectrum absorption of black SBO. The absorption capacity of SBO/P25 for visible light increases with the increase of SBO content. Furthermore, the bandgap energy can be obtained from the UV–vis DRS spectra and the optical band gap values (E g) for SBO, P25, and SBO/P25 are estimated via the following Eq. (5): (5) α h ν = A ( h ν - E g ) n / 2 where α, h, ν, E g, and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck’s constant, optical frequency, bandgap, and a constant, respectively. The index n depends on the electronic transition of the semiconductor, n = 1 for direct-gap semiconductor, and n = 4 for indirect-gap semiconductor [64]. Rutile is both direct and indirect band-gaps, whereas anatase exhibits only an indirect band-gap [65]. Assuming that P25 and SBO/P25 are the indirect semiconductors, the bandgap energy can be calculated from the relationship curve of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν) and is shown in Fig. 8(b). The bandgap for P25 and 0.4-SBO/P25 are 3.07 and 2.95 eV, respectively. The shifts of the band-gap energy of SBO/P25 composites also prove that the SBO decoration has changed the properties of P25 due to the formation of effective heterojunction. Most previous studies have reported that the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) position of photocatalysts are calculated by the bandgap (E g), according to the following empirical Eqs. (6) and (7): (6) E CB = X - E e - 0.5 E g (7) E VB = E CB + E g where Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), X is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms (X value for SBO is 5.80 eV and P25 is 5.81 eV). According to the UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra, and the ECB and EVB are calculated as shown in Table 3 . It is generally considered that the separation efficiency of electrons and holes plays a major role in photocatalytic reactions [66]. To further study the carrier lifetime and carrier intensity, the electrochemical impedance technique was used to study the electrical conductivities of pure P25, SBO, and 0.4-SBO/P25 from the perspective of carrier transport. The Nyquist plots of pure P25, SBO, and 0.4-SBO/P25 are displayed in Fig. 8(c). The diameters of capacitive loops at the high frequency region reflects the charge transfer resistance of photocatalysts [67]. The diameter of capacitive loops in the Nyquist plot for 0.4-SBO/P25 is much smaller than those for pure P25 and SBO, suggesting the charge transfer resistance is remarkably reduced. The results show that SBO/P25 nanocomposites are conducive to the fast separation of photogenerated carriers improving interfacial charge transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and significantly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The separation of photogenerated carriers would generate photocurrent. The stable photocurrent responses of pure P25, SBO, and 0.4-SBO/P25 recorded for several on-off cycles via a 420 nm light lamp in Fig. 8(d) further characterize the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Higher photocurrent means that there are longer-life photogenerated electrons and holes and hence the higher the photocatalytic activity would be [68]. The photocurrent increases rapidly after light irradiation and soon reaches a steady state. Subsequently, the photocurrent quickly returns to its dark current state when the light is turned off. According to the measured results, the photocurrent density of SBO/P25 composite is higher than that of pure P25 and SBO, demonstrating that the charge-transfer resistance can be decreased via coupling SBO with P25. The PL emission spectra of photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 9 a. The emission region in the wavelength range of 300–350 nm can be attributed to the defect emission region in which the emission is caused by the defects in SBO and TiO2 [12]. In addition, pure SBO has a high-intensity peak, but with the formation of the SBO/P25 heterojunction, the PL spectral intensity decreases significantly. The emission intensity of the P25 sample is greatly reduced compared to the pure anatase sample. Therefore, it can be concluded that the heterostructured SBO/P25 nanocomposites have effectively reduced the surface defects of SBO and the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by constructing a local electrostatic field."
13,1H NMR spectrum of methylene blue (MB),"3.6 1H NMR spectrum of methylene blue (MB) To elucidate the degradation mechanism of dyes during a photocatalytic reaction, the intermediate products and structures of MB before and after photocatalytic reaction over SBO/P25 nanocomposites were characterized by 1H NMR spectrum. It can be seen from Fig. 9(b) that the chemical shift F1 at 2.87 ppm is attributed to the proton peaks of –CH3, corresponding to 18, 20, 16, and 19 atoms in MB molecule, proving the high symmetry of the molecular structure of MB before photodegradation. The absorption peaks at 6.56 ppm (2H, 13, 9), 6.81 ppm (2H, 14, 10), and 6.99 ppm (2H, 11, 7) are attributed to the proton peaks on the benzene ring, which verifies the existence of benzene ring in MB and is consistent with the molecular structure of MB reported before [69,70]. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the intermediate product obtained after a period of photocatalytic oxidation of MB, there is no proton peak of a benzene ring and –CH3, and only an absorption peak at 4.79 ppm, which belongs to the characteristic peak of H2O, indicating that MB molecule is directly oxidized to H2O and CO2 by oxygen active group in photocatalytic reaction. These results clearly show that SBO/P25 nanocomposites can completely photodegrade organic pollutants in wastewater, providing a new avenue for the development of new visible light-responsive photocatalysts."
14,Possible mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction process,"3.7 Possible mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction process Based on the structural properties of the SBO/P25 nanocomposites and their photocatalytic results, a reasonable mechanism for the enhanced degradation of MB and photocatalytic ability of H2 production over the SBO/P25 heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 5, we can confirm that the SBO/P25 nanocomposites have three interconnected heterojunction interfaces, namely, SBO/Anatase, SBO/Rutile, and Anatase/Rutile. These heterojunction interfaces have a decisive effect on enhancing the overall photocatalytic properties of the nanocomposite [62]. Particularly, the heterojunction region between two semiconductors (also called the space charge region) has a local electrostatic field, which plays a crucial role in the photogenerated carrier separation in space [61].The energy bandgaps of SBO and P25 are 1.25 eV and 3.07 eV, respectively. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges of SBO are approximately 0.68 eV and 1.93 eV, respectively. The CB and VB of P25 are calculated to be −0.23 eV and 2.85 eV, respectively. When the SBO and P25 particles are exposed to the visible light, the electron-hole pairs are produced on the surface of the SBO and P25. The SBO particles on the SBO/P25 heterojunction serves as an excellent electron acceptor where electrons can be quickly transferred through a local electrostatic field [61]. The photo-excited electrons on the CB of SBO migrate to the surface of the SBO due to the potential difference of the SBO/P25 heterojunction system, which accelerates the separation of the photogenerated carriers and photocatalytic process. The EPR spectra with DMPO and DMSO as the trapping agent of O2 − and OH were acquired for SBO/P25 and presented in Fig. 9(c). No obvious signal is observed for SBO/P25 under dark conditions, indicating that neither O2 − nor OH is formed under dark conditions. After 30 min of exposure to the visible light, OH radical signals are observed, which confirms the existence of OH. Combined with the experimental results of OH by IPA in Fig. 6(d), it can be undoubtedly concluded that the formation of OH radicals enhance the photocatalytic activity. Besides, the photoexcited electrons within the SBO are unable to react with O2/H2O2 molecules to yield O2 − and OH, because the CB edge potentials of the O2/O2 − (−0.33 eV vs. NHE) redox couple is more negative than SBO (0.68 eV vs. NHE) [71]. Sr vacancies as a surface-active center in the SBO will facilitate the dissociative adsorption of the reactant molecule at a molecular level. Meanwhile, Sr vacancies not only introduce the continuous states to expand the optical absorption, but also form the defects to accumulate electrons, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers and leads to an enhancement in the photocatalytic performance. The foregoing analysis on photocatalytic activity (Fig. 6 (d)) and 1H NMR spectrum of MB (Fig. 9b) has clearly shown that the photogenerated holes are the major active species and oxidize MB into H2O and CO2 directly [72]. At the same time, the photoexcited electrons within the P25 react with H+ to produce H2, because the CB edge potentials of the H+/H2 (0.0 eV vs. NHE) redox couple is more positive than P25 (−0.23 eV vs. NHE). Due to the limitations of interface charge transport, kinetics, and thermodynamics, water splitting driven by photocatalysts is a complex process that can be improved by sacrificing electron donors or acceptors [59]. The introduction of sacrificial agents such as methanol can inhibit electron-hole recombination and improve hydrogen production efficiency. In the methanol system, in addition to being a hole scavenger, methanol will partially oxidize and decompose to produce H2, thus enhancing the overall H2 production rate [73]. As shown in Fig. 10, H2 production is mainly ascribed to the following three factors [74]: (1) The photogenerated electron will be easy to react with water to release H2 and OH–, while photogenerated h+ will oxidize H2O to produce H+; (2) Methanol captures OH– to form H2 and intermediate HCOOH; (3) Intermediate H+ and HCOOH will further react to generate CO2 and H2. In our work, the volume of CO2 was not detected during GC analysis. Carbon dioxide generated by photocatalysts in methanol aqueous solution will be dissolved in water, which will help to improve the acidity of the solution and further enhance the hydrogen production capacity of photocatalysts [75]. As indicated in Fig. 7 (f), methanol is continuously consumed during the reaction and the hydrogen production rate decreases gradually by capturing OH–."
15,Conclusion,"In summary, the SBO/P25 heterostructured nanocomposites were obtained by a single-step hydrothermal method and showed outstanding activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution and removal of MB solution. The 0.4-SBO/P25 nanocomposite has superior photocatalytic H2 evolution performance and good durability. The rate of H2 evolution of 0.4-SBO/P25 reaches 3.18 mmol g−1 h−1 and is about 35.33, 7.40, 2.12 times as large as those of pure anatase, unmodified P25, and anatase/rutile heterostructure, respectively. Meanwhile, the SBO/P25 nanocomposites also exhibit outstanding photocatalytic activity and stability towards the degradation of MB dye in an aqueous solution. The formed heterojunction on SBO/P25 nanocomposites provides unique advantages of improving carrier density, extending electron lifetime and reducing interfacial migration impedance, and it prevents the fast recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in space. The SBO/P25 nanocomposites are beneficial for exerting the synergistic effect existing between SBO and TiO2 in visible light absorption and charge separation, which further improves hydrogen-generating rate from water splitting and MB removal rate. The SBO/P25 nanocomposites have huge potential in H2 evolution from water splitting and wastewater treatment due to its good visible light absorption performance, efficient carrier separation efficiency, and good circulation performance, and proposing a new way for the development of novel, stable and visible light-responsive photocatalysts."
