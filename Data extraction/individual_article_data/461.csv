0,Introduction,"Biofuels can be synthesised via a variety of process routes, each with varying intermediates depending on the desired specific final product, including bio-routes (e.g. fermentation) and thermo-chemical routes (e.g. gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction). Pyrolysis densifies lignocellulose into bio-oil (main product), gas and char in absence of oxygen under ambient pressure, short residence time (<3 s) at around 500 °C. Bio-oil with yield up to 75 wt% (dry feed) can be usually obtained by lignocellulose fast pyrolysis [1]. The produced liquid bio-oil contains hundreds of chemical compounds, primarily oxygenated molecules and its composition can vary based on the operating conditions. The fast pyrolysis production route is favoured in comparison to the other thermal and biological processes as it is overall the least complex and most cost-efficient pathway for processing lignocellulosic biomass [2]. However, bio-oils require product upgrading due to their unfavourable physical and chemical properties, such as thermal and chemical instability and high oxygen content (30–40 wt%) which significantly lowers their energy content and increases both the acidity and corrosiveness of products, high viscosity and ash content and high water (~ 20 wt%). This high water content results in a polar nature and thus, the bio-oil is immiscible with crude oil [1,2]. A two-step process comprising of a low-temperature hydrogenation step, for the stabilisation of the bio-oil, followed by a high-temperature hydrodeoxygenation step for oxygen removal has therefore been developed for the production of the final value-added products [3]. Noble metal catalysts such as Pd, Ru and Pt tend to be used in the two-stage process due to their excellent hydrogenation activity [3]. In particular, Ru supported on carbon, has shown superior activity in aqueous-phase hydrogenation [4]. Moreover, changing the operating condition and solvent, different selectivity can be achieved. For example, Alibegovic et al. [5] was able to synthesise Pt-and Pd-containing magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by polyphenylquinoxaline and hyperbranched pyridylphenylene polymer for hydrogenation of furfural, achieving a conversion of about 98% and selectivity about 85%, at 120 °C 60 bar in presence of isopropanol. Furthermore, the same group stabilized the NPs using hyper-cross-linked polystyrene, able to maintain constant reaction performances for 7 cycles [6]. However, water is the preferred hydrogenation media due its participation into the reaction, providing an additional channel for hydrogenation of the aldehyde group, in which hydrogen bypasses the direct surface reaction via a hydrogen-bonded water network [7]. Based on previous studies, the main challenges facing the commercialisation of the hydrogenation step in water media is the large hydrogen requirement for maintaining a high product selectivity, mainly due to the mass transfer limitations, which is a result of the limited solubility of H2 in water [8,9]. Catalytic membrane micro-reactors have been recently proposed to overcome this limitation in the production of bio-chemicals and in hydrogenation reactions [10–15]. Catalytic membrane micro-reactors combine chemical reactions with membrane separation and provide a more compact and less capital-intensive system design, along with achieving improved selectivity and/or yield. The membrane provides an improved contact surface between the liquid bio-oil, solid catalyst and gaseous hydrogen, as all three phases must be in contact for the reaction to take place. Incorporating the Ru catalyst into the membrane allows the optimisation of the product distribution, thus reducing undesirable side reactions [16]. The hydrogen and bio-oil streams can operate in counter-current across the membrane, with the catalyst position determining where the reaction takes place [17]. The hydrogenation of levulinic acid was studied using Ru-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane in the range 40–90 °C and 0.7–5.6 bar, showing an hydrogenation rate 4 times higher than that using a packed bed reactor [14]. Liu et al. (2016) studied the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the presence of a Pd/γ-Al2O3 coated polytetrafuoroethylene film modified by dopamine [12]. The authors noted that the membrane with the catalytically active layer showed the best performance in terms of conversion and stability (compared to conventional membrane reactor), as a result of enhanced mass transport of hydrogen. Zhu et al. (2018) developed a gas–liquid–solid microreactor with a polydopamine functionalized surface coated with highly-active palladium nano-catalysts by the electroless deposition plus using hydrogen as a reducing agent [18]. This method increased both the utilization efficiency of the Pd ions and the durability of the microreactor compared to Pt/CNT, Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/TiO2 active layer membranes. Mengistie et al. [13] used a Pd–polyethersulfone (PES) membrane for the hydrogenation of the –NO2 group in nitrophenol in a flow-through catalytic membrane reactor, denoting the stability of PES as a support for Pd. Recently, our group has proposed an innovative Ru-PES composite membrane for hydrogenation reactions [10]. The Ru doped PES membrane was able to selectively convert furfural into furfuryl alcohol with high TOF (48,000 h−1) under mild operating conditions (70 °C and 7 bar), but the Ru-PES membrane showed instability over time due to Ru leaching under acid conditions. Unfortunately, the durability of the existing catalyst layers inside the membrane microreactor fabricated by the conventional methods is still poor [10,12,19,20]. Therefore, facile methods are needed for preparing catalyst layer with good durability and activity in membrane microreactors for this technology to be commercially viable. Modified polyetheretherketone (PEEK-WC: WC refers to cardo group) is a polymer containing a spirolactone group with good thermal stability, mechanical property and high resistance to chemicals due to its high glass transition temperature (225 °C) [11]. Due to these properties, PEEK-WC membranes find wide applications in different fields such as in biomedical engineering, fuels cells, liquid-liquid extraction and pervaporation [11,21]. Presence of WC increases solubility enabling techniques such as nonsolvent-induced phase inversion to be used in their preparation allowing for a larger range of membrane characteristics to be achieved [22]. Also, the PEEK-WC membrane has an high chemically and mechanically stability in acid environment than other polymeric membranes and an high permeability [23]. Sulfonation can be used to increase the hydrophilicity of PEEK by introducing charged sulfonate (-SO3-) groups into the polymer backbone. Sulfonation of PEEK can be applied before or after polymerization, where the former can achieve a high degree of sulfonation, but the resultant material has poor mechanical stability [24]. Hence, post-polymerization sulfonation is preferable in hydrogenation applications, where thermal and chemical integrity is critically important. The aim of this work was therefore to develop and test a novel and stable catalytic composite membrane in order to hydrogenate bio-oil derived compounds. To the best of our knowledge, Ru-functionalised PEEK-WC membranes have never been synthesised by post-polymerization sulphonation and tested for hydrogenation reactions. For the preparation of PEEK-WC membranes, Tamisolve® NxG (identified from now on as Tamisolve®) was explored, for the first time, as an alternative non-reprotoxic and biodegradable solvent [25]. Tamisolve® is a polar aprotic solvent with high boiling point (241 °C). The similar solubility parameters with those of traditional toxic solvents such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethyl acetamide (DMA) and its completely miscibility with water, make Tamisolve® an ideal candidate for the preparation of PEEK-WC membranes, by phase inversion techniques, in a more sustainable way. Therefore, this work focuses on the implementation of a sulfonated PEEK-WC membrane to overcome stability limitations shown by Ru-PES membrane on aldehydes groups' hydrogenation in aqueous media. Particular focus was on the use of a more sustainable solvent in the PEEK-WC synthesis and the sulfonation stage towards durable membranes."
1,Experimental,
2,Polymeric membrane preparation,"2.1 Polymeric membrane preparation The membrane was prepared at room temperature via vapour induced phase separation / non-solvent induced phase separation (VIPS/NIPS). The polymer used was PEEK-WC (13 wt%) with Tamisolve® (87 wt%) as a less toxic solvent. The polymer solution was cast on a glass plate into a climatic chamber using a manual casting knife with a set thickness of 0.35 mm and let to evaporate for 5 min under controlled humidity (55%) and temperature (25 °C), before the immersion in a water coagulation bath. The membranes were removed from the coagulation bath after 3 h and washed in hot water (60 °C) for 3 times to remove all the solvent. Finally, the membranes were dried in the oven for 4 h at 40 °C. The PEEK-WC membrane was immersed into H2SO4 solution at different concentrations (from 50 to 80 wt%) and time of exposition at 60 °C, in order to evaluate the sulfonation grade of the membrane surface. Subsequently, the modified PEEK-WC membrane was washed and dried and doped with Ru. The PEEK-WC modified has been placed into a bath of sodium mercapto sulphonate (3.40 g salt in 200 mL H2O) and added 2.39 g Ru (III)Cl3 x H2O solution (2.39 g of salt into 200 mL H2O). After 30 min, the reduction solution has been added (4.36 g NaBH4 in 200 mL water) and left for 2 h."
3,Membrane characterisation,"2.2 Membrane characterisation The membranes were tested using a Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) (TA Q500), to determine how the membrane performed more favourably at various temperatures and at which point the membrane structure changed. The temperature rate was imposed to 10 °C/min until 550 °C, feeding 22 mL/min of nitrogen. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis (Frontier IR Single-Range Spectrometer, Perkin Elmer) was used to determine the chemical composition of the membrane. The pore size and bubble point were investigated by a PMI Capillary Flow Porometer (Porous Materials Inc., USA). Porewick was used as wetting liquid (surface tension: 16 dynes/cm). The contact angle measurements were carried out using ultrapure water by the method of the sessile drop using a CAM200 instrument (KSV Instrument LTD, Finland). For each sample, at least 6 measurements were taken, and the average and standard deviation was, then, calculated. The porosity (%) was determined by recording the weight of membrane samples before and after immersion in kerosene (used as wetting liquid) and applying the following eq. (1): (1) Porosity % = wt w − wt d ρ k wt w − wt d ρ k + wt d ρ p ∙ 100 where wtw is the weight of the membrane in the wet state, wtd is the weight of the membrane in the dry state, ρk is the kerosene density (0.81 g/cm3) and ρp is the PEEK-WC polymer density (1.24 g/cm3). The percentage of porosity is the average of three different measurements for the same membrane. The mechanical tests of the membrane properties were analysed on a Zwick/Roell universal testing machine, single-column model Z2.5, equipped with a 50 N maximum load cell (BTC-FR2.5TN-D09, Germany). For all membranes, five measurements were carried out; then, the average values and corresponding standard deviation were calculated. By inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP –OES) analysis (Perkin Elmer Optima 5300DV) the Ru loaded on the membrane was quantified. The modified membrane (1 cm2) was dissolved in dimethyl formamide. The solvent was evaporated and then, an acid solution of aqua regia (HNO3 wt. 70% / HCl 36% = 3/1 v/v) was added in order to dissolve the Ru nanoparticles) [10]. The membrane morphology was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (Carl Zeiss SIGMA HD VP), studying the top layer. The samples were prepared for SEM analysis coating the one layer with carbon."
4,Reaction test,"2.3 Reaction test A simulated bio-oil was prepared by mixing the following key compounds: vanillin (3.75 wt%), acetic acid (4.2 wt%), furfural (5.32 wt%) and glucose (30.62 wt%) in water for a total organic content of 43.89 wt%. The pH of the solution was measured by a pH indicator paper and resulted acidic (pH = 2–3) as typical bio-oil. The bench scale hydrogenation set-up consisted to a first stage, where the liquid was fed by Eldex Pump (P-100), while the hydrogen stream was supplied by Brooks mass flow controllers. Both streams were heated up and sent into the second stage for carrying out the reaction into the catalytic membrane reactor (active surface 120 × 60 mm). The membrane reactor consisted in two stainless steel plates where the catalytic membrane was placed between them (see Fig. 1 ), dividing the liquid and vapour zone. The presence of the catalytic membrane had the function to improve the contact among the phases. A heating tape (Omegalux, model DHT101060LD) was used to heat up the membrane reactor to the desired temperature. In the last stage, the output of catalytic membrane reactor was collected into a 125 mL Dreschel bottles immersed in an ice trap and the liquid composition was then analysed by HPLC Agilent 1200 series with MS hook-up. After each reaction test the catalytic membrane was regenerated with a flow of H2 and N2 respectively 0.8 mL/min and 2.2 mL/min for 8 h [10]. During the experimental campaign, the effect of operating conditions such as the reaction temperature, reactor pressure and hydrogen flowrates were evaluated on the bio-oil model compounds hydrogenation. In particular: • Pressure: 11 bar, 16 bar and 18 bar. • Temperature: 65 °C, 75 °C and 85 °C. • Hydrogen flowrate: 5 mL/min, 18 mL/min and 25 mL/min. The reaction tests have been performed in duplicate and the error on the conversion was shown to be about 5%. For a complete evaluation and comparison with previous studies, the conversion, the selectivity for the products (i-compound) and the turn-over frequency (TOF) for furfural and vanillin (not shown in the equations) have been defined as: (2) x = Furfura l in − Furfura l out Furfura l in molar ∙ 100 = % (3) S i = i − compoun d out Furfura l in − Furfur l out molar ∙ 100 = % (4) TOF = mole of furfural reacted mole of catalyst · reaction time ∙ = h − 1"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Membrane characterisation,"3.1 Membrane characterisation Previous work show that PEEK-WC sulfonation is typically obtained using chlorosulfonic acid [26], while in this paper, the PEEK-WC membranes have been sulfonated superficially by dipping them into a sulphuric acid solution at different concentrations. After the sulfonation procedure, the membranes immediately changed colour from white to orange/yellow, thus suggesting that H2SO4 was effective on altering the PEEK-WC structure. Moreover, the membrane prepared with the 80% H2SO4 solution was extremely brittle and therefore was not further evaluated. To confirm sulfonation, TGA analyses were carried out. Fig. 2 shows the weight loss profile for the bare membrane and for those prepared using the different H2SO4 concentrations. The bare membrane lost weight between 70 and 170 °C, which is associated to release of trapped moisture. The weight loss starting at 180 °C up to 220 °C that is absent in the profile of the bare membrane, is instead associated to the decomposition of sulfonic groups. There is a clear trend depending on the degree of sulfonation, with the higher weight loss corresponding to the higher sulfonation. Based on TGA, the membrane prepared with 70% H2SO4 resulted in 10 wt% sulfonation, while those prepared using the 50 and 60% H2SO4 resulted in about 6.5 and 7 wt% sulfonic groups, respectively [27]. Differently from the bare and 50%/60% H2SO4 treated membrane, the membrane prepared with 70% H2SO4 shows a small weight loss between 250 and 400 °C, which could denote structural changes/damages during acid treatment. Finally, the decrease in weight at approximately 450 °C for all membrane types, represent the thermal degradation of the PEEK-WC polymer. Moreover, as reported in Fig. 2 the PEEK-WC sulfonated in presence of 60% of H2SO4, shows a somehow different trend of weight loss (between 230 and 330 °C), compared to the other sulfonated membranes, which can be associated to the larger presence of sulfonic groups into the membrane pores. FTIR analysis was carried out to determine which sulphuric acid concentration provided the optimal degree of sulfonation. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–800 cm−1 with the relevant ranges shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 . To confirm that the sulfonation of the PEEK-WC membranes had taken place and that sulfonic groups were present, the spectra of S-PEEK-WC membrane were compared to those of a non-sulfonated PEEK-WC membrane. In the FTIR spectra of the S-PEEK-WC's, the band at 3394 cm−1 (Fig. 3) corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the S-O-H functional group, which is due to the large volume of water bonded to the sulfonic groups. No water absorption was observed for the non-sulfonated membrane. Fig. 4 shows that the backbone carbonyl band at 1647 cm−1 appeared unchanged between the virgin PEEK and the treated samples. Moreover, a new absorption peak in the treated samples appeared at ~1050 cm−1 and was assigned to the O=S=O symmetric and asymmetric vibrations [24]. It is clear when compared to the non-sulfonated membrane, that sulfonic groups are present in the modified membranes, which corroborates the TGA analyses. Also, the degree of sulfonation generally increases hand in hand with the sulfonic group band intensity and the amount of water bonded to the membrane. Due to the damage experienced by the membrane when exposed to the 70% mass and 80% H2SO4 solutions, the 60% mass solution was found to be the most favourable for the hydrogenation experiments. The effect of the sulfonation duration was then investigated using the 60% H2SO4 solution, which demonstrated the most favourable sulfonation conditions. Therefore, 5 membranes were prepared and each exposed to a 60 wt% H2SO4 solution for one of the following time durations: 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h. A non-sulfonated membrane was also analysed for comparison purpose. Fig. 5 shows that as the sulfonation period increases, the degree of sulfonation also increases. The only exception to this trend is the result for the 60 min sulfonation period, which presents a peak higher than that of the 120 min sulfonation period. This could be due to the damage that the membranes experienced when exposed to the H2SO4 solutions for periods of over 60 min. For this reason, a 60-min sulfonation period was determined to be the most favourable. Furthermore, the membranes were characterised in terms of mechanical strength, porosity and contact angle. As reported in Table 1 , the addition of the Ru catalyst to the membrane improved the strength (Young's modulus) from 19 to 74 N/mm2, indicating a higher resistance of the Ru doped material. Previous work shows that the sulfonation of PEEK-WC resulted in a decrease of Young's modulus [28]. However, the doping with Ru could have promoted the rigidity of the material as observed for other catalysts [29]. Both membranes showed a hydrophilic nature (Table 1) with a surface contact angle value between 72 and 75°, in line with literature data [30]. The membrane morphology and presence of S and Ru was evaluated before and after the modification by SEM-EDS (see. Fig. 6 ). The SEM surface morphology of non-doped and doped membranes is shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. The modified membrane clearly presents a roughest surface characterised by a larger pore size of round and ellipsoidal shape surrounded by relatively round fibrils as pore walls. Dipping the PEEK-WC into H2SO4 solution led to an enlargement of the pore size, as reported in Table 1. The Ru doped membrane showed a pore size diameter (0.14 μm) two times bigger than the blank membrane (0.07 μm), while the porosity slightly increased after treatment due to the concurrently sulfonation and dissolution of the PEEK-WC membrane, which is expected to correspond with an increase in roughness and surface nano-topography [24]. Presence of Ru and S on the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane surface was confirmed by EDS. The Ru is clearly visible as bright areas on the surface of sulfonic groups on the treated membrane (Fig. 6c) and it is expected to be found also in the internal surface of the open pores [10]. The figure clearly shows that the distribution of the Ru particles is not homogeneous, and the size varies from ~30 nm to ~200 nm. Moreover, larger agglomerates as big as 1 μm are shown in the magnified picture. The Ru detected in the selected area (by SEM-EDS) was 0.95 at.%, while the overall Ru content in the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane was quantified by ICP-OES, resulting in 25.5 μg/cm2."
7,Hydrogenation reaction test,"3.2 Hydrogenation reaction test The modified membrane was tested for the hydrogenation reaction of a bio-oil model compounds (furfural, vanillin, glucose, acetic acid) studying the effect of pressure, temperature and hydrogen flow rate (see Table 2 ). For the whole experimental campaign, there was not clear conversion of acetic acid and glucose due the low operating condition used, which is in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the current microreactor under the studied conditions is more suitable to targeted chemical precursors compounds rather than complex mixtures such as raw bio-oil [31,32]. Therefore, the hydrogenation of furfural (model compound for hemicellulose) and vanillin (model compound for lignin) were studied more in detail. 3.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature The temperature effect was studied between 65 and 85 °C, for a reaction pressure of 11 bar, 25 mL/min of hydrogen and 0.005 mL/min of liquid feed. As reported in Fig. 7 , the temperature for the hydrogenation reaction plays a positive role incrementing the reactants conversion, in particular when increasing from 65 to 75 °C. Then the increase is less marked. The highest feedstock conversion was achieved for the highest temperature analysed, with 16.5 and 76.6% for vanillin and furfural, respectively. The reduction of furfural theoretically would probably proceed in four ways (see Fig. 8 ): i) the hydrogenation of CO bond, ii) the hydrogenation of the furan ring, iii) the hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, iv) decarbonylation. The selectivity of furfural to tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol improved with the increase in temperature from 42.47 to 74.59%. No other by-products were observed, implying that the reaction might mainly proceed via (i) chemoselective hydrogenation of CO bonds to form furfuryl alcohol, with further hydrogenation of the ring to yield tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. From the reaction pathway in Fig. 8.b, the vanillin can be converted for first instance in vanillin alcohol, hydrogenating the aldehyde group in alcohol. Subsequently, the hydrogenation is able to deoxygenate the vanillin alcohol to creosol. For comparison, low temperature (45–65 °C) hydrogenation of vanillin was performed in aqueous media under 13.8 bar H2 in presence of Ru/C [33]. After 10 min, about 49% of vanillin was converted, of which ~50% to vanillin alcohol. Complete conversion was achieved after 1 h. The same temperature range was studied in presence of Pd/C into batch system at 10 bar with initial concentration of vanillin of 65 mM. Under these conditions, the vanillin conversion increased from 46% (at 45 °C) to 82% (at 65 °C), while the selectivity to vanillin alcohol achieved 91.2% and 87.4%, respectively, while the TOF ranged from 130 to 720 h−1; [34]. Furthermore, comparing the selectivity towards vanillin alcohol for the above cited work and the MR (liquid residential time equal to 7.2 min), the MR achieved the highest selectivity (100%) due to the lowest residential time into the reactor system. Similarly, furfural hydrogenation over 5% Pt@TECN catalyst after 1 h reaction in water at 80 °C – 10 bar H2 achieved 32% conversion and complete selectivity to furfuryl alcohol and a TOF of 120 h−1 [35]. Nakagawa et al. (2014) reported 33% selectivity to FA using 2%Pd/SiO2, but conversion was of 63% and TOF of 53 under 80 bar, 20 °C after 1 h [36]. Total conversion of furfural was obtained by Fang et al. using 1-5wt%Ru-MIL-101 at 160 °C and 40 bar, but with low FA selectivity of only 1%. Also, Yang et al. (2016) fully converted furfural at 20 °C and 5 bar in presence 2.9%Ru/Al-MIL-53-BDC with 10% selectivity to FA, but the low TOF (21h −1) suggests that large amount of catalyst was used [37]. The Turnover Frequency (TOF) of Ru-PES for furfural ranged from 57 to 117 h−1, which suggests that the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane has comparable TOF to previously tested catalysts in conventional reactors, while the catalyst activity resulted lower than in previous work for vanillin, although the system was effective on selective partial hydrogenation to vanillin alcohol under moderate conditions. Again, this can be linked to the low dispersion of the Ru on the polymer surface. Bagnato et al. (2018) obtained a furfural conversion of 26% after 30 min (7 bar, 70 °C), using the same microreactor under similar conditions, with a TOF of 48,000 h−1. The large difference has to be attributed mostly to the different liquid flowrate, which was very low in this work (0.005 L/min) compared to the previous one (0.5 mL/min), but also can be linked to the lower dispersion of the Ru nanoparticles as suggested by the SEM pictures suggesting that Ru loading technique must be improved [10]. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction pressure The reaction pressure was varied from 11 to 18 bar, at 75 °C, 5 mL/min of hydrogen and 0.003 mL/min liquid feed. Using the membrane as active contactor among the 3 phases, the pressure favoured the hydrogen solubility into the liquid phase. Fig. 9 indicates that the vanillin and furfural conversion increased with reaction pressure, from about 70% (11 bar) to 75.3% (18 bar), with a decrease of the furfuryl alcohol selectivity at the highest temperature due a better solubility of H2 into the liquid phase, which facilitated the further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol on the Ru surface. While the vanillin conversion to vanillin alcohol increased from 22% to 32.8% at the highest pressure. The lower conversion of vanillin versus furfural can be attributed to the differences in the ring (aromatic and heterocyclic for vanillin and furfural respectively) adjacent to the aldehyde group. Clearly, the dependence of conversion on PH2 was linear, suggesting that H2 is weakly adsorbed on the catalyst surface with the process modelled by a simple second order reaction model based on bulk concentration of the reacting species [33]. Therefore, the increase of the H2 partial pressure facilitates the H2 adsorption and formation of vanillin alcohol. Jian et al. (2016) tested Pd on different carbons for low pressure (10 bar) and temperature (70°) hydrogenation of vanillin, achieving ~40% conversion after 30 min with ~50% vanillin alcohol selectivity in a STR [37]. The complete selectivity for vanillin alcohol shown by the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane is justified by the low operating condition applied during the reaction tests, in particular the contact time between the liquid phase and the membrane surface of 4.32 min. A short contact time (then a high liquid space velocity, 1.43 h−1) was able to hydrogenate only the aldehyde group, as reported by the selectivity. The above hypothesis is confirmed by Aliu et al. [34] who noted the highest selectivity to vanillin alcohol (~91.2%) in presence of Pd/C at 45 °C and 10 bar. A carbon nitride nanosheets supported Pt catalysts was developed and tested for the reduction of furfural with H2 at 100 °C under 10 bar H2 in water in a sealed stainless-steel reactor (50 mL). In the initial stages of the reaction, 29% furfural was transformed to furfuryl alcohol within 30 min, while the conversion increased to 90% in 5 h [35]. In comparison, the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane achieved a similar conversion at lower temperature but did not selectively produce furfuryl alcohol. 3.2.3 Effect of H2 flowrate on conversion The investigation of H2 flowrate was carried out from 5 mL/min to 25 mL/min at 75 °C and 11 bar, as shown in Fig. 10 , where the furfural conversion was steady at about 73%. The selectivity to furfuryl alcohol decreased from 21.36 to 0.83%, by increasing the H2 flow rate, while tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol production increased. The decrement of selectivity is related to a high hydrogen/ furfural ratio, converting the intermediate product (furfuryl alcohol) towards tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol; as reported in Fig. 10.b, where the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol decreased from 22.82 to 0.83% from 5 to 25 mL/min, respectively. Furthermore, the larger hydrogen flowrate increased the vanillin conversion from ~1 to ~15%, maintaining a complete selectivity to vanillin alcohol. Being the furfuryl alcohol and vanillin alcohol, both, intermediate reaction products (see Fig. 8a), the hydrodeoxygenation step (for vanillin alcohol to creosol) is more difficult than the hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol. Furthermore, the absence of 2 methyl furan from the hydrodeoxygenation of furfural, confirmed the difficulty to remove the oxygen compound from the organic molecule."
8,Membrane stability,"3.3 Membrane stability As mentioned in the introduction, the stability of the membrane system is key for the development of performing catalytic membrane hydrogenation processes. The membrane stability was studied by evaluating the Ru leached in the product solution from the membrane by ICP-OES. As reported in Fig. 11 , the Ru content in the liquid product was about 3.2 μg/L after 16 h, while dropped to 0.3 μg/L after 28 h and then remained constant up to 88 h, suggesting stability under the studied conditions. The initial Ru leaching can be attributed to some contamination left from the membrane Ru-doping step. A low amount of Ru was leached when compared to previous work [10], where Ru-PES membrane lost most of the activity surface after just 6.5 h. The results achieved in this work suggest the Ru PEEK-WC membrane is more resistant to wear due to the chemical reaction. Moreover, based on the data present in Fig. 11, the Ru lost was estimated to be 1.61 μg after 88 h, which is less than 1% of the Ru loaded onto the membrane surface (2.14 mg). Therefore, the Ru-PEEK-WC membrane showed a better stability than Ru-PES due mainly to: (i) the nature of the support, with the PEEK-WC having a higher chemical resistance and (ii) the method used for the membrane coating, where the Ru-PES membrane grafted by acrylic UV exposition resulted in a high Ru leaching than the sulfonation method used for the PEEK-WC membrane."
9,Conclusion,"The hydrogenation reaction of bio-oil model compounds was studied using a catalytic membrane reactor. A PEEK-WC membrane was synthesised by VIPS/ NIPS technique in presence of Tamisolve®, solvent with low carbon footprint. Afterward, the PEEK-WC membrane was sulfonated superficially, studying the effect of different concentrations and time of exposition of H2SO4 onto the membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was doped with Ru, obtaining a concentration of 25.5 μg/cm2. Comparing the PEEK-WC membrane before and after the Ru doping, the main differences consisted in an increased mean pore size from 0.07 to 0.14 μm and the Young's module from 19 to 70 N/mm2, while the membrane hydrophilic nature did not have significant changes. The model compounds hydrogenation using the microreactor resulted in: (i) 75% furfural and 33% vanillin conversion at 18 bar and 85 °C; (ii) a TOF of 117 h−1 for furfural in line with TOFs obtained using conventional reactors (iii) the Ru-S-PEEK-WC membrane was stable for about 90 h and outperformed stability of previously tested Ru- PES membrane, but (iv) the catalytic activity was not as good as the Ru-PES microreactor due to poor dispersion of the Ru on the S_PEEK-WC membrane surface."
