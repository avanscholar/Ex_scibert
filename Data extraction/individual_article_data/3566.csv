0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is the most important raw material and feedstock in the chemical, fertilizer, petrochemical and metallurgical industries with a high energy density of 122 MJ/kg which is about 2.8 times greater than the average value for the hydrocarbon fuels [1]. The main applications of hydrogen include ammonia production, refining and methanol production and high efficiency systems like fuel cells for the production of electricity and internal combustion engines for transportation [2,3]. Currently 97% of the total hydrogen production is accomplished by the catalytic steam reforming of natural gas or by the partial oxidation of other fossil fuels, heavy oils and oil-derived naphtha which lead to the formation of a large amount of CO2 leading to global warming and climate changes [4,5]. As a result, the feasibility of hydrogen production from renewable sources like biomass and biomass derived oils is being explored recently. The SR of bio-oil is considered to be a CO2 neutral and a sustainable route to hydrogen production due to the net CO2 uptake during the biomass growth [6,7]. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, sugars and furans [8]. The efficient usage of bio-oil for the reforming process requires the addition of water which leads to the separation of the pyrolysis oil into a hydrophobic lignin-derived oligomer-rich fraction which can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers for use as high-octane gasoline-blending components [9], and an aqueous fraction containing around 20% organics which can be reformed catalytically [1,4] for renewable hydrogen production with the advantage of the potential recovery of co-products like methane (that can be subsequently used for hydrogen production via steam reforming) during the reforming process that improves the overall economic efficiency of the process. However, the chemical complexity of the bio-oil along with the additional issues of polymerization and aging due to acidity makes it difficult to develop efficient catalysts, to establish reaction mechanisms and perform kinetic modeling of the overall reforming process [7,10]. Hence with the objective of identifying the best operating conditions for hydrogen production by catalytic steam reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, studies have been performed over different catalytic systems using model compounds or mixtures of oxygenates such as ethanol, acetic acid and glycerol [11–14]. Ni has been extensively used as an active metal for the steam reforming of oxygenates due to its high activity for C–C bond rupture and H2 formation from H atoms with a high catalysis rate of WGS reaction resulting in the removal of adsorbed CO from the surface [15]. The metal content (% Ni loading) ranging from 5 to 30 wt. % has been investigated by different authors in the literature [16–20] for the steam reforming of ethanol and acetic acid. Wang et al. [21] have reported the use of acid-treated Ni catalysts for ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and complete ethanol conversion was obtained regardless of the reaction conditions with the highest H2 yield of 84%. Zhikun et al. [22] investigated the steam reforming of acetic acid over Ni/La2O3 catalysts with different Ni content by varying the reaction temperature, liquid hourly space velocity and the S/C ratio and reported that a 20% Ni loading resulted in superior catalytic activity with a high hydrogen selectivity (93.8%) with low CO selectivity (0.3%). The conversion of the oxygenates has been found to increase with the increasing metal content in the catalytic system [23,24] but a 10–15% Ni loading is generally preferred as higher loading has been reported to cause significant catalyst deactivation due to sintering [25,26]. An et al. [27] reported a 12% Ni loading in the Ni/Al2O3 catalytic system with the highest catalytic activity and lowest coke deposition rate. Song et al. [28] employed a neural network approach to design on optimum Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for ESR. They reported an optimal Ni loading of 12.4% for the best catalytic performance. Compared with conventional fixed-bed reactors loaded with catalyst pellets, monolithic catalysts are more suitable in the heterogeneous catalysis applications with advantages such as lower pressure drops and larger external surface area per unit volume. However, as catalysts and catalyst supports for the conversion and synthesis processes, monolithic catalysts have found very limited commercial use so far [29]. In the present study, the catalytic activity of Ni loaded Al2O3 catalysts prepared and characterized in two different geometries (monolith and pellet) has been compared for the steam reforming of model bio-oil (C2H5.13O1.43) chosen as an equi-mass mixture (50 wt.% each) of ethanol and acetic acid by conducting selective experiments at optimal conditions determined by performing a basic thermodynamic evaluation of the process."
1,Methodology,
2,Thermodynamic analysis,"2.1 Thermodynamic analysis There is a limited amount of literature available on the chemical equilibrium analysis of the steam reforming of mixture of oxygenates. Most of the studies in the present literature deal with a number of pure components such as acetic acid & ethanol for the sake of simplicity. Moreover the carbon formation regions (plots of T vs. S/C indicating the thermodynamic region for carbon formation) are specific to the model oxygenate used. Therefore, the thermodynamic evaluation of the process was carried out using the process simulator PRO-II, a software package which allows for a sequential modular simulation to analyze the impact of essential process parameters (temperature and S/C ratio) on the hydrogen yield and selectivity & identify operating conditions that avoid carbon formation. This was done in two stages: In the first stage, the simulation was performed with pure components: acetic acid & ethanol; neglecting the reactions leading to carbon formation in the system at equilibrium inspired by the assumption that the hydrogen yield is unaffected. In the second stage, the assumptions were relaxed to include the reactions leading to coke formation in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the effect of carbon formation on the hydrogen yield using model bio-oil (C2H5.13O1.43). The Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state was used for the calculation of thermodynamic properties for the simulation of phase and chemical equilibrium in the temperature range 473 K–1273 K and the steam to carbon ratio ranging from 1 to 13. A Gibbs' reactor was employed for the purpose of simulating the reaction system at equilibrium. The main reactions which may occur in steam reforming of model bio-oil are shown in Table 1 . The associated equilibrium constants of these reactions are exhibited as a function of temperature in Fig. 1 . It can be observed that the steam reforming of model bio-oil (reactions 1 and 2) to form hydrogen is favorable at a temperature, T > 700 K. The water-gas-shift reaction is largely affected by the equilibrium. The methanation reactions involving CO and CO2 are favored at low temperatures. The coke deposition occurs mainly via the reverse Boudouard reaction (reaction 6) and the hydrogenation reactions of CO (reactions 7) and CO2 (reaction 8) respectively at low temperatures and via the methane decomposition (reaction 9) at high temperatures although these reactions are affected by the change in molar ratio of reactants due to their low Log (K p ) values within the investigated temperature range. The polymerization of ethylene may also lead to coke formation although it is thermodynamically unstable. In order to maximize hydrogen selectivity of the process, the methanation and the hydrogenation reactions of CO and CO2 need to be minimized."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The catalysts used for the reforming of model bio-oil were prepared in two different geometries: monolithic and pellet using the wet impregnation method for the loading of the active metal onto the prepared catalyst support. The details of the wet impregnation method are described elsewhere [30]. The chemicals employed in the catalyst preparation were procured from MERCK Chemicals with 99.90% purity. The cordierite monoliths used in this study had the following characteristic channel dimensions: GSA = 2.25 mm−1, OFA = 0.53 and D h = 0.95 mm. From a reaction engineering perspective, OFA relates to the void fraction in a packed bed, the GSA is analogous to the volumetric surface area (external mass transfer area per unit volume of bed) and the hydraulic diameter, D h is analogous to the open flow paths in a packed bed [31]. Water dispersible high purity boehmite alumina: Dispal 10F-4 (particle size (d50) = 30 μm and BET surface area = 0.10 m2/mg) procured from Sasol was used for the purpose of dip-coating onto the cordierite monoliths and as a support for the pelletized catalysts. 2.2.1 Monolithic catalysts Ni loaded Al2O3 catalysts supported over cordierite monoliths [400 cpsi, 2 ± 0.10 cm diameter, 3 ± 0.20 cm length] were prepared in two steps: preparation of support using the successive dip-coating of alumina from an alumina-water dispersion containing 1%(v/v) nitric acid followed by active metal loading of 12% Ni (by wt.) using wet impregnation from a solution of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O as the metal precursor in deionized water. The locked monolithic channels after each dip-coating were cleared by subsequent blowing of pressurized nitrogen gas. A rotary vacuum evaporator was employed for the initial drying of monolithic channels at around 370 K followed by overnight drying at 400 K and subsequent calcination in synthetic air at 773 K as revealed by the thermo-gravimetric analysis. 2.2.2 Pelletized catalysts Ni/Al2O3 catalysts in the form of cylindrical pellets (1 ± 0.10 cm diameter, 0.7 ± 0.20 mm thickness) were prepared by contacting the alumina slurry in a solution containing a calculated amount of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O as the active metal precursor to obtain a nickel content of 12 wt.% based on the total catalyst weight using a rotary vacuum evaporator followed by the pelletization. An effective dispersion of nickel inside the alumina pores was obtained only after the catalyst samples were allowed for overnight drying at 380 K and calcined in synthetic air at 773 K for about 5 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized using the techniques of Powder X-ray diffraction, Temperature Programmed Reduction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and BET Surface Area analysis. The determination of the calcination temperature for the catalysts was done using a SDT Q600 Thermo-gravimetric differential thermal analyzer. The determination of the crystallographic structure using powder x-ray diffraction was performed using a Phi Psi XYZ X-Ray vertical Diffractometer equipped with a PW Bragg-Brentano (θ/2θ) goniometer. The XRD patterns were obtained using Cu–K radiation of wavelength 0.154 nm at 45 kV and 40 mA and the identification of the present phases were done using the International Diffraction Data Library-JCPDS-PDF2 database. To quantify the amount of reducible nickel phases and the reducibility of the catalyst, the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed taking a 250 mg of catalyst placed in a U-shaped quartz tube (6.6 mm i.d.). The TPR spectra were recorded using a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorption Chemisorb 2720 apparatus. The reducing gas mixture (H 2 = 0.15 Lh−1 & Ar = 2 Lh−1) passed through the reactor (heated from room temperature to 950 °C with a slope of 10 °C min−1 and then maintained at the desired temperature of 900 °C until the end of H2 consumption showed by the baseline return) & a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to quantify H2 consumption rate. The surface morphology of the catalyst samples was determined using scanning electron microscopy in a Carl Zeiss SMT EVO 50 apparatus. The BET surface area and the pore size of the catalysts were determined using N2 physisorption using a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system. The samples were degassed at 150 °C under vacuum for 3 h prior to the gas adsorption measurements. The specific surface area was calculated using a value of 0.16 nm2 for the cross sectional area of the nitrogen molecule using BET model."
5,Experimental setup,"2.4 Experimental setup A schematic view of the laboratory scale experimental setup for the steam reforming is shown in Fig. 2 . The setup comprises of a peristaltic pump for the injection of liquid oxygenate feed containing 10 wt. % organics and balance water corresponding to a S/C ratio of 13 (total flow rate 0.40 ml/min) into the preheater maintained at 473 K where it is mixed with N2 carrier gas (flow rate 25 ml/min) to ensure good heat transfer rate and an inert atmosphere within the reactor tube for the reduction of catalysts prior to the experiments. The preheated feed goes into the fixed bed tubular reactor (20 mm i.d.) made of stainless steel packed with 3000 mg of prepared catalyst samples sandwiched by glass wool layers at top and bottom to provide support to the catalyst sample and ensure a uniform tortuous path so that there is no channeling of vapor feed. The pelletized catalysts were used in dilution with silicon carbide (Catalyst to SiC ratio 2:1(w/w)) to fill the macro-pores inside the catalyst bed to increase the effective flow resistance. Prior to the experiments, the calcined catalysts were reduced in the reactor at a temperature of 873 K for 1 h, using a hydrogen flow rate of 10 ml/min (STP) diluted in nitrogen in the ratio H2:N2 = 1:3. The condensable liquid products and the non-condensable gases exiting from the reactor were separated using a condenser-gas/liquid separator arrangement. The gaseous product analysis was done using a Nucon 5700 Gas Chromatograph Porapak Q column (3.2 mm OD × 1.8 m long) packed with carbosphere (80–100 mesh) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The analysis of liquid product was carried out using a Nucon 5700 Chromatograph SS column (3.1 mm × 2 m long) with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) & the results were also confirmed using the total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOC) for the calculation of conversion of model bio-oil. The hydrogen yield was defined as the ratio of the molar flow rate of hydrogen produced in the system to the input molar flow rate of oxygenate. (1) Molar Hydrogen Yield : Y H 2 = ( F H 2 Out F C 2 H 5 . 13 0 1 . 43 in ) (2) Selectivity to Carbon Compounds : S i = 1 2 × ( F i out F C 2 H 5 . 13 o 1 . 43 in ) The selectivities to the other carbon compounds present in the system such as CO, CO2, CH4 and C (s) were defined as the ratio of the output flow rate of the ith compound to the amount in moles of carbon fed into the system per unit time. The two catalyst geometries were analyzed based on the observed hydrogen yields and concentration in the product gas followed by comparison with the upper limits obtained from thermodynamic analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Thermodynamic analysis-stage 1,"3.1 Thermodynamic analysis-stage 1 The product distributions during the thermodynamic analysis of ESR at a temperature of 800 K & S/C ratio of 0.5 & 1.5 are presented in Table 2 . It should be noted that although the formation of carbon is expected to take place & alter the product distribution at these conditions, it has been neglected from the product pool for the purpose of comparison with literature. The distribution is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by Vasudeva et al. [32] although significant deviations are observed when the same results are compared with those of Rossi et al. [33] i.e. the methane content is higher at the expense of hydrogen concentration. Fishtik et al. [34] also carried out the thermodynamic analysis of ESR assuming no carbon formation. The product concentrations at S/C = 1.5 observed in the present study match with those calculated by Fishtik et al with the exceptions of a lower methane & higher water content. A comparison of gaseous product distribution on a dry basis is given in Table 3 for the thermodynamic analysis of ASR considering carbon formation (Case-1) & without considering carbon formation (Case-2) at T = 800 K. It is observed that the hydrogen concentration in the product gas is higher if the formation of carbon is considered although the result can be opposite for the reforming experiments due to loss of catalytic activity because of coke deposition onto the catalyst surface. It should be noted that the distributions in two cases match for a higher S/C ratio where the coke formation is effectively suppressed. The results are in agreement with that of Vagia et al. [35] at the same temperature."
8,Thermodynamic analysis of model bio-oil considering carbon formation,"3.2 Thermodynamic analysis of model bio-oil considering carbon formation The conversion of the model bio-oil was almost complete in the range of temperatures investigated with the maximum stoichiometric H2 yield of 5.13 mol per mole of oxygenate feed. 3.2.1 Hydrogen yield Fig. 3 depicts the molar H2 yield as a function of temperature and S/C ratio at atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen yield is observed to be a strong function of the reforming temperature and the S/C ratio. The maximum molar H2 yield is found to be 4.98 mol at a temperature of 873 K and S/C ratio of 13. The maxima of the H2 yield shifts from 4.32 mol at (T = 973K, S/C = 3) to 4.61 mol at (T = 873K, S/C = 5). The variation of the hydrogen yield with temperature for a given S/C ratio can be explained on the basis of the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants of the reactions 1 and 2. As the temperature is increased, the hydrogen yield increases but only up to a certain point after which the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (H2 + CO2 ↔ CO + H2O) becomes predominant leading to a decrease in hydrogen yield at subsequently higher temperatures. This is supported by the fact that the CO selectivity increases with temperature after a certain point (temperature corresponding to maximum hydrogen yield) for a fixed S/C ratio. For the constant temperature operation, the hydrogen yield is lower at S/C (∼1) ratios since the steam acts as a limiting reactant and the amount of hydrogen formed through the reactions 1 and 2 at equilibrium is reduced and limited by the amount of steam in the reactant feed. For high values of S/C ratio and temperature, the reverse reactions 4 and 5 dominate and the hydrogen yield is subsequently higher at the expense of reduction in methane selectivity. The temperature threshold for the optimal operation of the reformer is 900 K since the peak for the hydrogen yield is obtained around this temperature. 3.2.2 CO selectivity The equilibrium CO selectivity of the process at atmospheric pressure is presented in Fig. 4 with the observation that the CO formation selectivity can be minimized by operating the reformer at low temperatures and high S/C ratios. The selectivity shows a considerable increase with temperature preferentially at higher temperatures which favors CO production for any S/C ratio, since all the reactions involved in CO production are endothermic (Table 1). At lower temperatures (T < 700 K); the CO selectivity of the reforming process is nearly constant for increasing S/C ratio due to the endothermicity of the CO forming reactions but at high temperatures, the CO selectivity continuously decreases with the increasing S/C ratio. This is because at high S/C ratio, water is in excess, so that water-gas-shift reaction is favored. The carbon monoxide yield presents a maximum at low S/C ratios and high reforming temperature range. The goals of high hydrogen yield along with low carbon monoxide selectivity are mutually contradictory, because the reforming temperature has to be high enough to obtain a reasonable hydrogen yield and on the other hand, the reforming temperature has to be low for obtaining low carbon monoxide selectivity simultaneously. 3.2.3 Carbon formation Coke formation during SR leads to the rapid deactivation of catalysts and thereby results in low operation durability and activity loss [36]. Therefore, it is interesting to determine the reaction conditions eliminating coke in the thermodynamic calculations for the efficient design of carbon-resistant catalysts. Fig. 5 represents the carbon selectivity as a function of the reforming temperature and S/C ratio in the reform feed. The temperature variation of the carbon selectivity can be explained based on the fact that higher temperatures constitute a barrier for the exothermic reactions (Table 1: reactions 6, 7, 8) involving carbon formation. As the S/C ratio increases, the selectivity to the carbon formation approaches zero at comparatively lower temperatures. However, a nearly constant amount of carbon still appears in the product for S/C ratios of 0 and 0.5 at temperatures higher than 1073 K as reaction 9 becomes more plausible at high temperatures. This observed trend can also be explained by reverse of reactions 7 and 8: (H2O + C ↔ CO + H2 & 2H2O + C ↔ CO2 + 2H2) which are favorable at the higher temperatures but the rate reduces when H2O is the limiting reactant. Also, the carbon formation decreases with increasing S/C ratio at a constant temperature because the model bio-oil becomes the limiting reactant and the amount of CO available for reactions 6 and 7 are less, which results in a decrease of carbon formation. Fig. 6 shows the range of conditions under which coke will form during the reforming reaction at equilibrium. The curve was plotted through a second order extrapolation of the data sets obtained for the variation of carbon selectivity with S/C ratios at constant temperatures to the point (required S/C ratio) corresponding to the first disappearance of carbon in the product. For carbon free operation, a temperature higher than 900 K is necessary when the reforming process is operated at low S/C ratios (∼1). The temperature limit for carbon free operation shifts to significantly lower temperatures as the S/C ratio is increased to 1.5 and any further increase of steam concentration in the reactant mixture effectively suppresses carbon formation to zero. 3.2.4 CH4 selectivity Methane is an undesirable product for hydrogen generation since it leads to a reduction in hydrogen yield by competing for H atoms in the reaction system. Fig. 7 depicts that the methane selectivity decreases with temperature due to the highly exothermic nature of reactions (Reactions 4 and 5) involving methane formation (Table 1). Moreover, the methane selectivity drops sharply to zero at a much lower temperature with the increase of S/C ratio in the reactant feed. 3.2.5 CO2 selectivity Fig. 8 shows the CO2 selectivity of the process as a function of temperature and S/C ratio. It is observed that for a fixed S/C ratio, the amount of CO2 produced at equilibrium increases with temperature & then declines with any further increase in temperature. The increasing selectivity at lower temperatures can be ascribed to the exothermic water-gas-shift reaction (Reaction 3) which occurs spontaneously at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the dependence of the carbon dioxide selectivity on the amount of steam is quite strong with the highest selectivity obtained at the highest S/C ratio. 3.2.6 Optimal conditions for reforming The carbon free steam reforming of simulated bio-oil model is possible at high steam concentrations in the reactant feed at high temperatures. However producing high temperatures and the process operation at high steam concentrations required high energy consumption rate because of higher vaporization energy and larger reactor volume because of the higher volumetric flow rates of steam. The production of both CO and CH4 as by-products is undesired since it impacts the overall size of the fuel processor, especially the water-gas-shift reactors [35]. When the low CO selectivity was taken into account, the temperature and S/C ratio were optimized at T = 400–600 K and S/C = 5–8. The main advantage of low temperature reforming operations is the short start-up time and energy consumption. However it has been reported that the equilibrium cannot be attained in these conditions with the existing catalysts since the activity and selectivity of the catalyst along with side-reactions play an important role in determining the approach to the equilibrium and the product distribution. Hence the experiments over the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were carried out at high S/C ratios (∼13) to prevent coke deposition and to obtain higher hydrogen yield in the optimized temperature range of 900–1000 K."
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization 3.3.1 Powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) The observed XRD patterns for the monolithic and pelletized catalysts are presented in Fig. 9 a and b respectively. The XRD Diffractogram for the blank cordierite monolith shows the presence of Indialite: hexagonal form of cordierite (2MgO•2Al2O3•5SiO2) as the major phase with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 21.7°, 26.43°, 28.42°, 29.49° & 33.85° along-with traces of Al–Mg spinel (MgAl2O4). The XRD spectra for the fresh (un-calcined) monolithic catalysts showed the presence of the crystalline NiO phase with cubical structure (diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.4°, 43.3° & 62.7°) whereas the spent monolithic catalysts showed the presence of pure Ni metallic phase with cubical structure due to the reduction of Ni+2 metal ions by the H2 gas carried out prior to the reforming experiments. The absence of some characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to cordierite in the XRD spectra of fresh & spent monolithic catalysts may be ascribed to the reduction of cordierite to form spinel at high temperature (2MgO•2Al2O3•5SiO2 + 5H2→2MgO•Al2O3 + 5SiO + 5H2O). The XRD spectrum for spent monolithic catalyst also shows the diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.2° corresponding to graphitic carbon implying that the deposited coke if of the graphitic form. In addition, the monolithic catalysts show a (4 4 0) diffraction peak at 66.7° (fresh) & 66.6° (spent) which lies in between the characteristic values for NiAl2O4 (65.5°) and Al2O3 (67.3°). This can be explained with consideration to the fact that Ni2+ ions have a larger ionic radius than aluminum & their incorporation into the Al2O3 lattice results in an expansion of the lattice parameters. This suggests the formation of nickel aluminate (NiAl2O4) due to the close interaction between NiO and Al2O3 at high temperatures for impregnated catalyst samples [(NiO + Al2O3 ↔ NiAl2O4) and (Ni + Al2O3 + H2O ↔ NiAl2O4 + H2)] and is an indication of strong metal-support interaction [37]. The peaks corresponding to nickel species indicate the strong crystallinity of the species and that monolayer coverage of Al2O3 by the applicable Ni species was exceeded. The XRD spectra for the monolithic catalysts showed more intense & sharper peaks as compared to the pelletized catalysts indicating a higher crystallite size & presence of larger Ni particles. On the other hand, the absence of NiAl2O4 in the XRD spectra of pelletized catalysts signifies that the Ni species is still within the monolayer coverage (i.e. the amount present is too small) suggesting that the diffusion of nickel ions during calcination into the alumina lattice sites is limited to the first few outer layers of the support resulting in a material without three-dimensional long-range order [38]. It could also be possible that the NiAl2O4 could be in a well-dispersed form, too small to be detected by XRD. 3.3.2 Temperature programmed reduction The literature shows that supported Ni catalysts show different reduction behavior depending on the nature of Ni-support interactions. The bulk NiO phase that weakly interacts with support is reduced around 350–400 °C whereas a high dispersion of Ni on Al2O3 decreases the reducibility of the nickel ion and results in a reduction peak above 500 °C [39]. Huang et al. [40] reported that the peaks near 350 °C and beyond 700 °C can be attributed to the reduction of nickel oxide NiO and aluminum spinel NiAl2O4 respectively in reduction of Al2O3 supported Ni-based catalysts. The TPR profiles of monolithic & pelletized catalysts are presented in Fig. 10 . The results reveal higher reduction temperature for monolithic catalysts as compared to the pelletized catalysts indicating the presence of stronger metal-support interactions in agreement with the XRD spectra. The lower temperature peak around is associated with small NiO particles with strong support interactions, while the higher temperature peak may be attributed to NiAl2O4 spinel phase. For the case of pelletized catalysts, the two peaks observed at around 280 °C and 530 °C are attributed to the reduction of NiO phase (having a weaker interaction with the support) & NiO (incorporated into the tetrahedral sites of the support during the impregnation step) respectively. 3.3.3 BET surface area analysis The BET surface area and average pore width for the fresh and spent catalysts are presented in Table 4 . The confidence intervals have been taken from the analysis report provided by the software after conducting an experiment with each sample. The reduction in active surface area for the monolithic catalyst after the reaction is lower than that for the pelletized catalyst suggesting that the investigated temperature range leads to a greater sintering of pelletized catalyst. It is obvious that the surface area of the cordierite monoliths increases after the alumina coating followed by the impregnation of nickel into the surface channels [41]. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) plots of pore size distribution suggest a broad range of pores. Each catalyst shows a uniform mesopore distribution (15 nm < width < 40 nm). 3.3.4 Scanning electron microscopy The SEM micrographs for the monolithic and pelletized catalyst are displayed in Fig. 11 (a–d). The surface morphology of the monolithic catalyst changes significantly after the reaction due to the low attrition resistance of the monolithic catalysts resulting in coke deposition onto the catalyst surface. The dark coating over the catalyst surface is attributed to coke deposition as evident from the XRD spectrum for the spent monolithic catalyst. This was further confirmed by performing a TGA experiment over the spent monolithic catalyst to quantify the oxidation rate of deposited coke. The TG curve (Fig. 12 ) showed a weight loss of around 7% & two weight loss peaks at 350 °C & 570 °C were observed in the DTG curve. The pelletized catalyst exhibits significantly less deviation from the initial surface structure even after the reaction. However the surface morphology for the pelletized catalysts becomes more impact after the reaction due to the reduction in active surface area and average pore width due to sintering."
10,Effect of reforming temperature,"3.4 Effect of reforming temperature The effect of temperature on the molar H2 yield achieved with the monolithic and the pelletized catalysts is presented in Fig. 13 a and b respectively. The hydrogen yield obtained with the monolithic catalyst increases as the reforming is carried out at higher temperatures. This behavior can be attributed to the endothermic reforming reactions (Table 1: Reactions 1 and 2) and the decreasing carbon formation selectivity of the reaction system at higher temperatures. A hydrogen yield corresponding to 2.58 mol is obtained with the monolith catalyst geometry at 1023 K. The decline in the hydrogen yield with time on-stream can be attributed to the coke deposition over monolithic catalyst supported by the observed diffraction peak corresponding to graphitic carbon with hexagonal structure in the spent monolithic catalyst & the TG results. It should be noted that although the formation of graphitic carbon is thermodynamically unfavorable for the reaction conditions under study, the SEM micrograph & TGA results for the spent monolithic catalyst confirm the coke deposition selectivity. Such deviations between thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations have been reported in the literature by some investigators. Rostrup-Nielsen [42] explained that this behavior may be attributed to a structure disorder of carbon resulting in a higher surface energy. Manning et al. [43] and Bokx et al. [44,45] proposed the formation of an intermediate carbidic phase with different thermodynamic properties contributing to a minor carbon formation in equilibrium which could explain the weight loss peak observed at low temperature in the DTG curve (Fig.12). Therefore, the resulting carbon formation may be associated to the kinetic restrictions of the process or the hindered carbon gasification rate due to a competition between reactions generating and removing coke from catalyst [46]. For the pelletized catalyst, an increase in the reforming temperature from 823 K to 923 K improves the hydrogen yield but a further increase in the temperature from 923 K to 1023 K effectively suppresses the increase in H2 yield resulting in an approximate overlap of the yield curves at 823 K & 1023 K. Furthermore the drop in hydrogen yield is higher with the pellet geometry as compared with monolithic catalysts at the same temperature. The decrease in H2 yield with time on stream may be associated with the sintering of Ni particles driven by the additional surface energy associated with small particles. With sufficient activation, the smaller particles tend to reorganize to form larger particles, resulting in a decrease of surface free energy and more importantly, loss of active surface area as evident from a greater reduction in BET surface area for the pellet shaped catalysts as compared to the monolithic catalysts."
11,Effect of catalyst geometry,"3.5 Effect of catalyst geometry The product distributions achieved over the monolithic and the pelletized catalyst geometries are represented in Fig. 14 a and b respectively at a temperature of 1023 K. A uniform product distribution was observed over monolith catalyst with a steady state hydrogen content of 53 mol%. The hydrogen concentration observed over pelletized catalyst was initially higher along with a simultaneous decline in catalyst activity over time afterward. The fall in hydrogen concentration over monolithic catalyst is less as compared to the pellet geometry. The different product distributions over the two catalyst geometries might be associated with the dependence of the internal mass transfer phenomenon inside the catalyst on the catalyst geometry. A lower steady state H2 concentration in the product gas may be attributed to the internal mass transfer limitations due to the lower effective diffusivities of the reactant gases in the porous pellet shaped catalysts resulting in reduced reactant concentrations inside the active sites of the catalyst. Although it has been recognized in the past [47] that monoliths have excellent internal mass transfer characteristics because of thin walls & that the internal mass transfer resistance is lower than the external mass transfer resistance since the coat thickness is usually an order of magnitude lower than the hydraulic diameter, it is still imperative to ensure the absence of internal mass transfer limitations in monolithic catalysts [48] by the evaluation of Weisz–Prater Criterion. The thickness of the adsorbed catalyst layer onto the cordierite support was around 0.1 mm & the Weisz–Prater number was found to be 0.08 indicating that the internal mass transfer limitations in structured monolithic catalysts were negligible. Fig. 15 shows a comparison of the product distributions obtained over the monolithic and pelletized catalysts versus the thermodynamic values at a temperature equal to 1023 K. It can be observed that methane is absent from the product pool as per the thermodynamic calculations but a significant methane concentration is observed when the reforming experiments are carried out over the monolithic catalyst. The CO concentration observed during the catalytic test over monolithic catalyst is lower than that over pelletized catalyst and is comparable to the corresponding thermodynamic value at the same temperature. The lower CO concentration and the greater coke deposition with the monolithic catalyst geometry as evident from the XRD and SEM results can be attributed to the reversible CO disproportionation reaction (reaction 6) that can take place at a temperature of 600 °C over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [49]. The methane concentration observed with the pellet geometry is lower but the hydrogen content of the product is also lower at the expense of high CO concentration simultaneously. The higher methane content with the monolithic catalyst can be attributed to the reverse methane decomposition reaction (reaction 9) resulting in the hydrogenation of some carbon deposits forming methane. The steady state hydrogen content of the gaseous product obtained using the monolithic catalyst is closer to the thermodynamic concentration at equilibrium. Fig. 16 represents the comparison of the two catalyst geometries with thermodynamics on the basis of the steady state yield hydrogen yield at different temperatures. It is interesting to note that the monolithic catalyst shows increasing trends for the hydrogen yield with the reforming temperature. The higher efficiency of the monolith catalyst geometry for hydrogen production via steam reforming reaction in terms of the steady H2 yield can be ascribed to the enhanced metal-support interactions as evidenced by the XRD & TPR patterns. The advantage of the monolithic surface channels is that they function as a bundle of parallel single-pass reactors [50]. The lower surface area per unit volume ratio in case of pelletized catalyst geometry results in a lower reaction efficiency and correspondingly lower hydrogen yield."
12,Conclusions,The catalytic steam reforming of model bio-oil C2H5.13O1.43 for hydrogen production was investigated by carrying out studies over Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in two different geometries: monolith and pellet. The upper limit for the hydrogen yield at S/C ratio equal to 13 was found to be 4.98 with a stoichiometric limit of 5.13 mol from the thermodynamic analysis. The comparison of the two catalyst geometries by carrying out experiments at the optimal conditions determined using thermodynamic investigation showed that monolithic catalysts were much more selective to hydrogen production with a steady hydrogen yield of 50.29%(2.58 mol) at 1023 K. The higher activity of the monolithic catalysts was ascribed to the absence of internal mass transfer limitations and stronger metal-support interactions. The decline in catalytic activity was attributed to the coke deposition over monolithic catalysts and sintering with pelletized catalysts in correlation with the catalyst characterization results. Coke deposition was not detected with the pelletized catalysts either due to the selectivity of the employed catalyst to carbon formation or due to the heat transfer limitations of the reforming process implying that the ultimate equilibrium was never achieved. The comparison of the obtained product distribution with thermodynamics revealed a higher selectivity of the monolithic catalyst corresponding to a hydrogen content of 53% (volumetric basis) in the gaseous product.
