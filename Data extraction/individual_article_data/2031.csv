0,Introduction,"Tertiary alcohols are important structural subunits in chemical building blocks and common amongst biologically active compounds [1]. The additions of organometallic compounds of s-block elements (typically organolithium and Grignard reagents) to ketones or esters are among the most efficient and direct routes to accessing tertiary alcohols. At about this point, teaching textbooks are clear: highly polarized organometallic reagents need to be reacted at low temperature (often −78 °C), in aprotic solvents such as Et2O or THF, under a dry, inert atmosphere of argon or nitrogen, with the corresponding reactions usually coming to an end within a few hours [2]. As for the addition to esters, these reactions, once run under the aforementioned conditions, are sometimes plagued by the production of reduced secondary alcohols, and mixtures of ketones and carbinols can also be obtained, depending on the conditions employed (Scheme 1 a) [3]. The increasing awareness towards environmental pollution and climate changes has impelled research in organic synthesis to search for more environmentally responsible and less impactful solvents in place of toxic and often hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are known to account for about 80–90% of the total mass used in any organic reaction [4], thereby reshaping long-established paradigms [5]. In this vein, the past decade witnessed an explosive growth of applications of bio-based solvents [e.g., glycerol, ethyl lactate, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, γ-valerolactone] [6] and aqueous media [7] in several fields of chemistry. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) are among an emerging class of neoteric, nature-inspired designer solvents comprising at least one hydrogen bond donor and one hydrogen bond acceptor that, when mixed in a proper molar ratio, strongly associate with each other via hydrogen bond interactions, thereby forming an eutectic mixture with a melting point much lower than those of the individual components, and that of an ideal liquid mixture [8]. In addition, they are non-flammable, highly thermally stable, and characterized by low volatility. Recent independent ground-breaking studies by the groups of Hevia, García-Álvarez and Capriati have shown that s-block organometallic compounds are truly compatible with bio-inspired protic solvents like DESs, glycerol and even water [9]. Indeed, they have been successfully used to promote either the nucleophilic addition to carbonyl compounds [10], imines [11], styrene derivatives [12], amides [13], and nitriles [11b,14] or cross-coupling reactions with aryl halides under “on water” conditions [15]. On the basis of these precedents, our main aim was to investigate the addition of highly polarized organometallic compounds to esters in protic environmentally friendly reaction media to prepare valuable tertiary alcohols. Herein, we report that this nucleophilic addition takes place smoothly and cleanly working at room temperature (RT, 25 °C) and under air, thereby granting access to tertiary alcohols in up to 98% yield, with a broad substrate scope, and within 20 s reaction time (Scheme 1b). Comparison between water and DESs as reaction media as well as between organolithium and Grignard reagents in terms of reactivity have been provided and discussed. Additionally, this work also represented an opportunity for targeting a sustainable synthesis of S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC) and three of its derivatives, which are potent and selective inhibitors of the human kinesin Eg5, that has proven antitumor activity by preventing mitotic progression [16]."
1,Results and discussion,"We initiated our investigation using methyl benzoate (1a, 0.5 mmol) as the model substrate: 1 equivalent of n-BuLi (2.0 M in cyclohexane) was quickly spread throughout a suspension of 1a in water (1 mL) at RT under air, with vigorous stirring to generate an emulsion (vortex). After 20 s reaction time, the mixture was diluted with the environmentally friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) [17] (1 mL). An analysis of the crude mixture by GC-MS and 1H NMR revealed the formation of the desired tertiary alcohol 3a in 30% yield only. The precursor ketone 2a was still detected, but formed in less than 5% yield (Table 1 , entry 1). Pleasingly, alcohol 3a could be isolated in 98% yield as the sole product just by increasing the amount of n-BuLi up to 2.5 equivalents (Table 1, entries 2,3). Of note, upon replacing water with some prototypical choline chloride (ChCl)-based eutectic mixtures, namely ChCl/glycerol (Gly) (1:2 M ratio) and ChCl/urea (1:2), the effectiveness of this transformation was still maintained as 3a was isolated in 96–98% yield (Table 1, entries 4,5). A reaction yield of 95% was instead achieved in Gly when using it as the reaction medium (Table 1, entry 6). The chemistry of highly polar organometallic compounds in protic media has been recently discussed in a Concept article [9a]. Various studies have assessed the unusual kinetic stability exhibited by these reagents in the unique tridimensional hydrogen-bonding structure, which is common to both DESs and water. It is thought that this network can contribute in shielding the organometallic reagent from competitive protonolysis processes. The substrate scope of the reaction was evaluated next, by treating several functionalized esters with some typical, commercially available organolithium compounds either in water or in ChCl/urea as the representative eutectic mixture at RT and under air (Scheme 2 ). With regard to unsubstituted benzoate 1a, excellent yields (86–98%) of the desired alcohols (3a–3d) were obtained both in water and in ChCl/urea when it was reacted with either aliphatic or aromatic organolithium reagents (i-PrLi, n-BuLi, PhLi and 2-thienylLi). At this point, it is important to note that in all cases the formation of 3a-3d occurs chemoselectively with no side products observed in the crude reaction mixture. Substituted benzoates bearing electron-donating (Me, MeO, OH, Me2N) or electron-withdrawing (CN) groups at the ortho-, meta-, and para-positions (1b–1g) effectively participated as electrophilic partners as well, thereby providing in the reaction with both aliphatic (MeLi, EtLi, n-BuLi) and aromatic (PhLi) organolithium reagents the expected adducts 3e–3n in comparable range yields [water: 60–90%; ChCl/urea: 60–95%]. Again, it is important to highlight the high chemoselectivity of the studied process as we do not observe: i) metalation of activated benzylic position in benzoate 1d or ortho-lithiation processes in vicinal position to the methoxy group in benzoates 1b, 1c and 1f; or ii) competitive addition to nitrile group in benzoate 1g. An aliphatic ester like ethyl acetate (1h) also served as competent reaction partner, delivering alcohols 3o and 3p in 80–90% yield in the reaction with PhLi and n-hexylLi, respectively, in water or in DES. Encouraged by these initial findings, which glimpse the potential that water or ChCl/urea eutectic mixture have as green solvents for the chemoselective addition of organolithium reagents to esters under standard bench experimental techniques, we then assessed the scope of this methodology by extending our studies to a range of Grignard reagents. Under the best experimental conditions, upon switching organolithiums for organomagnesium reagents (e.g., MeMgCl, PhMgCl) as the nucleophilic partners, lower yields (75%) were observed in ChCl/urea in the synthesis of some representative alcohols like 3c, 3k and 3o. The latter, indeed, had been previously prepared in 85–98% yields when using the corresponding organolithium reagents (MeLi, PhLi) in DES. Benzoates 1a and 1b also underwent nucleophilic addition of MeMgCl and EtMgBr in ChCl/urea to afford tertiary alcohols 3q–3s in 75–95% yield. On the other hand, the reaction of Grignard reagents with esters in water proved to be ineffective. We propose that the large decrease in the polarity of the metal-carbon bonds in these commodity reagents (RMgX), when compared with organolithium compounds, may be the key to explain the experimentally observed decrease of activity when Grignard reagents are alternatively employed in water or in protic eutectic mixtures. The application of this method was then highlighted by the sustainable synthesis of S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC) (5a) and related analogues 5b–5d, which have been proven potent and selective inhibitor of human mitotic kinesin Eg5, that represents a novel mitotic spindle target for cancer chemotherapy (Scheme 3 ) [16a]. The above STLC derivatives are currently prepared in two steps including the synthesis of the intermediate trityl alcohols 3, and the reaction with l-cysteine (5a–5c) or cysteamine hydrochloride (5d), the latter performed in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the sole solvent. Tertiary aromatic alcohols 3, in turn, were furnished by exploiting a preliminary regioselective bromine-lithium exchange reaction with n-BuLi at −78 °C in THF for 1 h on the selected aryl bromide 4, followed by a nucleophilic addition to benzophenone. The reaction was then stirred for 4–6 h at −78 °C, then RT overnight (Scheme 3a). According to our protocol, by reacting benzoates 1a, 1d and 1f (0.5 mmol each) with PhLi (1.25 mmol) in ChCl/urea, at RT under air, the corresponding alcohols 3c, 3e and 3i were isolated in 75–98% yield, the reaction time being 20 s only. The isolated alcohols were finally suspended in ChCl/urea (1 g) in the presence of 0.2 mL TFA, and reacted with l-cysteine or cysteamine hydrochloride. After 2 h reaction time, the desired targets 5a–5d were isolated in 95–98% yield (overall yields for the two steps: 71–95%) (Scheme 3b). Finally, we decided to investigate a telescoped, one-pot tandem process for the preparation of STLC derivatives using water as the sole reaction medium, under aerobic conditions. These one-pot tandem protocols are attractive processes in the toolbox of synthetic chemistry for improving the economic efficiency of chemical reactions as they allow: i) the drastic reduction of isolation and purification steps of intermediates of reaction (thus minimizing both the generation of chemical waste and the required time and energy); and ii) the possibility to work with unstable reaction intermediates as no isolation of highly reactive and transitory species is needed [18]. To this end, benzoate 1a (0.5 mmol) was suspended in water (1.0 mL) and treated, at RT under air, with PhLi (2.5 equiv) under vigorous stirring. After 1 min, cysteamine hydrochloride (0.5 mmol) or l-cysteine hydrochloride (0.5 mmol) and TFA (0.2 mL) were sequentially added. After 2 h stirring at RT, the dropwise addition of an aqueous solution of NaOH (4 N) favored the precipitation of 5a (pH = 5–6) or 5d (pH = 9). The latter were isolated by filtration in both good yield (80–84%) and purity, with no need of column chromatography (Scheme 4 ) (see experimental part for details)."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, we have shown that the nucleophilic addition of organolithium reagents to esters can be conveniently carried out using bulk water or ChCl/urea, working under air and at RT. These reactions proceeded smoothly in such strongly hydrogen-bonded associated media, under heterogeneous conditions, and also very quickly (20 s reaction time), straightforwardly delivering tertiary alcohols in very good yields (60–98%). Similarly to other cases, they are thought to occur at the oil/water (or DES) phase boundary [9a,10d,11b]. Grignard reagents proved to be effective nucleophilic partners as well in ChCl/urea, though providing the desired alcohols in lower yields in comparison with organolithiums. The practicability of this methodology was demonstrated by the sustainable preparation of some S-trityl-l-cysteine derivatives, which are pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The latter could also be straightforwardly obtained via telescoped, one pot nucleophilic addition/thioetherification processes run in water starting from esters, through the tertiary alcohol intermediates, which allowed the isolation of the target molecule by filtration only. These results, which are in the footsteps of others [9–15], attest to the synthetic power, versatility and excellent performance of main group organometallic compounds when used in protic bio-based solvents under aerobic conditions. The adoption of these conditions is thus expected to have practical implications for synthetic organic chemistry, when reshaping other classical main-group-mediated transformations, which are traditionally carried out in VOC media."
3,Experimental section,"1H NMR,13C NMR were recorded on a Varian-Mercury 300 MHz or a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometers and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer 681 spectrometer. GC analyses were performed on a HP 6890 model, Series II by using a HP1 column (methyl siloxane; 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on pre-coated 0.25 mm thick plates of Kieselgel 60 F254; visualization was accomplished by UV light (254 nm) or by spraying a solution of 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate and 0.2% (w/v) cerium (III) sulfate in 100 mL 17.6% (w/v) aq. sulphuric acid and heating to 473 K until blue spots appeared. Chromatography was run by using silica gel 60 with a particle size distribution 40–63 μm and 230–400 ASTM. GC-MS analyses were performed on HP 5995C model. Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) or ethyl acetate (EtOAc) were used as the solvents in the work-up procedures. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses were performed using a Bruker microTOF QII mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI). Reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used without any further purification. Methyl 2,5-dimethoxybenzoate (1b) and methyl 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoate (1c) were prepared according to the reported procedure [19]. Reactions were carried out in deionized water (pH = 6.1, determined by pH meter 507 Crison). The following solutions of organolithium reagents were furnished by Albemarle (Germany) and were used with the following concentrations: n-BuLi, 2.0 M in cyclohexane; EtLi, 0.5 M in hexane; i-PrLi, 0.7 M in pentane; 2-thienylLi, 1.0 M in THF/hexane; MeLi, 1.6 M in Et2O; PhLi, 1.9 M in Bu2O. The following solutions of Grignard or organolithium reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used with the following concentrations: MeMgCl, 3.0 M in THF; EtMgBr, 3.0 M in Et2O; PhMgCl, 2.0 M in THF; n-hexylLi, 2.3 M in hexane. Full characterization data, including copies of 1H and 13C NMR spectra (see Supplementary Material), have been reported for both the newly synthesized (3d, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3j, 3m, 3n) and the known (3a, 3b, 3c, 3e, 3i, 3k, 3l, 3o, 3p, 3q, 3r, 3s, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d) compounds. The following abbreviations have been used to explain the multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, quin = quintuplet, sext = sextet, sep = septet, br s = broad singlet. Deep Eutectic Solvents [urea/choline chloride (ChCl) (2:1 mol/mol); glycerol (Gly)/ChCl (2:1 mol/mol)] were prepared by heating under stirring at 60–80 °C for 10–30 min the corresponding individual components until a clear solution was obtained. SAFETY NOTE: Organolithiums were handled under an inert atmosphere until they were mixed with a suspension of the substrate in water (or DES), under an air atmosphere and with vigorous magnetic stirring, whereupon they react quickly. No particular problems were experienced during the addition. Organolithiums, however, are notoriously prone to ignition in air, and caution should be exercised in adopting the recommended procedure, especially on a larger scale."
4,"Synthesis of aryl esters 1b, 1c. Typical procedure","4.1 Synthesis of aryl esters 1b, 1c. Typical procedure According to the procedure reported by Paquette [20], HCl 37% (1 mL) was carefully added to a solution of the corresponding benzoic acid derivative (15.6 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h. MeOH was removed under reduced pressure, and the reaction mixture was extracted with CPME (3.0 mL × 3). The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to give the methyl ester 1b or 1c without further purification."

Typical procedure in water In a 10 mL Schlenk-like flask, methyl benzoate 1a (68 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added under stirring to 1.0 mL of water at room temperature in air. A solution of PhLi in Bu2O (2.5 equiv, 0.63 mL of a 2 M solution), handled under argon using conventional Schlenk techniques, was rapidly spread over the mixture under air and with vigorous stirring at room temperature to generate an emulsion. After 1 min, cysteamine hydrochloride (56.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) or l-cysteine hydrochloride (78.81 mg, 0.5 mmol) and 0.2 mL of TFA were sequentially added to the reaction mixture, at room temperature under air. After additional stirring for 2 h at room temperature, an aqueous NaOH solution (4 N) was added dropwise in water up to pH of about 9 (for the synthesis of 5d) or pH of about 5–6 (for the synthesis of 5a). The resulting white precipitate was collected by filtration. The crude product was further washed with water (1.0 mL) and hexane (2.0 mL), and then dried to obtain 5a (from l-cysteine hydrochloride) as a white solid in 80% yield or 5d (from cysteamine hydrochloride) as a white solid in 84% yield [33]. Alternative work-up procedure for 5d : After stirring the whole mixture for 2 h at room temperature, an aqueous NaOH solution (4 N) was added dropwise in water up to a pH of about 9. The reaction mixture was then extracted three times with EtOAc (5 mL × 3). The resulting organic phase was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The crude was purified by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2/CH3OH 9:1; Rf 0.43) to provide the desired product 5d in 86% yield."
