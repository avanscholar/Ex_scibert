0,Introduction,"Industrialization, increasing population and limited availability of fossil fuels lead to the development of an alternative source of a renewable energy to fulfill the growing demand for energy. To develop a circular economy, it is indispensable to study and encourage long-term solutions to get rid of waste disposals, such as reuse and recovery. Sewage Sludge (SS) an unavoidable byproduct of the wastewater treatment comprised of various forms of heavy metals, pathogens and organic micro-pollutants [1]. In the near future, the disposal of sewage sludge should emphasize three major aspects i.e., resource recovery, least environmental issues, and less economic value. Some of the disposal techniques including gasification, combustion, and co-combustion along with other materials and its application in energy production to building materials, pyrolysis etc. have been investigated deeply [2–5]. The available techniques which aid in maximum energy recovery from sewage sludge will lead the future trend of development [6,7]. Compared to other available technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) found feasible for sludge volume reduction, production of nutrients rich compost and capture of energy in the form of biogas. Biogas as an energy cogeneration system could meet the current energy demand for electricity and heat production based on the renewable resource having a high potential [8,9]. Recently, it has been pointed out that bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) could have the ability to promote carbon oxidation on the anode and in-site CO2 capture and reduction on the cathode, thus providing additional CH4 formation in an integrated anaerobic digestion (AD) system [10,11]. BESs have considerably boomed over the past decade for their contribution as an emerging sustainable technology for concurrent electricity production and wastewater treatment [12]. It is well known that methane is synthesized by hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis from simple carbon sources, including CO2 type substrate, methyl-type and acid-type substrate (acetate) [13,14]. The technical and economic aspects must be evaluated to choose the most appropriate technology [15]. The recently developed BES uses bioelectrochemical reactions to promote the degradation of high strength organic wastes, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), toxic compounds along with non-degradable organic matter for higher biogas production in an anaerobic digester [16]. CH4 formation through “electro-methanogenesis” was proposed using methanogens as biocathodic catalyst to reduce CO2 into CH4 based on the following reactions [17]: Anode: acetate - + 2 H 2 O - - - - - - 2 CO 2 + 8 H + + 8 e - E ∘ ≈ − 0.2 ( NHE ) Cathode: CO 2 8 H + + 8 e - - - - - - - - CH 4 + 2 H 2 O E ∘ ≈ − 0.44 ( NHE ) However, products recovered on cathode would trigger AD process to methane production from CO2 reduction in different energy-flow pathways [18]. The external energy potential is required for the driving of free energy of the reaction for hydrogen at the cathode [19] based on following redox reactions in the MECs system at the requirement of practical voltages > 0.3 V to overcome electrode overpotentials. Anode: CH 3 COO - + 4 H 2 O → HCO 3 - + 9 H + 8 e - E anode = - 0.279 V Cathode: 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 Hythane, a mixture of methane and hydrogen is an emerging alternative fuel, which can be transported and stored using current natural gas infrastructure [20]. The small blending of H2 (10–25%) in methane to the hythane gas can greatly enhance the combustion rate and extend the lean limit of combustion, making it a promising fuel to improve the efficiency of methane-fueled vehicles [21–23]. Recently, Call and Logan [24] designed a single-chambered MEC bioreactor having lower internal resistance to produce a higher flow rate of hydrogen gas as compared to other MEC [25,26]. The residual biomass exceeds approximately 220 billion tons worldwide [27], and this untreated biomass residues in the environment can be detrimental [28]. The MECs as an alternative technology can produce hydrogen from waste, renewable materials [29], and from a wide range of simple and complex organic substrates [30]. Therefore, in the present study, a single-chambered MEC reactor was designed to evaluate the production of hydrogen and methane at higher organic loading (Solid State digestion) of sewage sludge co-digested with agricultural waste and food waste at different applied voltages."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental design and reactor operation,"2.1 Experimental design and reactor operation In the present study, Sewage sludge (SS) was used as a nutrients source and Food Waste (FW) and Agricultural Waste (AW) as substrates. The primary SS was collected from the domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Khodiyar, Gandhinagar. The FW, comprised of residues of cooked food i.e., dal, rice, chapatti, cooked vegetables, chicken, poha, idli, salad, eggshells, bone pieces etc. was collected from the Sector-30, Campus Canteen of Central University of Gujarat, Gandhinagar (Gujarat). The undigestible components such as eggshells, plastic bags, polythene, bone pieces were segregated from the waste. The digestible waste was finely pulverized to get a homogeneous representative sample. AW (Wheat straw) was collected from the nearby agricultural field of Pethapur village, Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The dried Wheat straw was pulverized to ≤2 mm using the grinder and was stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C in plastic bags. The substrates (FW, SS, and AW) were characterized (Table 1 ) individually as per standard methods (mentioned in the analytical section). The experiments were carried out in 130 ml serum bottles in triplicates. 25 ml of active mesophilic inoculum maintained at 37 ± 1 °C was added to serum bottles followed by the addition of a feasible amount of FW and AW slurry prepared in 25 ml of SS. The reactors containing slurry and inoculum were purged with N2 having 99.99% purity for 4–5 min and then sealed with rubber septa and aluminum caps followed by drawn of 30 ml headspace air. Thereafter, the serum bottles were placed in the water bath at 57 ± 1 °C. Volumetric biogas formation was measured by a 60 ml glass syringe at an interval of 24 h. The bio-electrolysis effect on methanogenesis was investigated in a 130 ml batch reactor (Fig. 1 ) as previously designed by Prajapati and Singh [31]. The Graphite electrodes of the batch reactor were made and available by S.D. Industries Ahmedabad (Gujarat). The diameter of the graphite electrode was 5 mm and the length was kept to 2.5 cm. To increase the working efficiency, electrodes were activated in a muffle furnace (SONAA, 220–230V AC) at 500 °C for 1 h."
3,Co-digestion experiments,"2.2 Co-digestion experiments The co-digestion ratio of 5:1 (AW: FW) was pre-optimized in earlier experiments. In the present study, the ratio of AW and FW (5:1) was maintained, whereas the concentrations of the wastes were increased 4 times (20:4), to evaluate the effect of higher wastes loading on product formation. Based on optimized conditions five reactors sets named as R-20, R-40, R-80, R-120, and R-CONT were prepared. The reactor R-20 was operated at 20 mV, R-40 at 40 mV, R-80 at 80 mV, R-120 at 120 mV with bio-electro fermentation and the reactor R-CONT was operated without electrolysis for 16 days."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The reagents used in the experimentation were prepared in double-distilled water using analytical reagent (AR) grade chemicals. Different physicochemical characteristics such as COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), TS (Total Solids), VS (Volatile solids), Ammonia, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and Total alkalinity of the sewage sludge, substrates, and inoculum were analyzed according to the standard methods [32]. At the end of the experiments the samples were harvested from the serum bottles and preserved at 4 °C, whenever required. Further, the harvested samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm to collect the supernatant. For the analysis of ammonical nitrogen (NH4 +-N), Double Beam Spectrophotometer (Dynamica HOLO DB-20 UV-VIS) was used. Cellulase enzyme activity was analyzed according to the methodology suggested by Ghose [33]. Initially, the gas production was measured at a time interval of 12 h for initial 2 samplings and thereafter it was measured at an interval of 24 h. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) present in the residual liquid were analyzed by Gas Chromatograph- Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) (PerkinElmer 680) using Elite-WAX capillary column (length 30 m and ID 0.32 mm). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 6.0 ml/min. Initially, the oven was maintained at 95 °C for 5 min; then increased to 140 °C at 10 °C/min holding for 6 min and finally increased to 200 °C at 40 °C/min, and it was held for 5 min. Split injector mode was applied at 7:3. Before GC analysis, the samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant collected was diluted 10 times with double distilled water and samples were acidified to pH 2–3 using Ortho-phosphoric acid. The samples were filtered through a syringe filter using 0.2 μm membranes (Dia. 25 mm). 0.5 μl of the sample was injected using an auto-injector for analysis. A series of VFAs standards calibration curve were prepared from Volatile Free Acid mix 10 mM (Sigma Aldrich) aqueous solution of acids: Formic acid, Acetic acid, Propionic acid, Isobutyric acid, Butyric acid, Isovaleric acid, Valeric acid, Isocaproic acid, Hexanoic acid, and n-Heptanoic acid in the range of 0.5–5 mM. The following metrics were used for the investigations with respect to the amounts and relative proportions of VFAs products [34]: i. Total molar concentration (total mM) of alkyl groups, expressing the sum of all methyl and methylene groups in VFAs. Total alkyl groups (mM) = C2 + (2 x C3) + (3x C4) + (4 xC5) + (5xC6), where Cx corresponds to mM concentration of VFA of the total carbon number x; ii. Average VFA chain length = (total mM alkyl groups/total mM VFA) + 1, where the 1 represents the non-energetic carbon (carboxyl group) of the VFA molecule."
5,Gas composition measurement,"2.4 Gas composition measurement Gas composition was analyzed using Gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer Clarus 680) equipped with the Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and Elite-Plot Q column (30.0 m length x 0.53 mm ID). The temperature of the injector and detector were maintained at 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min and finally makeup to 20 ml. Initially, the oven was kept at 35 °C for 3 min and the temperature was increased to 90 °C at the rate of 40 °C/min by holding for 1.5 min. 50 μl of the sample was injected using 100 μl airtight syringe. The concentration of the gases was calculated using standard plots containing a mixture of CH4, H2, CO2, and H2S. Hydrogen production was observed in all the bioelectrolysis (R-20, R-40, R-80, and R-120) as well as in control (R-CONT) reactors; however, the methane production was detected only in the R-120 and R-CONT reactors."
6,Kinetic modeling of hydrogen and methane production,"2.5 Kinetic modeling of hydrogen and methane production The kinetics of the product formation for the description and assessment of the cumulative biogas was conceded by fitting the experimental results of biogas production to various kinetic equations. The production rate and cumulative production in bio-electrolysis reactors and control reactors were simulated. Models Equation [35] First Order kinetic model P=Po[1-exp(-kt)].…… …. Logistic model C = a/(1+bexp(-kt)) Richard model C = a∗ (1+(d-1)∗exp(-k∗x-xc))^(1/(1-d)) Gompertz model C = a∗ exp(-exp(-k∗(x-xc))) Where. First order kinetic model- Po is the maximum biogas yield (ml); k (day−1) is the biogas production rate constant (ml) and t is the incubation time (days). Logistic and Richard models- C is cumulative gas production (ml/h); k is kinetic constant (day−1); t is hydraulic retention time (days); a and b are the constants. Gompertz model- C is cumulative gas production (ml/h); a is ultimate gas production potential, exp is exponential (1); d and k are constants. The experimental results of biogas production obtained from different bioreactors were applied to check the suitability of different models. Unsing the Origin Pro-2018 software (Learning Edi.) non-linear regression method was adopted for curve fitting and analysis of different kinetic parameters used in First order, Gompertz, Richard and Logistic kinetic models."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Hydrogen and methane production at different applied voltages,"3.1 Hydrogen and methane production at different applied voltages The effect of the variable voltages on the cumulative biogas, hydrogen and methane production is presented in Fig. 2 . The maximum biogas production of 283.75 ± 22.27 ml was observed in reactor R-20, at an applied voltage of 20 mV, whereas the lowest biogas production of 211.5 ± 4.24 ml was observed in the reactor R-120. The highest cumulative hydrogen production to 38.25 ± 0.02 ml/gCOD was observed in the reactor R-80, which was approximate, 1.8 folds higher than the R-CONT. The increased voltage supply from 20 mV to 80 mV to the reactors enhances the hydrogen production, whereas at 120 mV sharp decreased in cumulative hydrogen production (22.45 ± 0.03 ml/g COD) was observed. The lowest hydrogen production in the R-120 may be due to the chain elongation (Long Chain Fatty Acids formation) i.e., valeric acid as well as the diversion of the electrons flux towards the methanogenesis. Similarly, the observation of other research groups inferred that when macromolecule acid-like valeric acid was the main component of sludge fermentation liquid (SFL), the batch reaction time became longer, and growth of methanogens made more methane production to cause hydrogen loss [36]. The accumulation of propionic acids synthesis favored by the bioelectrolysis may also inhibit the methanogenesis. Similarly, in another study accumulation of propionic acid, the most sensitive inhibiting factor hardly used by methanogens also favored under thermophilic conditions [37]. Due to ohmic and other losses at the two electrodes, a voltage higher than 0.3 V is typically needed to generate hydrogen under practical, biologically relevant conditions [19,38]. However, the production of the hydrogen at the lesser external potential supplied than the required (<0.3V) is the indication of the innovative approach for the development of culture for bio-hydrogen generation. Interestingly methane production of 6.13 ± 0.01 ml/gCOD and 7.67 ± 0.0 ml/gCOD was observed in R-CONT and R-120 bioelectrolysis reactors respectively. These findings clearly indicated that in the R-CONT reactor the methanogens, i.e., competitors of the hydrogen-producing microbes were able to maintain their growth. Further methane production at the higher applied voltage (120 mV), very close to the theoretical value required to facilitates the hydrogen production directly from the biomass/intermediate products. In the R-CONT, hydrogen production was observed from 1st to 5th day and the methane production started on the 6th day which lasted until to end of the experiment (Fig. 3 ). Similarly in R-120 the hydrogen production starts from 1st day and continues to 7th day and methane production begins from the 6th day which lasts till the end of the experiment. Almost similar but different potential trends of biogas production rates (ml/day) were observed at different applied voltages. In all the anaerobic digesters coupled with bioelectrolysis an increase in the production rate was observed, however, 24 h onwards starts decreasing after reaching its peak point except in the digester (R-CONT), where a continuous decrease is recorded from the 1st day of digestion. The highest hydrogen production peak (80.8 ml/day) was observed in R-80, having 80 mV of voltage supply on the second day of incubation, followed by 40 mV, 120 mV, 20 mV, and Control respectively. Interestingly the present MECs systems were sufficiently able to reduce the methane production in R-20, R-40, and R-80 anaerobic reactors. Similarly in another study, using cellulose as a substrate and rice paddy soil as an inoculum, methanogens were found to be suppressed when a specific design was used [39]."
9,Variation in liquid phase components,"3.2 Variation in liquid phase components Anaerobic digestion of complex substrates is not easier but once solubilized they are converted into sugars, long-chain fatty acids and amino acids which further breakdown into short-chain fatty acids. The spectrum of the different volatile fatty acids present in digestate at different applied voltages is shown in Fig. 4 . The major VFAs detected during AD were iso-butyric acid, valeric acid, propionic acid and acetic acid. The total concentration of organic acids was above 200 mM, which was mainly due to the higher organic loading of the substrate under thermophilic conditions. Accumulation of VFAs might be due to the variation in temperature, overloading of the substrate, toxic compounds etc. [40]. The increasing voltage supply increased the accumulation of the VFAs to 229.0 mM, 241.52 mM, 283.12 mM, 282.23 mM and 298.10 mM in R-CONT, R-20, R-40, R-80, and R-120 respectively. Maximum VFAs accumulated in the bioelectrolysis digester at 120 mV was 1.3 folds higher than the R-CONT. The increase in the voltage supply triggered a sharp increase in the concentrations of iso-butyric and valeric acids. This accumulation of the VFAs with increasing voltage supply was due to the polymerization to form long-chain fatty acids. Though, the highest average chain length of 4.362 and the shortest chain length of 4.234 were observed in the R-CONT. and R-80 reactors respectively. The highest average VFAs chain length was because of the production/accumulation of the iso-caproic acid, hexanoic acid and n-heptanoic acids. Whereas, n-heptanoic acids production/accumulation was not detected, as well as the levels of the iso-caproic acid and hexanoic acid, were also very lesser in the reactors with electrolysis only. The elevated level of the valeric acid was favored by the increasing voltage supply, indicating the increase in the polymerization with an increase in voltage supply. Isomerization of butyric acid was also favored in the bioelectrolysis reactors. The highest numbers of the alkyl groups associated with VFAs were found in the R-120 reactor. According to reaction conditions, the propionic acid is a crucial intermediate in the chain elongation to valeric acid [41]. Despite having the lowest level of the VFAs, pH observed in the R-CONT. was 5.40 ± 0.12, whereas it ranges from 5.43 ± 0.20 to 5.77 ± 0.19 in the reactors with voltage supply. Agler [42] reported that at acidic pH, acetic acid and long-chain fatty acids (propionic acid and butyric acid) are the primary dominant fermentation products. But in our study, the accumulation of propionic acid and iso-butyric acid were reported at higher pH in the reactors with bioelectrolysis. The lesser level of the propionic acid, a hardy utilized acid by the methanogens, in the R-120 reactor, among the bioelectrolysis recators suggesting that microbial electrolysis existed in the MECs. Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is the most significant parameter of anaerobic digestion and nitrogen content observed was 783.07 ± 8.55 mg/L (20 mV); 762.53 ± 8.55 mg/L (40 mV); 566.53 ± 5.83 mg/L (80 mV) and 594.53 ± 7.05 mg/L (120 mV) at different voltage supply and 475.05 ± 13.81 mg/L in without voltage supply (R-CONT). The higher level of TKN in bioelectrolysis reactors indicates that the degradation of proteins was favored by applied voltages. This is also supported by the higher level of the valeric acids, the product of the degradation of the protein’s rich food waste in the reactors. Similarly, in the other study also the higher concentration of valeric and iso-valeric acid found may be due to the degradation of proteinaceous content [43] favored at a thermophilic temperature [44]. Anaerobic fermentation of nitrogenous rich substrate due to protein degradation leads to the formation of ammonia (Table 2 ). The ammonia concentration in the anaerobic digester (41.78 ± 16.49 mg/l) and digester coupled with bioelectrolysis varies from 43.51 ± 17.05 to 77.18 ± 38.55 mg/l, respectively, which was too much low than the range of 1.7–14 g/l concentration as reported by Chen [45] causing 50% decrease in methane production. Interestingly, the lowest concentration of 9733.33 ± 2052.64 mg/l of s-COD was observed in R-120 without yielding enough hydrogen and methane, inferring the maximum amount of organic matter degradation, further indicating the electrons flux maybe diverted to microbes other than methanotrophs or hydrogenotrophs. Various studies also reported that the application of bioelectrochemical system (MEC) not only enhances the removal efficiency of highly concentrated organic waste, VFAs but also enhances the biogas production via bioelectrochemical reactions [46–48]. The highest level of the residual glucose as substrate availability and consumption rates were monitored by the dissolved glucose contents as an indicator; however, this was not the only carbon source."
10,Cellulase activity,"3.3 Cellulase activity The highest cellulase enzyme activity of 461.80 μMol/min and 459.09 μMol/min were observed in R-CONT and R-80 (Table 2). However, the highest specific cellulase activity was observed in the R-CONT., whereas the lowest specific activity was observed in R-20. Despite having the highest cellulase activity in R-CONT, the reactor shows a lesser level of the residual glucose as an available substrate. The hydrolysis step is the rate-limiting step for the conversion of the lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels. The sugar-degradation products such as 2-furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; lignin-degradation products such as aromatic aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and acids; hemicellulose deacetylation products such as acetate from pretreatment conversion in MECs is specifically important due to their recalcitrant and inhibitory nature within the fermentation process [29]. On the other hand, the bioelectrolysis reactors having a lesser level of the cellulase activities were able to maintain the level of the residual glucose as well as elevated hydrogen production. Moreover, another highest benefit of bioelectrolysis in co-digestion was to overcome the limiting steps maybe by reducing inhibitory effects on microorganisms or helping in the hydrolysis of the substrate. The reason behind might be the variable external voltage, affect the microbial population. Similarly, in other groups study the mixed organics were converted to electrons in MECs, indicating that cascaded utilization of sludge fermentative liquid was regulated according to components of VFAs in different waste activated sludge (WAS) pretreatment [49]. However, the enzymatic specific activity was loosed with increasing reaction temperature from 55 °C to 75 °C. The highest loss in cellulase specific activity at 75 °C from all the reactors may be the due to mesophilic adapted microbial populations."
11,Kinetic modeling of hydrogen and methane production at variable voltages,"3.4 Kinetic modeling of hydrogen and methane production at variable voltages The results obtained for hydrolysis rate constant (k) for cumulative biogas production were presented in Table 3 . The first-order kinetic model assumes that the rate-limiting step of anaerobic digestion is the substrate hydrolysis [35]. Higher R2 values ranging from 0.9408 to 0.9822 at different applied voltages also confirm the highest degradability of the co-digestion of the substrate used. Maximum hydrolysis rate, k (0.4477) observed was at 20 mV followed by 0.3646 (40 mV), 0.3550 (80 mV), 0.1672 (120 mV) and control (0.2944). Higher values of k, at different applied voltages 20–80 mV promoted the substrate degradation rates and thereby biogas production. With an increase in the voltage supply, a decrease in the hydrolysis rate constant (k) was observed. The rate constant, k describes the velocities of degradation and biogas production [50]; therefore, higher k value represents rapid degradation and biogas production rates. Lower values of the rate constant at 120 mV might be due to the highest concentrations of VFAs. Tables 3 and 4 show the kinetic parameters obtained from Richard, Logistic and Gompertz models of cumulative methane and hydrogen production along with error functions (RMSE and NRMSE). Figs. 5 and 6 showed the experimental and predicted values of cumulative hydrogen and methane production at different applied voltages as suggested by different models. The predicted R2 and adjusted R2 values for H2 and CH4 production at supplied voltage also indicate the suitability of the model to the experimental data. It was found that the experimental cumulative data of hydrogen and methane production was nearly equivalent to the predicted data as analyzed by different models. In the case of cumulative hydrogen production, the experimental data vs predicted data plots formed a simple curve shape from the first day of production (Figs. 5 and 6), whereas the plotted curves shapes of cumulative methane production follow a sigmoid pattern (Figs. 5A and 6A). Error functions RMSE and NRMSE were used to minimize the differences between the different models for the best fit model. Higher R2 values and lower RMSE and NRMSE functions values of Richard, Logistic and Gompertz models aid in comparing the quality of best fit (Table 4). From the error functions, it was concluded that the Richard model best fitted the experimental data for cumulative hydrogen production at different voltages and cumulative methane production at 120 mV supply along with control."
12,Conclusion,"The present study investigated the effect of different applied voltages on the production of hydrogen and methane under thermophilic conditions in MECs reactors. The VFAs metrics indicated that the highest numbers of the alkyl groups associated with VFAs were found in the R-120 reactor. The highest average chain length of 4.362 and the shortest chain length of 4.234 were observed in the R-CONT and R-80 reactors respectively. At an applied voltage of 80 mV maximum hydrogen production was observed which was 1.8-fold higher than the control. Along with hydrogen small amount of methane was also observed in R-CONT and reactor (R-120) coupled with bioelectrolysis at an applied voltage of 120 mV. The higher methane was produced at 120 mV in comparison to R-CONT. The methanogenesis was inhibited in reactors having a voltage supply with 20 mV, 40 mV and 80 mV. Among the VFAs produced, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid and valeric acid were found in dominant concentrations. The kinetic study of cumulative hydrogen and methane production reveals the best fitted was Richard model according to the RMSE and NRMSE error functions."
