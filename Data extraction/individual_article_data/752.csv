0,Introduction,"With the gradual exhaustion of fossil fuel resources and the prominent problem of environmental pollution, the search for new alternative energy has aroused widespread concern [1–4]. Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) through coal, natural gas, or renewable biomass via syngas has become a research hotspot [5,6], while this process is usually restricted by the low selectivity to higher alcohols and the poor stability of the catalyst. Four major types of catalyst systems have reported for HAS included Rh based catalysts [7,8], Mo-based catalyst [9], modified methanol synthesis catalysts [10,11], and modified F–T synthesis catalyst [12]. Among them, Rh based catalysts have better selectivity of C2+OH alcohol, but industrialization of Rh was limited due to resource scarcity and the high price [13]. Although Mo-based have high sulfur resistance, the catalytic reaction requires harsh terms and sulfide impurities in the reactants [5,9]. Harsh operation condition and methanol as the main product was not conducive to the practical application of modified methanol synthesis catalysts [14]. Therefore, the modified F–T synthesis catalyst with mild reaction conditions has attracted increasing attention. Cu-Fe based catalyst as a modified F–T catalyst, which combines methanol with F–T active center with high selectivity to C2+OH moderate reaction conditions, is one of the catalysts most promising development prospects [15,16]. Although a lot of research have been devoted on the development of Cu-Fe based catalysts, several problems have not been well solved: catalyst deactivation, low alcohol yield, deficient selectivity, and complex mixtures of reaction products [17]. For bimetallic or polymetallic catalysts, the uniform distribution and the distance of the active material are the key factors to determine the activity and selectivity. One pathway to improve the catalytic performance of Cu-Fe based catalysts is to introduce the appropriate supports. Up to now, traditional supports, such as SiO2 [18], ZnO [19], layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [20] and CNTs [21] have been used to enhance the hydrogenation performance of catalyst CO due to the interaction between metal and carrier and the combination of chemical adsorption. Zhang et al. [4] reported that the CO conversion rate, total alcohol selectivity and C2+OH selectivity of Cu-Fe/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the plasma system were all higher than conventional Cu-Fe catalysts in CO hydrogenation. Lu et al. [17] prepared Cu-Fe/SiO2 catalyst through treating SiO2 with ammonia, and found that Si−OH on the carrier surface could promote the generation of C2+OH. Sun et al. [14] compared CO hydrogenation performance of Cu-Fe/SiO2 catalysts prepared by ultrasonic assisted impregnation, deposition-precipitation, solid-state impregnation, solid-state chemical reaction and citric acid combustion, and found that Cu-Fe/SiO2 catalysts prepared by ultrasonic-assisted impregnation have high dispersion and better catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation. Based on the above analysis, the introduction of suitable support is the most effective way to improve the activity and stability of Cu-Fe based catalysts HAS. Recently, porous silicas have been reported as suitable supports for HAS catalysts due to its high specific surface area, eco-friendly, inexpensive, high hydrothermal stability and highly porous. SBA-15 [22], MCM-41 [23] and so on jumbo size (∼μm) supports have been generally used in the research of CO hydrogenation to synthetic higher alcohol. Ding et al. [24] recently discovered that Cu-Fe was supported with the high dispersion and the high diffusion efficiency of the active metal sites in the double peak pore structure, and showed efficient catalytic activity and high selectivity of C2+OH. Many researchers used Co and Fe supported on SBA-15 as a catalyst for F–T synthesis, and the obtained catalysts had relatively narrow size distribution, which improve the activity and selectivity [25,26]. However, the large size of the support result in the aggregation of nanoparticles which affects the activity of the catalyst [21,27]. Previously, we prepared hierarchical hollow silica spheres (HHSS) with small hollow nanospheres @large hollow sphere structure, high specific surface area, and better thermal stability, which makes it as an excellent catalyst support [28]. We have conducted many researches based on HHSS. Many catalysts, including Ag3PO4/HHSS [29], TiO2/BiOCl@HHSS [30], Ag-AgBr@HHSS [31], Pd/HHSS [32], Fe3O4@HHSS [33], and HPW-NH2−HHSS [34] have been synthesized and showed efficient catalytic activity. However, finding a porous carrier with appropriate size for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas is still remained a focus of scientist attentions. Furthermore, for all we know, Cu-Fe bimetallic nanoparticles anchored on nano-sized HHSS for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas has not been reported. Herein, we developed a series of CuxFey@HHSS composites with different rate of Cu/Fe by a simple ultrasound-assisted impregnation method. In order to elucidate impact of structure on performance, the prepared catalyst was characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron Spectra (XPS), N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The results show that the CuxFey@HHSS catalysts still maintain the small hollow nanospheres @large hollow sphere structure and the Cu-Fe bimetallic nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the HHSS surface. The catalyst showed high CO hydrogenation performance and stability. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the process of the catalyst reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first time hierarchical hollow structure nano-catalyst was applied for HAS."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, AR), ethanol (AR) and ammonia solution (28 wt.%) were purchased from Sinopharma Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China; n-octane(C8H18, AR), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, AR) were from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory, China; Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, AR), and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3, AR) were purchased from Aladdin; Ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm) was used as solvent for all reagents. All chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation,"2.2 Preparation 2.2.1 The preparation process of HHSS As reported previously [28], the hierarchical hollow silica sphere (HHSS) was synthesized through single micelle template method. In a typical process, 1.38 g CTAB was dissolved in 66 mL deionized water and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10 min. After the addition of 14 mL ammonia solution (1 mol·L−1), continue to stir for 10 min, and then add 20 mL C8H18 to the above solution. 7.2 mL TEOS was added drop by drop, stirring continuously for 30 min. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min and then transferred to 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for heat treatment at 100 °C for 24 h under autogenous pressure. The obtained solid samples were washed several times with ethanol-water, filtered and separated, and air-dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The synthesized samples were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h to remove CTAB and other organic components. 2.2.2 The synthesis of catalysts A facile ultrasonic-assisted co-impregnation approach for CuFe@HHSS Catalyst synthesis was shown in Fig. 1 . In brief, a certain amount of HHSS was impregnated in the solution of different amounts of Cu(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 and placed at room temperature for 5 h after ultrasonic-assisted treatment (30 °C, 40 Hz, 120 W)for 1 h. The obtained samples were placed to dry in the oven at 100 °C overnight, the resulting solids were calcined at 450 °C for 4 h in a tubular furnace. The final products with different Cu-Fe contents are designated as CuxFey@HHSS, where x and y represent the percentage of the mass of copper and iron (Omitted if x and y were 1), and the total mass fraction of copper and iron is 20 wt%. The CuFe@HHSS-CP catalyst was prepared through co-precipitation method. In a typical process, a certain amount of HHSS was impregnated in the solution of Cu(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3, then 1 mol·L−1 of NaOH solution was added to adjust the pH = 7−8. After stirring vigorously for 4 h, the samples was filtered, washed and dried under 100 °C overnight. The finally resulting solids were calcined at 450 °C for 4 h in a tubular furnace and the catalyst was obtained and denoted as CuFe@HHSS-CP. The CuFe catalyst was prepared through co-precipitation method. In a typical process, Cu(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 according to the mole ratio of 1:1 were dissolved in deionized water, with 0.5 mol·L−1 ammonia solution pH adjustment to 7. After stirring vigorously for 4 h, the samples was aged for 6 h, then filtered, washed and dried under 100 °C overnight. The finally resulting solids were calcined at 450 °C for 4 h in a tubular furnace and the CuFe catalyst was obtained."
4,Sample characterization,"2.3 Sample characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscope to observe the morphology of the samples, which were treated with Au sputtered. The crystallinity and phase structure of the catalyst were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology, which was recorded on a Bruker D8 advance instrument. The Cu Kα radiation source(γ=0.15406 nm) voltage and current are 40 kV and 40 mA. Tow theta angle(2θ) ranged from 10° to 70° with a scanning rate of 10°s−1. BET specific surface areas (SBET), pore volumes (VP) and average pore diameters (DP) of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP instruments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the change in the surface composition using instrument Thermo Fisher equipped with K-Alpha, all binding energies were referenced to C1s of 284.6 eV. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out in a quartz micro-reactor. Firstly, 50 mg of the prepared catalyst was pre-treated at 300 °C in N2 for 1 h before a TPR measurement. During the TPR experiment, H2/N2 mixture gas with V H 2 / V N 2 = 1:9 was used at 50 mL/ min and the temperature was ramped from 50 to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, while the effluent gas was analyzed with a TCD."
5,Catalyst performance test,"2.4 Catalyst performance test The catalyst performance was tested in a stainless steel fixed-bed microreactor with a length of 550 mm and an internal diameter of 8 mm. The fresh catalyst (0.5 g) was anchored between quartz wool and axially centered in the reactor tube, with the temperature monitored by a thermocouple close to the catalyst bed. Before the reaction, the catalyst was heated to 300 °C (3 °C/min) and reduced with a H2/N2 mixture (50 mL/min, V H 2 / V N 2 = 1:9) for 6 h at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was then cooled down and the reaction started as gas flow was switched to an H2/CO mixture (30 mL/min, V H 2 / V C O = 2:1) at 4 M P. The gas hourly space velocity was set to 5000 h−1, and the reaction was conducted for 12 h at 300 °C.The products were analyzed for both oxygenates and hydrocarbons on-line by Agilent 7820A GC. The gas product of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 was separated on-line using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, TDX-01 3mm*3 m).The hydrocarbons and liquid product were analyzed with a flame ionization detector (FID, SE-30 30mm*Ф0.32*0.5 μm) The CO conversation(XCO) and the product selectivity(Si) were computed according to the following equation [35]: X C O = C O i n - C O o u t C O i n × 100 % S i = n i M i ∑ n i M i × 100 % COin and COout represent the mole’ s fraction of CO in the inlet and outlet gases, respectively; Where ni represents the number of carbon atoms in the product i (hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide, alcohol), Mi is the percentage of moles of carbon monoxide in the feed."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure of catalysts,"3.1 Morphology and structure of catalysts To observe the morphology and structure of the catalysts, the CuFe@HHSS composites were analyzed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 , HHSS was composed of spherical particles with diameters of 90 ∼ 150 nm [32]. The CuFe@HHSS catalyst maintains the morphology of HHSS (Fig. 2a, c) with small hollow silica nanospheres @ large ball structure (Fig. 2a and c). The shell of the large hollow ball was composed of small hollow balls (−20 nm) covered by the outer wall and most of the hollow balls remain spherical with smooth and complete surfaces. No large particles were observed in Fig. 2d and e, which indicate that copper oxide and iron oxide are evenly distributed on HHSS, and smaller copper oxide and iron oxide particles are embedded in the thin wall of HHSS and well dispersed in the channels. The HRTEM image of CuFe@HHSS catalyst (Fig. 2f) shows the presence of highly dispersed copper and iron oxide on HHSS of 2−5 nm. In addition, the spacing of lattice stripes are 0.23 nm and 0.25 nm, which are attributed to the crystal plane of highly dispersed CuO (111) and the crystal plane of CuFe2O4 (211) [37], respectively. The TEM elements mapping of CuFe@HHSS catalyst are shown in Fig. 3 , in which the Cu, Fe, Si and O elements are well dispersed on the catalyst. All elements are well distributed on HHSS without obvious aggregation. Energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) provides visual information of element distribution in CuFe@HHSS catalyst. The EDS spectrum of CuFe@HHSS catalyst (Fig. 3b) shows that the molar ratio of Cu: Fe estimated from the peak area approximately is 1:1.1 and the content of Cu and Fe in CuFe@HHSS are 8.16 wt% and 9.28 wt%, respectively. This result is close to that of the standard stoichiometric composition of CuFe @HHSS catalyst (with the Cu: Fe mass ratio of 1: 1).The XRD patterns of HHSS and CuxFey@HHSS catalyst with different Cu/Fe content are compared in Fig. 4 . The obvious wide diffraction band from 20° to 30° indicates that HHSS is amorphous [28,30]. The diffraction reflections at 2θ of 35.5°, 38.7° and 48.7° in Cu@HHSS (Fig. 4b) and Cu3Fe@HHSS (Fig. 4c) catalysts indicate the formation of CuO phase (JCPDS no.48-1548), corresponding respectively to (002), (111) and (-202) crystal surfaces. With the increase of iron species, the peak of CuO decreased for CuFe@HHSS (Fig. 4d) and CuFe3@HHSS (Fig. 4e) catalysts. The diffraction peaks were observed at 35.5° and 62.7°, which demonstrates formation of the CuFe2O4 phase (JCPDS no.77-0010). A CuO phase is predominant for The CuFe@HHSS-CP catalyst and no CuFe2O4 phase was observed in Fig. 4a, which indicates that the co-precipitation method is not conducive to the dispersion of Fe3+ and Cu2+ on HHSS to form CuFe2O4. The CuFe@HHSS catalyst showed as lightly wider diffraction peak of CuO and CuFe2O4, which shows that ultrasonic-assisted co-impregnation approach is beneficial to the dispersion of CuO and CuFe2O4 on HHSS. In addition, CuFe2O4 phase indicates that copper may be combined with iron to form Cu-Fe composites and the Cu-Fe interaction is improved [36], consisting with the SEM and TEM results. The catalyst with large specific surface area can maintain high metal dispersion at higher metal loading. The BET surface area of the catalyst is analyzed by N2 adsorption-desorption. Fig. 5 shows that the isothermal adsorption and desorption curves of the catalysts and HHSS are typical type-IV N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms according to IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of the catalyst mesoporous structure, which are consistent with our previous study [28,29,32]. Table 1 exhibits the specific surface area, pore size and pore capacity of CuFe @HHSS catalysts and HHSS. HHSS has a specific surface area of 752.68 m2/g, an average pore diameter of 9.59 nm, and an average pore volume of 1.75 cm3/g. The BET surface area of Cu@HHSS, Cu3Fe@HHSS, CuFe@HHSS, CuFe3@HHSS, and CuFe are 500.56 m2/g, 512.81 m2/g, 538.58 m2/g, 511.43 m2/g, and 3.56 m2/g, respectively. The surface areas of the CuxFey @HHSS catalysts were decreased as compared to that of HHSS is due to the introduction of copper and iron oxide nanoparticles into HHSS channels and cavities. The nanoparticles are well distributed in the cavities, which makes the pore volume and pore diameter decrease correspondingly. In addition, the specific surface area of the CuxFey@HHSS catalysts are larger than the CuFe catalyst. It is worth noting that both the specific surface area and porous volume of CuFe@HHSS catalysts are largest in the CuxFey@HHSS catalysts, which is due to formation of the CuFe2O4 phase with smaller particle size. This can facilitate the diffusion of reactants through pores to the Cu-Fe active site surface in the cavity [13,24]. The XPS spectra of Cu 2p3/2 and Fe 2p catalyst samples with different Cu-Fe supported on HHSS. The XPS spectra of Cu 2p3/2 and Fe 2p for Cu3Fe@HHSS, CuFe@HHSS and CuFe3@HHSS catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 6 . According to the Cu 2p spectra (Fig. 6a), the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 is near 933.0–935.0 eV, indicating that the copper species in the catalyst exists in the form of Cu2+ species. The other two peaks between 938 eV and 945 eV are satellite structures. These satellites can be attributed to the vibrational transition caused by the 3d charge transfer from the ligand to the metal [37]. It was found that compared with Cu3Fe@HHSS, CuFe@HHSS and CuFe3@HHSS catalyst, the Cu 2p3/2 peaks could be divided into two small peaks, concentrated in about 933.0 eV and 935.0 eV. It shows that Cu2+ exists as C u A 2 + and C u B 2 + , C u A 2 + exists in the tetrahedron of the oxygen atom of CuFe2O4, and in the octahedron of the oxygen atom of CuO in C u B 2 + [38]. Two small peaks near 941 and 944 eV, attributed to the satellite peaks of C u A 2 + and C u B 2 + [36]. From the fitting data of Cu 2p3/2 XPS in Table 2 , Cu2+ exists in the form of C u A 2 + , the amount of C u A 2 + rises and then falls with the decline of Cu/Fe ratio. When Cu exists in the form of composite oxide, it is conducive to the dispersion of Cu species, enhancing the synergistic effect between Cu and Fe on the catalyst surface. The synergistic effect between Cu and Fe was maximized with the Cu/Fe ratio 1:1. The strong synergistic effect of Cu and Fe is beneficial to the formation of C2+OH [36]. The peak centers of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are 711.0 and 725.0 eV are exhibited in Fig. 6b, indicating the presence of Fe2O3 phase in the catalyst. Among the three samples, two sorts of Fe3+are existent in HHSS supported, F e A 3 + and F e B 3 + [36], and F e A 3 + and F e B 3 + are existent in CuFe2O4 and Fe2O3, respectively. Table 3 shows the Fe 2p XPS spectral parameters of catalysts with different Cu /Fe content. According to the data of Fe 2p3/2 fitting in Table 3, the binding energy of Fe3+increased firstly and then decreased with the decrease of the specific amount of Cu /Fe, while the proportion of Fe3+ in the form of F e A 3 + increased firstly and then decreased. The ratio of F e A 3 + (65 %) was larger with the F e A 3 + specific amount of Cu /Fe was 1:1. Combining the result of XRD and BET, further indicated that the synergistic effect of Cu /Fe on the catalyst surface was strongest [15]. In order to study the reduction process of the catalyst, H2-TPR was determined and profiles were displayed in Fig. 7 , from which two reduction processes were observed in the high-temperature region (450−650 °C) and low-temperature region (150−250 °C). Compared with the study by Sun et al. [14], CuO reduction in this study has a lower reduction temperature. This is attributed to the larger surface area of the catalyst and the better adsorption of H2 by the cavity structure, which was more conducive to CuO reduction [39]. Two peaks appeared in the center of the reduction peak of different catalysts at 150−250 °C, corresponding to CuO and CuFe2O4 reduction [40]. The peak at 400−600 °C attribute to the reduction of process of Fe2O3 (Fe2O3➝Fe3O4➝FeO➝Fe) [36]. With the increase of Fe/Cu ratio, the reduction peak position shows a negative low-temperature region migration trend. This may be due to the formation of CuFe2O4, which lead to the easier reduction of Fe2O3 [23,36]. The results were consistent with the results of XPS and XRD. The H2-TPR results show that the three-dimensional structure of HHSS improves the synergistic effect of copper and iron and promotes the reduction of the active component of catalyst [41]."
8,CO hydrogenation performances of the catalysts,"3.2 CO hydrogenation performances of the catalysts The CO hydrogenation performance of the catalyst was determined at 300 °C, 3 MPa pressure, and 5000 h−1 airspeeds, and the detailed data shown in Table 4 and Fig. 8 . The CO conversion of Cu@HHSS, Cu3Fe@HHS, CuFe@HHSS, CuFe3@HHSS, CuFe and and CuFe@HHSS-CP were 35.1 %, 48.3 %, 65.1 %, 52.9 %, 38.2 % and 43.6 %, respectively. The high CO conversion rate and STYROH (118.1gkg-1 h-1) for CuFe@HHSS, could be attributed to a large specific surface area and a strong copper-iron interaction promoting CO conversion [23]. The alcohol selectivity were 30.6 %, 40.1 %, 46.6 %, 31.1 %, 21.1 % and 33.1 % for Cu@HHSS, Cu3Fe@HHS, CuFe@HHSS, CuFe3@HHSS, CuFe and CuFe@HHSS-CP, respectively. The CO conversion rate of Cu@HHSS was relatively low and the product was mainly methanol, due to the fact that Cu is the active center of methanol [42]. The selectivity of CO2 ranges from 12.1%–16.2%, and highest selectivity of CO2 for Cu@HHSS, indicated that iron could inhibit water-gas reaction [43]. The selectivity of hydrocarbons over Cu@HHSS, Cu3Fe@HHS, CuFe@HHSS, CuFe3@HHSS, CuFe and CuFe@HHSS-CP were 53.2 %, 46.5 %, 40.9 %, 54.2 %, 62.6 % and 52.1 %, respectively, and CuFe was highest, attributing to the secondary hydrogenation of the alcohols over the CuFe catalyst [13]. The alcohol product distribution of catalysts was conducted and shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that alcohol distribution of Cu@HHSS catalyst is consist of methanol (76.4 %) and high alcohol (23.6 %), attribute to the fact that Cu is the active center of methanol. The distribution of high alcohol are increased from 45.3%–59.7 %, with the ratio of Cu/Fe from 3/1 to 1/3. Iron promotes the growth of carbon chain, and increasing the content of iron can obviously improve the selectivity of high alcohols [44]. The alcohol distribution of CuFe catalyst are consistent with CuFe@HHSS, but the C2+OH/ C1OH of CuFe only 1.12 less than CuFe@HHSS (1.30). The CuFe@HHSS-CP catalyst was tested for HAS as control experiment. However, the C2+OH/ C1OH of CuFe@HHSS-CP only 1.19, which was less than CuFe@HHSS(Table 4 and Fig. 8). This is because copper and iron do not form a composite structure (CuFe2O4), which prevents the growth of carbon chain to form more C2+OH. This result is consistent with the XRD characterization. Based on the above CO conversion, alcohol selectivity and yield, CuFe@HHSS showed the best catalytic performance, Fig. 9 presents the catalytic time of stream for 50 h, with the CO conversion rate rising and up to 65.1 % for the first 12 h, and then continuing to stabilize. The alcohol selectivity still remains more than 40 % from 12 h to 50 h even much longer time. It indicates that CuFe@HHSS possess well stability for CO hydrogenation to alcohol. The SEM and TEM characterizations of the used CuFe@HHSS catalyst were conducted in Fig. 10 . Although a few spherical structures were destroyed, the HHSS structure was maintained in the used catalyst, which indicated that the catalyst structure had good stability in the reaction process. However, compared with Fig. 2d, the TEM image of spent CuFe@HHSS catalyst (Fig. 10b) become more blurred, which means that the state of Cu and Fe has changed in the catalytic reaction. In order to further verify the change of material state, the catalysts before and after the reaction were characterized by XRD (Fig. 11 ). Compared to the XRD patterns of fresh catalyst, there is a weak diffraction peaks at 43.5°in XRD patterns of spent CuFe@HHSS catalyst (Fig. 11), which is corresponding to F5C2 (JCPDS No.51-0997). The result indicates that the copper and iron are in a high dispersion state after the reaction and form new Cu-F5C2 composites. It is worth noting that there is no obvious diffraction peak of Cu° in the XRD spectrum (Fig. 11a) due to the diffraction peak of Cu° coinciding(JCPDS No.04-0836) with that of F5C2 and the highly dispersed copper [45]. In order to further verify the existing forms of iron and copper, the XPS spectras of spent CuFe@HHSS are obtained in Fig. 12 . Compared to the fresh CuFe@HHSS (Fig. 12a), the Cu 2p3/2 of spent CuFe@HHSS shows a negative shift from 933.27 eV to 932.51 eV, attributing the interaction of Cu and Fe. On the other hand, the Cu (LMM) KE for the spent catalyst (Fig. 12b) appears at 918 eV, which agree well with the Cu° species on the surface of spent CuFe@HHSS. The Fe 2p of spent CuFe@HHSS (Fig. 12c) also shows a negative shift from 710.98 eV to 710.52 eV, which could be attributed the form of Fe5C2. The results suggest that the CuFe2O4 spinel and CuO-CuFe2O4 metal-oxide were converted to Cu-Fe5C2 composite which is consistent with the recent literature of Fe5C2-Cu interfacial catalyst [36,45]. Bimetallic Cu-Fe supported HHSS, the conversion rate of CO and the selection of alcohol catalyst increased significantly with the increase of Cu/Fe ratio. CO conversion, total alcohol selectivity and a maximum of C2+OH over CuFe@HHSS catalyst were the 65.1 %, 46.6 % and 59.6 %, respectively. Based on the SEM, TEM and BET results of the catalyst, it can be seen that copper and iron are highly dispersed in HHSS. HHSS hollow porous structure can inhibit the agglomeration of active components, and HHSS hierarchical hollow three-dimensional structure provides a better reaction site for CO hydrogenation, resulting in the reaction to the direction of high alcohol. Combined with the results of XRD, XPS and H2-TPR, it can be seen that the interaction between copper and iron elements of catalysts with different amounts of Cu/Fe materials is different. The larger or smaller Cu/Fe ratio results in the presence of the active components of copper (iron) as a single substance, and the synergistic effect of copper and iron is reduced. The copper and iron species are highly dispersed on HHSS due to the three- dimensional hierarchical porous structure of HHSS. The copper and iron exist in the form of CuFe2O4, implied the strong synergies between copper and iron. At the same time, the higher specific surface area and pore volume of CuFe@HHSS enable the generated alcohol products to spread to the outer surface of the catalyst faster and avoid the secondary hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons. Compared with CuFe@HHSS catalyst, CuFe shows lower specific surface area, the product cannot be timely diffused, resulting in the secondary hydrogenation to produce hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, the hydrogenation of CO is impeded, resulting in a lower conversion rate of CO and a lower selectivity of alcohol [45]. Table 5 shows the typical catalyst CO hydrogenation catalyst performance, compared with the literature [11,13,14,18,36,46–49], the CuFe@HHSS catalyst has a high CO conversion efficiency and high alcohol better selectivity at a lower temperature (300 °C). Furthermore, the lower cost of catalyst preparation, relatively lower temperature and pressure of HAS, it might be a high alcohol better selectivity of the catalyst."
9,Mechanism of catalytic reaction,"3.3 Mechanism of catalytic reaction It is generally believed that the formation of high alcohols requires the construction of a double site, in which one active site as a dissociation and chain propagation of CO, and the other active site as a non-dissociation activation and insertion of CO [52]. These active sites are formed during activation and reaction, and the synergistic action of the active sites will facilitate the formation of higher alcohols [1,36]. The Cu-Fe catalyst was modified from the Cu catalyst synthesized [53]. Copper species are the main elements in methanol synthesis, acting on H* in the dissociated state of chemical adsorption and CO* in the adsorbed molecular state [39]. Fe is an important element in the F–T synthesis, which mainly dissociates and absorbs carbon monoxide and hydrogenates [54]. In the process of higher alcohol synthesis, copper and iron cooperate to form bimetallic catalysts. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the mechanism of the catalyst reaction of HHSS supported Cu-Fe bimetal catalysts (Fig. 13 ). Cu as CO the solution from the active site, produce large amounts of CO, and Fe promotes the generation of dissociative state C*, C* and dissociation state H* generate CHx*, CO* on Cu activity sites at the same time combined with H* generate CH3OH, CHx* coupled with CO*and H* generate C2H5OH, CHx*coupling enhanced carbon chain *CnHz generated and CO* to generate the corresponding alcohols in turn. Inevitably,*CnHz directly combines with H* to form olefin in this process. Highly dispersed copper and iron form composite oxides on the HHSS surface, and the binding of Cu-Fe bimetals at the atomic scale reduces the distance between the double active sites and enhances the synergistic effect of the double active sites [55]. The three-dimensional pore structure of the catalyst promotes CO conversion and improves the selectivity of alcohol, and the alcohol products can be timely diffused in the HHSS hierarchical hollow porous structure, effectively avoiding the occurrence of secondary hydrogenation of alcohol."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, the HHSS supported Cu-Fe bimetal catalysts with high dispersion were successfully synthesized through a simple ultrasound-assisted impregnation method. The characterization results showed that Cu-Fe bimetallic nanoparticles anchored on HHSS with high dispersion (2∼5 nm), and the structure of HHSS maintained. The CuFe@HHSS catalyst has a higher specific surface area (538.58 m2/g) and pore volume (1.16 cm3/g), which enabled the adsorption of more reactants on the catalyst surface and cavity for the reaction. Furthermore, because of the formation of CuFe2O4 phase in the catalysts, which is helpful to convert to Cu-Fe5C2 composites and the interaction between copper and iron is enhanced. The results show that the hollow structure of carrier can inhibit the sintering of active phase and improve the activity of the catalyst. The CuFe@HHSS catalyst has a high CO conversion efficiency (61.5 %) and high alcohol better selectivity (59.4 %) for HAS at a lower temperature (300 °C). The performance-structure correlation suggested that a higher specific surface area and pore volume and the formation of CuFe2O4 in the catalysts were remarkably improved the catalytic activity and selectivity."
