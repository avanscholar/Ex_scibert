0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as one of the cleanest energy sources has attracted worldwide attentions [1,2]. At present, the most common method to produce hydrogen is coal gasiﬁcation technology. However, this method requires more than 1000 °C condition and high energy consumption and also has pollution problems [3,4]. Water electrolysis, another widely studied hydrogen production method, has not made great progress due to its high energy consumption too [5,6]. As early as 1979, Coughlin and Farooque reported coal slurry electrolysis to produce hydrogen following the reactions below [6,7]: (1) anode: C + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e (2) cathode: 4 H + + 4 e → 2 H 2 (3) overall reaction: C + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 H 2 The technology of coal slurry electrolysis to produce hydrogen combines the advantages of clean utilization of coal and new energy to production [8–14]. More importantly, it requires a standard potential of 0.21 V, far less than the 1.23 V hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. However, coal electrooxidation occurs to form CO2 is a four-electron process, which leads to a slow reaction kinetics. Low overall electrolytic efficiency has limited its commercial applications. Therefore, it is important to develop new catalysts with high activity and low cost [12–16]. At present, platinum (Pt sheet or Pt mesh) and Pt-based catalysts are the main catalysts used for coal slurry electrolysis for hydrogen production. Patil et al. studied the constant potential technology of electrodes loaded with various precious metals (Pt, Pt–Ru, Pt–Rh, Pt–Ir, etc.) and found that Pt–Ir (80:20) had the maximum electrolytic efficiency [17]. Yin et al. studied a serial of Pt-based electrocatalysts, including Ti/TiO2–Pt, Ti/TiO2–PtRu, NiO and/or Co3O4 modified TiO2/Pt electrodes, and found improved activity and lowered cost of electrodes for coal electrolysis to produce H2. [18,19] Yang et al. studied the catalytic activity of PtCo nanoparticles loaded on carbon fibers in hydrogen transformation reaction compared with commercial carbon supported Pt [20]. Overall, Pt-based electrocatalysts showed outstanding performance. However, the high cost and low reserves of Pt hinders its further commercial applications [21,22]. Fortunately, palladium (Pd), as a catalyst with similar properties to Pt, is three times in reserve compared to Pt and has relatively low price compared with Pt [23–25]. Importantly, it had been reported that transition metals, such as Cr, Co, Cu, are added to Pd to form Pd-M bimetallic alloy can further improve the catalytic activity and reduce cost [26–33]. It has been found that the 3 d-transition metals chromium (Cr) has better catalytic performance than pure Pd when forming Pd–Cr alloy catalysts. On the other hand, Cr is a good candidate for metal corrosion resistance [34–36]. Duan et al. investigated nanoporous (NP) PdCr alloys by a dealloying method and showed methanol tolerance and structure stability for ORR and the performance of NP-Pd75Cr25 being the best performance. This was attributed to the appropriate amount of Cr alloyed with Pd that results in favorable modification of Pd electron structure to alter the reaction rate for oxygen reduction reaction. DFT calculations showed that the oxygen adsorption energy (ΔE0) of the Pd3Cr (111) and Pd (111) was −3.27 eV and −4.33 eV, respectively. Therefore, the ΔE0 of the Pd3Cr (111) was lower than Pd. The addition of Cr made the ΔE0 decrease was conducive to the optimal balance between adsorption energy and surface coverage of oxygenated species and finally led to the increase of active sites activated by O2 adsorption [22]. Likewise, the Liu group prepared carbon loaded Pd–Cr bimetallic catalysts by chemical reduction method and found that the catalyst Pd0·8Cr0·2/C exhibited the highest catalytic activity for ORR. The results showed that the alloy catalyst has better performance than pure Pd with optimum atomic ratio [32]. Wen et al. prepared a series of Pd–Cr alloy catalyst supported on Vulcan carbon for electrochemical oxidation of formic acid and found the best catalytic performance and high stability with an atomic ratio of Pd to Cr of 8:2 [37]. In general, alloying is one of the strategies to enhance and optimize the performance of electrocatalysts besides reducing the cost of precious metal [38]. In this work, Pd–Cr electrocatalysts supported on carbon ﬁbers (PdCr/CFs) were prepared as an anode for hydrogen production by coal slurries electrolysis in acidic solution for the first time. It is interesting to find that the Pd–Cr catalyst with relatively low Pd atomic ratio exhibits high electrocatalytic activity. A combination of experiments was conducted to understand the mechanism behind the hydrogen production by coal slurry electrolysis based on the PdCr catalyst. Increased number of surface-active sites and enhanced activity are main reasons for the strong performance observed. The method for preparing the PdCr/CFs catalyst is simple and convenient and can be easily applied commercially."
1,Experimental,
2,Electrode preparation,"2.1 Electrode preparation Carbon fibers were used as the electrode substrate. The titanium mesh (1 cm × 1 cm) was used as the electrode matrix, wounded around with 20 cm length carbon fibers. CFs were treated by acetone (from Anhui Full Time Specialized Solvents & Reagents Co., Ltd., 99.5%), then rinsed with distilled water for several times to remove the oil and impurities on the surface of the electrode, and finally put it in a drier (GZX-GF101-1-BS) for 2 h at 120 °C and cooled it to room temperature. PdCl2, as the precursor of Pd, (59.0% metals basis), was dissolved in 0.4 M hydrochloric acid and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Ltd., 99+% purity) was dissolved with alcohol as the precursor of Cr. All chemicals used were from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. The impregnation liquid was prepared according to the atomic ratio of Pd–Cr (1:0), (7:3), (1:1) and (3:7). The impregnation liquid was ultra-stirred by ultrasound cleaner (VGT-1620QTD) for 20min.Dip the electrode substrate in the impregnation liquid for a few hours. The impregnated electrodes are dried in drier at 120 °C for 2 h."
3,Reduction electrode,"2.2 Reduction electrode The reduction process was carried out in a tubular furnace (GSL-1100X). Firstly, the air in the tube was removed furnace with 600 mL min−1 nitrogen for 30min. Secondly, the furnace temperature was increased to the 480 °C and then the electrode was reduced under the mixture of 100 mL min−1 Hydrogen and 500 mL min−1 Argon for 2 h. Then the sample was decreased to room temperature in Ar (600 mL min−1) atmosphere."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM, Inspect F 50) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, X-Max) was used to examine the surface morphology and the chemical compositions of electrode catalyst. X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO) analysis was used to analyze the phase composition of the electrocatalysts with the scanning speed 2°/min, the scanning range of 5–95°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250) was used to determine the chemical composition of the surface and the chemical states of the elements. The elements and components of coal samples were analyzed using a carbon-sulfur analyzer (SC-144DR, American Leco Co.) and an oxygen-nitrogen-hydrogen analyzer (ONH836, American Leco Co.), and a full-automatic industrial analyzer (TRGF-8000, China HebiTianrun electronic technology Co. Ltd.)."
5,Electrochemical performance measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical performance measurements H-type electrolytic cell was used to evaluate electrochemical measurements at electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Limited Co.). The 1 cm × 1 cm carbon fibers loaded Pd–Cr alloy electrode as working electrode and 3 cm × 3 cm pure Pt plane electrode as a counter electrode. The anode solution was 4.0 wt% coal slurries solution (particle size ≤ 88 μm) in 1 mol L−1 sulfuric acid solution and 0.04 M Fe2+ and Fe3+(from FeSO4·7H2O and Fe2(SO4)3 ·xH2O precursor respectively, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added. A blank solution without coal but only 0.040 M Fe2+ and Fe3+ in 1.0 mol L−1 sulfuric acid was used for comparison. The cathode solution was 1.0 mol L−1 sulfuric acid solution. Under constant current, in order to avoid water electrolysis, the electrolysis was stopped when the potential of the electrolytic cell reached 1.17 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a constant potential of 1.0 V at a rate of 20 mV s−1. With saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, constant agitation of 1.0 M H2SO4 and constant potential of 1.0 V were conducted for the ampere I-t test. The electrochemical measurements were carried out at 80 °C."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The crystal structure and phase of the electrocatalysts were determined using XRD. Fig. 1 a shows that for Pd/CFs the characteristic peaks of (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of Pd appeared at 40.12°, 46.66°, 68.12°, 82.10°, and 86.62°, respectively, revealing the Pd face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. Compared with pure Pd/CFs, the characteristic peaks for Pd–Cr/CFs are widened with increasing content of Cr. Moreover, there are slight shifts towards smaller angles in the Pd (220) diffraction peaks for Pd–Cr/CFs compared to the pure Pd/CFs, as seen in Fig. 1b. This is possibly due to Cr being incorporated into the lattice of Pd to form an alloy and making the lattice contract under the reduction of high temperature hydrogen. This suggests that the Pd–Cr alloy was formed during the preparation of catalyst electrodes. According to the (220) diﬀraction peaks, the domain sizes and the lattice parameters of PdCr/CFs with various ratios were calculated, seen Table 1 . The domain size and the lattice parameters of Pd–Cr (3:7) are the smallest [39]. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of Pd/CFs with different Pd/Cr atomic ratios. The catalytic electrode obtained by the impregnation and reduction method was covered with catalyst particles on the surface of CFs. The carbon fibers provide a large specific surface area for the catalysts, which is desired for improving electrolytic efficiency. EDS analysis showed the amount of Cr in PdCr/CFs (7:3), (1:1) and 3:7 was 28.62%, 49.10% and 67.86%, respectively. The XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3 . Characteristic peaks of Pd and Cr are observed (Fig. 3a). The binding energy related to the Pd 3 d peaks shifted towards higher energy by 0.28 eV when Cr was added (Fig. 3c and d), which further indicates the formation of Pd–Cr alloy. The shift of binding energy indicated the change in the Pd electronic structures. The increase of binding energy may be due to the change in electron density around Pd caused by the formation of Pd–Cr alloy [37]. The peaks corresponding to Cr2p were deconvoluted into Cr, CrO3 and CrOx according to the Gaussian-Lorentzian method [40]. CrO3 and CrOx form on the surface possibly due to the samples exposed to ambient air. Li's group investigated PdCr/C electrocatalysts for the electrooxidation of formic acid and also found that the binding energy of the Pd 3d5/2 in PdCr/C was positively shifted. The results are possibly due to high-valency chromium oxides formed on the catalysts, such CrO3 and CrOx [37]. Pd–P electrocatalyst prepared by Lu et al. showed a positive shift for Pd in Pd–P/C, which indicated the 3 d electron density of Pd decreased and the surface adsorbate binding strength reduced with P addition into Pd–P/C catalysts [41]."
8,Electrochemical properties,"3.2 Electrochemical properties Electrochemical properties of the PdCr/CFs electrocatalysts were evaluated under galvanostatic conditions with anodes fabricated from pure Pd, Pd–Cr (7:3), Pd–Cr (1:1) and Pd–Cr (3:7) catalysts supported on carbon fibers. As shown in Fig. 4 , their corresponding polarization time was 10.73 h, 11.53 h, 13.42 h and 14.71 h, respectively. The polarization time became much longer after coal slurry was added into the electrolyte, indicating coal being electrocatalytically oxidized. The longer the polarization time is, the more coal is electrocatalytically oxidized [16,42,43]. The cell voltage increased with polarization time, as shown in Fig. 4. It indicates that the reactivity loss can possibly be attributed to the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of coal, thereby blocking the polarization [44]. Compared with pure Pd, the polarization time of Pd–Cr ratios of (7:3), (1:1), and (3:7) was increased to 0.80 h, 2.69 h and 3.98 h, respectively, and the electrooxidation efficiency of PdCr/CFs catalysts to coal increased by 7.5%, 25.1% and 37.1%, respectively, all higher than that of pure Pd electrode. This indicates that the catalytic performance of binary metal alloy is better than that of pure Pd due to the change in the Pd electronic structures. Our previous research investigated Pt- and Pd-based electrocatalysts for coal to produce H2 [29,30,42]. It was found that PdCo/CFs (1:1) increased the efficiency of electrooxidation for coal up to 16.9%. PtCo and PtFe on carbon fibers improved the activity for coal electrolysis by 23.1% and 19.0% accordingly, compared to Pt. In this work, the polarization time of PdCr/CFs (3:7) was the longest, indicative of the best electrolytic efficiency for coal electrooxidation. It was interesting to find that PdCr/CFs (3:7) with a small amount of Pd shows higher catalytic activity than that of pure Pd/CFs. A possible explanation is that the addition of Cr results in some d electrons transferred from Cr to Pd, change the electron structure of the outer layer of Pd atom and increase the number of holes in the d orbital of Pd atom. It was reported that the catalytic activity of the catalyst was in a volcanic relationship with the location of the d-band center of the metal [22,45]. For precious metals, only when the d-band center of the catalyst metal is in the appropriate range can make the catalytic activity of the catalyst reach the highest level. Thus, the appropriate amount of Cr could lead to optimal electronic properties of the increased for electrocatalysis, as indicated by the increased polarization time [45–47]. The strong performance of the PdCr/CFs (3:7) electrocatalyst may be partly due to the corrosion resistance of Cr. Generally, metal catalysts tend to corrode in acidic solution, especially when there are collisions between coal particles and the catalysts with continuous stirring. In this work, the presence of Cr in the Pd–Cr alloy may effectively reduce corrosion of the catalyst. The PdCr/CFs catalytic activity was also measured at constant potential as shown in Fig. 5 . When the voltage reached 0.65 V, the current density began to increase significantly. This is attributed to electrooxidation of the coal slurry. The current density for PdCr/CFs with Pd/Cr ratio of (7:3), (1:1), (3:7) and (1:0) was 64.51 mA cm−2, 65.01 mA cm−2, 75.85 mA cm−2 and 62.37 mA cm−2, respectively. This indicates that the catalytic performance of binary metal PdCr alloy was better than that of the pure Pd, which indicated that the formation of Pd–Cr alloy actually promoted the catalytic efficiency. The current density of PdCr/CFs(3:7) was the highest, demonstrating that PdCr/CFs(3:7) has the best electrolytic efficiency for coal electrooxidation. This result agrees with the measurement under the galvanostatic condition. The I-t test of Pd–Cr/CFs at a constant potential voltage of 1.0 V were shown in Fig. 6 . The current density of Pd–Cr/CFs (7:3), (1:1), (3:7) and (1:0) is 105.3 mA/cm2, 127.3 mA/cm2, 171.1 mA/cm2, and 59.3 mA/cm2, respectively. The current density of PdCr/CFs (3:7) is nearly three times higher than that of pure Pd. The results indicated that the catalytic performance of PdCr/CFs was higher than that of pure Pd/CFs, and PdCr/CFs (3:7) has the best catalyst activity, consistent with the other test results. A possible explanation is that adding 3 d-transition metal Cr to form Pd–Cr alloy catalysts makes Pd atoms better embedded or anchored on the surface of the supporter, preventing the catalyst from accumulating on or detaching from the surface of carbon fibers. Elements of the coal samples before and after electrolysis under galvanostatic conditions are analyzed, as shown in Table 2 . The amount of C and H decreased after electrolysis, which revealed that there was electro-oxidation occurring on the surface of the coal [19,30,48]. Parts of the coal are oxidized into some organic intermediates that are not completely converted into CO2 [19,49,50]. Some intermediates composed of carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups that accumulate on the surface of the coal. Therefore, oxygen content increased after electrolysis. These results are consistent with our and other previous studies [19,30,48]. The decrease in S and ash is possibly due to sulfides and basic oxides in coal that react with acidic electrolyte [48]. It can be seen from Table 3 that volatile matters decreased and fixed carbon increased, which indicates that volatile matters rich in hydrogen were preferentially consumed and the reacted carbonaceous solid is enriched in fixed carbon. It also indicates that coal electrooxidation produces a product with a higher proportion of fixed carbon, which contributed to the increase in fixed carbon [48]. The anode and cathode gas were collected under galvanostatic conditions. The volume of H2 and CO2 was 14 mL and 2.2 mL after 2 h electrolysis of coal, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7 . The ratio of CO2/H2 is much less than that of theoretical value 1/2, according to the reaction (3). This indicates that coal did not convert completely into CO2, but into some organic intermediates, predominately species containing carboxyl groups, which possibly form on the coal surface as a film and prevent electron transfer. These results were consistent with our previous research [30,45] and other reported studies [44]."
9,Conclusion,Carbon fiber supported Pd–Cr electrocatalysts for hydrogen production by coal electrolysis were prepared by an impregnation and hydrogen heat treatment method. The PdCr/CFs electrocatalysts had higher catalytic efficiency than pure Pd. The PdCr/CFs (3:7) showed the best electrocatalytic performance. The shift of binding energy due to interaction between Cr and Pd. The good corrosion resistance for Cr in acidic solution is an added advantage. This study demonstrates that the Pd–Cr/CFs is a promising candidate for the hydrogen production through coal electrolysis.
