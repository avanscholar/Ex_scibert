0,Introduction,"Due to depletion of non- renewable energy resources such as coal, petroleum, oil and natural gas the search of an alternative energy source has got priority in the current research. Search of sustainable and renewable nature of energy source is the need of the hour. Hydrogen is found to be a better alternative because of its environmental friendly nature. Hydrogen has high energy content (142 KJ/g) and its conversion leads to the formation of water. Biologically, hydrogen could be produced by photosynthetic and fermentative routes which are more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive compared to thermo- chemical/ electrochemical processes (Levin et al., 2004). Dark fermentative method of bio- hydrogen production has become more attractive due to the utilization of renewable resources, especially cellulosic and lignocellulosic biomasses as substrates, simple in operation, no light source is required and the process can be carried out at ambient temperature and pressure (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Among the different fermentative hydrogen producing microorganisms, the genus Enterobacter (Fabiano and Perego, 2002; Nakashimada et al., 2002), Bacillus (Kalia et al., 1994) and Clostridium (Chin et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2008; Md. Saiful Islam et al., 2017) were studied extensively. At present, most of the studies on bio-hydrogen production were confined to pure carbohydrates and carbohydrate-rich waste water as substrates (Fan et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2008; Lo et al., 2008a; Lin et al., 2008). Bio-hydrogen production from cellulosic biomass seems to be a better option due to the abundant availability of cellulosic biomass in the earth (Xing et al., 2009). Direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to hydrogen could not be possible due to the complex structure of cellulose. And thus, the utilization of pretreated cellulosic substrate is essential which reduces time and overall cost of the process. Only few studies have been reported on the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to hydrogen and by using pretreated substrates either by physical/chemical methods (Fan et al., 2006a, 2006b; Levin et al., 2006; Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Ntaikou et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2010; Nagaiah et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2016a; Fujita et al., 2016). Most of the studies were restricted only on the degradation of cellulosic biomass using thermophilic and strict anaerobic bacteria especially Clostridium species. Though, bio-hydrogen research has been carried out for more than two decades, there is no commercial hydrogen production processes established. This is due to the high maintenance costs involved and low H2 yields obtained. Economically viable fermentative hydrogen production process could be possible only by utilizing cellulosic biomass as substrates. Identification of a strain with potent cellulose degrading and hydrogen yielding ability would be a success in hydrogen fermentation process in future. The strain capable of converting cellulose and hemicellulose part of the cellulosic biomass with larger percentage is the crucial step in biomass fermentations used in fuel and other chemicals production applications (Goncalves et al., 2013; Ajijolakewu et al., 2017). In this work, we identified a mesophilic, facultative anaerobic bacterium isolated from SCB waste and employed for hydrogen fermentation. The isolated species was biochemically and molecularly characterized. The phylogenetic analysis of the isolated species was carried out to analyze its evolutionary relationship. The isolated mesophilic strain has special characteristics and thus it has been attracted and was used in this study. The hydrogen production ability of the strain was tested with the future renewable energy resources such as sugar cane bagasse and sweet sorghum stalk biomass."
1,Methodology,
2,Strain isolation,"2.1 Strain isolation The strain used in this study was isolated from soil samples collected from sugarcane bagasse storage yard. One-gram soil sample in 50 ml LB medium was incubated at 30 °C for overnight. 0.5 ml of the supernatant was transferred to 50 ml of the minimal salt medium supplemented with 0.1% w/v carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC). The minimal salt medium contains the following components in a liter of medium: 5.0 g NH4HCO3, 1.0 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 mg ZnCl2, 0.1 mg MnSO4, 0.1 mg CuSO4, 4.0 mg FeSO4·7H2O, and 2.0 mg NaMoO4. The culture was incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. 0.5 ml of the culture broth was diluted to 50 ml using the same minimal salt medium and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The same procedure was repeated for three times to enrich the culture. After enrichment, the culture broth was spread on agar plate which contains minimal salt medium. Pure culture was obtained by spreading each colony on agar plates by repeating the procedure for three times. Hydrogen producing ability of the strain was tested for each colony and the best strain was selected based on its high hydrogen yielding capacity."
3,Identification of the strain,"2.2 Identification of the strain A large fragment of 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using universal primers as 27F (5′- AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG- 3″) and 1492 R (5″- TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3″). PCR amplification conditions are 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 60 s and 72 °C for 60 s performed for 35 cycles. The PCR product was purified using a Montage PCR clean up kit (Millipore). PCR product was sequenced using 518 F/800 R (518F- CCA GCA GCC GCG TAA TACG; 800R- TAC CAG GGT ATC TAA TCC) primers. Sequencing reactions were performed using an ABI PRISM BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (FS enzyme) (Applied Biosystems) (Gutell et al., 1990). The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced in Synergic scientific services, Chennai."
4,Phylogenetic tree construction,"2.3 Phylogenetic tree construction Using the BLASTn search tool, the sequence of Bacillus subtilis AuChE413 was compared. The obtained sequences were further aligned by multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using the CLUSTAL X program (Tompson et al., 1997). Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbor joining method was performed using the Mega3.1 program (Kumar et al., 2004, 2016)."
5,Feed stock preparation and treatment,"2.4 Feed stock preparation and treatment Fresh sugarcane bagasse was obtained from nearby sugar industry (MRK Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd., Cuddalore, India). It was cleaned by removing dirt and other materials and stored at - 20 °C. The fresh sorghum stalk was collected from farm land near Salem, India. The leaves of sorghum stalk were removed and cut into 15–20 cm length and stored at − 20 °C. The contents of pretreated SCB and sweet sorghum stalk were analyzed using standard procedure (Ververis et al., 2007). The compositions are as follows: SCB- cellulose 34.5%, hemicelluloses 21.5% and lignin 5.57%; Sorghum stalk- cellulose 45.3%, hemicelluloses 26.3% and lignin 15.2%. The biomass was ground using the laboratory mixer grinder to an average particle size of 2–3 mm. Pretreatment of biomasses were carried out using 0.5% HCl by following the method suggested by Cao et al. (2012)."
6,Experimental procedure,"2.5 Experimental procedure Batch experiments were performed with 600 ml serum bottles filled with 200 ml minimal salt medium composed of the respective substrates (sugar cane bagasse/ sweet sorghum stalk). Composition (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 6.0% w/v) of the biomass in the medium was varied to study their effects. Fermentation was carried out with the available oxygen in the head space and in the medium (DO). pH was adjusted to 7.0 and sterilized in an autoclave (121 °C, 15 psi) for 20 min. 5% v/v seed culture (one day grown culture in CMC medium) was used as inoculum. The bottles were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C. The biogas from fermentation was collected using water displacement method. Hydrogen content present in the biogas was analyzed using gas chromatograph (AFMIL-NUCON5765) equipped with thermal conductivity detector and 2.0 m (6.25 mm inside diameter) stainless steel column filled with porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml per minute. Injector, oven and column temperatures were maintained at 150 °C, 80 °C and 200 °C respectively. Gas sample (200 µl) was collected through a hypodermic needle fixed in the stopper for GC analysis."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Strain isolation and characterization,"3.1 Strain isolation and characterization Using CMC as sole carbon source, 30 distinct colonies were selected for further screening process. Among the colonies studied for H2 production, a single colony producing high hydrogen yield with consistent performance is being selected for further studies. A complete characterization of the selected strain was made. The hydrogen production ability of the isolate by utilizing cellulosic biomass was tested by subjecting sugar cane bagasse and sweet sorghum stalk as substrates. The isolated strain, B. subtilis AuChE413 is a gram positive, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium, and have an endospore forming features (shown in Fig. 1). The spore formation was occurring at the time of exponential growth reaches the maximum (or at the time of start of depletion of substrate). The strain appears as white or milk-white colonies and the edge of the colony is clear, round and smooth. B. subtilis AuChE413 is found to be a facultative anaerobe, since it performs its activities well both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The isolate could ferment the sugars such as, glucose, fructose, sucrose, galactose and maltose with the formation of acetic acid as end products. Fermentation of mannitol, xylose and lactose took place slowly after 48 h of growth. The isolate is highly specific in degrading starch. It showed the presence of catalase activity and the absence of oxidase activity. It is not capable of utilizing amino acid tryptophan and capable of utilizing citrate and it does not have the ability to give off hydrogen sulfide."
9,Molecular characterization,"3.2 Molecular characterization The sequence analysis technique of 16S rRNA, genes encoding small-subunit ribosomal RNA were commonly used for the phylogenetic classification and reconstructing of prokaryotic phylogenies (Case et al., 2007). A total of 793 nucleotide sequence was analyzed from the 16S rRNA of the present isolate. The closest known relatives of the new isolate were determined by performing a nucleotide BLAST search ( Table 1). The comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences also provides a way to investigate the dissimilarity between the strain collections and the natural communities (Weller et al., 1991). The 16S rRNA sequence of the newly identified strain Bacillus subtilis AuChE413 was submitted with the NCBI GenBank and deposited under accession number JX471147 and is given in Fig. 2 as FASTA format. Phylogenetic analysis was made to understand the evolutionary relationship of the isolate. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the homology existing between the 16S rRNA sequences available in NCBI database by BLASTn search. Construction of the tree contains 20 strains, in which, five different genus with different Bacillus sp., Clostridium sp., E.coli, Pantoea sp., and Rhodoplanes sp., along with B. subtilis AuChE413 is represented in Fig. 3. From the analysis, the test strain is evolutionarily modified from other Bacillus strains, this may be due to the environmental adaptability of the strain."
10,Growth conditions,"3.3 Growth conditions The isolate, B. subtilis AuChE413 grows favorably well in high acidic and neutral pH conditions. The cells grew well favorably at 37 °C with less lag period and a doubling time of 120 min (specific growth rate µ, 0.347 h−1). Based on the growth rate constant, the mean generation time or doubling time was calculated. The other Bacillus sp., with similar growth characteristics have also been reported (Leitch and Collier, 1996). The strain attains sporulation at the end of exponential phase, nearly 24 h of fermentation. Formation of spores by the isolate might be to compensate unfavorable conditions developed in the medium due to the formation of primary and secondary metabolites and depletion of medium components. The favorable temperature range for the growth of the isolate is between 30 °C and 40 °C and an optimum temperature is 37 °C ( Fig. 4). The pH range for maximal growth will be around 5.0–9.0 and an optimum is around 7.0 ( Fig. 5). The newly isolated strain is tolerant to high salt concentrations and shown up to the maximum of 6% w/v NaCl in the medium. It shows an indication of osmotic pressure uplift by the isolate. The effect of different carbon substrates was studied. Glucose, carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), pretreated sugarcane bagasse and sweet sorghum biomass were used in equivalent sugar compositions. Total gas production and hydrogen gas percentage was measured. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The maximum total biogas (3040 ml/l) with 18% H2 (552.67 ml H2/l) was obtained with sweet sorghum biomass as substrate. It was observed that the isolate B.subtilis AuChE413 grows well also in cellulose and starch medium as like in glucose medium. Further, it exhibits its growth characteristics well in both aerobic and anaerobic environments. This nature of this strain will be considered to be an additional advantageous feature of the isolate."
11,Hydrogen production,"3.4 Hydrogen production Hydrogen producing ability of the isolate was tested by employing pretreated SCB and pretreated SSB as substrates. Different biomass loading (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 6.0%w/v) in the medium was varied for H2 production studies. Hydrogen production and yield was recorded and is shown in Table 2. The increase in hydrogen production up to 5.0%w/v biomass loading in the medium was observed. Hydrogen production of 1199 and 1933 ml H2/l was obtained with SCB and SSB respectively. In terms of hydrogen yield, 1% w/v biomass loading in the medium was resulted with the highest hydrogen yields. The hydrogen yields of 39.6 and 55.2 l H2 /kg biomass was obtained with the SCB and SSB respectively. The maximum hydrogen content in biogas was obtained at 24 h of fermentation with a percentage of 43.11%. After that, the hydrogen content in biogas was decreased. This may be due to the increase in partial pressure levels of hydrogen in the head space of the reactor. The effect of partial pressure in the reactor was studied and reported that the hydrogen synthesizing mechanism was changed over to the alcohol synthesizing mechanism (Fan et al., 2004). Bacterial consortia were used in H2 production with different feedstocks of starch, sucrose, glucose, fructose and xylose and obtained a maximum H2 production of 2.0–2.3 mol H2 /mol glucose (Singh et al., 2010). Antonopoulou et al. (2008) have used the sorghum as sorghum extract, sorghum stalk and sorghum residue separately as substrates and obtained the combined H2 yield of 46.6 mmol H2 /g glucose. The other results with high H2 yield (240 ml H2 per g TVS) was obtained from whole sweet sorghum biomass as substrate (Nagaiah et al., 2012). Sinha and Pandey (2014) have used a pure culture of Bacillus firmus NMBL-03 and obtained the highest H2 production of 22.58 ± 2.65 mmol H2 /l with starch as feedstock."
12,Conclusions,"A novel hydrogen producing strain was isolated from SCB waste. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the isolate belongs to the genus Bacillus. The strain was able to grow under facultative anaerobic conditions and produce high amount of hydrogen. And also, it is able to utilize a variety of sugars and cellulosic biomasses more efficiently. Pretreated sweet sorghum stalk biomass was found to be a suitable substrate for H2 fermentation by the isolate B. subtilis AuChE413. The highest hydrogen yield of 55.2 1H2/kg sorghum stalk biomass was obtained with a maximum percentage H2 content of 43.11% at 24 h fermentation. Further investigations may lead to commercial exploitation of the isolate successfully."
