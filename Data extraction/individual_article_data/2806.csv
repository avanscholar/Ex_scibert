0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production using sunlight as the energy input is a valuable sustainable-energy technology. In this case, solar energy is stored by driving chemical reactions toward chemicals, such as H2, of higher chemical potentials. Photocatalytic processes over metal oxide semiconductor surfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years as potentially efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost methods for renewable hydrogen production [1–6]. Due to its high stability against photo-corrosion and its favorite electronic energy band structure, TiO2 has drawn tremendous attention for such applications. For H2 production from water, many studies have concluded that direct splitting of water into H2 and O2 has a very low efficiency due to rapid reverse reaction. A much higher hydrogen production rate can be obtained by addition of the so-called “sacrificial reagents”, such as alcohols and other organics [7–10], which are oxidized to products that are less reactive toward hydrogen. For H2 production from a water/methanol (MeOH) solution, depending on reaction conditions and on whether metal catalyst used, the reaction could proceed either stepwise, involving stable intermediates, such as aldehydes and acids [11]: (1) MeOH ( l ) ⟷ h γ , catal . HCHO ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G 1 o = 64.1 kJ / mol , (2) HCHO ( g ) + H 2 O ( l ) ⟷ h γ , catal . HCO 2 H ( l ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G 2 o = 47.8 kJ / mol , (3) HCO 2 H ( l ) ⟷ h γ , catal . CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G 3 o = - 95.8 kJ / mol , as suggested by Sakata et al. [7–10], or in one-step on catalyst surface to give the overall reaction: (4) MeOH ( l ) + H 2 O ( l ) ⟷ h γ , catal . CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) as suggested by Chen et al. [12], H2 is produced in all of these steps. Deposition of Pt-group metals, including Ni, Pd and Pt, on TiO2 has been shown to greatly enhance the photocatalytic production of H2 from pure water or water/sacrificial reagent solutions. Sakata et al. [10] attributed the enhancement to the catalytic effects of the metal particles on H2 evolution. Dickinson et al. [13], on the other hand, suggested that the presence of Pd provides a reaction pathway which involves chemisorption and dehydrogenation of MeOH on Pd to produce chemisorbed CO and subsequent oxidation of the chemisorbed CO to CO2. Since oxide semiconductors generally have a wide bandgap, they absorb only a very little part of light in the visible region and this drawback could be overcome by sensitization. Dabestani et al. [14] have achieved the sensitization of TiO2 and SrTiO3 electrodes by using the photosensitizers ruthenium (II) tris (2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) and zinc tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl porphyrin). They also sensitized TiO2 by CdS-loading and this effect was ascribed to more efficient charge separation caused by an inter-particle electron transfer from excited CdS either to the conduction band of TiO2 or directly to redox catalyst [15]. The CdS/TiO2 system exemplifies the third type of sensitization. Another requirement for photoproduction of hydrogen using a semiconductor is the need for hydrogen evolution catalyst on semiconductor surface as reported by many research groups [16]. Nada et al. [17] have also investigated the role of PdO, Ag2O and RuO2 for the photocatalytic production from aqueous organic solutions using UV radiation. In the present investigation, sensitized TiO2/RuO2-MV2+ system was studied for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen using both UV and solar radiation in the presence of several photosensitizers. Also, MV2+ as electron relay was investigated."
1,Experimental,"Purest research grade chemicals were used in the present study obtained from Fluka and Sigma-Aldrich companies. TiO2/RuO2 was prepared by fusion in which RuCl3 dissolved in water and mixed with TiO2 anatase to form slurry in which the chloride salt content is 3%. The slurry was dried at 110°C and then heated at 500°C for 2h. The resulting solid mass was ground to obtain fine powder [17]. The immersion well photochemical reactor (350ml), equipped with high pressure mercury lamp (HPK, 125W, England), was used for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water or aqueous solutions of organic compounds using UV radiation, Fig. 1 (a). Also, solar radiation (the direct sunlight)—as a source of energy—was used; the mean daily clear sky isolation=27.82×106 Jm−2) [18], Fig. 1(b). The photochemical reactor comprises radiation source, a reactor transparent for the light, a gas product outlet and photocatalytic reactor. The product of the process is released from the reactor by the gas product outlet as the product of the process basically is H2 and CO2; the product is led to a CO2 absorber (CaO, Ca(OH)2 and NaOH), where CO2 is separated from the hydrogen. The hydrogen was detected using Bacharach hydrogen detector with resolution of 1ppm (USA), and the amount of hydrogen evolved was measured using water manometer. Ru(bpy)3 2+, Cu-phthalocyanine, and Eosin Y have been studied as photosensitizers in the present work, Fig. 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,"Several investigations have been carried out using TiO2 in different forms, such as anatase, rutile, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, etc. The difficulty with this type of semiconductors is its bandgap energy which needs an input energy of >3.2eV to excite an electron from the valence band to conduction band. Considering the solar spectrum, the wavelength region that suits this energy is <400nm. This problem was overcome by doping with transition metal ions [13] which increase the absorption of this semiconductor in the visible region. TiO2 (anatase) loaded with RuO2 catalyst displayed extremely high activity for hydrogen production rate [17]. An important approach to prevent the quick e−–h+ recombination in the photocatalytic processes is coupling of photocatalyst particles with photosensitizers (S) that have different energy levels [19–21]. In the TiO2/RuO2(photocatalyst)-MV2+ system, photogenerated electron from (S) can be transferred into a TiO2 particle while holes remain in the (S) particle. This process of charge separation is considered to be very fast, for example, a picosecond that electron injection from (S) into TiO2 occurs in less than 20ps [22]. The amount of hydrogen produced with sensitized TiO2/RuO2 photocatalyst increases with the increment of photosensitizer concentration. This is attributed to direct electron transfer from the excited photosensitizer (S*) to the conduction band of the semiconductor (TiO2) [23,24]: (5) ( S ) ⟷ h γ ( S * ) (6) ( S * ) + TiO 2 ⟶ e cb - ( TiO 2 ) + ( S + ) Ru(bpy)3 2+, Eosin Y, and Cu-phthalocyanine were investigated as photosensitizers in the present study. Figs. 3–5 represent the effect of photosensitizer type and their concentration using UV and solar radiation, it could be concluded that the activity according to the following order: Cu-phthalocyanine >Ru(bpy)3 2+ >Eosin Y. The difference in hydrogen production rate is based on the structures and properties of these dyes and the difference in their electron injection characteristics [25,26]. A sacrificial electron donor, methanol in this system was employed to scavenge the photosensitizer's holes formed on illumination which otherwise would decompose (S). (7) 2 h + ( S * ) + Electron Donor ⟶ Electron Donor ox . Addition of MV2+ as an electron relay for hydrogen production was investigated to increase the hydrogen production rate, Fig. 6 . MV2+ as an electron relay undergoes one-electron reduction with ecb − (TiO2) to form MV·+. The MV·+ thus formed reacts with the H+ ion to evolve hydrogen and then returning to the dipositive state. The transition metal oxide (RuO2) act as catalyst for redox reaction MV2+/MV·+ and thus for hydrogen production. So, it could be concluded that the trapped conduction band electron by TiO2 generate hydrogen via MV2+/MV·+ [27]. (8) e cb - ( TiO 2 ) + MV 2 + ⟶ MV + + TiO 2 (9) MV + + H + ⟶ 1 2 H 2 + MV 2 + The effect of pH on hydrogen production rate was studied, Fig. 7 . It was found that the amount of hydrogen produced in the acidic medium was more than basic medium. At acidic pH, more H+ ions would be adsorbed on semiconductor surface, and hence the possibility for reduction of H+ to H by the ecb − (TiO2) to increase. At high pH values the precipitation of Ru4+ and Cu2+ ions as hydroxides could occur. The reduction of MV2+ by ecb − (TiO2) is the rate controlling process at lower pH [28]. The mechanism of hydrogen evolution operative in this system involve injection of an electron from the excited state of the sensitizer into conduction band of TiO2 leading to hydrogen evolution, Scheme 1 ."
3,Conclusions,"Results of the present study show that the use of photosensitized TiO2/RuO2-MV2+ and solar or UV radiation results in the enhancement of hydrogen production rate. Qualitatively, the ranking of photosensitizers in terms of the degree of enhancement of hydrogen production rate was found in the following order: Cu-phthalocyanine >Ru(bpy)3 2+ >Eosin Y. It was concluded that the amount of hydrogen produced in the acidic medium was more than basic medium. Addition of MV2+ as an electron relay for hydrogen production was investigated to increase the hydrogen production rate. Also, MV2+ plays an important role as an electron relay for the increment the hydrogen production rate. The overall process represents an environmentally friendly and cost effective method for production of energy."
