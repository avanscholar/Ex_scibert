0,Introduction,"In the field of lignocellulose biorefining, pretreatment is a crucial step to deconstruct the rigid structure and remove the recalcitrant fractions of lignocellulose, from which the subsequent bioconversion to biofuel/bioproduct (for example, bioethanol) will be made much easier (Rajendran et al., 2018). A pretreatment using phosphoric acid plus hydrogen peroxide (PHP) was invented by our group in 2014; this can be regarded as an oxidative method. By contrast, PHP pretreatment can work efficiently at mild conditions (40–55 °Ϲ) to achieve over 95% hemicellulose removal and 71–96% delignification using various typical lignocellulosic feedstocks. Correspondingly, more than 90% enzymatic hydrolysis for glucose can be achieved (Wang et al., 2014). When the pretreatment and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation were both performed at the optimal levels, approximately 15.5 g bioethanol was yielded from 100 g wheat straw (Qiu et al., 2018). Moreover, the main chemical, phosphoric acid, can be recycled at least 11 times for lignocellulose pretreatment (Yao et al., 2019). More recent results indicated that a multi-product platform for bioethanol, lignin and ultra-high surface area carbon was successfully integrated based on the PHP pretreatment for lignocellulose (Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, the PHP pretreatment technique is promising for efficient lignocellulose refining according to these results. Unexpectedly, a large amount of tail-gas was observed when the lignocellulosic feedstocks were pretreated with PHP; moreover, some accessories of the pretreatment device, such as the latex tailpipe and the silicone sealing ring, were rapidly aged by the derived tail-gas (Supplementary Fig. S1). These observations triggered us to valorize the released tail-gas in a reasonable way to avoid the potential corrosion risk as much as possible and build a more integrated biorefinery platform. Organic contaminants, especially the refractory organic pollutants, are growing dramatically with the rapid development of modern industry and society. Their persistent accumulation in aquatic environments causes serious damage to human health and ecological security. Efficient treatment of these organic contaminants is strongly required in the real world, and this topic is widely focused on by the scientific community (Ahmed et al., 2021; Show et al., 2021). A widely investigated technique, the advanced oxidation process (AOP), realizes the effective degradation of refractory organic pollutants with non-selectivity via the highly reactive radicals, such as HO·, O2·- and SO4·- (Chen et al., 2021). Compared with other AOPs, the oxidative gas involved in AOPs, such as ozone, H2O2/O3, UV/O3 (Gomes et al., 2017) and UV/Cl2 (Tian et al., 2020), can simplify the operational process, reduce the sludge and promote efficient degradation (Malik et al., 2020). According to a critical comparison of the energy efficiency of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order values, the electrical energy per order value of the oxidative gases involved in AOPs was estimated to be < 1 kWh/m3, which was lower than that of other AOPs (Miklos et al., 2018). However, the large amount of energy consumed by the oxidative gas supply is challenging the application (Srivastav et al., 2018). Therefore, it is essential to seek a more cost-efficient method in the area of oxidative gas-based AOPs. Considering this application challenge of the oxidative gas involved in AOPs, the valorization of the derived tail-gas offers the possibility to achieve a gas-based AOP. This will create a brand-new technology to control organic pollutants based on the lignocellulose pretreatment platform once this cross-border attempt becomes feasible. However, to verify the proposed method, scientific investigations should be performed to smooth some knowledge gaps, mainly including the feasibility of organic pollutant degradation by the derived tail-gas and the technical compatibility with lignocellulosic feedstocks and organic pollutants, as well as the underlying mechanisms. To achieve these investigation aims, first of all, the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment was introduced into a solution of methylene blue (MB) to check the technical feasibility of organic pollutant degradation by the derived tail-gas. Based on the MB solution, the technical mechanisms of organic pollutant degradation by the derived tail-gas were investigated. Afterwards, in addition to MB, other six pollutants, namely rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO), malachite green (MG), resorcinol (RC), tetracycline (TC) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), were also selected to check the technical compatibility to pollutants. Moreover, PHP pretreatment of six typical lignocellulosic biomasses was tested for MB degradation to display the feedstock compatibility of this method. Besides, the analysis of potential byproducts and the cytotoxicity assessment of the degraded MB were performed to evaluate the environmental risks of the effluent after degradation by the tail-gas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to valorize the tail-gas from lignocellulose PHP pretreatment for organic pollutant degradation. Furthermore, a novel “Win–Win–Win” concept of waste control and waste valorization for biofuels/bioproducts will be potentially integrated to form a more sustainable lignocellulose biorefinery process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Lignocellulose,"2.1 Lignocellulose Based on their typical composition characteristics ( Table 1), six lignocellulosic feedstocks, namely wheat straw, corn stover, Jerusalem artichoke (JA) stalks, rice straw, birch sawdust and oak sawdust, were selected for PHP pretreatment to generate tail-gas for testing the organic pollutant degradation potential. Agricultural residues of wheat straw, corn stover, rice straw and JA stalks were collected from the farm of Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China; the woody feedstocks of birch and oak sawdust were collected from a furniture factory in Dujiangyan City, Chengdu, China. The collected raw materials were air-dried, and milled through a 40-mesh sieve before loading for the PHP pretreatment."
3,Lignocellulose pretreatment,"2.2 Lignocellulose pretreatment PHP pretreatment was performed on the selected feedstocks in a previously designed lab-scale device to collect the tail-gas for degrading the organic pollutants (as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2). In total, 12.0 g lignocellulosic biomass (dry basis) and 120.0 g of the PHP solution (the final fraction of H3PO4 and H2O2 was 65% and 7.06%, respectively) were evenly mixed in a 500-mL bottle for pretreatment. The pretreatment was carried out at 55°Ϲ with a rotary shaking frequency of 180 rpm for 2.0 h. During pretreatment, the produced gas was introduced into the organic pollutant solution in a degradation bottle for pollutant degradation. After pretreatment, the cellulose fraction was washed for the subsequent enzymatic saccharification and bioconversion (Qiu et al., 2017). The hemicellulose and lignin fractions were also recovered from the solids, and the H3PO4 could be recycled for the next batch according to previous work (Yao et al., 2019)."
4,Organic pollutant degradation,"2.3 Organic pollutant degradation Seven organic pollutant models (MB, RhB, MO, MG, RC, TC and HCB) were selected for the degradation test using the tail-gas. As exhibited in Supplementary Fig. S2, the tail-gas was introduced into the degradation bottle with 8.0 mL of the corresponding pollutant solution. The concentration of these organic pollutants was controlled at 100 mg∙L−1 for the investigations of degradation performances. Besides, the concentration of RhB and MG were promoted from 100 mg∙L−1 to 2000 mg∙L−1 to investigate the maximum degradation potential of the tail-gas. The degradation reaction was performed at room temperature without agitation. It could also be observed that the water vapor released from the pretreatment accompanying the tail-gas affected the determination of the pollutant concentration because the condensed water diluted the pollutant solution. The difference in volume before and after degradation was recorded as the condensed water volume to eliminate its effect on calculating the concentration. According to the change in concentration before and after degradation, the removal efficiency of the corresponding pollutant was accurately calculated by discounting the condensed water."
5,Determination of model pollutants,"2.4 Determination of model pollutants MB, RhB, MO and MG concentrations were determined by a UV–visible spectrometer (UV-2102, Unico, USA) at wavelengths of 664 nm, 554 nm, 463 nm and 617 nm, respectively. RC, TC and HCB were measured by a HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) system (1260 Infinity ІІ Quaternary System, Agilent, USA). The HPLC was equipped with a C18 column (120 EC, 4.6 × 150 mm, 4 µm particle size, Agilent, USA) and a variable wavelength detector. The mobile phase for RC determination was a mixture of methyl alcohol and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (60:40, v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. Acetonitrile and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (15 mmol L−1, pH = 2.9) at a ratio of 30:70 (v/v) was used as the mobile phase for TC determination, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL min−1. A mixture of acetonitrile and pure water (80:20, v/v) was used as the mobile phase for HCB with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. During the determination, the injection volume for these three samples was set at 10 μL each, and the column oven temperature was set at 30 °C. The corresponding wavelength of the variable wavelength detector was set at 277 nm for RC, 270 nm for TC, and 233 nm for HCB."
6,Composition of the tail-gas,"2.5 Composition of the tail-gas To clarify the main composition of the tail-gas from the PHP pretreatment, 8.0 mL of nano-pure water was used to absorb the tail-gas. The absorption liquid was determined by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system (TQ8050 NX, Shimadzu, Japan) with a headspace injector (AOC-6000, Shimadzu, Japan). In total, 1.0 mL of the absorption liquid was transferred into 20.0-mL vials of the headspace analyzer and the headspace injection was maintained at 60 °C for 20 min to equilibrate the temperature. A capillary column (SH-Stabilwax-DA, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, Shimadzu, Japan) was used for separation, with helium (99.999%) as the carrier gas. The flow rate was controlled at 44.3 cm s−1 with a split ratio of 1:10. The oven temperature was initially held at 50 °C for 1.0 min and gradually increased to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, then was finally held for 5.0 min. Electron ionization mode at 70 eV was set for the mass spectrometer, and the full-scan mode was applied with mass-to-charge ratio in the range of 29–500. The temperature of the ion source and the transfer line were set at 200 °C and 240 °C, respectively."
7,Determination of free radicals,"2.6 Determination of free radicals To clarify the real contributor to the degradation of the model pollutants, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) with a purity of 97% was used as the spin-trapping agent to detect the potential reactive oxygen species (Du et al., 2018). In total, 25 μL of 200 mM DMPO was mixed with 100 μL of the absorption liquid of the tail-gas and immediately transferred into a 100-μL capillary tube for measurement by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (E-500, Bruker, Germany). The microwave frequency was 9.8 GHz at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and the modulation amplitude was 1.0 G. The full microwave power achieved by a klystron reached 20 mW, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded with a sweep width of 100 G."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis All degradation tests of the pollutants were performed in duplicate. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on the data using SPSS software (Version 26.0, IBM Corp., NY). All the results are displayed as the mean with error bars or standard deviations. The Duncan multiple range test was applied to check the significance amongst different runs."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Feasibility of tail-gas from PHP pretreatment to degrade organic pollutants,"3.1 Feasibility of tail-gas from PHP pretreatment to degrade organic pollutants Wheat straw was pretreated with PHP to check the feasibility of degrading organic pollutants with the tail-gas; MB was used as the model pollutant. Correspondingly, phosphoric acid alone and hydrogen peroxide alone were also used to pretreat wheat straw as two comparisons. According to Fig. 1a, the PHP pretreatment of wheat straw released 2283.3 mL of tail-gas, but almost no tail-gas was observed in the phosphoric acid-only and hydrogen peroxide-only groups. Thus, the phenomenon of tail-gas generation may be a unique characteristic of PHP pretreatment. When the tail-gas was introduced into the MB, rapid decoloration could be observed, and the decoloration rate of the MB reached approximately 96.0%. There was no decoloration in the phosphoric acid-only group, and 5.4% in the hydrogen peroxide-only group. From these results, it can be deduced that the MB decoloration was directly related to the tail-gas derived from the PHP pretreatment. It is well-known that MB can be decolored when a reductant is introduced, but blue will be recovered as an oxidative environment is introduced (Mills et al., 2009). To exclude MB decoloration by the reduction reaction, the MB solution decolored by the tail-gas was exposed to air, even added 1.0 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide as a stronger oxidant. Both of these groups showed no color recovery even after the experiment lasted for 24 h (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results prove that there were no reductive fractions in the tail-gas, and MB decoloration had nothing to do with the reduction reaction. Besides, the pH of the tail-gas absorption liquid decreased to lower than 3.0 after PHP pretreatment. Therefore, the MB solution was adjusted from 7.0 to 2.0 to check the color change of MB solution. According to Supplementary Fig. S4 , the absorbance at 664 nm of the pH-adjusted MB did not display a significant difference (p < 0.05). This result indicates that the decrease in pH from tail-gas did not relate to the MB decoloration in this work. According to these results, it can be deduced that the MB degradation was probably related to the decoloration. Therefore, full-wavelength scanning at 200–1000 nm by a UV–visible spectrometer was conducted to confirm this possibility. The characteristic peaks of MB could be observed at 664 nm, 610 nm and 291 nm (Florence and Naorem, 2014) (Fig. 1b). However, these three characteristic peaks disappeared when the decolored MB solution was scanned; moreover, the scanning curve basically overlapped with that of the tail-gas absorption liquid. This result proved that the MB underwent a substantial degradation reaction as the tail-gas was introduced. In addition to MB, similar results could also be achieved with other azo dyes, such as RhB, MO and MG (Supplementary Fig. S5). The results demonstrate that the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment had the ability to degrade organic pollutants."
11,Elucidating the possible mechanisms of organic pollutant degradation by the tail-gas,"3.2 Elucidating the possible mechanisms of organic pollutant degradation by the tail-gas 3.2.1 Recognizing the tail-gas components It is crucial to recognize the main components of the tail-gas so that the underlying mechanisms of MB degradation can be understood well. GC-MS analysis of the absorption liquid of the tail-gas indicated that the main detectable components were organic acids, among which acetic acid and formic acid made up the majority (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S1). These organic acids can be explained by the oxidative degradation of lignocellulosic fractions, such as lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, by the PHP pretreatment, because previously published papers indicated that complete hemicellulose removal and above 70% lignin removal could be achieved by PHP pretreatment (Wang et al., 2016). When the collected tail-gas was directly identified by GC-MS, CO2 was the main detectable fraction; this was also double-checked in a Ca(OH)2 solution (Supplementary Fig. S7). The formation of CO2 in the tail-gas was mainly related to the excessive oxidation of the lignocellulosic fractions or their degraded fractions (Wang et al., 2018). In addition, a rapid self-exothermic process could be observed during the PHP pretreatment of various lignocellulosic feedstocks (Supplementary Fig. S8). This process caused a temperature change in the range of 70–130°Ϲ during the PHP pretreatment. Moreover, the maximum temperature caused by the exothermic process using different feedstocks basically matched the starting-point of the released tail-gas. Based on these results, tail-gas generation could be described as the PHP pretreatment oxidizing the lignocellulose fractions to CO2 and organic acids, such as acetic acid and formic acid. The rapid self-exothermic process drove the volatilization of the organic acids with CO2 as the tail-gas, and the organic acids could be condensed and dissolved into the absorption liquid. However, these recognized components of the tail-gas obviously could not have achieved the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants. Thus, the oxidative substances that caused the degradation of organic pollutants still needed to be identified. Some thermally unstable substances are very hard to detect by GC-MS (Koželj and Prosen, 2021). Thus, HPLC analysis (the detailed procedure in the Supplementary information) was applied. This analysis identified two oxidative substances, namely H2O2 and peracetic acid (PAA), in the PHP slurry (drawn directly from the pretreatment) and the absorption liquid (Supplementary Fig. S9). It was deduced that the H2O2 and PAA detected in the absorption liquid may have come from the PHP pretreatment via volatilization by a self-exothermic process. To check the contribution of H2O2 to the degradation of organic pollutants, a PHP solution (65.0% H3PO4 and 7.1% H2O2) and the corresponding concentration of H2O2 solution were heated to 130°Ϲ to simulate the temperature achieved by a self-exothermic process. A small amount of gas could be captured from the PHP and H2O2, but almost no MB degradation could be detected (Supplementary Fig. S10). Furthermore, the corresponding concentration H2O2 was directly added to the MB solution, and no MB degradation was detected (Supplementary Fig. S10). These results excluded the possibility that the H2O2 detected in the absorption liquid was related to MB degradation. According to the HPLC determination, the concentration of PAA in the PHP slurry and the absorption liquid was 71.0 mmol L−1 and 8.9 mmol L−1, respectively. Therefore, 10.0 mmol L−1 to 70.0 mmol L−1 as the final concentration of PAA was directly added into the MB solution and kept for 5.0 h. MB degradation could be observed (Supplementary Fig. S11) but only 19.0–52.8% MB was degraded with the increased concentration of PAA, which was greatly lower than that of the tail-gas (96.0%) (Fig. 1a). Thus, the self-generated PAA in the tail-gas may be a possible contributor to the degradation by oxidization of pollutants. 3.2.2 Uncovering the possible degradation mechanisms In many investigations, PAA has been widely used for the waste(water) disinfection and oxidation of aqueous pollutants by forming highly oxidative radical species (e.g., HO·, O2·-, HO2·acyl and peracyl radicals) (Luukkonen and Pehkonen, 2017). The electron paramagnetic resonance determination with DMPO as a trapping reagent indicated a four-line signal that displayed a 1:2:2:1 intensity ratio with a hyperfine coupling constant of AN = AH = 14.9 G ( Fig. 2a). These ESR characteristics were consistent with the formation of the spin adduct DMPO-OH, indicating the formation of HO·(Yan et al., 2019). Furthermore, a quantitative investigation of the generation of HO·in the absorption liquid was carried out by HPLC with benzene as a probe (the detailed procedure in the Supplementary information). Fig. 2b shows that the average hydroxyl radical generation rate was calculated as 26.7 μmol∙L−1∙min−1 from the tail-gas. This was approximately 20–90 times than that of typical Fenton (-like) techniques (0.3–1.1 μmol∙L−1∙min−1) (Miao et al., 2018), and 270–600 times than that of photocatalytic techniques (4.4 ×10−2–9.7 × 10−2 μmol∙L−1∙min−1) (Tai et al., 2018). In addition, Fig. 2b also shows that MB degradation had a positive correlation with the HO·generation intensity (R2 =0.974, p < 0.01). These results strongly indicate that the free radicals formed during the release of tail-gas were mainly responsible for the organic pollutant degradation. Although these results provided a supportive explanation of the highly efficient MB degradation, the formation of radicals from PAA is limited by a rate-determining step of the homolysis of the oxygen–oxygen bond (CH3COOOH→ CH3COO·+ HO·). This bond generally requires activation by the involvement of a transition metal catalyst, activated carbon or UV irradiation (Luukkonen and Pehkonen, 2017). Obviously, these activation methods did not exist in the tail-gas releasing process. According to recent works, the homolysis of PAA can also be achieved by thermal activation (Wang et al., 2020). In this work, a rapid self-exothermic process occurred during the PHP pretreatment, and the highest temperature could reach 70–130 °Ϲ, depending on the feedstocks used. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the self-exothermic process drove the volatilized self-generated PAA from PHP pretreatment to degrade the pollutants via the free radicals from thermally activated PAA. To test this hypothesis, different concentrations (150–450 mmol L−1) of PAA were added to phosphoric acid with a final fraction of 65%. When the temperature of 130 °Ϲ was maintained for 10 min to simulate the rapid self-exothermic process, 4.9–29.8 mmol L−1 PAA was detected in the absorption liquid (Supplementary Fig. S12). These results showed that the PAA generated by the PHP pretreatment could be volatilized by the self-exothermic process. Consequently, 85.5–98.7% MB degradation was achieved (Supplementary Fig. S13), which was almost equal to that of the tail-gas. Besides, Supplementary Fig. S14 indicates that phenol generation was detected with the benzene probe, strongly suggesting the formation of HO·. Moreover, after introduction of the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment, the temperature of the MB solution could increase to 60–100°Ϲ through heat exchange (Supplementary Fig. S15). As reported previously, these temperatures were enough to thermally activate the PAA to form HO·(Wang et al., 2020). Thus, this demonstrated that the efficient MB degradation by tail-gas could mainly be attributed to the free radicals formed via the thermal activation of PAA. In addition to the PAA, some other organic acids, such as formic acid, propanoic acid and valeric acid, were also detected in the absorption liquid (Supplementary Table S1). Their corresponding peroxy acids, such as performic acid and propaneperoxoic acid, were also probably self-generated (RCO2H + H2O2 ⇌ RCO3H + H2O) during PHP pretreatment (Jung and Chang, 2021), and some may potentially be volatilized from the PHP pretreatment as the oxidants. These points clearly indicate the efficient MB degradation by the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment, and the tail-gas may act as the oxidative gas to integrate a new AOP for organic pollutant degradation. The main mechanisms of this method are summarized in Fig. 3. The organic peroxy acids may be self-generated during PHP pretreatment of lignocellulose, and the self-exothermic process drove volatilization of the organic peroxy acids with the derived CO2 as a carrier. The self-exothermic process also thermally activated the organic peroxy acids to form organic radicals, such as HC(O)O·and C2H5C(O)O·, causing efficient pollutant degradation."
12,Performances of the tail-gas to degrade organic pollutants,"3.3 Performances of the tail-gas to degrade organic pollutants 3.3.1 Pollutant compatibility In addition to the four aforementioned azo dyes, three other typical refractory organic pollutants, including the phenolic pollutant (RC) (Sun et al., 2020), a pharmaceutical and personal care product (TC) (Peiris et al., 2017), and an endocrine disrupting chemical (HCB) (Tong and Yuan, 2012), were tested for potential degradation by the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment. These organic pollutants are popularly used in many studies to investigate suitable and efficient degradation approaches. In this section, wheat straw was PHP-pretreated under similar pretreatment conditions to yield the tail-gas. According to Fig. 4a, above 90% degradation of these azo dyes (100 mg L−1, 8.0 mL) could be achieved; in particular, almost complete degradation could be achieved for MG and RhB. In addition, more than 90% TC (8.0 mL, 100 mg·L−1) could be degraded by the derived tail-gas. Although slight decreases appeared in the degradation of RC and HCB (8.0 mL, 100 mg L−1), the tail-gas still could achieve a degradation rate of 80.8% and 73.8%, respectively. Correspondingly, the degradation efficiency of MB, RhB, MO, and MG in this work could be calculated as 3.1 × 10−4 mmol·min−1, 2.4 × 10−4 mmol min−1, 3.4 × 10−4 mmol min−1 and 3.1 × 10−4 mmol min−1, respectively. Currently, AOPs are the mostly reported methods for the efficient degradation of these pollutants. By contrast, the reported degradation efficiencies of these azo dyes were in the range of 2.4 × 10−4–3.4 × 10−4 mmol min−1 within the literature (Supplementary Table S2) (Bañuelos et al., 2016; Diao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Natarajan et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2011; Zhan et al., 2013). For the RC, TC and HCB, in this work, their degradation efficiencies were estimated to be 9.8 × 10−9–2.8 × 10−4 mmol·min−1, which is competitive with currently existing methods in other studies (Supplementary Table S3) (Li et al., 2019; López et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2020; Shih et al., 2011; Wang and Yuan, 2021; Xie et al., 2021). It is worth mentioning that the whole degradation process of these pollutants could be rapidly finished in 6–7 min, as seen in Fig. 4a. A degradation kinetic analysis indicated that the degradation reaction of these pollutants was simulated well by the pseudo-first-order model with correlation coefficients (R2) in the range of 0.958–0.995 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table S4). The rate constant K for the degradation of these pollutants could reach 0.244–0.788 min−1. This was about 10–102 times than that of the degradation of these pollutants by AOPs in previously reported results (Luan et al., 2011; Wang and Yuan, 2021), again suggesting the rapid degradation by the tail-gas. As displayed in Fig. 4a, the tail-gas almost completely degraded some pollutants, such as MG and RhB, at their corresponding concentration of 100 mg L−1, implying that these pollutants could be degraded more. Therefore, the initial concentration of MG and RhB was increased to 2000 mg L−1 to check the degradation potential of the tail-gas. According to Fig. 5, a 98.5% RhB degradation rate still could be achieved at the initial concentration of 2000 mg L−1, although the degradation rate slightly decreased with the increase in the initial concentration. The MG degradation showed no significant decrease with the increase in the initial concentration, even at an extra high concentration of 5000 mg L−1 (data not shown). These results indicate that the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment has an especially high capacity to degrade some organic pollutants, displaying a great potential for real-world applications. 3.3.2 Feedstock compatibility Besides wheat straw, several representative lignocellulosic feedstocks – agricultural residues of corn stover, JA stalks and rice straw, and woody residues of oak and birch sawdust – were also selected to evaluate their functional compatibility for the degradation of organic pollutants. According to Fig. 6a, the tail-gas from the PHP pretreatment of these lignocellulosic feedstocks all demonstrated MB degradation. The tail-gas from agricultural residues achieved relatively higher MB degradation: corn stover, wheat straw and JA stalks degraded 98.3%, 95.2% and 94.0% MB, respectively. Although the MB degradation by the tail-gas from rice straw decreased slightly, it still achieved 81.3%. By contrast, the MB degradation of oak and birch sawdust was 70.2% and 68.0%, respectively, which was relatively lower than that of agricultural residues. The degradation kinetics indicated that the degradation process was also described well by the pseudo-first-order model with R2 in the range of 0.965–0.998 (Fig. 6b). Correspondingly, the degradation rate constant (K) of MB (100 mg∙L−1) degradation reached 0.448 min−1, 0.437 min−1, 0.360 min−1, 0.133 min−1, 0.176 min−1 and 0.165 min−1, respectively, using the tail-gas from wheat straw, corn stover, JA stalks, rice straw, oak sawdust and birch sawdust, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). According to the MB degradation results, the starting time-point for MB degradation was different among these feedstocks. Woody biomass started at 48–50 min, which was earlier than that of agricultural residues (60–106 min). Moreover, the monitored yield of tail-gas was positively correlated with MB degradation (Supplementary Fig. S16). Probably, the tail-gas generation results may relate to the characteristics of the selected feedstock. For example, the content of lignin and carbohydrate in agricultural residues was significantly lower than that in woody biomass. Moreover, lignin in agricultural residue is generally characterized by p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringyl, which is typically different from the lignin in woody feedstocks (guaiacyl for softwood; guaiacyl and syringyl for hardwood) (Buranov and Mazza, 2008). Besides, hemicellulose is mainly dominated by xylan in agricultural residue and hardwood, whereas the main component of hemicellulose is mannan in softwood (Sánchez, 2009). The mineral fraction and content in these feedstocks were also significantly different (Le et al., 2017). These minerals, especially some transition metals, could potentially serve as catalysts to activate the oxidative degradation of lignocellulose in PHP pretreatment to trigger tail-gas production (Liu et al., 2018). Of course, this hypothesized function of the mineral fractions in biomass deserves more investigation in future work. 3.3.3 Environmental risks To verify the potential environmental risk of the effluent after degradation of the pollutant by the tail-gas oxidization, the absorption liquid of tail-gas, degraded MB and untreated MB were evaluated by HPLC-MS (the detailed procedure in the Supplementary information). According to Fig. 7a, an obvious peak at a retention time of 4.33 min in the untreated MB was recognized as MB; however, this could not be detected in the degraded MB solution according to the total ion chromatograms. Moreover, no new peaks appeared when comparing the total ion chromatograms of the degraded MB and the absorption liquid. These results indicated that the MB was almost degraded completely by the oxidative tail-gas, which meant the very low environmental risk of the effluent after degradation. Furthermore, Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were used to check the cytotoxicity of the effluent after degradation (Zhang et al., 2018) (the detailed procedure in the Supplementary information). According to Fig. 7b, the relative viability of L-929 (mouse fibroblast, Mus musculus) cells in the untreated MB was 80.4%. It has been reported that cationic MB could penetrate the cellular membrane through the attractive force because the surface of the cellular membrane is negative, as it consists of phospholipid groups (Intarasuwan et al., 2017). By contrast, the relative viability of L-929 cells in degraded MB was 103.5%, obviously displaying that the effluent after degradation had no cytotoxicity. This result corresponded well to no byproduct being detected after oxidative degradation by the tail-gas. Therefore, the tail-gas could thoroughly oxidize organic pollutants and display better environmental friendliness. Of course, the degradation of different organic pollutants by the tail-gas will produce different final byproducts in the effluent, and more investigations should be performed in future work. Based on the performance of organic pollutants degradation, the currently developed AOP using the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment displayed excellent compatibility with pollutants and feedstocks, as well as the relatively lower environmental risks, which offers great possibilities for application. Moreover, the AOP strategy integrates waste tail-gas and pollutant control. This will be more competitive compared with the traditional AOPs or emerging AOPs in terms of cost reduction. In a biorefinery platform for waste lignocellulose, 100.0 g lignocellulose (wheat straw) yielded approximately 11.2 g bioethanol after PHP pretreatment (Qiu et al., 2017), as well as 4.5 g high-purity lignin (Wan et al., 2018). Besides, the waste water released from PHP pretreatment successfully prepared ultra-high surface area carbon (Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, further integrating the pollutant control of tail-gas into the currently existing PHP pretreatment platform will achieve a new “Win–Win–Win” concept of pollutant control by waste and the waste valorization of biofuels/bioproducts."
13,Conclusions,"In addition to efficient lignocellulose deconstruction, PHP pretreatment exhibited a distinctive feature of releasing an oxidative tail-gas. Its oxidability was mainly attributed to the self-generated organic peroxy acids in the pretreatment. The unique self-exothermic process achieved a maximum of 130°Ϲ during the pretreatment. This drove the volatilization of organic peroxy acids with the generated CO2 to form the tail-gas. The self-exothermic process built a new AOP by thermally activating peroxy acids as free radicals. The tail-gas degraded various organic pollutants, such as MB, RhB, MO, MG, RC, TC and HCB, by 73.8–99.5% with a corresponding degradation efficiency of 2.4 × 10−4–9.8 × 10−4 mmol∙min−1. The tail-gas from six typical lignocellulosic feedstocks, including agricultural residues, softwood and hardwood, efficiently degraded MB by 68.0–98.3% with a degradation efficiency of 1.3 × 10−4–2.9 × 10−4 mmol∙min−1. Moreover, the MB was almost completely degraded with a relative viability of 103.5% of L-929 cells in the cytotoxicity assessment, implying better environmental friendliness. These results showed that the tail-gas from PHP pretreatment has the comprehensive pollutant and feedstock compatibility, and displays a great potential for application."
