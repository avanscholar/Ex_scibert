0,Introduction,"Over the past few years, we witnessed that developments of renewable energy have been a bandwagon action everywhere to solve the problems associated with anomalous global warming effects and the vast demand of fossil fuel supplies for those uprising industrialized nations. Among all sorts of renewable energy types, hydrogen energy is deemed as the most popular candidate due to the fact that it is regarded as a storage form of “secondary energy” for a wide range of energy utilization. Hydrogen has a myriad of merits from the environmental and ecological standpoints such as zero pollution, lowest environmental impact, high thermal content and combustibility [1–4]. Prof. J.A. Dumesic at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA, has conducted a lot of pioneering research on catalytic bioconversion and bio-refinery. Recently, Cortright and coworkers of Prof. Dumesic’s group [5] further developed a technique for bio-hydrogen generation through aqueous-phase sugar and alcohols reforming at 227 °C to manifest a feasible route to gain hydrogen production by direct biomass reforming in the aqueous phase, where the cellulose and hemi-cellulose in the biomass can be hydrolyzed into reduced sugar under the chemical reaction driven by heat and acid, whereby, the produced sugar will become a workable feedstock for the biological fermentation process. Currently a higher biomass utilization rate can be practically achieved by the aqueous-phase biomass reforming process. The biomass can be reformed in terms of physical, chemical or biological means into secondary energy carriers, which are in turn to be used as the energy source to deliver heat, electricity, solid fuels, liquid fuels or gaseous fuels. In the pioneering work of hydrogen production by aqueous-phase biomass reforming, Valenzuela and coworkers [7] used woodchips as biomass in sulfuric acid and platinum catalyst at 227 °C for 3 h. A United States National Science Foundation (NSF) report [8] stated that the long chain alkanes were produced by aqueous-phase biomass reforming. Furthermore most of the oil companies around the world became interested in in-depth bio-refinery research to develop liquid fuels extracted from biomass. In addition, Dumesic and coworkers [5] also demonstrated the possibility to produce hydrogen by aqueous-phase biomass reforming process, which consisted of two major reactions, namely reforming and water gas shifting, to be operated at a much lower temperature as compared to gasification or thermal cracking of biomass. In the aqueous-phase reforming reaction of methanol and ethylene glycol, a very high hydrogen selectivity rate around 96% was realized. To date, a series of metallic catalysts used for bio-refinery to produce hydrogen consist of elemental catalysts including Pt, Ni, Pd, Ru, Ir and bimetal catalysts such as Ni–Sn. The metallic catalysts are carried over porous inorganic media such as alumina (Al2O3), titania (TiO2), silica (SiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2). Opposed to current examples for the catalysts used for bio-refinery, a different approach was employed to evenly deposit Pt and Pt–Ru nanocatalysts onto the porous carbon textile by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process [9]. In the EPD route, the nanocatalysts made into the colloidal form with surface charge can be moved under the influence of applied electrical field and are eventually deposited on the oppositely charged electrode such as the carbon textile in our case. Use of the EPD process allows us to generate a uniform ultra-thin layer of deposit on the surfaces of working electrodes of different geometries associated with tightly controlled deposited thickness or amount of material to be coated on the substrates. In this study, bio-hydrogen production via the aqueous-phase reforming of biomass (α-cellulose) by Pt catalysts on activated carbon nanoparticles (Pt/C) and Pt–Ru bimetal catalysts on activated carbon (PtRu/C) is proposed. The catalyst was prepared by EPD process or dip-coating process by effectively introducing Pt/C or PtRu/C nanoparticles to be coated onto the surface of the carbon textile support. The yield of gaseous phase products was in-line monitored and analyzed regarding the overall production of bio-hydrogen."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of the catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of the catalyst Commercially available carbon textile (E-TEK, EMT67S) was employed as the catalyst support and then it was calcined under an ambient condition in a box furnace at 500 °C for 1 h to enhance the hydrophobicity of the carbon textile. To prepare the EPD or dipping solution, approximately 150 mg Pt/C nanocatalysts (40 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, E-TEK, Pt particle size of 2–3 nm) or PtRu/C nanocatalysts (40 wt% PtRu on Vulcan XC-72, BASF, PtRu particle size of 2–3 nm) were evenly dispersed in 150 ml ethanol and 0.3 ml Nafion solution by the aid of ultrasonic agitation for 15 min. This solution was prepared for EPD suspension to form the catalyst layers. Both working electrode and counter-electrode in the EPD tank were connected to a high-voltage d.c. power supply (Glassman, model NJO8829) and a computer-controlled waveform programming controller. A voltage of 500 V was applied between the platinum counter-electrode and the carbon textile working electrode with an area of 5 cm2, and the distance between these two electrodes was 2.5 cm, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Normally, the adequate deposition time for the entire EPD process depends on the desired amount of nanocatalysts to be coated on the carbon support and the colloidal characteristic of the EPD suspension. In this study, we used a fixed deposition time of 50 min for each EPD run. The resultant microstructure and amount of Pt/C or PtRu/C catalysts were determined via an in-situ control of externally applied electrical field, deposition time, and addition of Nafion® content in the EPD suspension. The deposited carbon textile, which was loaded with nanocatalysts, was baked in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h to remove the residue of organic solvent. The specific catalyst loading for this study was set at 0.75 mg/cm2 for Pt/C and PtRu/C samples, as shown in Fig. 2 . The prepared catalyst sheets were rolled up into rod-like hollow pellets (7 mm in diameter by 25 mm long), which were carefully fastened with carbon adhesive tapes, as shown in Fig. 3 ."
3,Experimental,"2.2 Experimental To process an aqueous-phase biomass reforming reaction over carbon textile supported Pt catalysts or Pt–Ru bimetallic catalysts for bio-hydrogen generation, 15.3 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid was added into the autoclave reactor containing 15 g α-cellulose (Sigma, 9004-34-6) and an equivalent weight of 18.75 mg Pt/C or PtRu/C mixed in 300 ml de-ionized water. The reactor was pressurized with argon gas up to 15.3 psi and was heated from room temperature at the rate of 2 °C/min to the reaction temperature of 195–235 °C for 3 h. The composition of gaseous products and reduced sugar concentration in the aqueous phase were analyzed after the reforming reaction. The schematic procedures for the reaction are shown in Fig. 4 . When the APR reaction finished, the gas phase sample was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (G.C., GC-1000, Chinese Chromatograph with TCD) to determine the hydrogen yield; the aqueous-phase sample concentration was determined by the DNS (3,5-dinitrosalycilic acid) solution and analyzed by a spectrophotometer (Genesys 20, Thermo Spectro) to determine the yield of the reduced sugar [6]; and the solid phase sample was washed, dried, and weighed to determine the conversion of the biomass. Glucose was used as the standard to calibrate the concentration of the reduced sugar in the aqueous product."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of the prepared catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared catalyst In this study, a novel material (carbon textile) was used as the catalyst support due to (a) light weight and flexibility for catalyst design, (b) high specific surface area by the same weight, and (c) suitability to obtain higher conversion efficiency with various rates as compared to other conventional supporting media such as alumina. The effect of surface modification of carbon textile before and after heat treatment under the ambient condition is shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a) clearly indicates that the contact angle of the carbon textile prior to the heat treatment was 110°, which was hydrophobic and not rather suitable for our hydrogen production through aqueous-phase biomass reforming. In contrast, the surface property of carbon textile used as new media of catalyst support can be further modified to be more hydrophilic because the contact angle was reduced to be approximately 40°, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In comparison with the conventional or the commercial catalyst, two preparation routes were investigated for aqueous-phase biomass reforming process. The catalyst prepared by the EPD features have some advantages including homogeneous catalyst distribution, short preparation time, less amount of catalyst usage deposited on the supporting material, and good control on the catalyst loading over the surface of carbon textile. Fig. 6 shows the microstructure of carbon textile surface (a) before and (b) after the PtRu/C nanocatalyst deposited via EPD method, with the perpendicularly interwoven pattern of the carbon fibers in the carbon textile and the uniform distribution of such catalysts over the surface of carbon fiber substrates. The result clearly manifests that the EPD process is an ideal route to load the catalysts on the carbon textile substrate as compared to other conventional techniques such as dipping, air-jet spraying, printing or brushing to obtain better catalyst utilization. For each carbon textile with an effective area of 5 cm2, the total amount of loaded catalysts was 3.75 mg to be counted for a specific catalyst loading amount of 0.75 mg/cm2. Fig. 7 (a) depicts surface groove-like anisotropic characteristics and smooth morphology of carbon fibers, which has good electrical conduction during the EPD process to be effectively deposited and make the nanocatalyst in the EPD colloid to form a thin, porous catalyst layer with a well-connected network of high specific surface area on the top of individual carbon fiber, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The PtRu/C catalyst particles can be visibly observed over activated carbon nanoparticles in the microstructure of catalyst layers on carbon fibers as seen in Fig. 8 , where the microstructure of PtRu/C catalysts was evenly distributed on the surface of carbon fiber supporting media during the preparation of our reforming catalysts."
6,Hydrogen production in the aqueous-phase reforming,"3.2 Hydrogen production in the aqueous-phase reforming Our previous work suggested that the reduced sugar can be formed by aqueous-phase reforming. With the presence of nitric acid at 170 °C, 52 wt% of the reduced sugar was generated from cellulose. With the presence of sulfuric acid, hydrogen was generated accordingly. The yield of the hydrogen can be further enhanced by introducing more of catalysts in the reforming reaction [10]. In this study, the new catalyst for the reforming reaction was used for the formation of the bio-hydrogen from α-cellulose. The blank analysis was studied using the carbon fibers by the hydrophilic pre-treatment without adding the noble metal catalyst loaded over the surface of the carbon fiber. Fig. 9 shows the yield of the gaseous products after the reaction at temperatures from 195 °C to 235 °C. The results give rise to the yield of the bio-hydrogen (around 0.2 mmol/g) and CO2 (around 1.5 mmol/g) at the reaction temperature of 235 °C, indicating that the carbon fiber is also capable of triggering the reforming reaction to produce bio-hydrogen from α-cellulose. In our tests, CO was also found in the gaseous phase product, but it was not observed in the previous studies by using Pt/Al2O3 as the catalyst."
7,The effects of catalyst,"3.3 The effects of catalyst Fig. 10 shows that four different proposed catalysts were prepared and used for the aqueous-phase reforming, namely (1) EPD-Pt, (2) EPD-PtRu, (3) Dip-Pt, and (4) Dip-PtRu. The metal catalysts were loaded onto the surface of the carbon textile and the theoretical loading of the effective noble metal was 18.75 mg of Pt or PtRu on carbon fibers. The result of bio-hydrogen production by APR reaction suggested that the yields of all gaseous phase products were monotonously increased with the reaction temperature. However, yield of the reduced sugar was diminished, which is in good agreement with the previous study. In comparison with the processes to prepare the reforming catalyst, the activity of the catalysts prepared by the dip-coating method was found to be higher than that prepared by the EPD route. With the presence of ruthenium in the supported catalyst, the yield of the bio-hydrogen was also improved. Although the catalyst prepared by EPD can easily control the catalyst surface distribution and loading, the apparent activity is lower than by the dip-coating process. This apparent result can be explained by the following facts: (a) some of the Pt/PtRu was present inside the carbon textile, and (b) the Pt/PtRu active center over the carbon textile surface was too small. Thus, the loaded active centers cannot be utilized completely for the reaction. Furthermore, the activity of the catalyst can also be determined by H2 production in the reaction. Although the highest turn over frequency (TOF) in this study is 0.77 min−1 (0.355 mmol/g) by Dip-Pt catalyst at 235 °C, it is slightly lower than those of the alumina supported Pt catalyst from the reported values in the literature [6,8,10]. In this study, a maximum yield of hydrogen production, 0.470 mmol/g-cellulose, was also attained at 235 °C. The catalyst for this result was prepared by the dip-coating process with the presence of the PtRu over the surface. Nevertheless, our process improvement regarding the catalyst loading onto carbon textile by the EPD route is still on the way for the aqueous-phase reforming to produce bio-hydrogen."
8,Conclusion,"This study provided a practical technique for the bio-hydrogen and reduced sugar production simultaneously in a one-pot reaction process. In most cases, a maximum yield of the reduced sugar was attained at a relatively lower temperature (<200 °C). On the other hand, for the cases at a reaction temperature higher than 200 °C, the yield of gaseous products will be increased. The current study also revealed that CO was formed for all samples, which was not observed in the previous study by using 0.5% Pt/Al2O3 for the reaction. The carbon fiber supported catalyst provides a good reforming environment for the bio-hydrogen generation from biomass. Current studies suggested that a monotonic increase of the biomass conversion and the reaction temperature was found for all of our studies. However, the yield of the reduced sugar was not increased at a higher temperature."
