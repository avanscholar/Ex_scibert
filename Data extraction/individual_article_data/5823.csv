0,Introduction,"Alcohol is known to be a teratogen and its consumption during pregnancy can produce a wide range of adverse effects in the developing fetus. The severity of fetal damage due to ethanol exposure depends on a number of factors that include the timing, pattern, and dose of ethanol consumed (Abel and Hannigan, 1995; Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010). The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) includes the vast range of pathological conditions that can occur when alcohol is consumed during different periods of the pregnancy (Sokol et al., 2003). The spectrum of disorders can include alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), alcohol-related neurological disorders (ARND) (Burd and Martsolf, 1989; May et al., 2009; Oesterheld et al., 1998), and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS, the most severe condition that results from in utero alcohol exposure, is characterized by a pattern of cranio-facial dysmorphologies (Jones and Smith, 1973; Sokol and Clarren, 1989), growth retardation (Sokol and Clarren, 1989), and central nervous system (CNS) impairment (Jones and Smith, 1973; Sowell et al., 2002). These deficits are generally accompanied by both structural and functional brain damage (Archibald et al., 2001; Autti-Ramo, 2002; Chen et al., 2003; Ikonomidou et al., 2000; Kerns et al., 1997; Klintsova et al., 2007; Roebuck et al., 1998; Streissguth and LaDue, 1987; West et al., 1984). Prenatal ethanol exposure has been shown to cause an increase in oxidative stress in developing organs, including the brain (Chu et al., 2007; Dembele et al., 2006; Heaton et al., 2002; Heaton et al., 2003b; Petkov et al., 1992; Ramachandran et al., 2001; Reyes et al., 1993; Smith et al., 2005). Indeed, even a brief exposure to ethanol during gestation can produce an imbalance in the brain's intracellular redox state (Dong et al., 2010) that can be correlated with behavioral deficits (Vink et al., 2005), while antioxidants have been repeatedly shown to improve these deficits (Busby et al., 2002; Neese et al., 2004; Reid et al., 1999; Vink et al., 2005) in rodent models of FASD. In fact, when compared to other organs, the brain is more susceptible to the generation of ROS. It possesses the highest oxygen metabolic rate of any organ in the body as its cells utilize 20% of the oxygen consumed by the entire organism (Sokoloff, 1999), thus having the potential to generate a high quantity of ROS during oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, brain tissues are rich in unsaturated fatty acids that can be substrates for ROS (Halliwell, 1992; Porter, 1984). Also, some brain regions have a high content of iron (Gerlach et al., 1994), which can further promote the generation of ROS. In addition, several neurotransmitters are autoxidizable (i.e., they can spontaneously react with oxygen). These include dopamine and its precursor levodopa (l-DOPA), serotonin and norepinephrine, and their reaction with oxygen can generate not only superoxide (O2 −•), but also quinones and semiquinones that can deplete the levels of the endogenous antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) and bind to protein thiol groups, which in turn can be easily oxidized (Spencer et al. 1998). Given this potential to generate elevated levels of ROS, it is surprising that the antioxidant defense system of the brain is somewhat limited. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are lower in the brain than in other organs such as the liver or kidney (Floyd and Carney, 1992). In addition, fetal cells are more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of oxidative stress than the adult brain since the levels of antioxidant enzymes and of non-enzymatic endogenous antioxidants in the developing fetus are lower when compared to the levels observed in adults (Bergamini et al., 2004; Henderson et al., 1999). For example, brain GPx and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities at gestational day (GD) 19 are only 41% and 11% of the adult values respectively, while GSH and vitamin E levels are 51% and 20% of the levels found in adulthood (Henderson et al., 1999). In the present review we will cover the most recent findings in this field and critically analyze their relevance for the understanding of the neuropathology of FASD. Moreover, as there is currently no satisfactory treatment for these disorders, we will also discuss the potential therapeutic value of antioxidants for the mitigation of neuroanatomical and behavioral deficits caused by exposure to alcohol in utero. We believe that the findings reviewed and discussed in this article might also be pertinent to other syndromes that arise as a consequence of prenatal exposure to different substances of abuse and teratogens."
1,Modeling of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in rodents,"Unlike conditions that have well defined pathologies and symptoms, FASD can be influenced by an array of factors ranging from social-economic status to amount, pattern, and timing of alcohol consumption (Ethen et al., 2009; Sokol et al., 2003). Thus the use of animal models is of particular importance in FASD research largely because they impart control over the relatively long list of extraneous variables. Specifically, animal models allow for control over the pattern of ethanol exposure (chronic, acute, or binge-like); the timing during the period of brain development at which ethanol is administered; the amount of ethanol that the fetus is exposed to; the levels of stress that the mother is experiencing during ethanol ingestion; and the caloric restriction commonly associated with ethanol consumption (Cudd, 2005; Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010). The most commonly used techniques of ethanol exposure include the consumption of ethanol liquid mixtures by the pregnant dams; delivery of ethanol by intragastric intubation; the use of vapor chambers in which pregnant dams are exposed to ethanol in a gaseous state; artificial rearing (exclusively used to deliver ethanol during the third trimester equivalent); and intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of ethanol. These have been thoroughly discussed in our recent review article (Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010). Nevertheless, since understanding the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with each different model is crucial when interpreting and correlating results from different studies, a brief description of the most commonly used models is presented below."
2,Ethanol in a liquid diet,"2.1 Ethanol in a liquid diet Adding ethanol to a liquid diet is a very effective method for self-administration of ethanol in rodents (Lieber and DeCarli, 1982; Sherwin et al., 1979; Weinberg, 1984). Using this method, rats can consume on average 12g of ethanol/kg/day (or up to 18g of ethanol/kg/day) (Berman and Hannigan, 2000). This technique is advantageous in that it is less time consuming and labor intensive than other methods, it does not require constant handling of the animals, and reliably allows for low stable BAC levels to be achieved in pregnant dams. However, this method does not control for precise dosage or timing of consumption and can only be used for pregnant dams and not neonatal pups."
3,Intragastric intubation,"2.2 Intragastric intubation In this method, an ethanol solution is delivered directly to the stomach using a gavage (or force-feeding) strategy (Cronise et al., 2001; Kelly and Tran, 1997). Doses of ethanol typically range between 2 and 6g/kg/day in this model (Berman and Hannigan, 2000). This technique allows for precise control over the dose administered, and hence accurate control of the peak BAC reached being the model of choice when mimicking a pattern of binge-like alcohol consumption. As well, it can be used in the treatment of neonate pups and thus inclusion of the third trimester equivalent is possible. However, daily intubations can be stressful to the animals, and thus the potential impact of stress has to be taken into consideration."
4,Inhalation method,"2.3 Inhalation method In this method, pregnant dams or neonates are placed in an inhalation chamber filled with ethanol vapor for several hours (Karanian et al., 1986; Miki et al., 2008; Rogers et al., 1979; Ryabinin et al., 1995). This technique is characterized by a rapid rise in BAC (Miki et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 1990). In many ways, the effects obtained with this method are comparable with the ones obtained with the intragastric intubation technique with the advantage of being less labor intensive and involving less handling of the dams and/or pups. On the downside, this technique does not mimic the most common route of alcohol administration (i.e., oral ingestion), and in some studies, pups must be removed from their mothers for extended periods of time (Miki et al., 2008)."
5,Artificial rearing,"2.4 Artificial rearing This method is used when administering ethanol during the third trimester equivalent (Dobbing and Sands, 1979). Pups are typically maintained in a cup with nesting materials, floating in warm water, designed to mimic warm nesting and maternal interaction (Kelly et al., 1988; Kelly et al., 1991; Samson and Diaz, 1981; West, 1993). The process involves surgically implanting an intragastric tube or gastric cannula into the pups' stomach (Hall, 1975) and delivering ethanol through a programmable pump. This model is reliable in producing consistent BAC levels. However, it involves an invasive procedure, and requires pups to be removed from their mother and littermates."
6,Subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections,"2.5 Subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections These routes of administration have been consistently used in acute mouse models of prenatal/early postnatal ethanol exposure (see for example, Chen et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2010; Shirpoor et al., 2009) and allow for a rapid increase in BAC with limited handling-induced stress. However, these methods are far less reliable for long-term/chronic exposure paradigms and the extremely high BACs achieved do not reflect the typical values obtained upon ethanol ingestion. Furthermore, they do not mimic the route of intake in humans (Webster et al., 1983). In conclusion, there is currently no “ideal” rodent model to mimic FASD, as all the above methods are associated with potential advantages and drawbacks. These have to be carefully taken into consideration when planning FASD studies. Furthermore, caution is needed when comparing different studies that used distinct FASD rodent models, as the particular characteristics of each model might have influenced the results."
7,What is oxidative stress?,"Oxidative stress is a general term used to describe a serious imbalance between ROS production and the levels of antioxidant defenses that cause oxidative damage in a cell, tissue, or organ (Sies, 1991). Intracellular ROS are produced in mitochondria as a by-product of normal cellular metabolism (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1990) and in the cytoplasm via the xanthine oxidase and reduced nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) pathways (Gao et al., 2003; Infanger et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2006). In addition, oxidative stress may result from exposure to a variety of agents present in the environment. External sources of ROS include radiation, UV light, chemical reagents, pollution, cigarette smoke, drugs of abuse, and ethanol (Zadak et al., 2009). ROS can play physiological roles in signal transduction, but in excess can cause the oxidative damage of cellular macromolecules including proteins (Dean et al., 1997), lipids (such as the phospholipids that form cellular membranes), and DNA, thus compromising numerous intracellular pathways, cellular integrity, and causing genetic alterations (Finkel and Holbrook, 2000; Halliwell, 1991). This can ultimately culminate in cell death and, in the case of the CNS, neurodegeneration (Halliwell, 2007; Janssen-Heininger et al., 2008). In order to prevent ROS-induced cellular damage organisms have adopted a variety of defense mechanisms that can be referred to as the endogenous antioxidant system (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1995). Endogenous antioxidants (which can either inhibit the formation of ROS or promote the removal or scavenging of free radicals and their precursors) can be further subdivided in two major groups, non-enzymatic and enzymatic. Endogenous non-enzymatic antioxidants include thiols and GSH (Halliwell, 2006). Enzymatic antioxidants include (1) SODs, which inactivate O2 −• and exist as copper/zinc-containg SODs in the cytosol or manganese-containing SODs in the mitochondria (Fridovich, 1997); (2) catalase, an iron-containing enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by reducing it to water (Percy, 1984); and (3) the GPx system, which encompasses the enzymes GPx and glutathione reductase (GR) and uses GSH and NADPH as co-factors. GPx reduces hydrogen peroxide and other organic peroxides at the expense of GSH, which is in turn oxidized to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG). GSH is regenerated by GR with the consumption of NADPH (Halliwell, 2006). Additionally, GSH also transports amino acids across the cellular membrane through the γ-glutamyl cycle and acts as a co-factor for the detoxification of certain drugs and chemicals as well as other reactive molecules by the enzyme GST. In the brain, most GST is located in glial cells (which are also rich in GSH), helping protect neuronal populations that have a low content of this co-factor (Hayes and Strange, 1995; Meister, 1988; Salinas and Wong, 1999). Given its extensive list of functions, GSH is probably the most important endogenous non-enzymatic antioxidant. A decrease in the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes may indicate that these enzymes were oxidized due to an increase in ROS production. Alternatively, a reduction in enzymatic activity may be the result of a decreased synthesis of these enzymes. On the other hand, an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes may often be explained as an adaptive reaction to an excess production of ROS (Haorah et al., 2008)."
8,How does ethanol cause oxidative stress?,"Alcohol toxicity is caused not only directly by ethanol but also by its metabolic products, including the ROS produced during its biotransformation. Ethanol is metabolized in two steps (Fig. 1 ). First, the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase converts alcohol into acetaldehyde in the liver. Importantly, alcohol dehydrogenase can be first detected in the liver of rat pups at GD 18 at which time it functions at approximately 25% of adult capacity, whereas adult activity levels are not reached until after birth at postnatal day (PND) 18 (Raiha et al., 1967). Alternatively, ethanol can also be metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1, which is present both in the liver and in the brain (Hansson et al., 1990; Upadhya et al., 2000; Zimatkin et al., 2006) and has been found in human fetal brain cells (Khalighi et al., 1999). Indeed, a recent study has shown that the activity of this enzyme is increased in the liver of close-to-term guinea pigs that were exposed to ethanol throughout gestation (Hewitt et al., 2010). Importantly, the reaction catalized by cytochrome P450 2E1 leads to an increase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO•), thus leading to increased levels of lipid peroxidation (Buonocore et al., 2001; Mansouri et al., 2001). The metabolism of ethanol by cytochrome P450 can also result in the formation of acetaldehyde, as well as the hydroxyethyl radical. In addition, the enzyme catalase may also play a role in the production of acetaldehyde from ethanol in the brain (Aragon et al., 1992; Hamby-Mason et al., 1997; Zimatkin et al., 2006). Acetaldehyde can then be further oxidized into acetate by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is present in the brain (Abel and Hannigan, 1995). These reactions result in an increase in the activity of the respiratory chain and consequently in the formation of ROS. It is important to note, however, that for the most part, ethanol metabolism occurs in the liver and that its effects in the intracellular redox state in the CNS are likely to result from a direct dysregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown that chronic ethanol exposure can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in both astrocytes (Gonzalez et al., 2007) and immature neurons (Chu et al., 2007). This hypothesis is also supported by in vivo evidence. For example, Xu and colleagues (2005) have observed mitochondrial dysfunction in the cerebral tissue of mouse fetuses that were exposed to ethanol during GD 6–15. Thus, ethanol exposure resulted in inhibition of mitochondrial proliferation and differentiation, reduction of mitochondrial volume, a decrease in the activities of the respiratory chain complexes I, IV and adenosine triphospahe (ATP) synthase with a consequent reduction in the generation of ATP in the cerebral tissue (Xu et al., 2005). Moreover, ethanol exposure throughout gestation was shown to result in selective mitochondrial dysregulation in the hippocampus of neonatal guinea pigs through depletion of mitochondrial GSH (Green et al., 2006). Thus, ethanol can lead to an increase in the production of ROS and/or a decrease in the levels of antioxidant defenses causing a redox imbalance and resulting in the oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and DNA (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, oxidative stress can contribute, at least in part, to the neurodegeneration observed in FASD."
9,Involvement of oxidative stress in FASD,"Several lines of evidence have implicated the generation of ROS in the general mechanism of teratogenesis (Nicol et al., 2000; Ozolins et al., 1996; Parman et al., 1999; Wells et al., 1997; Winn and Wells, 1997). For example, embryopathies are enhanced in mutant mice deficient in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) (Nicol et al., 2000), by GSH depletion or inhibition of GSH synthesis, and by inhibition of GPx or GR activities (Ozolins et al., 1996; Wells et al., 1997). Importantly, the protection afforded by these antioxidant enzymes is remarkable, since the embryonic activity of most is less than 5% of maternal activity (Ozolins et al., 1996; Wells and Winn, 1996; Wells et al., 1997). In agreement, administration of ethanol to pregnant mice disturbs embryogenesis and this adverse effect is more pronounced in the offspring of mice with low antioxidant capacity (Wentzel and Eriksson, 2006). Most evidence for a role of oxidative stress in FASD is indirect, as only a few studies have analyzed the production of ROS in animals exposed to ethanol during the perinatal period (Dong et al., 2010; Heaton et al., 2002; Heaton et al., 2003c; Kane et al., 2008). Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown increases in markers of oxidative damage to lipids (Chen et al., 1997; Henderson et al., 1995; Perez et al., 2006; Petkov et al., 1992; Ramachandran et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2005), proteins (Marino et al., 2004; Shirpoor et al., 2009), and DNA (Chu et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2010; Ramachandran et al., 2001), as well as alterations in the levels of endogenous antioxidants (Edwards et al., 2000; Heaton et al., 2003a; Heaton et al., 2003b; Henderson et al., 1995; La Grange et al., 1999; Perez et al., 2006; Reyes et al., 1993; Shirpoor et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2005) in the liver and brain of rodents that were exposed to ethanol during the period of brain development. Although in most cases these studies point towards an involvement of oxidative stress in FASD, they vary substantially in regards to the experimental paradigms used (i.e., method and period of ethanol exposure, peak BAC reached, age of the offspring at the time of analyzes, as well as the tissues analyzed and the markers of oxidative stress evaluated) making direct comparisons among them virtually impossible. Since it is important to keep in mind the experimental variables of these studies when discussing them, they have been summarized on Table 1 . In particular, several studies have shown that the activity of antioxidant enzymes is significantly reduced in the CNS of animals exposed to ethanol (Calabrese et al., 2002; Das and Vasudevan, 2007; Dembele et al., 2006; Emre et al., 2007; Ledig et al., 1989; Somani and Husain, 1997). As outlined above (Section 2), this decrease may indicate an oxidative modification of the enzymatic proteins caused by an increased generation of free radicals during ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism. Alternatively, it may also result from a decrease in the synthesis of these enzymes. However, some studies have also reported an ethanol-induced increase in the activity of these enzymatic antioxidant defences (Cano et al., 2001; Nanji et al., 1995; Ojeda et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 1999), which, as mentioned above (Section 2), can be explained as an adaptive reaction to an excess production of free radicals. It is now well established that prenatal ethanol exposure causes an increase in fetal levels of lipid peroxidation both in the liver (Chen et al., 1997; Perez et al., 2006) and in the brain (Dembele et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 1995; Petkov et al., 1992; Smith et al., 2005), while decreasing the content of the antioxidant GSH (Dembele et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 1995; Reyes et al., 1993). For example, Reyes et al. (1993) used a liquid diet model to expose pregnant rats to 35% ethanol throughout gestation (i.e., from GD 1–21) and observed a reduction in the brain levels of GSH in the offspring at GD 21. Dembele et al. (2006) also analyzed the levels of several antioxidants in the hypothalami of the offspring of female rats that received 36% ethanol through intragastric intubation (i.e., gavage) throughout pregnancy. In both PND 7 and PND 90 (adult) rats, prenatal ethanol exposure was associated with decreased levels of GSH and increased expression of SOD. The concentrations of lipid peroxides and protein carbonyls were also increased in ethanol-exposed PND 90 rats. In another study, Petkov et al. (1992) showed an increase in lipid peroxidation markers in the hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex in 12week old rats that were exposed to ethanol either during the entire fetal development (i.e., throughout gestation) and the lactation period or during lactation alone (dams were fed a liquid diet containing 6% of ethanol). Furthermore, Chu et al. (2007) found that exposure of pregnant rats to different concentrations of ethanol (through liquid diets containing 0, 2%, 4.5%, 6.5%, or 9.25% of ethanol) from GD 6 to birth induced a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoding the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes II-A, IV, and V as well as an increase in the expression of the apoptotic gene p53 and the enzymes NOXs 1 and 3 in the cerebella of the offspring. Furthermore, these authors also observed an increase in the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE; a highly reactive and toxic product of lipid peroxidation) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; an oxidized DNA nucleoside that is commonly used as an indicator of DNA oxidation) in cerebellar granule cells of ethanol-exposed animals (Chu et al., 2007). Interestingly, it appears that even brief prenatal exposure to ethanol can produce long-lasting deficits. Acute maternal exposure to ethanol during GD 17–18 (in order to mimic an episode of binge drinking) is enough to decrease GSH content while increasing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (commonly used indicators of lipid peroxidation) in the fetal brain (Henderson et al., 1995). In agreement, Ramachandran et al. (2001) also demonstrated that fetal exposure to ethanol over a two-day period (pregnant dams received 4g/kg of 25% ethanol via intragastric intubation every 12 h during GD 17–18) was enough to cause an increase in mitochondrial permeability transition, mitochondrial 4HNE levels, caspase-3 activity, and DNA fragmentation in the fetal brain (Ramachandran et al., 2001). Moreover, in another acute model of prenatal ethanol exposure (where pregnant mice received two intraperitoneal injections of 2.9g/kg of ethanol spaced 4 h apart on GD 9) increases in NOX enzymatic activity, ROS generation and oxidative DNA damage were detected in the ethanol-exposed embryos (Dong et al., 2010). Taken together, the results from these studies strongly suggest that an acute exposure to ethanol during gestation is enough to induce a redox imbalance (either by increasing the generation of ROS and/or by decreasing the levels of antioxidant defenses) in the brains of the offspring, which in turn can culminate in cell death. The effects of ethanol can be equally devastating in new born rodents. Exposure of rodents to ethanol during the first days of postnatal life (which are equivalent to the third gestational trimester in humans) has also been shown to alter the GSH content while increasing the levels of lipid peroxides and protein carbonyls in several brain regions (Kumral et al., 2005; Marino et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005). Importantly, the extent of oxidative damage appears to depend on the brain region as well as the age of the animals at the time of analysis. Thus, Heaton et al. (2003b) reported that rats acutely exposed to ethanol on PND 7 showed an immediate increase in ROS production in the cerebral cortices. However, when rats were allowed to live until PND 21 (after being exposed to ethanol on PND 7), there were no differences in ROS production between ethanol-exposed and control animals (Heaton et al., 2003c). In agreement, exposure of PND 7 mice to an acute dose of ethanol (2.5g/kg, 2 times separated by an interval of 2 h) also increased the levels of lipid peroxides (Kumral et al., 2005). In addition, Smith et al. (2005) showed that exposure of rat pups to ethanol (6g/kg) using artificial rearing between PND 4 and PND 9 increased the concentration of MDA (i.e., the levels of lipid peroxidation) and the GSH content in the cerebellum. In support of these findings, acute ethanol exposure of rat pups on PND 4 was shown to increase ROS production in the cerebella, which might be associated with an ethanol-induced loss of Purkinje and granule cells that is commonly observed in animals exposed to ethanol during this early postnatal period (Heaton et al., 2002; Light et al., 2002). Indeed, the peak of vulnerability of cerebella neurons to the teratogenic effects of ethanol was shown to occur between PND 3 and PND 7 both in mice and rats (Dikranian et al., 2005). In summary, mounting evidence from rodent models of FASD clearly implicates ROS production, oxidative damage, and a dysregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system in the neuropathology of these neurodevelopmental disorders."
10,Use of antioxidants as therapeutic strategies for the treatment of FASD,"The role of oxidative stress in FASD is also corroborated by numerous studies showing the beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy upon prenatal ethanol exposure (Cano et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2004; Cohen-Kerem and Koren, 2003; Heaton et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2009; Marino et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 1999; Neese et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2005; Ramachandran et al., 2003; Shirpoor et al., 2009; Siler-Marsiglio et al., 2005; Wentzel and Eriksson, 2006; Wentzel et al., 2006). Again, a great number of experimental variables (including the mode and period of ethanol exposure, the antioxidant used and the time of administration, as well as the age of animals at the time of analysis and the neuropathological hallmarks evaluated) make direct comparisons among the various studies difficult. Thus, in order to facilitate the following discussion, the experimental parameters and the major findings of the various studies are summarized in Table 2 . Several in vivo studies have indicated that antioxidant treatment can prevent or reduce growth retardation and/or the occurrence of malformations upon ethanol exposure during development. Thus, Peng et al. (2005) showed that the antioxidant vitamin C could decrease microencephaly and growth retardation in embryos of Xenopus laevis (the African clawed frog) that were exposed to ethanol (Peng et al., 2005). Furthermore, Chen et al. (2004) showed that when ethanol was administered to pregnant mice in combination with EUK-134, a synthetic mimetic of both SOD and catalase, there was a reduced incidence of forelimb malformations and cell death in the offspring when compared with animals that received ethanol alone (Chen et al., 2004). Finally, treatment of pregnant dams (that were fed a liquid diet containing 20% of ethanol between GD 1 and GD 20) with vitamin E normalized fetal development (Wentzel et al., 2006). As expected, the use of compounds with antioxidant properties has also been consistently shown to reduce oxidative stress levels and/or to increase the endogenous antioxidant capacity in the brains of different rodent models of FASD. For example, Peng and colleagues (2005) showed that the antioxidant vitamin C could inhibit ROS production and the activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in embryos of Xenopus laevis (the African clawed frog) that were exposed to ethanol (Peng et al., 2005). In a different study, co-treatment of ethanol-exposed pregnant dams with silymarin (a flavonoid that has antioxidant properties) was shown to normalize the activity of γ-glutamyltransferase (an enzyme involved in the metabolism of GSH) in the liver and brain of close-to-term (i.e., GD 21) fetuses (Edwards et al., 2000; La Grange et al., 1999). Vitamin E is one of the most commonly used natural occurring antioxidants and several studies have also shown its beneficial effects in decreasing oxidative stress in different models of FASD. Thus, it was recently demonstrated that treatment with vitamin E completely reversed the increase in apoptosis as well as in the levels of protein oxidation (as assessed by the protein carbonyl content) and lipid peroxidation in both the hippocampus and the cerebellum of the offspring of dams that were exposed to ethanol between GD 7 and GD 21 (Shirpoor et al., 2009). In another study, pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats were given drinking water containing 20% ethanol and food containing 5% vitamin E between GD 1 and GD 20. Maternal vitamin E treatment normalized the fetal hepatic levels of isoprostane (a prostaglandin-like product of the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of essential fatty acids) (Wentzel et al., 2006). Finally, vitamin E was also shown to alleviate oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rat pups that received ethanol (5.25g/kg) by intragastric intubation between PND 7 and PND 9 (Marino et al., 2004). In several cases, antioxidant treatment was also shown to have a positive impact at the neuroanatomical level. Indeed, pre-treatment and co-treatment with vitamin E were shown to attenuate the reduction in the number of Purkinje cells in lobule I of the cerebellum of rats that were acutely exposed to ethanol on PND 4–5 (Heaton et al., 2000). In a different model where rat pups received ethanol (5.25g/kg) by intragastric intubation between PND 7 and PND 9, vitamin E also alleviated hippocampal neuronal loss (Marino et al., 2004). Furthermore, co-treatment of ethanol-exposed pregnant guinea pigs with a combination of a high-dose of both vitamins C and E protected against the loss of hippocampal weight relative to brain weight in the newborns (Nash et al., 2007). Finally, co-treatment of ethanol-exposed pregnant dams with silymarin was also shown to prevent the ethanol-induced impairment in corpus callosum development (Moreland et al., 2002). Importantly, in many cases, the neuroprotection conferred by antioxidant therapy was translated into an improvement of the behavioral deficits and learning abnormalities associated with perinatal ethanol exposure (Busby et al., 2002; Endres et al., 2005; Neese et al., 2004; Reid et al., 1999; Vink et al., 2005). For example, co-administration of silymarin to pregnant dams that were fed a liquid diet containing 35% of ethanol-derived calories throughout gestation was shown to improve several behavioral deficits in the adult offspring (Busby et al., 2002; Neese et al., 2004; Reid et al., 1999). Thus, while PND 90 ethanol- and silymarin-treated males were shown to perform better in a social recognition task as compared with age-matched ethanol-exposed males (Reid et al., 1999), PND 60–75 ethanol- and silymarin-treated females performed better on the radial arm maze task than their age-matched ethanol-exposed counterparts, indicating that treatment with this antioxidant reversed the ethanol-induced deficits in spatial working memory (Busby et al., 2002; Neese et al., 2004). In a different study, co-treatment of ethanol-exposed pregnant guinea pigs with a combination of a high-dose of both vitamins C and E mitigated the ethanol-induced deficit in the task-retention component of the water-maze task when animals reached PND 45. However, this vitamin regimen did not mitigate the ethanol-induced impairment in hippocampal long-term potentiation (Nash et al., 2007). The protective properties of natural antioxidants such as vitamin E, β-carotene, folic acid, and flavonoids have also been corroborated by several in vitro studies (Heaton et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 1999; Pirlich et al., 2002; Sheth et al., 2009). For example, using an in vitro whole embryo culture system, Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the antioxidant black ginseng has a protective effect on ethanol-induced teratogenesis through the augmentation of the embryonic antioxidant activity. In a different study, vitamin E was shown to ameliorate neuronal apoptosis and the reduction in neurotrophin secretion in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells that were exposed to ethanol (Heaton et al., 2004). Furthermore, treatment with a combination of both vitamin E and β-carotene was also shown to protect cultured hippocampal neurons against ethanol-induced cell death (Mitchell et al., 1999), while α-lipoic acid was able to prevent ethanol-induced intracellular protein oxidation, GSH depletion, and cell death in mouse hippocampal HT722 cells (Pirlich et al., 2002). Additionally, Ramachandran et al. (2003) demonstrated that pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of GSH, increased cellular GSH levels and prevented apoptosis induced by ethanol in cultured fetal cortical neurons (Ramachandran et al., 2003). In agreement, flavonoids were shown to inhibit apoptosis in cultured fetal rhombencephalic neurons (Antonio and Druse, 2008) as well as in cultured cerebellum granule cells, where a reduction in ROS production and an up-regulation of the expression and activity of the copper/zinc-containing SOD and the GPx/GR system were also observed upon antioxidant treatment (Siler-Marsiglio et al., 2004). These results strongly support the idea that an increase in oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms by which ethanol induces apoptotic cell death in fetal neurons. Despite this increasing body of literature implicating oxidative stress in ethanol-induced neurotoxicity, a few studies have suggested otherwise and the lack of effectiveness of some antioxidants remains a conundrum. For example, Kane et al. (2008) showed that ethanol does not induce the production of ROS nor the deterioration of the mitochondrial membrane potential in rat cerebellar granule neurons. Moreover, treatment with certain antioxidants such as NAC, lazaroid (U83836E), and melatonin has failed to prevent the ethanol-induced Purkinje cell loss in the developing rat cerebellum when these were administered concurrently with alcohol (Edwards et al., 2002; Grisel and Chen, 2005; Pierce et al., 2006). In a different study, Tran et al. (2005) also found that vitamin E did not protect against cerebellar damage nor the deficits in eye-blink classical conditioning in ethanol-exposed rats (Tran et al., 2005), while Marino et al. (2004) showed that treatment with this antioxidant also failed to improve the spatial learning deficits observed in rats that received ethanol by intragastric intubation between PND 7 and PND 9 (Marino et al., 2004). Although there were many procedural differences among these studies and the ones reporting the beneficial effects of antioxidants in models of FASD (see Table 2), the issue of bioavailability of these compounds at the time of the ethanol insult may be a critical factor dictating the efficacy of their protective capacity. Also, some antioxidants such as NAC might fail to show protective effects (Pierce et al., 2006) simply because they are not cell permeable. Furthermore, the dose and timing of administration (i.e., the therapeutic window) of these substances are important factors to take into consideration. These factors are particularly important when comparing studies that tested the same antioxidant. For example, as stated above, vitamin E has consistently been shown to reduce oxidative stress levels in different models of fetal ethanol exposure (Marino et al., 2004; Shirpoor et al., 2009; Wentzel et al., 2006). However, its effects at the neuroanatomical level have been mixed, with some studies showing that vitamin E treatment can reduce the ethanol-induced cell loss in certain brain structures (Heaton et al., 2000; Marino et al., 2004), while others have found no effect (Tran et al., 2005). Finally, when administered alone, vitamin E repeatedly failed to have a positive impact on behavioral deficits (Marino et al., 2004; Tran et al., 2005). Thus, it is possible that its efficiency at the neuroanatomical and behavioral levels might be highly dependent on its dose and therapeutic window. On the other hand, it is likely that various intracellular pathways are involved in the maintenance of neuroanatomical networks as well as in the regulation of complex behaviors. In this case, preventing the propagation of cascades of lipid peroxidation (which is thought to be the main mechanism of action of vitamin E, a liposoluble antioxidant; Aiguo et al., 2010; Traber and Atkinson, 2007) might not be enough to mitigate the neuroanatomical and behavioral deficits observed in certain models of FASD. Indeed, spatial learning in particular is a hippocampal dependent behavior that may be more dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis than on damage induced by oxidative stress. Although vitamin E treatment was shown to ameliorate learning and memory deficits in other disease models such as diabetes (Comin et al., 2010), Alzheimer's disease (Veinbergs et al., 2000) and traumatic brain injury (Aiguo et al., 2010), this might be due to the fact that the levels of oxidative damage in these models might have been high enough to interfere with intracellular pathways that modulate synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Indeed, increased levels of lipid peroxidation will disrupt the properties and fluidity of cellular membranes thus interfering with receptors and their signaling cascades that are dependent upon insertion into specific membrane regions (for review, see Traber and Atkinson, 2007). However, the levels of lipid peroxidation present in the hippocampus of models of FASD might not be high enough to significantly affect the pathways involved in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis and the dysregulation of other mechanisms that regulate these complex behaviors might have a major role in this case. If this is true, it is not surprising that vitamin E did not ameliorate these behavioral deficits (Marino et al., 2004). On the other hand, antioxidants with a broader mechanism of action might have a positive impact on behavioral deficits. For example, silymarin is a bioflavonoid that acts not only by scavenging and quenching ROS and inhibiting the propagation of cascades of protein nitrosylation and lipid peroxidation (Hou et al., 2010; Valenzuela and Guerra, 1986) but also by preventing the depletion of GSH levels and promoting the endogenous antioxidant defense system (Lu et al., 2009; Nencini et al., 2007). Moreover, silymarin has also been shown to inhibit the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) (Zi et al., 1997), and to have estrogenic effects (Pliskova et al., 2005; Pradhan and Girish, 2006) as well as anticancer (Chen et al., 2009; Tyagi et al., 2009) and anti-inflammatory properties (Hou et al., 2010; Manna et al., 1999). Thus, it is possible that this antioxidant might be more successful than vitamin E in mitigating some of the behavioral deficits observed in rodent models of FASD (Busby et al., 2002; Neese et al., 2004; Reid et al., 1999) because it not only acts as a ROS scavenger but also promotes the endogenous antioxidant system and inhibits inflammatory pathways (which might be activated as a direct result of oxidative stress). Together, the activation of these pro-survival pathways in brain regions such as the hippocampus might result in an environment more conductive to synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, which will ultimately result in a behavioral improvement. Future experiments are warranted in order to test this hypothesis. Indeed, given the diversity of results that have been obtained with antioxidants and the numerous experimental variables that confound these results, it is virtually impossible to ascertain whether oxidative stress is a major contributor to the neuroanatomical and behavioral deficits induced by ethanol or whether an imbalance in the intracellular redox state is simply a secondary player in the pathology of FASD. Within this scenario, it is important to point that other mechanisms have also been implicated in ethanol toxicity. Thus, a dysregulation of gliogenesis (Gressens et al., 1992; Rubert et al., 2006; Vemuri and Chetty, 2005), cell proliferation and survival (Caldwell et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2005; Fiore et al., 2009; Miki et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008), neurogenesis (Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010) and neuronal migration (Kumada et al., 2006; Ozer et al., 2000), as well as alterations in gene expression (Green et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009; Yamada et al., 2005), neurotransmitter systems (Bellinger et al., 2002; Hsiao et al., 2002; Miller, 2006; Savage et al., 1991), growth factors (Caldwell et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2005; Fiore et al., 2009; Miki et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008), and cell adhesion molecules (Charness et al., 1994; Ramanathan et al., 1996; Vangipuram et al., 2008), are likely to also play major roles in ethanol-induced damage. Whether alterations in these systems occur as a consequence of oxidative stress or independently from an imbalance in the intracellular redox state is currently not known and likely depends on the magnitude and timing of the insult (as certain intracellular pathways are likely to have different susceptibilities to ethanol depending on the dose and period of exposure). Thus, it is possible that in several situations these mechanisms might have a more prominent role than oxidative stress in the observed deficits and therefore treatment with antioxidants might not be enough to counteract the effects of perinatal ethanol exposure. Nevertheless, antioxidants (alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents) might still be good candidates for the mitigation of some of the deficits observed in individuals affected with FASD. Further studies in rodent models are thus warranted in order to identify the optimal cocktail of antioxidant compounds and/or to test therapeutic strategies that use antioxidants in combination with other pharmacological drugs or non-invasive strategies, such as physical exercise or increased environmental stimulation (Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010), to treat some of the neuropathological and behavioral symptoms associated with FASD."
11,Conclusions,"FASD is a major public health problem that affects all socio-economic strata, being the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and birth defects in the United States (May et al., 2009; Oesterheld et al., 1998; Stratton et al., 1996). The mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced neuropathology during fetal development are likely multifaceted and complex. Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence from different in vitro and in vivo models of perinatal ethanol exposure strongly suggest that oxidative stress (caused either by an increase in ROS production and/or by a decrease in antioxidant defenses) plays a major role not only in the neuropathology (i.e., neuronal cell death) but also in the development of some of the behavioral symptoms associated with FASD. However, although the relationship between ethanol exposure during the period of brain development and oxidative stress is now widely accepted, the exact mechanisms by which ethanol induces an imbalance of the intracellular redox state (ultimately culminating in neurotoxicity and neuronal death) are not yet completely understood. It is likely that an increase in the production of ROS arises as a direct consequence of ethanol metabolism and its actions on mitochondrial bioenergetics (which is particularly important in the brain) and that the developing fetal antioxidant system quickly becomes overwhelmed by such increase. It is also possible that the oxidative insults experienced early during development have long-lasting effects, rendering the antioxidant defense system of the offspring ineffective later on in life. Future research is warranted in order to test these hypotheses. Although the use of appropriate animal models of FASD has greatly improved our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the teratogenicity of ethanol, the use of different modes of ethanol administration and differences in the exposure periods make comparisons among studies challenging and the drawing of conclusions difficult. With this regard, it will be important to analyze the effect of prenatal/early postnatal ethanol exposure on the various indicators of oxidative stress in a systematic manner (i.e., using the same model and controlling for all external factors such as dose, peak BAC achieved, time of exposure, procedural stress and caloric restriction). For instance, it would be interesting to determine the levels of endogenous antioxidants (such as GSH) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and the enzymes of the glutathione system) as well as the degree of oxidative damage (measured by the amount of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) upon exposure to ethanol during each one of the three trimester equivalents alone, during the first and second trimester equivalents combined (i.e., during the prenatal period), and during all the three trimester equivalents (i.e., during both the prenatal and the early postnatal periods). Such experiment would identify the phase during the developmental period when the brain is most susceptible to the effects of ethanol. This information would be invaluable for the identification of optimal therapeutic windows for the use of antioxidants. Furthermore, it would be important to test whether the use of antioxidants later on in life would also have beneficial effects in these models of FASD. This is particularly important since to date most studies have only analyzed the effects of antioxidant compounds in rodent models of FASD when these are administered concurrently with ethanol. However, while this strategy can have a therapeutic impact in animal models, the likelihood of convincing alcoholic women to take antioxidant supplements during pregnancy is not very high. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to ascertain in rodent models whether administration of antioxidants to the ethanol-exposed offspring can still mitigate some of the neuroanatomical and/or behavioral deficits observed. In agreement, several lines of evidence have shown that antioxidant treatment can be beneficial in the amelioration of some biochemical (Chovanova et al., 2006; de Diego-Otero et al., 2009) and behavioral (Chovanova et al., 2006; de Diego-Otero et al., 2009; Dolske et al., 1993) deficits associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Akins et al., 2010; Dolske et al., 1993), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Chovanova et al., 2006), and fragile-X syndrome (de Diego-Otero et al., 2009). On the other hand, human clinical and epidemiological studies are still scarce. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one clinical study showing no significant differences in the urine levels of the products of lipid peroxidation 8-isoprostane F2α and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1α between women who drunk during pregnancy and control nondrinkers (Signore et al., 2008). However, this study did not evaluate changes in oxidative stress markers in the fetuses and/or newborns. Thus, it will be crucial to validate the findings from animal models in children that were exposed to alcohol during gestation. This is also particularly important for the development of therapeutic strategies that can prevent and/or ameliorate some of the deficits associated with FASD. Within this scenario, we believe that antioxidants (either alone or in combination with other therapies) are strong candidates for the design of clinical trials in FASD-affected children."
