0,Introduction,"The impacts of emission from internal combustion engine emissions on environment and human health have gained more concerns over the years, leading to the more stringent emissions limits legislations enforcement in many countries [1]. Compression ignition (CI) engines have been commonly utilised in both on- and off-road application due to its higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE), higher torque output and lower carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions when compared to spark ignition (SI) engines. In order to ensure the sustainability of environment and lower impact on human health, these emissions are heavily regulated. Despite having lower CO and THC concentrations produced by CI engines, the emissions legislated limits are extended to THC, CO, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. THC and CO are regulated with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), meanwhile PM is controlled by employing diesel particulate filter (DPF). Whereas for NOx various control alternatives for CI engines have been extensively investigated combustion control and exhaust aftertreatment. NOx control via combustion control or known as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) reduces NOx through retaining/reintroducing exhaust gas in the combustion chamber externally or internally. External EGR reintroduces exhaust gas through intake manifold using a variety of configurations (e.g. high-pressure loop or low-pressure loop) [2–7]. Internal EGR retains exhaust gas using exhaust valve closing (EVC) and intake valve opening (IVO) overlapping NOx-DPM trade-off leading to more rapid engine wear due to the higher PM concentration degrading the engine lubricants [8]. Urea-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is the most widely employed aftertreatment NOx reduction technique [9,10]. Urea-SCR combines the use of aqueous urea solution (AUS) as a reducing agent with an SCR catalyst (e.g., vanadium-base and zeolite-base catalyst) with efficiency up to 90%. However, the complexity of urea dosing controls [10], urea solution storage, urea solution freezing problem at sub-zero temperatures, by-products generated from urea decomposition process [11] and the higher cost due to ammonia slippage [12]. Alternatively, urea-less SCR or passive ammonia SCR systems has been researched with the aim to eliminate the urea solution or ammonia (for NH3-SCR) storage and to reduce cost of the overall NOx reduction system [13–14]. Lean NOx trap (LNT) is an alternative aftertreatment for NOx where NOx is stored in the substrate during lean combustion [15,16]. In the presence of THC, CO, and H2, NOx is converted into N2 when the engine operation is switched to rich combustion. The periodically adjustment between rich and lean engine operations result in greater complication to the engine management system (EMS) and making the implementation of such a technology becomes less economically and technologically feasible for agricultural applications (e.g. small single cylinder diesel engine). Hydrocarbons-SCR (HC-SCR) utilises existing THC in the exhaust gas as a reducing agent to selectively reduce NOx into N2 through a series of reactions (Eq. (1,2) and Eq. (3)) [17,18] Silver/alumina (Ag/Al2O3) is a well-established catalyst for HC-SCR system due to its high NOx reduction activity at relatively low temperatures [17]. However, Ag-based catalysts are susceptible to the presence of H2O and SO2 which considerably reduce the NOx conversion efficiency [19]. Other types of catalysts such as copper-base, platinum-base, gold-base, iron-base, magnesium-base and cerium-base have been studied in conjunction with silver-base catalysts in a bimetallic configuration. Bimetallic catalyst setup provides superior performance both in terms of low temperature NOx conversion and sulfur tolerance [20]. In general, the higher HC/NOx molar ratio of exhaust gas compositions can improve NOx reduction performance of the HC-SCR system [17,21]. Therefore, THC enrichment is required to obtain a high NOx conversion. THC can be supplied externally (‘active mode’ HC-SCR [22]) with fuel injector upstream the HC-SCR using the same fuel supply for combustion and reportedly to have fuel penalty only up to 2% of the engine fuel economy [23]. Alternatively, additional THC can be introduced by engine control strategy through multiple short fuel injection at post-combustion condition (end of power stroke) for partial oxidation and remained as THC [24] which is also referred as ‘passive mode’ HC-SCR [22]. (1) N O + C x H y + x O 2 → 0.5 N 2 + x C O + y 2 H 2 O (2) N O + O 2 → N O 2 (3) N O 2 + C x H y O z → N 2 + C O 2 + H 2 O HC/NOx ratio can be altered by the combustion using diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends, increasing THC and reducing NOx concentrations respectively. This is due to the ethanol physiochemical properties such as low cetane index, low fuel density and viscosity, low heating value, and higher latent heat of evaporation [25]. Ethanol reported to prolong the ignition delay due to the lower cetane number and higher heat of vaporisation in comparison to diesel. In turn, reducing the combustion duration leading to lesser production of NOx and achieving higher THC/NOx ratio in the exhaust system [26,27]. It is believed that diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blend is expected to improve the HC-SCR performance. Furthermore, prolonged exposure of HC-SCR under higher THC concentration activity was found to deactivate the catalytic activity of a Ag-base catalyst by occupation of heavy hydrocarbons on active sites, leading to deteriorating the generation of silver nitrate for NOx reduction activity [28,29]. Kim et al. demonstrated catalyst deactivation by hydrocarbons can be reserved with hydrogen (H2) injection onto the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity at lower temperature [28]. THC concentration decreases alongside O2 concentration under the presence of H2 in the reactant feed, which was resulted by the activation of reactant (THC) oxidation and believing it assists the regeneration of the HC-SCR catalyst [23]. To date, there have been several studies involving HC-SCR system developments (e.g. catalyst developments by corporation of bimetallic [30] or new catalyst [19], new or multi-fuel blend for NOx reducing agent. [17], H2 could be used to assist NOx reduction activities of HC-SCR [29,31,32]) and the influence of renewable fuels on the HC-SCR system [33]. However, there are limited number of studies [34,35] that take a holistic approach towards the effect of renewable fuel blends on the combustion characteristics and its impact of emission on HC-SCR in a passive mode. Additionally, no studies have been conducted on the investigation of renewable fuels and H2 addition on HC-SCR performance. The present research studied and provided the guideline for direct-injection diesel engine fueled with diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends fuel equipped with the passive mode HC-SCR catalyst (Ag/Al2O3) under steady-state conditions. The aims were to examine the effects of ethanol blends in diesel-biodiesel fuel blends up to 50%-vol. on combustion and emissions characteristics, the effects of ethanol blends on NOx reduction activities of HC-SCR, and the effect of H2 addition upstream the HC-SCR catalyst on NOx reduction activity under low operating temperatures."
1,Instruments and methodology,
2,Engine test setup,"2.1 Engine test setup The experimental setup was as shown in Fig. 1 . Comprised of a Yanmar L100V, 4 S single cylinder direct injection diesel engine detail in Table 1 mounted to an eddy-current engine dynamometer (Hofman, model D3210 Elze 1, Hofmann Prüftechnik GmbH, Germany) for constant engine speed and torque controls. The engine test was conducted at a constant speed of 1500 rpm (±20 rpm) that is common operating engine speed and the most fuel-efficient engine speed in diesel engine. The brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) of between 1.21, 3.47 and 3.71 bar corresponds to engine load of between 25%, 50% and 75%. A pressure transducer (Kistler: 6056A, Winterthur, Switzerland), a charge amplifier (Kistler: 5018, Winterthur, Switzerland), and an incremental optical encoder (Baumer Electric: CH-8500) were used for measuring in-cylinder pressure profile control with an in-house software. The net rate of heat release (RoHR) (or heat release rate: HRR) was calculated using the average in-cylinder pressure value of 200 cycles and Eq. (4) [36]. (4) dQ d θ = γ γ - 1 p dV d θ + 1 γ - 1 V dp d θ where dQ d θ = net rate of heat release (J/ θ ), γ = isentropic expansion coefficient, p = in-cylinder pressure (Pa), and V = in-cylinder volume (m3)."
3,Gas emission compositions measurement,"2.2 Gas emission compositions measurement A Testo 350 (Testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany) was used for exhaust gas composition measurement including CO2, CO, O2, nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and THC (Hexane equivalent) where NOx was the sum of NO and NO2 (in ppm-vol.). Hydrogen (H2) concentration in the exhaust gas was measured by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu: GC-2014, Shimadzu corporation, Kyoto, Japan). HC-SCR system consisted of a small-scale 2% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, and tests were conducted in a mini reactor. The monolith substrate had 600 cells per square inch (cpsi) dimensions of 24 mm diameter and 60 mm length with surface area of 150 m2/g. The reactor was mounted inside the exhaust manifold assembly and centrally located allow heat recovery for the reactor was provided by the exhaust gas. Type K thermocouples were installed upstream and downstream of the catalyst monolith and data logged with a TC-08 (Pico technology, Cambridgeshire, UK). The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of the HC-SCR system was controlled at approximately 15,000 h−1."
4,Fuel preparations,"2.3 Fuel preparations Three different liquid fuels were tested, one diesel (D) one ethanol (E) and one biodiesel (B) fuel. Biodiesel fuel was selected the palm oil to produce the ethyl ester biodiesel. The preparation of biodiesel under study was performed using the transformation process from raw oil to biodiesel production was known as transesterification. This was a chemical reaction between palm oil (triglyceride) and an alcohol (i.e. methanol) using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the base catalyst to produce glycerol and fatty acid methyl esters compounds. Three fuels were blended on different ratios by volume into a homogeneous mixture by a magnetic stirrer. The final fuel blend was kept in a glass vial for observing the physical appearance. In this study, the ethanol fuel blends were limited at 50 %vol. in the fuel blends because the use of higher ethanol fuels (>50 %vol.) ratio resulted in deteriorating engine behaviour. The engine was fuelled with diesel fuel to determine the baseline data, and then diesel-biodiesel-ethanol was investigated as E10, E20, E30, E40 and E50 on a volume basis. These blends were subjected to performance and emission tests on the engine. The fuel blends properties are illustrated in Table 2 . The lowered flash point when ethanol was blended, handling safety precaution was taken according to the health and safety guidance. H2 with purity of 99.98% hydrogen was injected into the exhaust gas manifold upstream the HC-SCR catalyst. The H2 injection concentration into exhaust gas stream was controlled with a flow meter estimating the volumetric H2 required with theoretical calculations according to the test. The H2 concentrations were constantly monitored by continuous samplings with the gas chromatography, and adjustments were made within ± 5% error limit to achieve the H2/NOx molar ratio in between 0.44 and 16.99, accordingly."
5,Measurement accuracy and uncertainty analysis,"2.4 Measurement accuracy and uncertainty analysis Error and uncertainty from the measurement can arise during the experiment as the result of instrument condition, instrument calibration, ambient temperature, and observation and test procedures. Emissions and engine parameters measurements were sampled three times and the average values were recorded. The root-sum-square (RSS) is used to calculate the uncertainty in the experiment (Uexp) as shown in Eq. (5). The measurement accuracy and uncertainty of the experiment are indicated in Table 3 .

6,Results and discussions,
7,Combustion characteristics,"3.1 Combustion characteristics The effect of biodiesel and ethanol blends on the in-cylinder pressure profile and the rate of heat release of the combustion process at 1.21, 2.47, and 3.71 bar BMEP are shown in Fig. 2 . In general, the RoHR featured a higher magnitude and steeper curve with the increased engine output torque. This was a result of the increased quantity of fuel injected into the combustion chamber. This had raised the gas pressure and temperature during the mixing-controlled combustion phase. In overall, diesel fuel (E0) combustion exhibited the highest RoHR of all fuel blends. E0 depicted the earliest combustion ignition as shown in Fig. 2 [37]. This was due to the higher cetane number and lower comparing to ethanol blends [27]. The reduction in RoHR magnitude with ethanol blends was attributed to the higher latent heat of evaporation of ethanol, absorbing heat within the combustion chamber [38]. Whereas the RoHR tendency to shift towards later ignition indicates the retarded ignition as the consequence of lower heating value (LHV) of ethanol blends from requiring more amount of fuel to be injected into the combustion chamber. This had led to more effort and energy required to vaporise the fuel for combustion and extended the duration for vaporisation process. However, the combustion durations of ethanol-blended fuels were noticeable shorter than that baseline diesel except for E20. This was explained by the significant faster flame propagation velocity, better fuel spray-air mixing and oxygenate content of ethanol compared to diesel fuel [26]. Despite the high heat of vaporisation of ethanol, the lower density and viscosity of ethanol have enhanced the fuel breakdown and atomisation which in turn promotes rapid combustion (shorter combustion duration in Fig. 3 through improving the air–fuel mixing process [27]. Combustion delay and combustion duration were a direct function of the ethanol fraction in the fuel blends [27]. In general, the peak of the RoHR curves decreased with the ethanol blend ratio for low (1.21 bar) and medium (2.47 bar) engine load conditions. However, the opposite trend of RoHR magnitude for the ethanol-blended fuels at high engine load condition (3.71 bar), indicated a substantial drop and followed by increases as the amount of ethanol in the fuel blend increases. The RoHR decreased because of the combined effects of ethanol’s high latent heat of vaporisation and high amount of fuel injected that absorbs a significant amount of heat within the combustion chamber. Although, the pressure curve indicated a marginally higher peak pressure than the diesel baseline condition suggests a rapid burning rate that raises the pressure and temperature within the cylinder. Mass fraction burnt (MFB) analysis was performed based on the change of in-cylinder pressure by combustion volume change and the change by expansion of the combusted gas [39] this also allows the calculations of the ignition delays and combustion durations. Ignition delay was computed from start of injection to MFB at 10% (CA10), and combustion duration was obtained through the duration between CA10 to CA90 (MFB at 90%). MFB at 50% (CA50 is the crank angle degree where 50% of fuel fraction is converted to heat energy, commonly used for fuel characterisation for comparing combustion characteristics [40,41]. Overall, a longer ignition delay could be observed as ethanol content in the fuel blend increases for all engine loads as indicated in Fig. 3 This was the consequence of a high latent heat of vaporisation and low cetane index of ethanol that prolongs the time required to absorb heat from the compressed air and start the self-ignition process in comparison to neat diesel fuel. Meanwhile, a shortened combustion duration with ethanol fraction due to ethanol in the fuel blend was confirmed at CA50, corresponding to significant reduction of combustion duration caused by the high flame velocity of ethanol combustion. The use of E20 demonstrated the longest combustion duration for any given engine load. Exhaust gas temperature was a parameter to assess the combustion process and it had a strong correlation to the combustion temperature. In addition to that, this could also provide an estimation post combustion oxidation of THC and CO in late expansion stroke. In Fig. 4 a, E10 exhibited the highest EGT of all fuel blends at all engine loads. In general, no trend was observed by the EGT of an engine operated with ethanol. EGT substantially increased with E10, as the ethanol fraction increased up to 20 %, and at 30% blend, the EGT dropped further. Subsequently, EGT increased again at high ethanol fraction blends (40 % and 50%). The substantial increment of EGT with E10 indicated higher combustion temperature, was thought that the ethanol fraction did not impact much on in-cylinder temperature during injection (higher heat of vaporisation), but it had, in fact, boosted the temperature during combustion due to the higher adiabatic flame temperature. This was further confirmed by high peak pressure of in-cylinder pressure profiles in Fig. 2. The dropping EGT trend with E20 and E30 could be explained by the greater amount of ethanol into the combustion chamber and the ethanol fraction absorbed the heat during the fuel vaporisation process, as indicated in the greater BSFC (Fig. 4b). This had resulted in the lower combustion temperature. Furthermore, the faster flame speed of ethanol could have promoted the flame quenching phenomenon in comparison to baseline diesel and E10. Therefore, the lower combustion temperature and flame quenching occurrence had collectively lowered the EGT at E20 and E30 conditions. Although the same scenario was thought to happen at E40 and E50, but because the ignition was significantly retarded, and the combustions take place up to the late expansion stroke, the heat loss was not as prominent as E20 and E30 conditions. BSFC was the parameter to assess the fuel economy of the engine combusting with different ethanol blends. BSFC increased proportionally with ethanol fraction blended with baseline diesel as the result of the lower LHV. More fuel was required to compensate the lower LHV for the same engine output when it is compared to baseline diesel compared to neat diesel fuel as illustrated in Fig. 4b [42,43]. To evaluate the amount mechanical output was generated from energy input by fuel, BTE was calculated from the ratio between brake output powers to input energy from the fuel depicted in Fig. 4c. Ethanol fraction in fuel depicted a slight improvement in BTE for E10 through to E30 as a result of the oxygen content in the fuel and the physiochemical properties of ethanol in better fuel atomisation, improving the air–fuel mixing process. Both, collectively, had enhanced the combustion process in the combustion chamber. As the ethanol fraction increased to 40% and 50%, the BTE deteriorated as the consequence of LHV as more fuel was required to be injected into the combustion, leading to the fuel cooling effect became significant. This had further caused in the drop of the combustion efficiency as shown in Fig. 4d, especially at low engine load where combustion was less stable when compared to the higher engine load conditions. The lower density and viscosity of ethanol compared to diesel also contributed to the change in injected fuel spray characteristics such as fuel spray penetration length, spray cone angle, fuel droplet size, and mean axial velocity [25,44]. In this study, the benefits from improved fuel spray characteristics that enhanced the combustion process through improved fuel–air mixing could be observed by comparing E10 to E30 (in aspect of BTE). The advantage from ethanol was overwhelmed by the cooling effect of the higher latent heat of vaporisation of ethanol when up to 50%-vol. of ethanol (E50) was used."
8,Emission characteristics,"3.2 Emission characteristics Overall, the brake specific emission for NOx and BSNOx decreased with the elevated BMEP as a consequence of the increased rate of fuel injection that led to higher heat release rate and raised the pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber as shown in Fig. 5 . Considering the volumetric concentration, NO concentration steadily rose with elevated BMEP as the result of increased combustion pressure and temperature. However, in respect to brake output power generated, NO concentration (ppm-vol.) only marginally increased while brake output power increased substantially, hence the decreasing trend of specific NO emission over the BMEP range. The combustion characteristics of ethanol-blended fuels discussed in the previous section demonstrated the tendency for ethanol to reduce thermal NOx. This was because of a reduced RoHR (that reduced combustion temperature), shortened combustion duration caused by longer combustion delay and fast flame propagation speed (which decreases residence time of NO to completely oxidise into NO2) [27,39]. Ethanol’s latent heat of evaporation was a parameter that showed a significant impact upon NOx formation, especially, the suppression of thermal NO formation which decreased with the increase of ethanol blend (E10 → E50) due to the greater magnitude of the cooling effect causing a deterioration of combustion. The effects of ethanol addition on the brake specific HC emissions (BSHC) were as shown in Fig. 6 . BSHC was reduced with the higher BMEP due to higher combustion temperature promoting the post-combustion oxidation process. Meanwhile, BSHC noticeably increased as ethanol was added for the entire engine load. This agreed with the previous studies reported [26,27]. This phenomenon was caused by the incomplete combustion caused by the flame quenching due to the heat lost to evaporation of ethanol that reduced post-combustion oxidation of THC. Another factor that contributed to the incomplete combustion of ethanol blends was the fuel spray impingement due to the longer spray penetration as more fuel was required with ethanol blends due to lower LHV [37].The relatively longer fuel spray of ethanol blends was the result of the higher latent heat of vaporisation that prolonged the liquid phase of the fuel droplets. In turn, the liquid fuel droplets carried more momentum than vaporised droplets, leading to the fuel impingement on the cylinder wall and crevices resulting in increased unburnt hydrocarbons [37]. The increased ethanol fraction in the fuel blend resulted in the enhanced HC/NOx ratio for all engine load conditions compared to neat diesel fuel as indicated in Fig. 6b. The increased HC/NOx ratio was reported to improve the HC-SCR NOx reduction performance [19,38] as the consequence of raising the amount of NOx reducing agent (THC) in the exhaust stream which will be discussed further in the next section (“Effect on the HC-SCR system”). On the other hand, CO was mainly formed by the incomplete combustion process where air–fuel mixing was poor, and CO was unable to oxidise into CO2. CO was the indicator of combustion efficiency which was inversely proportional and discussed in the previous section (also shown in Fig. 4d). In general, CO emission from CI engine was drastically lower in comparison to spark ignition (SI) engines due to the nature of overall lean AFR (highly excess air combustion) of compression ignition engines [36,39]. Brake specific CO emissions (BSCO) for all fuel blends declined with the increase of engine load due to an elevated temperature in the combustion chamber that enhances CO oxidation during post-combustion process. In this study, BSCO substantially increased with lowering AFR (or increasing equivalence ratio (ϕ)) [36,39] as a result of more fuel injected when the ethanol ratio increased (due to lowered LHV of fuel blends) as shown in Fig. 7 ."
9,Effect on the HC-SCR system,"3.3 Effect on the HC-SCR system The effects of ethanol blends on combustion characteristics and engine-out emissions have been discussed. The fuel blends showed to be beneficial for NOx reduction without major engine modification through lowering thermal NO generation. On top of that, ethanol fuel blends increased THC concentration and it could enhance the HC/NOx ratio. Greater HC/NOx ratio caused by ethanol addition could be the key to improve the performance of NOx conversion for HC-SCR [17] as there were more HC molecules to selectively react with the NO molecules to reduce them into N2. With the baseline condition, where HC-SCR without H2 addition (denoted: 0 ppmH2), the NOx conversion was 26% for baseline fuel (diesel: E0) and substantially increased to 32% when E10 blend was used as shown in Fig. 8 . However, NOx conversion significantly dropped for E20 blend (13%) and gradually increased again (up to 43%) as ethanol content increased (E30 → E50). This indicated that the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst was less selective toward reducing NO and NO2 with such ratio of ethanol blends. Hydrogen addition prior to the HC-SCR catalyst generally enhanced the NOx reduction performance of HC-SCR system by reversing catalyst deactivation caused by the adsorption of heavy hydrocarbon molecules that reduced the adsorption process of NO molecules onto catalyst active sites [17,18,22,45]. The merit of H2 addition on NOx reduction could be seen up to 1000 ppmH2 in the exhaust gas stream. Higher H2 concentration from this point resulted in a decline in NOx reduction performance for all fuel blends. The NO concentration considerably decreased with 250–1000 ppmH2 injected which significantly contributed to the improved NOx conversion compared with HC-SCR without H2 addition. Low H2 concentrations (250–1000 ppmH2), where the H2/NOx ratio was between 0.55 and 3.36 and HC/NOx ratio was between 0.31 and 0.64, are within the optimised window of HC-SCR operating condition reported by Sitshebo et al. [22]. Injecting of 1000 ppmH2 demonstrated the overall highest NOx conversion for ethanol fuel blends mainly contributed by significant NO and NO2 reduction for E20, E30, E40 and E50 blends. The lowered NOx reduction activity for E0 fuel due to activation of HC oxidation that reduced availability of HC as reducing agent [22,23]. It may be concluded by this study that 1000 ppmH2 addition was the optimum condition in terms of NOx conversion efficiency. Up to 73% NOx conversion could be observed with an E50 blend. The result demonstrated the merit of high ethanol content that enhanced NOx reduction through the combined effects of modified combustion characteristics, increased HC concentration in the exhaust gas feed (hence, higher HC/NOx ratio), and HC-SCR enhancement by ‘H2-effect’ [46]. Meanwhile, higher H2 concentrations of 2000 and 3000 ppm-vol. (H2/NOx ratio = 4.39 to 10.08) exhibited an adverse trend on NOx reduction as shown in Fig. 9 . It was inferred that a higher H2 concentration greatly promotes NOx formation. In this case, NOx was thought to be formed through desorption of nitrate from the catalyst sites activated by the presence of H2 at low temperature (<300 °C). Significant temperature increase caused by HC and CO oxidation activated by H2 which sharply raised the catalyst temperature. The effects of hydrocarbon activation by hydrogen could be observed starting with small H2 addition (250 to 500 ppmH2). This exhibited a mild exothermic reaction, and it was confirmed with the temperature rise witnessed in Fig. 10 again the drop in HC concentration (Fig. 11 ) for fuel blends. The rise of CO and CO2 concentrations were consistent with the decrease in O2 concentration which indicated the activation of hydrocarbon oxidation (and partial oxidation) by the H2 presence in the reactant feed. Meanwhile, increasing H2 in the reactant feed to 1000 and 2000 ppm-vol., CO concentration started to drop significantly while CO2 concentration increased demonstrating the oxidation of CO into CO2. At high H2 addition (2000 and 3000 ppm-vol.), HC concentration noticeably increased which might infer that this was the result of increased breaking of C-H and C-C bonds of heavy hydrocarbon molecules by radical species generated by the presence of H2 [23]. The hydrocarbon break-down speculation was based on our findings of higher HC concentration of conditions with H2 injection in comparison with baseline condition."
10,Implementation in practical application and future work,"The experimental results demonstrated the possibility to cost-effectively improve NOx emissions using high ethanol content fuel blends with Ag/Al2O3 catalyst and hydrogen injection. The fuel blend could be used with minimal modification to the existing fuel injection system. The proposed system could be operated without a complex control system (e.g. periodically switching between rich and lean AFR modes for LNT and urea-less SCR systems, or urea injection dosage controls in urea-SCR system) which was feasible for the implementation in agriculture or stationary application where cost and reliability were important factors, and engine was operated at steady-state. The expected future works will be devoted to: 1) Hydrocarbon speciation to explain how the H2 presence influences the behaviour and activation of hydrocarbon oxidation on Ag/Al2O3 catalysts, 2) The study of combustion characteristics and HC-SCR performances at different engine speeds, 3) H2 injection strategy to maximise NOx reduction performance while minimising amount of H2 required, and 4) The study of diesel particulate matter morphology and nanostructure."
11,Conclusion,"This research work was carried out experimentally on a direct-injection diesel engine fuelled with diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends (up to 50% ethanol in blends) to observe the effects of ethanol blends on combustion and emission characteristics. Higher ethanol fraction (50 %vol.) in fuel blends resulted in longer ignition delays (up to 50%), shorter combustion durations (up to 68%) and lowered rates of heat release (up to 36%) which effectively reduced BSNOx and increase BSHC (up to 46% and 58%, respectively). In additions, Ethanol was expected to enhance NOx reduction of Ag-based catalyst HC-SCR system. The increased HC/NOx ratio by increasing ethanol content in fuel blends enhanced NOx reduction efficiency of HC-SCR system (up to 43%) than the engine operated on diesel/biodiesel fuels. The presence of small hydrogen additions (1000 ppm) in exhaust feed enhanced NOx reduction activities up to 73% over HC-SCR through the activation of hydrocarbon oxidation and enhanced catalyst surface nitrate desorption process at the low temperature region (<300 °C). These results suggested that the use of ethanol and biodiesel blends with diesel fuel as alternative fuel had significant benefit in terms of engine emissions, aftertreatment and environmental pollution. In addition, the design properties and combustion of these fuels could be further improved to manipulate NOx reduction activities of the HC-SCR system. However, the optimum conditions for the use of silver-alumina catalyst in exhaust gas treatment were needed to achieve optimal nitrogen oxide reduction. Furthermore, exhaust gas reformer for on-board H2 production could also contribute to an improved engine-aftertreatment system (e.g. SCR, Lean-NOx trap) aiming to achieve future emissions regulations of NOx."
