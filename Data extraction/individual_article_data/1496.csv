0,Introduction,
1,Ethanol,"1.1 Ethanol The effects of greenhouse gas and air pollution on climate change and human health have been on the rise in recent decades. Many countries have therefore begun to put an emphasis on the development and application of alternative sources of energy. Among these, hydrogen is the best energy carrier on earth because it is clean and rich in energy [1]. Therefore, the core technologies of hydrogen energy, including production, storage, and transportation, as well as applications have been developed. Hydrogen production technologies can also be divided into electrolysis, reformation, and bio-hydrogen production, among others. The reformate technology used to produce hydrogen has been widely applied to industry and several types of fuel cell systems [2]. Many kinds of materials can be used as reforming fuels, including coal as the solid phase, natural gas, propane, and ammonia as the gas phase, and alcohols (e.g. methanol and ethanol), gasoline and diesel as the liquid phase. Over the last few years, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, researchers have been limiting utilization of fossil fuels and have been examining hydrogen production by biofuels. Among these, bioethanol as a reforming fuel is being extensively investigated and discussed. Bioethanol has the same properties as ethanol, which is made from a fossil material. Bioethanol from biomass is produced by microbial fermentation of sugar. Brazil has developed the bioethanol industry because of the oil crisis in the early 1970s [3]. Nowadays, due to the demand for carbon dioxide reduction and the unstable supply of crude oil, increasing numbers of countries are developing it. In 2016, the production of bio-ethanol all over the world was 117.7 million m³. In 2017, the ethanol production remained at nearly 117.6 million m³ [4]. Bioethanol can be produced from many kinds of feedstock, including corn and wheat crops, rice straw, willow, Pennisetum, miscanthus, and sorghum plants, among others [5]. There is also much ongoing research into the development of waste straw and sawdust from municipal solid wastes for use in the production of ethanol fuels [6]. Bioethanol can be used as an alternative fuel to power vehicles. It is commonly blended with gasoline in a range from 5 vol% to 85 vol% and the popular blending ratio is 10 vol % (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline is also called E10). The engine operates without any modification when low-level blends of E10 is fed [7]. Ethanol blended with gasoline fuel as an engine system is cleaner and more efficient because of its higher octane number [8]. At the same time, it is generally recognized that bioethanol is produced from biomass, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions because plants capture carbon dioxide when they grow [9]."
2,Hydrogen production of ethanol,"1.2 Hydrogen production of ethanol Because of the protection of environment and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, hydrogen application has known as the best solution. Hydrogen can be applied to fuel cell system such as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which will reduce the noise and vibration as well as higher fuel economy than internal combustion engines. It also can be employed for combustion enhancement, and the hydrogen-rich syngas of reforming can raise the combustion efficiency of an engine because of its properties of low ignition energy, high flame, and diffusion speed [10]. Bioethanol is also a good reforming material for hydrogen production since it is easy to store and transport, and unlike methanol, bioethanol is non-toxic. It is friendlier to the environment and to human health [11]. There have been many papers discussing bioethanol and ethanol reforming as well as its application for fuel cells. Oliveira et al. [12] presented a study of direct bioethanol fuel cells to examine how the operating conditions and design parameters affected the ethanol and water crossover rate. They concluded that bioethanol used in fuel cells would lead to financial opportunities and energy resources as well as environmental progress in the future. Tippawan et al. [13] applied a thermodynamic approach to a two-step steam reforming of ethanol integrated with solid oxide fuel cell process using a CaO sorbent to capture CO2. Their results showed that the more the CaO was, the higher the hydrogen yield became, and the higher power output generated. Kraleva et al. [14] used an xNiAlZn catalyst to perform partial oxidation reforming of bioethanol with only 5 wt% Ni to convert the ethanol completely at 700 °C. Moreover, the experiment was proven over 100 h of testing without any significant degradation. Lee et al. [15] applied a new metal catalytic species, Sn ion to hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming. They found that the maximum H2 production appears at 75% and the maximum ethanol conversion 92%, and the Sn-based activity has a long-lasting reactivity. Nissan Motor Company [16] announced that they had developed an electric vehicle and might have an extended range by using SOFCs running on bioethanol. Wang et al. [17] carried out the dry reforming of ethanol and CO2 using a thermodynamic analysis. Their results indicated that under the most favorable conditions yielded, syngas production was 94% without any carbon deposits. Autothermal reforming or oxidative steam reforming of ethanol is also a subject, which has been discussed in many studies, because it has the advantage of higher efficiency than partial oxidation reforming, and no external heat has to be applied, like steam reforming. There has been a significant amount of research on autothermal reforming of ethanol using thermodynamic analyses or experimental investigations. Liu et al. [18] analyzed hydrogen production by oxidative steam reforming of ethanol using a thermodynamic analysis. Their results showed that when the highest hydrogen yield was, the lowest methane yield and carbon formation could be obtained at a temperature of 900 K. Moreover, Sun et al. [19] also compared hydrogen production using different reforming methods, including partial oxidation, steam reforming, and autothermal reforming of ethanol by thermodynamic analysis. They observed that neutral temperature increases with increasing oxygen-to-ethanol mole ratio, and it decreased with increasing steam-to-ethanol mole ratio. Ávila et al. [20] used an in-house code to conduct the hydrogen production of ethanol reforming. Their results showed that the highest net mole production of H2 was achieved at temperatures higher than 1123 K. Graschinsky et al. [21] also carried out thermodynamic analyses of autothermal reforming of ethanol for reaction temperatures ranging from 600 K to 1200 K at H2O/EtOH ratios ranging from 0 to 9 and O2/EtOH molar ratios between 0 and 1.25. They found that when oxygen increased, hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields decreased due to the oxidation reaction, and carbon formation became negligible. In terms of experiments, Chen et al. [22] and Cai et al. [23] evaluated the effects of hydrogen production using Ir, Ru, Rh, and Pd based catalysts. Their results indicated that Ir/La2O3 had better activity and selectivity to hydrogen; however, Ru, Ir and Rh supported on lanthanum sesquioxide showed similar activity and selectivity to hydrogen. Chiu et al. [24] assessed the hydrogen production of ethanol reforming using different catalysts including Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru coated on the metal substrate Al2O3. They observed that the highest syngas concentration which was 43.41% can be achieved using Rh/Al2O3, and 42.08% can be obtained using Ru/Al2O3. Baruah et al. [25] reviewed and discussed research articles concerning autothermal reforming of ethanol published prior to 2014. They assessed the efficiency of hydrogen production using the non-noble and noble metal catalyst as well as a reformer design."
3,Urea,"1.3 Urea Urea has been receiving more attention because it is the good hydrogen carrier [26]. Urea is an organic chemical composed of C, N, O, and H. Urea can produce 86 g of hydrogen per liter, which is not only higher than hydrogen storage (70 g per liter) in the liquid phase at −252 °C, but is also higher than hydrogen storage (43 g per liter) at a pressure 800 kg/cm2 [27]. Urea is in the form of crystals or powder, and it is colorless, non-flammable, non-toxic, stable, and easy to store and transport. It can dissolve in water, ethanol, and glycerin, among others. Commercial urea is made from carbon dioxide and ammonia, and it can be made from municipal wastewaters as an alternative source [28]. Approximately a billion tons of urea is produced each year, over 90% of which is used as fertilizer [29]. On the other hand, urea can be used in vehicle applications. Diesel engine vehicles are in compliance with Euro 5 emission regulations equipped with a selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) intended to reduce the NOx emissions [30]. The SCR utilizes AUS injected into the exhaust pipe that reacts with the NOx on the selective catalyst to convert it into N2 and H2O. AUS is tasteless and colorless, and it is blended with 32.5 wt% urea and 67.5 wt% deionized water (AUS 32). Although hydrogen content of urea is lower than that of liquid ammonia and methanol, it has some advantages including being non-flammable and non-explosive, as well as inexpensive. Therefore, it is very suitable for vehicle applications and satisfies the requirement of being a hydrogen carrier with a hydrogen content of more than 5 wt%, as defined by the US DOE [31]."
4,Urea application in the energy field,"1.4 Urea application in the energy field Since the advantages of urea are mentioned above, increasing numbers of researchers have been investigating hydrogen production of urea and its applications. Rollinson et al. [32] designed a continuous flow packed-bed reactor and conducted steam reforming of urea for the purpose for producing syngas at 600 °C. The reactor for the experiment was filled with a nickel-based catalyst, and was operated at atmospheric pressure under S/C ratios between 4 and 7. They reported that the hydrogen yield was 3 mol per mole of urea. Furukawa et al. [33] assessed steam reforming of urea by utilizing different kinds of catalysts, including both noble and non-noble metals. Their results indicated that the hydrogen yield of a Ruthenium-based (Ru/Al2O3) catalyst was higher than that of other catalysts with 92 mol H2 and 1.8 mol CO. Giovanni and Umberto [34] evaluated the application of urea on an SOFC system, and the experimental results revealed that the efficiency of the SOFC system could be as high as 40% using urea decomposition to produce and feed syngas into it. Zheng et al. [35] assessed the in-situ generation of H2O2 as an oxidant for direct urea fuel cell, and the urea was conducted in a decomposition reaction, which was not through a reforming process used in the fuel cell. The above cited papers indicated that previous studies on hydrogen production of bioethanol or ethanol reforming have only focused on effects of different catalysts. No studies or any research papers have been published to discuss the hydrogen production using the combination of two different hydrogen carriers such as AUS and ethanol. In addition, from Refs. [24] and [33], it is practical to utilize Ru/Al2O3 as the sharing catalyst of reforming process of ethanol and AUS. Therefore, this study presents a novel concept of hydrogen production by the reforming of ethanol blended with AUS instead of by decomposing urea only. The thermodynamic analysis of Gibbs free energy minimization method is employed to evaluate and compare the performance of syngas production in the steam reforming and autothermal reforming of ethanol that is blended with or without AUS."
5,Methodology and parameter setting,
6,Methodology,"2.1 Methodology The Gibbs free energy minimization method has been used frequently for estimating the reaction parameters of chemical systems and for evaluating syngas production and carbon formation [18–21]. In this study, the Gibbs free energy minimization method is used to calculate chemical thermodynamics including the reaction equation, heat production, species equilibrium, and components of a heterogeneous system. The Gibbs function is shown as Eq. (1) for the gas phase reaction, f i ˆ = ∅ i ˆ y i P f i 0 = p 0 , G i 0 = Δ G fi 0 . (1) n G = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i = ∑ n i G i 0 + R T ∑ n i l n f i ˆ f i 0 In order to minimize free energy, the authors used the Lagrange's multiplier method to solve the above equation, and then Eq. (1) is written according to Eq. (2) as follows. (2) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T l n ∅ i ˆ y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 Δ G f i 0 is the standard Gibbs function of specie i at the standard pressure p 0 equal to 101.3 kPa ∅ i ˆ is the fugacity coefficient of specie i; y i is the mole fraction of the gas phase; λ k is Lagrange's multiplier; a i k is the number of atoms of the k element in each molecule of species i, and A k is the total atomic mass of the kth element in the feed. When AUS is involved in the reaction, the atomic elements are H, C, O, and N, where k = 4. If urea is not used in the reaction, the atomic elements are only H, C, O, where k = 3. The possible products are hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ethyne(C2H2), ethane(C2H4), ethane (C2H6), ammonia (NH3), isocyanic acid (HNCO), and carbon (C) in the solid phase, all of which are included in the calculations. The nonlinear equations expressed in Eq. (3) according to the chemical equilibrium and constrained condition can be solved to obtain the mole fraction of the species for the product and reaction enthalpy at different temperatures after the reaction occurs. (3) ∑ i N n i a i k = A k In this study, the commercial software HSC [36] is used to analyze the syngas yield in the reforming process."
7,Chemical equilibrium and parameter setting,"2.2 Chemical equilibrium and parameter setting The physical and chemical characteristics of ethanol and urea are shown in Table 1 . Urea can dissolve in water, methanol, and ethanol. At atmospheric pressure and room temperature, the solubility of urea in water is 51.6 wt% [37], corresponding to 0.315 mol-urea/mole-H2O. The authors used pure steam without AUS and with AUS to compare the syngas yield in the steam reforming of ethanol and the autothermal reforming of ethanol. In the autothermal reforming process, ethanol serves as a heat provider, where urea reforming is an endothermic reaction. The H2O/EtOH molar ratio from 1 to 5 and O2/EtOH molar ratio from 0.2 to 1.2 is set to calculate all yields in the reforming reaction of ethanol blended with and without AUS. In the meantime, the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also calculated in addition to carbon formation. The chemical equilibrium equation of the autothermal reaction of ethanol blended with AUS is shown in Eq. (4), where A refers to the proportional constant, and a, b, d, e, f, g, and h are all equilibrium factors. The reaction temperature for the thermodynamic calculation is set from 0 °C to 1000 °C at normal atmospheric pressure. When x is equal to 0, the equation shows a partial oxidation reforming reaction of ethanol. When y is equal to 0, and z is not equal to 0, this represents steam reforming of ethanol blended with AUS, where z is equal to 0.315x. At the same time, if z is equal to 0, it is a steam reforming of ethanol without AUS. When x, y, and z are not equal to 0, an autothermal reforming reaction occurs. The reaction path of the syngas production of urea has five main reactions [33] that include urea hydrolysis, NH3 decomposition, urea decomposition, hydronitrogen decomposition, and a water-gas shift reaction in sequence. The total chemical equilibrium equation of reforming of AUS is shown as Eq. (5). In this study, the H2O and AUS are set as the gas phase of the reaction. (4) C2H5OH (l)+ x(H2O(g) +z(NH2)2CO (g) )+y(O2+3.76N2)→A(aH2+bCO + c CO2+dCH4+fN2)+g H2O + hC + j C2H5OH x = 0; y≠0 (partial oxidation reforming,POX) x≠0; y = 0 (Steam Reforming,SR),z = 0.315x z = 0 without urea, z≠0 with urea (z = 0.315x) x≠0; y≠0 (Autothermal Reforming,ATR): z = 0 without urea, z≠0 with urea (z = 0.315x) (5) H 2 NCONH 2 (g) + H 2 O (g) → CO 2 + 3 H 2 + N 2 Δ H 298 0 = 80.4 kJ/mol"
8,Test bench setup,"2.3 Test bench setup The test bench for the hydrogen production of ethanol reforming is shown in Fig. 1 . This bench includes a reactant supply system, a signal measurement and acquirement system, a cooling and gas-liquid separation system, and a gaseous production analysis system. In this study, the cylindrical reformer contains stainless steel with five catalyst packed bed tubes, and a coiled tube surrounding the central catalyst tube to recover the exhaust waste heat provided by exhaust gas from a diesel burner. The pellet Ru/CeO2 catalyst with 1.2 wt % loading is filled in the catalyst tubes. The reaction air flows through the coiled tube and is heated. The other components of reformer include a two-fluid porous wide-angle nozzle and thermocouples. The thermocouples are set to measure the temperature of the catalyst packed bed. The authors analyze the gaseous products using gas chromatography (GC, Aglient 6850). It can be used to analyze the volume concentration percentage of gaseous products including H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2. The autothermal reforming of ethanol with and without AUS is conducted in this study. The control parameters include the ethanol flow rate, the flow rate of water (without AUS), the flow rate of the AUS, the air to fuel ratio (A/F ratio), and the reaction temperature. The flow rate of ethanol is set at 20 c.c./min and corresponds to a heating value of 7.81 kW; the steam to carbon ratio (S/C) is set as 1, 2 and 3, and the oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) is set 0.8. In the experimental process, when the temperature of catalyst packed bed is heated up to 500 °C, the injector starts to inject ethanol into the reformer. The catalyst reaction temperature and the gaseous concentrations of the products are measured."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield of SRE,"3.1 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield of SRE Steam reforming without AUS, chemical reaction Eq. (4), can be simplified to Eq. (6), for which the ideal reaction equation is shown as Eq. (7). For the comparison and validation of results, the authors have added the data of reference [21] in Figs. 2–4, 6(a), 7(a) , 9(a), and the data of reference [18] in Fig. 10. The comparison and validation of results will be discussed. As illustrated in Fig. 2, when the H2O/EtOH ratios are equal to 1, 3 and 5, the hydrogen yield is affected more than without the blended urea using the urea blending ratio. Hydrogen production is enhanced using an increased urea blending ratio. The highest hydrogen yield occurs under reaction temperatures between 700 °C and 800 °C, whereas the hydrogen yield decreases slightly when the temperature is over 800 °C. Because the H2O production increases with an increase in temperature, the equilibrium of reaction is affected. When the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 3 without AUS, the hydrogen yield is as high as 4.49 mol at reaction temperatures ranging from 750 °C to 800 °C. The data are closer to the ones as shown in Ref. [21], which is illustrated in Fig. 2 at water to ethanol molar ratio (R) of 3 and oxygen to ethanol molar ratio (Ro) of zero. When it is blended with AUS, 0.96 mol of urea can dissolve in 3 mol of H2O, and it can produce 2.88 mol of hydrogen in the reforming process. However, based on the thermodynamics calculation, the hydrogen yield is 6.4 mol when the reforming is with AUS at 800 °C, which is 1.42 times higher than that without AUS. At the same time, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5, the hydrogen yield is as high as 4.88 mol of steam reforming using pure steam at 700 °C. This result is similar to that of reference [21]. For ethanol blended with AUS, the hydrogen yield can theoretically increase by 4.8 mol. The hydrogen yield is 8.01 mol at 700 °C, and the highest yield is 8.15 mol at 750 °C. The highest yield is 1.67 times higher than the hydrogen yield of 4.87 mol using pure steam without AUS. Therefore, if external heat is not considered, blended urea can increase the hydrogen yield in the same volume of water. It can be applied to a plentiful supply of heat condition, in which an example is sufficient waste heat recovered from a combustion engine. (6) C2H5OH (l) +xH2O (g) →A(aH2+bCO + c CO2+dCH4+fN2)+gH2O + hC + jC2H5OH (7) C 2 H 5 OH (l) + 3 H 2 O (g) → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ H 298 0 = 173 kJ/mol Fig. 3 shows that whether the AUS is blended or not during the reforming of ethanol, carbon monoxide increases with increasing temperature. The difference exhibits that steam reforming of ethanol without AUS, carbon monoxide yield decreases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratios at temperatures higher than 700 °C. This is the same trend as reference [21] because the carbon reacts with excessive H2O and conducts a water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction. On the contrary, carbon monoxide increases sustainably with increasing urea blending ratios because of the carbon atom content of urea. The carbon monoxide comes close to increasing proportionally with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio when the reaction temperature is over 800 °C. For ethanol with AUS, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 3 at a reaction temperature of 700 °C, the carbon monoxide yield is 1.99 mol. Carbon monoxide yield for reforming without AUS is 1.25 mol, and the yield of 0.74 mol is lower than that with blending AUS. At the same time, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5 at 700 °C with blending AUS, the carbon monoxide yield is 2.2 mol but without AUS, the carbon monoxide yield is 0.99 mol. The gap in the carbon monoxide yield becomes greater and greater with increasing temperature whether the AUS is blended or not."
11,Carbon formation and heat production of SRE,"3.2 Carbon formation and heat production of SRE Carbon deposits are harmful to the reforming reaction. Hence, discussion of the temperature at which carbon formation occurs is one of the most important parts of a thermodynamic analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, when the H2O/EtOH ratio grows, the temperature of carbon formation drops and expands into the range of reforming temperature because of the coal gasification reaction. When the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 1, it is not suitable for ethanol reforming hydrogen production because carbon will be produced at 900 °C, which is greater than the temperature ranging from 700 °C to 800 °C where the highest hydrogen yield occurs. However, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 3, the steam reforming of ethanol without AUS will not produce carbon when the reaction temperature is higher than 250 °C. The results for the steam reforming of ethanol without AUS show the close ones in Ref. [21]. In contrast, with the AUS, carbon will be produced when the reaction temperature is lower than 650 °C in the process. This is the barrier of steam reforming of ethanol blended with AUS because urea contains a carbon atom. If the H2O/EtOH ratio increases to 5, as shown in Fig. 4, there is no influence of urea on carbon formation. For ethanol with the AUS, there will be no carbon formation at temperatures above 221 °C. Under the same conditions without the AUS, carbon will not be produced above 118 °C. Fig. 5 shows that the steam reforming of ethanol is an endothermic reaction, where the heat production is positive, and it means that heat input to the reformer is required from outside to maintain the ongoing reaction. When the H2O/EtOH ratio increases from 1 to 5, the heat production increases with increasing H2O molar ratios, this means that more heat must be input to the reforming reaction. For ethanol with the AUS, the molarity of the urea increases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio, and the heat production also grows. The comparison between the heat production under the H2O/EtOH ratio of 3 with and without the AUS at 700 °C indicates that the heat production is 694.9 kJ/mol with the AUS and is 433.5 kJ/mol without the AUS. The heat production with AUS is 261.4 kJ/mol higher than that without AUS. At the same temperature, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5 with AUS, the heat production is 934.6 kJ/mol, but it is 486.1 kJ/mol without AUS. In other words, the steam reforming of ethanol with AUS requires heat production 1.9 times as large as that without AUS."
12,Hydrogen yield of ATRE,"3.3 Hydrogen yield of ATRE The autothermal reforming of ethanol is shown as Eq. (4). For ethanol without AUS, the reaction equation becomes Eq. (8), for which the theoretical reaction is shown as Eq. (9). (8) C2H5OH(l)+x(H2O (g)+y(O2+3.76N2(g) )→A(aH2+bCO + c CO2+dCH4+fN2)(g)+gH2O + hC + j C2H5OH (9) C 2 H 5 OH (l) + 1.78 H 2 O (g) + 0.61 O 2 (g) → 4.78 H 2 (g) + 2 CO 2 (g) Δ H 298 0 ≈ 0 kJ/mol The hydrogen yield of autothermal reforming of ethanol at different H2O/EtOH ratios are shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(a) represents the reaction at 600 °C, where it can be seen that both with or without AUS, the hydrogen yield increases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio but decreases with an increase in the O2/EtOH ratio, because the oxygen reacts with the hydrogen and reduces the hydrogen yield; the results have the same trend with reference [21]. With the AUS, the highest hydrogen yield is 6.3 mol, which occurs at an O2/EtOH ratio is equal to 0.2. The lowest hydrogen yield is 6.09 mol when the O2/EtOH ratio equals 1.2, which is 0.21 mol lower than the highest value. For O2/EtOH with AUS, the hydrogen yield increases with an increase in moles of urea. At an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5, with AUS, when the O2/EtOH molar ratio is equal to 1.2, the hydrogen yield is 6.09 mol, which is 2.98 mol higher than that without AUS. Fig. 6(b) shows a comparison of hydrogen yield at different H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH ratios, where the hydrogen yield increases slightly with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio at 800 °C. At the same H2O/EtOH ratio, the hydrogen yield drops off proportionally with a decrease in O2/EtOH. With the AUS, the hydrogen yield increases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio but decreases in proportion with a decrease in the O2/EtOH ratio, which is the same as the case without AUS. When the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5 and the O2/EtOH ratio is equal to 1.2, the biggest difference occurs, which the hydrogen yield is 3.44 mol higher when it blends with AUS."
13,Carbon monoxide yield of ATRE,"3.4 Carbon monoxide yield of ATRE A comparison of the carbon monoxide yield at different H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH ratios are shown in Fig. 7 (a) at 600 °C. It is different from hydrogen yields without AUS where the carbon monoxide yield drops off when H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH ratios increase at 600 °C. The oxygen oxides the carbon monoxide and favors the water to undergo the WGS reaction [21]. It can be found after comparing with reference [21] that the results were close to the results in this study at H2O/EtOH ratio is ranged from 1 to 5, and O2/EtOH of 1 when it is without AUS. However, with AUS, the carbon monoxide yield still exhibits an increasing trend when the H2O/EtOH ratio increases because urea also proportionally increases. In addition, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is less than 3, the influence of the O2/EtOH ratio on carbon monoxide yield is more obvious and exhibits a reverse trend. That is, the carbon monoxide yield decreases with an increase in the O2/EtOH ratio. However, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is greater than 3, the O2/EtOH ratio only has a small influence on carbon monoxide yield of 0.06 mol. At 600 °C, the biggest difference between ethanol with and without AUS occurs when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5, and the O2/EtOH ratio is equal to 1.2, where the carbon monoxide yield with AUS is 1.13 mol, but is only 0.39 mol without AUS. There is a 2.89 times difference between them. As illustrated in Fig. 7(b), the carbon monoxide yield with AUS has the same trend for temperatures of both 800 °C and 600 °C, which increases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio without AUS, the carbon monoxide yield decreases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio. Whether the AUS is added or not, carbon monoxide yield exhibits a decreasing trend when the O2/EtOH ratio increases. The biggest difference in the carbon monoxide yield occurs at an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 and an O2/EtOH ratio of 0.2, in which the carbon monoxide yield with AUS is 2.46 mol, and it without AUS is 1.1 mol. There is a 1.37 mol difference. Furthermore, at an O2/EtOH ratio of 1.2, the carbon monoxide yield with AUS is 1.98 mol, and it is 0.7 mol without AUS."
14,Carbon formation of ATRE,"3.5 Carbon formation of ATRE The amount of carbon formation in an autothermal reforming reaction is greater than that of steam reforming. Therefore, carbon formation and avoiding carbon deposits is very important when the reaction occurs. As mentioned in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the highest yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide occurs when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 3, 4 or 5. Hence, Fig. 8 shows that the temperature of carbon formation occurs when the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 3, 4 or 5, and the O2/EtOH ratio is equal to 1.2. This illustrates that both with and without AUS, the temperature at which carbon forms decreases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio. When ethanol with AUS undergoes reforming, the carbon formation zone is greater than it is without AUS because of the carbon atom in urea. Furthermore, when the H2O/EtOH ratio is greater than 3 and the O2/EtOH ratio is greater than 1.0, although urea can expand the carbon formation zone, the lowest carbon formation temperature is below 300 °C. In other words, when the reforming reaction operates at temperature higher than 300 °C, carbon formation can be avoided, and the common reforming process can take place."
15,Methane production of ATRE,"3.6 Methane production of ATRE Under the reforming of ethanol, the amount of methane production refers to the reforming conversion efficiency. The methane will capture the hydrogen atom and reduce hydrogen yield. Methane should not be fed into fuel cells such as those in solid oxidation fuel cell systems. The methane yield generated in autothermal reforming of ethanol with and without AUS is indicated in Fig. 9 (a). The comparison of methane yield of reference [21] is well close to the result of this study under the same operation condition, which is O2/EtOH ratio of 1 and H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 when it without the AUS. Fig. 9(a) shows that at 600 °C, methane yield decreases with AUS as the H2O/EtOH ratio increases. Moreover, whether the AUS is added or not, methane and carbon monoxide exhibits the same trend of decreasing with an increase in the O2/EtOH ratio. At an O2/EtOH ratio of 1.2, the methane yield with AUS increases slightly as the H2O/EtOH ratio rises. Fig. 9(b) shows that the methane yield is less than 0.5 mol when the reaction temperature increases to 800 °C. Meanwhile, when the O2/EtOH ratio is higher than 0.8, there is no methane yield whether the AUS is added or not because methane is oxidized or reformatted at high temperatures under adequate oxygen concentrations."
16,Heat production of ATRE,"3.7 Heat production of ATRE Heat production during autothermal reforming of ethanol with or without AUS is shown in Fig. 10. The neutral thermal temperature (TNT) of reference [18] is about 567 °C (840 K) at H2O/EtOH ratio of 4 and O2/EtOH ratio of 0.8, and it is close to that of this study. Due to the presence of urea, reforming is an endothermic reaction, which reduces the thermal neutral temperature as a result of increases in the urea molar ratio. At the same H2O/EtOH ratio, thermal neutral temperature increases with an increase in the O2/EtOH ratio and decreases with a decrease in the O2/EtOH ratio. Without the AUS at an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 and an O2/EtOH ratio equal to 1.2, the thermal neutral temperature is approximately 700 °C, but it decreases to 450 °C when it reacts during the AUS. If one wants to raise the thermal neutral temperature, the O2/EtOH ratio must also be raised. It can be found from the above comparison that the results of references [18] and [21] were close to the results of this study in the same condition, which was steam reforming of ethanol without AUS."
17,Influence of AUS,"3.8 Influence of AUS In order to understand the influence of urea in the autothermal reforming of ethanol, this study employs three different degrees of solubility of urea in water, including 0 mol-urea/mole-H2O (without aqueous urea), 0.1 mol-urea/mole-H2O, and 0.2 mol-urea/mole-H2O to evaluate the hydrogen yield and heat production. As shown in Fig. 11 , for an autothermal reforming reaction at an O2/EtOH ratio of 1.2, the hydrogen yield tends towards stability when the reaction temperature is greater than 750 °C. When the ratio of the urea molarity is 0, 0.5 and 1.0, there is 1.5 mol hydrogen-rich gas could be produced following each 0.5 mol increase of urea under the H2O/EtOH ratio of 5. As compared to the same condition without adding AUS, Fig. 11 also illustrates that hydrogen-rich syngas increases about 1.5 mol by increasing 0.5 mol of urea. The result is similar to that obtained by Eq. (4), which can prove that adding AUS could contribute to the syngas production. Fig. 11 also illustrates that the thermal neutral temperature decreases rapidly with an increase in the molarity of urea. The slope of the heat production curve without AUS is gentle when it passes through the zero line. However, as the molarity of the urea increases proportionately, the slope of heat production through the zero line rises with increasing concentrations of urea. At an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 and an O 2/EtOH of 1.2, when the urea/H2O ratio is equal to 0.2, the thermal neutral temperature is 503.2 °C and the syngas yield is 3.67 mol, which is higher than the highest syngas yield occurring at 750 °C without AUS. In other words, one can reduce the thermal neutral temperature by adding urea to acquire the same or higher hydrogen yield than that obtained in traditional autothermal reforming of ethanol using pure steam."
18,Reforming efficiency and cost analysis,"3.9 Reforming efficiency and cost analysis The reforming efficiency of autothermal reforming of ethanol blended with and without AUS is calculated using Eq. (10). Under the same conditions, when the mole fraction of urea n ˙ ( N H 2 ) 2 C O is equal to zero without AUS and the H2O/EtOH ratio is equal to 5, n ˙ ( N H 2 ) 2 C O corresponds to 1.6 mol. (10) Reforming efficiency ( % ) = n ˙ H 2 × L H V H 2 + n ˙ C O × L H V C O n ˙ C 2 H 5 O H × L H V C 2 H 5 O H + n ˙ ( N H 2 ) 2 C O × L H V ( N H 2 ) 2 C O × 100 Fig. 12 shows that for steam reforming at an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5, thermal efficiency is only 1% difference with or without AUS at temperatures over 800 °C, and thermal efficiency without AUS is 120.85%, which is higher than that with AUS, which is 119.66% at 800 °C. The syngas yield without AUS is lower than that with AUS. The nitrogen produced with AUS in the reforming process dilutes the syngas concentration; as a result, the syngas concentration without AUS is approximately 7% higher than that with AUS. Moreover, for autothermal reforming, the reforming efficiency with AUS is much higher than that without AUS. At 800 °C, when ethanol blends with AUS, the reforming efficiency is 93.17%, and the syngas concentration is 51.85%. Both reforming efficiency (72.60%) and syngas concentration (38.10%) are higher than those without AUS. Therefore, adding AUS not only increases the hydrogen yield but also raises the total reforming efficiency of the autothermal reforming process. Table 2 shows the comparison of hydrogen production cost of ethanol reforming with and without AUS. According to reference [38], bioethanol average price is $1.5 per gallon in 2017 approximately and the urea price is $0.219 per kilogram [39]. For steam reforming, the cost of hydrogen production of ethanol reforming without AUS is lower than that with AUS. However, in terms of autothermal reforming, at the best condition that is H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 and the O2/EtOH ratio of 1.2, the cost of hydrogen production of ethanol reforming blended with AUS is lower than that without AUS. Therefore, in autothermal reforming, using AUS to replace pure steam can not only increase the hydrogen yield but also lower the cost."
19,Experimental verification of ethanol reforming,"3.10 Experimental verification of ethanol reforming In this study, the verification of ethanol reforming with and without AUS for hydrogen production is conducted using the test bench that is shown in Fig. 1. The results of the experimental hydrogen concentration of ethanol reforming with and without AUS are compared in Fig. 13 . It can be found that when pure water is replaced by AUS, the higher hydrogen concentration is obviously acquired. When H2O/EtOH is equal to 2 and O2/EtOH is equal to 0.8, the concentration of experimental hydrogen is 26.37%, which is 7.07% higher than that without blending with AUS. When the AUS is added into the reforming, although the increase in experimental CO concentration is not as high as the increase in hydrogen concentration, the higher CO yield is produced in general condition. As also shown in Fig. 13, under all H2O/EtOH ratio conditions, the trend of CO concentration between experimental and simulation results is similar. The trend of the H2 concentration between experimental and simulation results is also similar as H2O/EtOH is equal to 1 and 2. When H2O/EtOH is equal to 3, there is a reverse trend of experimental H2 concentration regardless of AUS is added or not. The season is that the excess water evaporates incompletely and cause a lower reaction rate of reforming limited by the reactor and catalyst. However, the ethanol reforming using AUS to replace pure steam can produce higher H2 and CO concentrations are verified elementarily in this study. Regarding H2 concentration and CO concentration, experimental results are lower than the theoretical ones. This is maybe caused by the reformer design, finite reaction rate and catalyst condition. In the future, the further experiments then need to be conducted to understand the effect of AUS concentration and the catalyst on hydrogen production."
20,Conclusions,"This study provides a novel concept for using AUS to replace steam due to more hydrogen carriers during the reforming process and compares the hydrogen yield and thermal efficiency of steam to that of the autothermal reforming process of ethanol. The findings are as follows: 1. In the same volume, adding AUS can increase hydrogen yield. It increases with the increasing molarity of urea. Under an H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 for steam reforming, the hydrogen yield with AUS is 3.7 times higher than that without AUS. In the case of autothermal reforming, the hydrogen yield decreases with an increase in the molarity of oxygen; when it blends with AUS, the hydrogen yield is 3.44 mol higher and the carbon monoxide yield is 1.28 mol higher than that without AUS at the H2O/EtOH ratio of 5 and the O2/EtOH ratio of 1.2 at 800 °C. 2. Because urea contains carbon atoms, carbon will form more easily than it will without the presence of AUS. Thus, the operating temperature range can be reduced. Carbon formation is affected by steam more than it is by oxygen, and the highest carbon formation temperature decreases with an increase in the H2O/EtOH ratio. When H2O/EtOH ratio is higher than 3 or equal to 3, and O2/EtOH ratio is higher than 0.8, carbon formation can be avoided since the operating temperature is higher than 400 °C. At the low temperature operating condition, the carbon formation and carbon monoxide are higher than those using pure steam; this is the drawback of blending with AUS. 3. In general, syngas yield will increase with AUS when the reforming of ethanol occurs. For steam reforming, nitrogen is produced by AUS, which reduces the concentration of the syngas. Nevertheless, there is only a 1% difference in total reforming efficiency between samples with and without AUS. Moreover, at the best operating condition of autothermal reforming with AUS, the syngas is 51.85% and reforming efficiency is 93.17% when H2O/EtOH ratio is 5, and the O2/EtOH ratio equals 1.2 at 800 °C. 4. Because urea is non-flammable, it plays a role in the endothermic reaction during the reforming process. Therefore, the intensity of the endothermic reaction will increase when the molarity of urea rises. For autothermal reforming, a higher concentration of urea will reduce the thermal neutral temperature, and the blended urea can control the thermal neutral temperature without reducing syngas yield and reforming efficiency as compared to traditional autothermal reforming with pure steam. Moreover, the cost of hydrogen production of ethanol reforming blended with AUS is also lower than that without AUS at the best operating condition. 5. A new concept of ethanol reforming blended with AUS is presented and analyzed, and the elementally verification is also conducted by the tubular reformer. The results showed that the trend of experiments and simulation is similar. Using AUS to replace pure steam actually has benefits of increasing syngas production. In the future, the further experiment needs to be carried out to understand the influence of urea concentration of AUS and catalyst."
