0,Introduction,"To face the rapid growth of energy consumption and its correlated environmental issues, renewable and clean energy sources are unavoidably necessitated [1,2]. Hydrogen is viewed as a promising energy carrier for harnessing green energy through electricity generation or combustion because of its cleanliness, high efficiency, and renewability [3,4]. For sustainable hydrogen production, water electrolysis by renewable energy (e.g. sunlight, wind, and tide) has become an emerging strategy. Electrochemically producing H2 from renewable energy sources allows generating more sustainable and locally distributed energy by eliminating transportation costs accrued from large-scale centralized steam reforming [5,6]. Nevertheless, most of the efficient electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are noble metals, for example, Pt, whose high cost and scarcity limit their potential applications. Therefore, the development of earth-abundant–based electrocatalysts with high efficiency has become an emerging mission for the sustainable and economic hydrogen fuel technology [7–9]. During a large-scale catalytic hydrogen evolution, tremendous quantities of H2 bubbles are rapidly generated under high current densities. When the gas bubbles agglomerate in the middle surface of electrolytes and catalysts, the stability and electrocatalytic activity are deteriorated because of lowering the number of exposed active sites, electron transfer, and the liquid mass transport [10,11]. In the hydrogen industry, the challenge in maintaining the catalytic property of electrodes is mainly boosting the detachment of H2 [12]. In high-current HER, large gas bubbles are regularly created, a superhydrophilic/aerophobic surface is suggested to be an effective way to release these bubbles with unique array architecture [13,14]. As per the utilization of alkaline electrolyte in a regular hydrogen production process, these electrolytes can be exploited for further improvement through a proper setup. Dissimilar to acidic electrolyte, alkaline electrolytes have numerous protons and hydroxyls [15]. Thus, bifunctional electrocatalysts are required to not only emit H2 rapidly but also have the ability of water adsorption and dissociation to obtain ample protons for H2; this brings new challenges to the design of HER catalysts. Computational and experimental studies have shown that layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes, with a great number of active unsaturated sulfur atoms at the edge of catalysts, can act as an effective HER catalyst [16,17]. However, the HER activity of MoS2 is largely limited by its poor conductivity and serious aggregation at the nanoscale [18,19]. In addition, due to the instability of MoS2 under alkaline conditions, MoS2-based nanostructures show an appropriate electrocatalytic activity only in acid or neutral solutions [20]. With relatively low activity in basic solutions, the potential applications of MoS2-based nanostructures have been stopped behind full water splitting systems; thus, great efforts have been devoted to improving the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2 in alkaline electrolytes [20,21]. Despite significant progresses, the facile preparation of ultrathin MoS2 with abundant active edge sites and well-designed structures with high stability and excellent HER activity has yet remained a great challenge. Besides MoS2, other transition metal sulfides, in particular earth-abundant 3d metal (Co, Ni, and so on) chalcogenides, have shown good electrochemical properties [22–24]. These transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been rapidly reached to HER systems as highly promising and stable electrocatalysts. As a positive point, the synergetic effects of nanoscale interfaces in different metal sulfides may enrich structural defects and, thus, activate some inert sites, which can further promote the activities of multimetal sulfides [25]. For instance, MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures were developed through interface engineering to achieve excellent catalytic water splitting performance [26]. Well-defined CoxCeO2+x–MoS2 nanotube hybrids exhibited outstanding hydrogen reduction ability [27]. Compared with pure MoS2, cake-style CoS2@MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid catalysts showed a great hydrodeoxygenation activity [28]. In addition, nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene/rGO, are always used as support materials for the dispersion of TMC nanoflakes with improved conductivity; however, nanocarbon materials cause serious aggregation which decreases the mass transport and effective active area [28,29]. To overcome the aggregation issue of catalysts and their poor conduction, well-defined hierarchical structures of nanorod/nanowire/nanotube arrays, decorated with TMC nanoflakes on metal foams, can be a promising strategy. These defined hierarchical structures facilitate rapid electron transport, enable well-dispersive active constituents of TMC nanoflakes, and, as a result, enhance the performance of HER. For example, Liu et al [30] developed triple Ni–Co–Mo sulfides with 1D and hierarchical nanostructure that concluded in an enhanced catalytic activity in basic electrolyte. Besides, An et al. [7] reported a hybrid nanowire structure consisting of NiS2–MoS2 interlaced nanoflakes by thermal conversion to achieve outstanding alkaline water splitting performance. In fact, there are two strategies to enhance the performance of an electrocatalyst system: (i) increasing the number of active sites on a given electrode (e.g. through directly increasing loading or constructing a catalyst with special structure to expose more active sites per area) and (ii) increasing the intrinsic activity of each active site, in other words, raising the reaction rate of each active site (e.g. the amount of hydrogen produced per second per active site) [31]. Herein, a hierarchical heterostructured composition of nickel foam–supported Co3S4 nanorod arrays embellished with edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes (Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs) is developed as an effective HER catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte. In this design, multiscale pathways are set for efficient charge and mass transport through the hierarchical structure of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs which has porous Nickel form (NF) and moderately distributed Nanorod (NR) arrays; this setup provides significantly enlarged surfaces for the deposition of ultrathin and dense MoS2 flakes. MoS2 flakes can anchor on NR arrays, well disperse with plentiful active sites exposed at the edges, enhance intrinsic activity of active sites (due to the adequate intersection of charge and mass), and include the synergetic effect of bimetal sulfides. The superhydrophilic/aerophobic properties of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs significantly promote the flow of electrolyte and emission of H2. In return, the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential (η10 = 90.3 mV and η1000 = 502.0 mV) and small Tafel slope (61.69 mV dec−1) with advantageous cycling stability in an alkaline electrolyte."

7,Physical characterizations,"2.6 Physical characterizations Field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed on a ZEISS-Merlin field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 Super-Twin transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV with a drop on a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid, which was scraped from the foam surface and dispersed in the ethanol. In addition, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM characterizations were performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 Super-Twin TEM system operated at 300 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) curves were collected on Rigaku with Copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) curves were recorded on a PHI Quantera SXM (ULVAC-PHI) instrument to determine the compositions and valence states of the elements in the samples. Raman spectroscopy measurements were obtained from HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution. The contact angle was measured by VCA Optima 3000S."
8,Electrochemical measurements,"2.7 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements were carried out in a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments Inc. Shanghai, China) equipped with a three-electrode system. The Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF was directly used as the working electrode with the dimensions of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. A graphite rod and Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Polarization curves were recorded using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH (pH 14.0) for hydrogen production. Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained at the corresponding potentials from 0.01 to 1,000,000 Hz for HER at the overpotential of 200 mV with the amplitude of 5 mV. All the potentials reported here were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode by adding a value of (0.098 + 0.059 pH) V. The iR compensation was manually performed for each electrode, through using the potentioelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The compensated potential was modified by the equation Ecompensated = Emeasured – iRs, where Rs is the series resistance determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). All the working electrodes were activated 40 times of the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at a high scanning rate before measurements. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) were estimated by recording the capacitive current connected to the double-layer charging for the scan rate dependence of CVs. The range of impressed potential was 0.1–0.2 V vs. RHE (Reversible hydrogen electrode), and the scan rates were set at 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mV s−1. The double-layere capacitances (Cdl) of various samples were evaluated through plotting ΔJ = (Ja−Jc)/2 against the CV scan rates, where the slope defined Cdl. High Cdl value indicated the abundant active sites on the electrode for HER; this allowed to compare the electrochemical active surface areas of the samples."

10,Characterization of edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs,"3.1 Characterization of edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs The schematic design of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs is illustrated in Fig. 1. The detailed synthesis process is provided in the experimental section. Briefly, Co(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O nanorod arrays are fabricated on commercial NF through the hydrothermal method. The obtained sample serves as the precursor for the sulfurization of nanorods and the steady growth of edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes on nanorods. The crystalline structures of as-prepared samples (including Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs) are characterized by XRD (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a). The result in Fig. 2 a confirms the coexistence of Co3S4, MoS2, Ni, and Ni3S2. The peaks at 2θ = 31.120°, 37.817°, 50.226°, and 55.067° are assigned to (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of Co3S4 (PDF#42–1448), respectively. The peak at 2θ = 14.172° is weak, broad, and quite close to 14.125° which is corresponded to (002) plane of MoS2 (PDF#75–1539). Fig. 2b shows the SEM images of dense Co(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O nanorod arrays grown on NFs. The nanorods are several micrometers in length and tens of nanometers in diameter (the crystal structure of nanorods is confirmed by XRD in Fig. S1b). Fig. 2c and Fig. S2 show the SEM images of as-prepared Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs, where the nanorods possess coral-like morphology and highly wrinkled surface. In contrast with general rough surface of Co3S4 nanorods (Fig. S3), the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF has a distinct edge-exposed surface on each nanorod, which is determined to be edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes in the subsequent characterizations. On the other hand, the sample of grown MoS2 on NFs is also prepared for comparison (Fig. S4); it is featured by a thin layer of dense MoS2 nanoflakes. This result suggests the adoption of Co3S4 nanorod arrays in the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF which efficiently intensifies the loading of MoS2 nanoflakes. Furthermore, Fig. 2d and e show TEM images of typical hierarchical structures of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs, where nanorods are decorated with plenty of ultrathin edge-exposed nanoflakes, each of which consists of few-layers structure with the thickness of several nanometers. The weak intensity of (002) peak verifies the sole existence of MoS2 with few-layers nanoflakes. In fact, (002) plane usually means interlayer spacing between each MoS2 monolayer, when it is reconfirmed with the TEM results (Fig. 2e). Besides, NF as the substrate displays the sharp and intense characteristic peaks. A small amount of NF is not covered tightly by Co(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O array due to the zigzag framework of NF and then is sulfurized in the solvothermal process; this is supported by the observation of several Ni3S2 peaks in Fig. 2a. The contact angle and receding contact angle (θ R) are usually measured to evaluate the wetting and aerophobic properties of HER catalyst surface, respectively [32,33]. All the NF supported samples, including Co3S4@NFs, MoS2@NFs, and Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs, exhibit an initial contact angle of nearly 0° (Supporting Video 1). It is a remarkable fact that Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF with earlier mentioned unique hierarchical structure has superhydrophilic property because the water droplet spreads instantly all over the surface and disappears when contacted with Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs (Supporting Video 1). In contrast, the bare NF keeps a contact angle of 121.0° on the interface (Fig. S5), which shows the hydrophobic property of bare nickel foam. The sketch map of trend of gas detachment from different surfaces is provided in Fig. 2f. Sites 1 and 2 located at the gas-liquid-solid interface are, respectively, corresponded to the quick and slow detachments of hydrogen gas bubbles. The three-phase interface of the electrolyte, catalyst, and gas bubble is similar to receding wetting behavior on the catalyst. With smaller θ R, the harder gas bubble grows further and thus is easier to detach from the surface of the catalyst [32]. The θ R value of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs shows the minimum angle (15.70°) compared with bare nickel foam (41.10°), Co3S4@NFs (23.16°), and MoS2@NFs (26.94°) (Fig. 2g). This finding suggests the efficient detachment of gas bubbles from the superaerophobic surface of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs when they are small. All in all, it is expected that the superhydrophilic/aerophobic properties of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs enhance the intensity of phase contact between the liquid and solid substances and also promote the flow of electrolyte and emission of H2. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100513 The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Video 1 Video 1 The interior heterostructure and elemental distribution are further studied by HRTEM and EDS in Fig. 3 . The evident lattice fringes with the interplane spacing of 0.279 nm and 0.630 nm in Fig. 3a and b are consistent with the d-spacing of (311) planes of Co3S4 and (002) planes of MoS2, respectively [34,35]. The SEM and TEM results are the comprehensive piece of evidence on the well-designed heterostructure of Co3S4 nanorod embellished with edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes formed as proposed in Fig. 1. Fig. 3c provides the EDS mapping on a single Edge-MoS2/Co3S4 nanorod, which exhibits uniform elemental distribution of Co, Mo, and S (Figs. S6a and S7a). The absence of Ni element, specifically Ni3S2, is clearly detected in the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4 nanorod array. Further elemental mapping analysis of a cluster of several edge-exposed nanoflakes (Fig. 3d, Figs. S6b and S7b) reveals the coexistence of Co3S4 and MoS2 on nanoflakes. It is most likely that the precursors and the Mo source on the surface of precursors are sulfurized simultaneously, which produce the heterostructure catalyst consisting of Co3S4 nanorod embellished with edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes. The Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF is further characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4 a) and XPS. The Raman spectrum demonstrates the heterostructures of Co3S4 and MoS2. Several peaks under 500 cm−1 are assigned to F2g (148.00 cm−1), Eg (218.98 cm−1), and F2g (341.40 cm−1) vibrations of Co3S4, as well as to E1g (294.80 cm−1), E 2 g 1 (373.53 cm−1), and A1g (401.90 cm−1) vibrations of MoS2 [36–38]. It is worth mentioning that the three strong peaks between 800 and 1,000 cm−1 can be well ascribed to the molecular structure of [Mo3S13], which is reported as an excellent HER active substance usually existing at the MoS2 edge sites [39,40]. This further approves the fact that a large quantity of undercoordinated Mo–S edge sites are exposed. XPS analysis is used to investigate the chemical states of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs as depicted in Fig. S8 and Fig. 4b–d; full XPS spectrum of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs indicates the presence of Mo, Co, S, Ni, and O elements (Fig. S8). The Mo 3d spectrum shows two significant peaks located at 229.02 eV and 232.27 eV (Fig. 4b), which belong to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, suggesting a +4-oxidation state, as well as the formation of MoS2 [41,42]. The nearby S 2s peak is located at 227.37 eV, consistent with the previous reports on MoS2 which verify Mo4+ and S2− chemical state on the account of Mo–S charge transfer [7,25]. Another peak located at 235.4 eV also belongs to Mo 3d3/2 which reveals an oxidation state of +6. The partly oxidation of active MoS2 exposed to air is the probable cause of oxidation state and but also due to the [Mo3S13] existing at the MoS2 edge sites considering the Raman spectrum result in Fig. 4a [39,40]. The spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 4c) can be divided into two pairs of spin-orbit doublets, (780.52, 796.42 eV) and (783.02, 797.82 eV), which belong to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively [42,43]. The coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ is in accordance with the chemical state of Co3S4. Fig. 4d suggests the core-level spectrum of the S 2p region with two important peaks and one shake-up satellite, where the binding energy peaks at 161.90 and 163.21 eV are referred to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively [40,44]. From this evidence, the concurrence of Mo–S and Co–S is evidenced with slight differences with the standard patterns. These facts explain the redistribution of charge on their heterogeneous interfaces as a result of electron interaction between the mixed MoS2 and Co3S4 (Fig. 3a)."
11,Electrocatalytic HER activity of edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs,"3.2 Electrocatalytic HER activity of edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs Electrocatalytic performance of HER of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs was measured in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH alkaline electrolyte through steady-state LSV. To reveal the synergetic effect of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs for an enhanced HER performance, the control samples of bare NFs, Ni3S2@NFs, Co3S4@NFs, MoS2@NFs, and commercial Pt/C (20 %wt Pt on Vulcan carbon black) were prepared and examined (refer Experimental Section for details). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the HER activity of NFs is inert in the alkaline electrolyte. Ni3S2@NFs showed very weak HER performance (≈232.2 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, Fig. 5a). Co3S4@NFs exhibited the inferior HER activity with the overpotential of 161.2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 slightly larger than the result of MoS2@NFs (149.2 mV at 10 mA cm−2); these results verified MoS2@NFs with better performance than Co3S4@NFs. In contrast, Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs displayed a superior electrocatalytic performance with a significant overpotential of 90.3 mV at 10 mA cm−2. This property is better than that of many other transition metal sulphide–based HER catalysts reported so far (refer the statistical results in Table S1 and Fig. 5g), already approached to that of Pt/C (≈69 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, Fig. 5a). Few works of transition metal sulfide–based HER catalysts have been reported on the HER performance at large current density [33,45]. It is noted that Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF is even able to maintain a low overpotential at large current density (502.0 mV to achieve 1,000 mA cm−2), which overtakes the figure for Pt/C when the overpotential is as large as 708.0 mV (Fig. S9). It indicates the advantage of superhydrophilic/aerophobic surface and the unique synergic effects of Co3S4 and MoS2 in this meticulously built hierarchical and heterostructure catalyst of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF. The underneath mechanism responsible for the substantially enhanced HER activity is further elaborated as following. The consistent development of HER kinetics can be revealed by Tafel plots. Corresponding Tafel slopes of the Tafel plots in Fig. 5b and their electrocatalysts’ exchange current densities (j0) were further calculated to evaluate the inherent HER activities (Table 1 ). According to traditional electrochemical theory [46], HER in alkaline aqueous media proceeds with two steps reaction (Eqs (1)–(3)) (the asterisk signifies the active site for HER and H∗ means a hydrogen atom bound to an active site). In the first step, a discharge reaction (Volmer reaction) with the Tafel slope of 118 mV dec−1 occurs (Eq. (1)). The following step is either the reaction (Heyrovsky reaction, which includes the ion and atom) with a slope of 40 mV dec−1 (Eq. (2)) or the atom combination reaction (Tafel reaction) with a slope of 30 mV dec−1 (Eq. (3)) [26]. (1) H 2 O ( l ) + e − + ∗ ⇄ H ∗ + O H − ( a q ) V o l m e r r e a c t i o n (2) H ∗ + H 2 O ( l ) + e − ⇄ H 2 ( g ) + O H − ( a q ) + ∗ H e y r o v s k y r e a c t i o n (3) H ∗ + H ∗ ⇄ H 2 ( g ) + 2 ∗ T a f e l r e a c t i o n The obtained Tafel slope of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs (61.69 mV dec−1) is the lowest among all examined catalysts except the commercial Pt/C catalyst (43.49 mV/dec). This implies a sharp increase in the hydrogen generation rate via the applied overpotential, which is corresponded to a high electrocatalytic activity. According to the kinetic analysis in Supporting Information, the value of the Tafel slope of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs (61.69 mV/dec) represents that there is zero electron transferred in the rate-determining step (RDS) and one electron transferred in the step just before the RDS during the hydrogen production in the alkaline electrolyte [47–49]. It means that the RDS occurs after the step of the first time charge transfer (Volmer reaction, Eq. (1)) but just before that of the second time charge transfer (Hyrovsky reaction, Eq. (2)). Furthermore, Kibsgaard et al. [39] supplied an appropriate explanation that H2 evolution reaction with a Tafel slope of about 60 mV/dec has a fast discharge step (the step before RDS, Eq. (1)) and is limited by a chemical step required (RDS) before the electrochemical desorption step (Eq. (2)). Such this rate-determining chemical rearrangement (the RDS step after Eq. (1) but before Eq. (2)) can contribute to a Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec. This suggests Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF has an intermediate reaction process for HER that follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with a rate-determining chemical rearrangement, which is between the initial discharge step (Eq. (1)) and the electrochemical desorption step (Eq. (2)). Meanwhile, Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF exhibits a striking exchange current density (j 0) of 2.1125 mA cm−2, quite close to that of 20% Pt/C (2.5338 mA cm−2). This result verifies the outstanding intrinsic rates of electron transfer of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs, which might highlight the synergetic effect between Co3S4 and MoS2 on account of much lower j 0 of Co3S4@NFs and MoS2@NFs. Furthermore, it is reasonable that the majority of the active content of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs is heterostructure Co3S4 nanorod and edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes rather than a few concomitant Ni3S2 because the j 0 of Ni3S2@NFs is quite low and similar as that of bare NFs. Therefore, the superior HER performance of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs can be mainly rationalized to its heterostructure and improved edge-exposed active sites. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was measured to estimate the effective electrode surface area of catalysts [50,51]. Because C dl is proportional to the ECSA, it may be used to identify different electrocatalytic active sites. As shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S10, the Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF has the largest C dl of 88.65 mF cm−2, nearly 300% of those of Co3S4@NF (23.67 mF cm−2) and MoS2@NF (30.84 mF cm−2) samples, as well as more than 10 times as much as Ni3S2@NF (7.36 mF cm−2). This confirms the highest exposure of effective active sites of the hierarchical Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF structure. EIS was carried out to study the electrode kinetics and interface reactions during the HER process (Fig. 5d). The charge transfer resistances (R ct) of all NF-supported catalysts are low, implying the fast rate of electrons from electrical source to the catalyst surface. In comparison with the other three samples, the Nyquist plots of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs demonstrated noticeable lower charge transfer resistance (Rct ∼0.479 Ω cm−2). The improved charge transfer properties and HER kinetics of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs demonstrate the rapid electron transport during the hydrogen evolution on the hierarchical 1D nanorod arrays as they are directly anchored to the conducting NF which enables these composites inherit an enhanced conductivity. Noteworthy, turnover frequency (TOF) is regarded as the best figure of merit to compare the intrinsic activities of various HER catalyst materials, which represents the number of H2 molecules produced per second per active sites [52]. Owing to the unknown exact number and nature of hydrogen binding sites, the number of active sites is estimated as the number of surface sites including the whole atoms in the cell as possible active sites (refer Supporting Information for details on the calculation of TOF values) [53,54]. Fig. 5e and Table 1 exhibit the TOF values of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs and other samples at the overpotential of 150 mV vs. RHE. Ni3S2@NF shows the lowest TOF value of 0.019 H2 s−1, revealing inert HER activity. Comparably, Co3S4@NF and MoS2@NF provide moderate TOF values of ∼0.027 H2 s−1 and ∼0.029 H2 s−1, respectively. Due to the disignated hierarchical strucure of this composite, Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF displays a superior TOF value (∼0.066 H2 s−1), compared with those of Co3S4@NF and MoS2@NF. This result indicates that the electrocatalytic performance of per active site of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs has been substantially enhanced. It has been reported that edge-exposed MoS2 has a proper hydrogen adsorption free energy while Co3S4 tends to adsorb a water molecule and promotes the process of water dissociation [55,56], in which the Co atom can grab the hydroxyl atom, and it is easy for the S atom to catch the hydrogen atom; they together facilitate a fast and efficient HER process. Therefore, the evidently improved electrocatalytic properties of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs can be explained as the synergetic effect of the closely mixed MoS2 and Co3S4 upon Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs. The stability of the catalyst was further carried out by taking chronoamperometry analysis in alkaline solutions (refer Experimental section for details). As shown in Fig. 5f, the performance of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs has a negligible loss throughout the whole 20 h period (approximately 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential vs. RHE), revealing the excellent stability of Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NFs. The good stability is mainly related to the strong interaction in the heterostructure of Co3S4 and MoS2."
12,Conclusion,"In short, a hierarchical heterostructured HER catalyst Edge-MoS2/Co3S4@NF was well designed; this catalyst presents a superior HER activity by comprehensively integrating the advantages of multilevel structure and the synergetic effect between Co3S4 and MoS2 as follows: (1) the superhydrophilic/aerophobic surface provided the rapid spread of electrolyte and accelerated the detachment of H2. (2) Co3S4 nanorod arrays provided a short path (a fast charge step before the RDS) for the effective electron transport directly to the catalytic active substance of edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes. (3) The sufficient coverage of edge-exposed MoS2 nanoflakes on the Co3S4 nanorod arrays supported by NFs gave a rise to the high dispersion of MoS2 nanoflakes, which promoted the loading of active substances and provided abundant active sites for the HER process. (4) The synergetic effect of the unique heterostructure of Co3S4 and MoS2 improved the intrinsic electrocatalytic ability compared with individual Co3S4 or MoS2. This work provides a facile strategy to develop effective HER catalysts through the synergy of enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic processes, shedding lights on the advanced design of functional materials for energy chemistry."
