0,Introduction,"The increase in the generation of solid organic waste due to population growth (7.7 billion) and the intensification of agriculture has had negative impacts on society and on the environment as a result of the emission of pollutants. In order to mitigate impacts, the reuse of organic solid waste as raw material in biological processes enables the recovery of value added products with concomitant bioenergy production [1], reinforcing the concept of biorefinery where there is valorization of by-products and minimization of remaining waste released into the environment. Organic solid waste-derived volatile fatty acids (VFA) have been considered as building-blocks for the hydrogen (H2) production by dark fermentation [2], thus, the use of wastes which are easily hydrolyzed into simple carbohydrates could be considered an interesting substrate for obtaining valuable end-products, due to little or no need for initial pretreatment, reducing the cost of the process. About 144 million tons/year of banana (Musa spp.) is widely produced in the worldwide, in addition, banana waste contains high organic matter concentrations in the form of total suspended solids (108 gTSS L−1) and soluble organic material (56 g COD L−1), including carbohydrates, such as glucose (8 g L−1), fructose (7 g L−1) and sucrose (3 g L−1) [3]. According to Refs. [4], high concentrations of organic matter in the substrate can result in higher microbial biomass concentration and positive influence on the H2 production. Thus, the use of banana waste as a renewable raw material can contribute with the advance in the development of renewable energy production, since it a variety of carbohydrates present this waste can be fermented to H2 and organic acids by autochthonous bacterial. One of the main limitations for H2 production from agricultural waste, such as banana waste, is the low biodegradability of substrate and the intolerance to inhibitory compounds, as high acids concentration and aromatic compounds, produced during substrate fermentation. To overcome these barriers, the application of autochthonous bacteria, as bioaugmentation strategy, with high hydrolytic and fermentative activity e tolerance to high polyphenol concentrations and compound recalcitrante (herbicides and pesticides), can overcome the toxicity this elements present in banana peel. Besides, autochthonous bacteria have greater adaptation capacity when its own vegetal biomass is used for its growth and metabolism, when compared to the application in other types of substrate [5]. Bacteria of the genus Clostridium, Paenibacillus, Bacillus, Thermoanaerobacterium and Caloramator have been reported as the main fermenting bacteria for their ability to degrade lignocellulosic materials through cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes and for producing H2, organic acids and solvents [6–8]. The interest for H2 is not restricted to its usage as a source of energy, because of its high heating value (122 kJ g−1), but also its various applications as starting material in the pharmaceutical, petrochemical and chemical industries [9]. Nathoa et al. (2014) [10] reported yield of 209,9 mL H2. g−1 volatile solids using banana peel ground in a blender to particles of diameter approx. 0.5 mm as substrate in batch reactor at 37 °C and pH 6.0. Rai et al. (2019) [11] observed 43 mL H2 per 30 mL media at 5% w/v of chemical (acid/basic) pretreated banana peel powder waste (BPPW) in batch reactor at 38 °C and pH 7.0 with Bacillus licheniformis. The yield of H2 of 142 mL H2.g−1 total carbohydrates was obtained by Ref. [3] in dark fermentation from banana waste crushed in industrial blender and posteriorly sieved (2 mm-mesh) using batch reactor at 37 °C and pH 7.0 with Bacillus sp. isolated from the waste itself. The authors also observed production of ethanol and acetic, caproic and butyric acids. However, no reports were found in the literature for the dark fermentation from banana waste without chemical pre-treatments of the substrate e associating the reactor operational performance with metabolic functions autochthonous bacteria, emphasizing the importance of this research. It is known that hydrogen production is influenced by many factors, such as pH [12], temperature [13], substrate concentration [14], inoculum [15] and partial pressure [16]. However, these factors were studied separately, and there are no reports on the effects of these factors on the fermentation process of banana waste. When there are many variables involved in the process, the Plackett-Burman experimental design is an excellent tool of high practical significance for assessing the effect of each variable on the desired responses [17]. Jiang et al. (2014) [18] evaluated the effect of eight variables (NaCl, glucose, yeast, tryptone, FeSO4 and MgSO4, initial pH and incubation temperature) in hydrogen production from deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment in batch reactor. The initial pH, tryptone and yeast were significant variables, in which the optimal culture conditions for hydrogen production were initial pH of 7.7, 8.3 g L−1 tryptone and 7.9 g L−1 yeast. Under these conditions, the maximum cumulative hydrogen volume was 1.58 L H2 L−1 medium. A total of 6 variables included sweet potato starch concentration, initial pH, Aji-L concentration, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) concentration, iron (II) sulfate (FeSO4) concentration and nutrient solution addition that were evaluated by Placket-Burman design that affects the hydrogen production by mixed cultures. Only the variables sweet potato concentration, FeSO4 concentration, and initial pH were significant factors for hydrogen production, whose maximum cumulative hydrogen production was of 3501 mL L−1 [19]. However, only using statistical tools is not sufficient to overcome some of the conventional limitations, as operational conditions of the reactor, there is the need to vigorously consider modern bioinformatics approaches for enhanced hydrogen production. It is vital to comprehensively understand the complex microbial communities involved in organic waste fermentation in terms of taxonomic compositions, metabolic pathways and relations between operational conditions, biodiversity and functional genes [20]. Campanaro et al. (2018) [21] made use of bioinformatics tools to profile functional interactions between microbial species involved in the anaerobic digestion process and identify key microbial enzyme-encoding genomes involved in the metabolic pathways. Recently, by metagenomic analysis, different microbial communities were observed in terms of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which were influenced by independent variables [22,23]. These studies have greatly enriched our knowledge about the taxonomic profile and functional genes of the microbial community and their correlation in establishing metabolic pathways in anaerobic reactors using different lignocellulosic waste. In this scenario, the effect of the variables pH (5.5–7.7), temperature (30-44 °C), headspace volume (40–60%), percentage of inoculum (5–15%) and carbohydrates concentration (3–15 g L−1) were evaluated by the Plackett-Burman (PB) design in H2 production using ripe banana waste (pulp and peel) as substrate and source of fermentative bacteria. In addition, it was possible to correlate the taxonomic profile with reactor performance as well as to identify the main genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of H2 production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrate and autochthonous inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and autochthonous inoculum Banana waste (BW) which consisted of a mixture of pulp and peel was collected at grocery (São Carlos, Brazil). This solid waste was crushed in industrial blender and posteriorly sieved (2 mm-mesh). The resulting extract was stirred and mixed in a mechanical stirrer with flow profile containing chicane and stored in plastic bottles and kept stored at −20 °C until use. The inoculum source was autochthonous microbiota obtained from natural fermentation of banana waste. For this, Duran® bottle (2 L total volume) was filled with 1 L of BW (24 g L−1 volatile suspended solids (VSS) and 31 g L−1 total soluble carbohydrates (CT)). The pH was not adjusted, keep the pH natural of the BW (initial pH ~ 4.4) The bottles were subject to nitrogen gas atmosphere (100%) for 10 min and then sealed with a rubber stopper and plastic thread and after cultivated at 37 °C for 2 days without agitation. The reactor biomass was recovered by centrifugation with resuspension of the pellet in a new condition (banana waste) for three more times. This biomass was used as autochthonous inoculum in all batch assays for hydrogen production."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Plackett-Burman design was performed with 12 assays for the five variables studied at two levels, with the addition of 3 central points totaling 15 assays (in triplicate) (Table 1 ) calculated based on the use of equation (1) [17]. (1) r × P B + c p = 1 × 12 + 3 = 15 All assays were conducted in batch reactors of 250 ml of useful volume. The BW was used as the only carbon source and the autochthonous inoculum was used as hydrogen-producing bacteria source. For this, the autochthonous inoculum was centrifuged at 1250 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force) for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet transferred to the reactors. The variables temperature, headspace volume, percentage of inoculum, substrate concentration and pH were adjusted according to Table 1. The PCS medium (5.0 g L−1 CaCO3, 5.0 g L−1 NaCl; 5.0 g L−1 peptone and 1.0 g L−1 yeast extract) [24] was used to compose the working volume. The bottles were subjected to nitrogen gas atmosphere (100%) for 10 min and capped with butyl rubber stoppers and plastic thread."
4,Chromatographic and chemical analysis,"2.3 Chromatographic and chemical analysis The biogas in the headspace was assessed by gas chromatography (GC 2010, Shimadzu®) through Carboxen™ 1010 PLOT (30 m × 0.53 mm) capillary column with argon as carrier gas. Soluble metabolites (organic acids and ethanol) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm, 7.8 mm) with column oven (CTO-20A) at 43 °C, UV-diode array detector (SDP-M10 AVP), system controller (SCL-10 AVP) and a pump (LC-10 ADVP) [25]. The determination of pH and volatile suspended solids (VSS) was performed by Ref. [26] and total dissolved carbohydrates by Refs. [27]."
5,Kinetic modeling and statistical analysis,"2.4 Kinetic modeling and statistical analysis The experimental data was adjusted to the average values from triplicates reactors using the software package OriginPro 9.0. The H2 accumulated production was adjusted using modified Gompertz model equation (Equation (2)) modified by Ref. [28]. (2) P H 2 = P × e x p { − exp [ R m × e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where: PH2 is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); λ is the starting time for H2 production (h); P is the hydrogen production (mL); Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL H2. h−1) and (Euler number) is the constant of 2.718281828. To evaluate the statistical methods the effect of factors on the H2 production kinetics (PH2, Rm and λH2), total soluble carbohydrates (TC), hydrogen yield (YH2) and organic acids were analyzed using the software Protimiza Experimental Design, which can be accessed by subscribing to the site http://experimental-design.protimiza.com.br."
6,Metagenomics analysis,"2.5 Metagenomics analysis Two samples were selected to evaluate the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial community, including inoculum and assay 6 (regarding higher H2 production). Sample preparation consisted of separating the suspended cells by centrifugation (10 min). For this, the autochthonous inoculum was centrifuged at 706 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force) for 10 min at 5 °C and subsequently washed with PBSX1 buffer (0.35 g L−1 NaH2PO4+H2O; 8.2 g L−1 NaCl and 1.05 g L−1 Na2HPO4) and stored at −20 °C. The FastDNA SPIN Kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) was used to extract the metagenomic DNA from each sample following the manufacturer's instruction. The quality and quantity of the DNA extract were evaluated with Nanodrop 2000 equipment (ThermoFisher Scientific (https://mlz-garching.de/files/nanodrop_2000_user_manual)) and gel electrophoresis (0.8%). The library preparation (Illumina® TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit) and metagenomics sequencing (Illumina HiSeq Platform; 2 × 100 bp) were performed at the Animal Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Animal Science (ESALQ/USP, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Metagenomics analysis of raw sequences was performed by the Multidisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural Research. (CPQBA)/UNICAMP. The fastqc tool (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.CA.uk/projects/fastqc/) was used to check the quality of the libraries, then, low-quality sequences (Phred score < 20) were trimmed and reads shorter than 50 bp were discarded using the Trimmomatic tool [29]. After a normalization step using kmer counts (21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101) the individual assembly of each library was conducted with the metaSPAdes tool [30,31] and the assembly quality was verified with the metaQUAST tool [32]. A minimal threshold of 150 bp was applied to contig length. The FMAP (Functional Mapping and Analysis Pipeline for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies, [33]) tool was used for the taxonomic and functional annotation and mapping of reads with 80% identity cutoff, e-value <1e-3 and genes with coverage >80%, where the RefSeq database (NCBI reference sequence database, [34]) was used for taxonomic annotation, while the UNIREF protein database [35] was used for functional annotation according to the number of KEGG orthologies (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [36,37] The sequences were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.CA.uk) under project accession number PRJEB33574 and sample numbers ERS3583600 (RM1) and ERS3583601 (RM2)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of the experimental variables by Plackett–Burman (PB) design,"3.1 Effects of the experimental variables by Plackett–Burman (PB) design In order to screen the significant factors influencing the hydrogen production fermentation, five variables, including initial pH, temperature, headspace volume, percentage of inoculum and substrate concentration were investigated by PB design. The analysis of the regression coefficients based on the experimental data is shown in Table 2 . Parameters with p values lower than 10% (p < 0.1) were considered significant for the selection of variables. In general, H2 production start time (λH2) was between 2.6 and 9.8 h, with maximum production of around 18 h and stabilization at 30 h of operation (Fig. 1 ). In this study, the p-values of PH2, Rm, λH2 and YH2 were less than 0.1, indicating they were significant terms. The hydrogen yield YH2 (mL.g−1 total carbohydrate added) was calculated based on the initial total soluble carbohydrate concentration contained in the BW sob the accumulated hydrogen production. For PH2 values between 31.01 and 38.08 mL at pH 7.5 and lower values between 6.32 and 29 mL for pH range between 5.5 and 6.5 were observed. Similar hydrogen yield of 43 mL H2 per 30 mL media was achieved by Ref. [11] during the fermentation of pretreated banana peel powder waste (BPPW) in batch reactor at 38 °C and pH 7.0. Similarly, it was found for Rm increased from 1.50 to 4.54 mL h-1 in assays whose initial pH was 5.5 and 7.5, respectively (Table 3 ). Therefore, the pH increase from 5.5 to 7.5 resulted in maximum PH2 and Rm values of 38.08 mL and 4.54 mL h−1 in assays E6 and E1, respectively. The t value was equal to 9° of freedom, i.e., 15 assays minus 6 determined information (5 effects + mean). Similar result was obtained by Ref. [12]). The authors evaluated the effect of pH (5.5–8.0) on glucose and peanut shell such as supplementary substrate fermentation and reported an increase in hydrogen production from 97 to 99 mL with an increase in pH from 5.5 to 6.5. Performance losses in acidogenic processes operated at low pH values are often related to the inhibitory effect of biomass by the accumulation of organic acids in the environment, enhancing this effect in processes under higher temperature conditions. Therefore, low hydrogen production (E3, E7 and E8) associated with acidic pH (pH 5.5) and high temperature (44 °C) may be due to the energy expenditure of the catabolic pathways to maintain the initially low intracellular pH, which was initially low, preventing this energy from being used for biomass synthesis. Regarding the production start time of H2 (λH2), a higher value was found at higher pH (7.5). Thus, lower pH values (5.5) reduced in hours (from 9 h to about 3 h) the start time of hydrogen production, especially in assays with higher temperature (44 °C), low headspace volume (40%) and high percentage of inoculum (15%) (Table 3). Hwang et al. (2011) [38] reported production start time (λH2) of 3–4 h in the fermentation of grape waste in batch reactors with initial pH of 5.2–5.4, similar to the present study (2.6–38 h in pH 5.5). Temperatures above 37 °C are related to the increase in metabolic rates and are closely associated with the enzyme Fe-hydrenase. Thus, the activation of this enzyme under temperature conditions of 44 °C and pH 5.5 may have contributed to obtain reduced λH2 times. Probably lower pH and higher temperature contributed to the rapid growth of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria, resulting in increased concentration of available sugars. The availability of soluble sugars enabled it to rapidly be converted to H2 and organic acids, thus decreasing λH2 (3.89–4.72 h) in assays 3, 7 and 8. However, the rapid production of metabolites such as organic acids may have contributed to change the metabolic pathway of production to inhibit the H2 production process. The higher pH value (7.5) reflected higher hydrogen yield (YH2), which is statistically significant (p < 0.1). Thus, the high YH2 of 103.3 and 122.3 mL H2 g−1 added carbohydrates were obtained in assays E1 and E10, at an initial pH of 7.5. Similar result was obtained [3], of H2 yield of (142 mL H2.g−1 total carbohydrates) from banana waste at pH 7.0 using Bacillus sp. Probably the pH 5.5 conditions were favorable for the growth of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria, while at pH 7.5 it favored the establishment of H2-producing bacteria. Initial pH 5.5, higher temperature (44 °C), carbohydrate concentration (15 g L−1) and headspace (60%) conditions contributed to lower H2 production of 3.2 and 4.9 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrate in assays E7 and E3 respectively. Regarding the variable initial total carbohydrate concentration (TC), no significant values (p > 0.1) were observed for PH2, Rm and λH2, however, the increase in carbohydrate concentration from 3 to 15 g L−1 contributed to the reduction of these response variables (Table 3). High carbohydrate concentrations associated with lower pH (5.5) and higher temperature (44 °C) assays may have contributed to the low H2 production of 6.32 and 6.42 mL in assays E3 and E7, respectively. The condition of higher carbohydrate concentration (organic overload) can lead to the accumulation of biomass and metabolic byproducts, such as H2 and organic acids. On the other hand, for the variable carbohydrate concentration, significant values (p < 0.1) were obtained for YH2 (Table 2). Hydrogen yield (YH2) decreased with increasing carbohydrate concentration, thus, the maximum YH2 values of 103.4, 104.7 and 122.3 mL g−1 carbohydrates were obtained in the assays with 3 g L−1 carbohydrates. However the lowest yields of 3.2 and 4.9 mL g−1 carbohydrates were obtained in the 15 g L−1 assays (Table 3). Regarding the temperature, it was found that the increase from 30 to 44 °C disadvantaged the PH2, Rm and YH2. Thus, the low PH2 (6.32 mL), Rm (2.01 mL h−1) and YH2 (2.79 mL H2 H2 g−1TC add) values were obtained mainly in the assays (E7 and E3) at 44 °C, pH 5.5 and 15 g L−1 carbohydrates. Higher temperatures may have increased membrane permeability to undissociated organic acids, inhibiting hydrogenogenic biomass [39], resulting in lower hydrogen production and yields. Thus, for autochthonous biomass of banana waste, higher temperatures may negatively influence the metabolism of bacteria and consequently result in low H2 production and yields. Reduced hydrogen production start times (λH2) from 4.03 to 3.89 h at 44 °C may be closely associated with the enzyme Fe-hydrogenenase. According to Ref. [40], the hydrogen production process is dependent on this enzyme, which is directly affected by temperature. Thus, the temperature of 44 °C applied to the E3 and E8 assay may have favored Fe-hydrenase activity and, consequently, decreased the start time of hydrogen production, especially at lower pH value (5.5) and higher inoculum concentration (15%). Changes in headspace volume allow evaluating the effect of H2 partial pressure (pH2) on fermentation, since the smaller the headspace volume, the higher the pressure exerted by biogas. Normally, the accumulation of dissolved H2 or pH2 in the headspace alters the flow of electrons in microorganism-catalyzed biochemical reactions, affecting the efficiency and conversion of these reactions [16], resulting in low H2 productions. However, an adverse effect was obtained in the present study, in which the decrease in headspace volume (from 60 to 40%) contributed to obtain higher PH2 (31.01–38.08 mL), Rm (4.25–4.54 mL h-1) and λH2 (6.8–9.79 h) values (Tables 2 and 3). A similar result was obtained by Ref. [23], in which it was found that lower headspace volume significantly favored (α = 0.5) hydrogen production (82 mL) and maximum H2 production rate (3 mL H2.h−1) in the co-digestion of coffee residue. Probably, there was the selection of microorganisms adapted and resistant to higher pH2 or pH2 exerted in batch reactors did not exceed the inhibition threshold. Moreover, the low solubility of H2 under thermophilic conditions, when compared to mesophilic conditions, may also have contributed to the detection of higher headspace of this gas in the assay at 44 °C [41]. Lower and significant hydrogen yield (YH2) (p < 0.1) was observed with headspace volume increasing from 40 to 60%. Thus, lower headspace volume (40%) did not result in excessive pH2 increase to the point of inhibiting hydrogenogenic biomass. For a higher percentage of inoculum from 5 to 15% there was a decrease in PH2, Rm, λH2 and YH2. Thus, the lower percentage of autochthonous inoculum resulted in higher H2 production and production rate, however, in longer periods (8.30–9.79 h). Similar results were obtained by Ref. [15] in which they reported decrease in λH2 from 11 to 7 h with increasing inoculum percentage (without inoculum up to 5%, v/v) in the fermentation of peach pulp waste. The lower PH2 (6.32 and 9.03 mL) and YH2 (2.79 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrate) in assays with higher inoculum concentration may be due to hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenic bacteria, biomass inhibition and/or inhibition of hydrogen producing bacteria for the accumulation of organic acids. Possibly, the higher inoculum concentration resulted in displacement of the metabolic pathway of H2 production for the formation of other products, such as organic acids, acidification of the environment and consequent impairment of the efficiency of biochemical reactions of carbohydrate conversion into hydrogen [15]. The variable inoculum percentage was not statistically significant (p > 0.1) for hydrogen yield (YH2), however, the increase in inoculum concentration contributed to its decrease. Therefore, the low yields obtained (4.9–13,7 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrates) occurred mainly in the assays (E3, E13, E14 and E15) with 10 and 15% of inoculum, while the maximum yields (103.3 and 104.7 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrates) were obtained in assays E1 and E12, corresponding to assays with 5% inoculum."
9,Effects of the experimental variables on the soluble metabolites,"3.2 Effects of the experimental variables on the soluble metabolites The analysis of the production of soluble metabolites helps understanding the dynamics of the acidogenic process. The main soluble metabolites observed from fermentation of banana waste with autochthonous biomass included acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), lactic acid (HLa) and propionic acid (HPr) (Fig. 2 ). Both Butyric (HBu) and Propionic (HPr) were not statistically significant (p > 0.1) for the variables studied (Table 2). However, for both acids the pH increase (5.5–7.5), decreased temperature (44–30 °C) and the increase of headspace volume (40–60%) contributed to the highest HBu concentrations (2.6 g L−1) and HPr (0.23 g L−1) in the assays at pH 7.5, 30 °C and 60% headspace, while the lowest concentrations were obtained in assays 3 and 8, at pH 5.5 and 44 °C, respectively, 0.03 g L−1 and below the detection limit (<DL). On the other hand, the increase in total carbohydrate concentration (3–5 g L−1) and inoculum (5–15%) contributed to the increase of HBu concentration, resulting in a maximum final concentration of 2.6 g L−1 in E5 and E14, corresponding to the assays with higher pH values (6.5 and 7.5, respectively) and high inoculum percentage (10 and 15%, respectively). The maximum concentration of HPr was 0.23 g L−1. According to Refs. [42], higher production of HPr is associated with organic overload. This statement corroborates the maximum final HPr concentration in E2 with 15 g L−1 total carbohydrates. Normally, the occurrence of HPr formation reaction (Equation (3)) is associated with lower PH2. Thus, the highest PH2 values (38.08 and 37.18 mL) obtained in assays 6 and 10 may be due to lower HPr concentrations (below the chromatographic DL curve). (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 → 2 C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 O On the other hand, formation reactions of butyric acid and acetic acid contribute to the hydrogen production in low (2 mol H2 mol glucose) and high yields (4 mol H2 mol glucose), respectively [43]. Thus, the occurrence of these metabolic pathways were crucial for H2 production in the assays, especially in E1, E6 and E10. Higher final concentration of HAc (0.63 and 0.72 g L−1) was obtained in assays 1 and 7, at 44 °C, conditions that favored the establishment of the acetogenic route, and statistically significant (p < 0.1). Similar result was obtained by Ref. [22]; in other words, higher H2 production was associated with higher concentration of HAc and HBu, especially at thermophilic temperatures (50-70 °C). Furthermore, as HAc and ethanol were produced concomitantly in all assays (Fig. 2), it can be inferred that part of HAc was derived from acetogenesis, in which ethanol is converted to HAc [43]. On the other hand, in systems where lactic acid is abundant, the increase in acetic acid concentration may be due to the conversion of lactic acid to acetic and propionic acid (Equation (4)). (4) 3 C H 3 C H ( O H ) C O O H → 2 C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + C H 3 C O O H + C O 2 There was a relevant production of lactic acid (HLa), representing 60% of total organic acids. The highest HLa production, between 2.37 and 5.14 g L−1, was obtained in the assays E3, E7, E11, E13, E14 and E15. Among the analyzed variables, only pH and carbohydrate concentrations were statistically significant (p < 0.1) for HLa production, which were inversely proportional, that is, lower HLa concentrations (0.26–1.6 g L−1) were found for alkaline pH (7.5). However, for higher total carbohydrate concentrations (from 9 to 15 g L−1) associated with acid pH (5.5–6.5), there were higher concentrations of this organic acid (2.37–5.14 g L−1). According to Ref. [44], formation of smaller compounds, such as lactic acid, is favored in acidic pH. The lower H2 productions of 6.32 and 6.42 mL achieved in assays E3 and E7 may also be associated with higher HLa concentrations (2.37 and 3.14 g L−1, respectively), since their favorable production conditions (pH 5.5 and 15 g L−1 TC) were not beneficial for H2 production. It is important to highlight the occurrence of the heterolactic lactic acid production pathway, where in addition to this organic acid, sugars can be converted to ethanol [45] (Equation (5)), justifying the concomitant acquisition of these two metabolites, in all assays. (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → C H 3 C H ( O H ) C O O H + C H 3 C H 2 O H + C O 2 Furthermore, the production of lactic acid for the other variables (temperature, headspace and inoculum) were not statistically significant (p < 0.1). The difference in production profiles of organic acids such as lactic acid was mainly due to the difference in metabolic activities of the bacterial community and not due to the amount of cells [46]. These results corroborate the present research, because the increase of the inoculum percentage (5–10%) did not influence the HLa production in the assays. During fermentation there may be diversion of metabolic pathways from organic acids to alcohol, especially at pH values < 4.0. For example, in the present study, the highest ethanol production of 0.61 and 0.64 gL-1 occurred mainly in assays with final pH value of 3.5, corresponding to assays with low hydrogen production (6.32 and 6.42 mL) (Fig. 2). Generally, lower hydrogen production may be associated with ethanol production, since during the process of substrate conversion to ethanol (Equation (6)) and conversion of organic acids, such as acetic acid to ethanol (Equation (7)), there is no H2 production. Ethanol production may also be associated with metabolism of heterolactic bacteria, as discussed earlier, in which carbohydrates ferment to produce HLa and ethanol.

Similar results were reported by Ref. [23], which higher concentration of ethanol (~0.4 g L−1) in coffe waste co-digestion at pH 5.5, 40 °C and 18.5 g L−1 of soluble carbohydrate-rich wastewater. Such conditions are similar to those obtained in the present research, reinforcing the predominance of solventogenesis in acid pH, high temperature and high substrate concentration."
10,Autochthonous microbial biomass structure,"3.3 Autochthonous microbial biomass structure The taxonomic diversity of autochthonous microbial biomass (inoculum and E6) were evaluated. For the microbial biomass of the inoculum and assay E6, 96 and 94% of relative abundance was observed for representatives of the phylum Firmicutes, respectively. For both samples, the dominant classes were Bacilli (53.68% inoculum and 39.66% E6) and Clostridia (42.13% inoculum and 53.73% E6). Bacteria belonging to the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacilalles were identified in the samples. Among these three, there was lower abundance for Bacilalles (0.69% inoculum and 1.22% E6), when compared to Lactobacillales (53% inoculum and 38%. 44% E6) and Clostridiales (41.77% inoculum and 53.06% E6). Regarding the Bacilli class and Bacilalles order, representatives belonging to the Lactobacillaceae family were identified, with 52.7% of the inoculum biomass representatives and 38.06% of the E6, and also representatives of the Bacillaceae family, with 0.47% of the inoculum and 0.90% of E6. Regarding the class Clostridia and order Clostridiales, representatives of bacteria belonging to the family Clostridiaceae (34.57% inoculum and 40.9% E6) and Peptostreptococcaceae (7.04% inoculum and 12.78% E6) were identified. Generally, the Clostridiaceae family includes bacteria involved in cellulose degradation [22,23,47], providing fermentable substrates (soluble carbohydrates) for hydrogen bacteria and organic acid producers. The main predominant genera identified in the inoculum biomass and E6 are represented in Fig. 3 . It was observed that the predominant genera in both samples were Lactobacillus and Clostridium, followed by Clotridioides, Fusobacterium, Gottschalkia and Bacillus. The predominance of these genera in the microbial biomass at the end of banana fermentation may be due to their adaptation to reactor operating conditions and the versatility to metabolize various carbohydrates, since banana waste is basically glucose, fructose and sucrose [43]. In addition, bacteriocins synthesized by these bacteria may provide competitive advantages over other bacteria. Importantly, there was a change in the relative abundance of genera for the different reactor operating conditions, i.e., for inoculum (pH 4.4, 37 °C) and E6 (pH 7.5, CT 15 g L−1, 44 °C 40% headspace and 15% inoculum) the predominance was Lactobacillus (52.61%) and Clostridium (39.88%), respectively. The higher relative abundance of Clostridium in E6, when compared to the inoculum, may be due to the higher temperature (44 °C) in this assay, when compared to the conditions for obtaining the inoculum (37 °C), since higher temperature selects Clostridium-like bacteria and higher H2 production in thermophilic system [22]. According to Ref. [48], Clostridium species are acid sensitive (pH < 5.0) and adjustment to pH 7.5 in E6 may have contributed to their growth. In addition, Clostridium are resistant to stress conditions, such as higher partial hydrogen pressure (pH2), provided by decreased headspace. In this case, decreasing headspace volume to 40% did not affect the hydrogenogenic population, whose prevalence of Clostridium was higher and that consequently resulted in higher H2 production in E6. Considering the autochthonous microbial biomass structure, it could be postulated that Clostridium was the main responsible for H2 production, HAc and HBu [22,23] in E6, through the Clostridial pathway (Equations (8)–(12)), whose soluble sugars are metabolised to organic acids, mainly acetic and butyric acid. Such an equation is mediated by the enzyme FeFe-hydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of ferredoxin followed by the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas [49].

There was probably the accumulation of lactic acid (1.6 g L−1) and the rapid stabilization of H2 production (~22 h of operation) at the end of E6 at pH below 4.0. Another study [51] reported the predominance of Lactobacillus (27%) in sucrose fermentation in acid pH (~3.0). Thus, the higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus at the end of natural fermentation to obtain inoculum (52.61%) and in E6 (38.02%) may be related to the lower pH value (<5.0) in the medium. Thus, besides the production of lactic acid, the predominance of Lactobacillus in the inoculum and in E6 may be associated with H2 production, since these bacteria use the pathway of this acid to obtain energy at lower carbohydrate concentrations. In addition [52], suggested that converting pyruvic acid to lactic acid (Equation (13)) would result in increased NADH, which in turn would further favor H2 production by reoxidizing NADH molecules into NAD+ (Equation (14)). (13) C H 3 C O C O O H + N A D H + H + → C H 3 C H ( O H ) C O O H + N A D + (14) N A D H + H + → H 2 + N A D + Park et al. (2018) [46] reported that Lactobacillus utilized glucose faster than Clostridium at low levels of glucose (<1 g L−1). It can then be inferred that the predominance of Lactobacillus in the inoculum and in E6 was favored because of substrate depletion conditions at the end of banana fermentation, since carbohydrates were consumed by the microbiota to maintain cell metabolism and production of soluble metabolites and H2. There was a higher relative abundance of Clostridioides in E6 (12.32%) compared to inoculum (6.80%). For Fusobacterium 0.79% and 0.62% was obtained in inoculum and E6, respectively. The identification of these bacteria in the inoculum biomass may have contributed to the production of organic acids, such as butyric acid as the main end product of its metabolism [53]. With regard to Gottschalkia and Bacillus, were obtained relative abundance of 0.31 and 0.21% for inoculum, respectively, and 0.56 and 0.47%, for E6, respectively (Fig. 2). Probably the anaerobic condition of the medium and acid pH (<5.0) conditions at the end of fermentation, higher temperature (44 °C), substrate scarcity and higher concentration of soluble metabolites in the reactor were favorable for these bacteria in E6. Unlike the Clostridial pathway, H2 production via the Enterobacterial pathway occurs through the cleavage of formic acid which is formed concomitantly from the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme NiFe-hydrogenase (Equation (15)) [54]. This pathway may have occurred concurrently with the Clostridial pathway, contributing a portion of H2 production. Bacillus-like bacteria identified in inoculum and in E6 perform both hydrogen production pathways [49]. (15) 2 p i r u v a t o + 2 C o A → 2 a c e t i l − C o A + 2 f o r m i a t o → 2 C O 2 + H 2"
11,Metabolic association between the functional profile and autochthonous microbial biomass,"3.4 Metabolic association between the functional profile and autochthonous microbial biomass The main genes encoding enzymes involved in banana waste fermentation was detected in the autochthonous microbial biomass of the inoculum and E6 (Table 4 ). Autochthonous microbial biomass identified in inoculum and E6 was correlated with performance data, i.e., PH2 and soluble metabolite production in the metabolism of sucrose, fructose and glucose, corresponding to the banana waste degradation (Fig. 4 ). Regarding the first stage of fermentation (hydrolysis), genes related to Fructokinase were identified (EC 2.7.1.4, K00847). Banana fructose can be phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate by Fructokinase using ATP as a phosphate donor. Genes related to this enzyme were abundant in the inoculum (0.56%) and in E6 (0.51%). d-fructose, observed in free form in many fruits and formed by sucrose hydrolysis, can be phosphorylated in C-1 instead of C-6, forming fructose 1-phosphate, which is cleaved to d-glyceraldehyde-3phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in glycolysis and glycogenesis by the action of Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13, K01624) [55]. Genes related to this enzyme were abundant in inoculum (3.4%) and in E6 (2.6%). Thus, the two products of fructose-1-phosphate hydrolysis enter the glycolytic pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Due to the identification of genes related to Fructokinase and Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase, it can be inferred that fructose was one of the main carbohydrates used to produce H2 and metabolites in E6. Since G3P can be directly metabolised in the glycolytic pathway to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, it can be rapidly converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in reversible equation by Triose-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1, K01803) [56]. The total abundance of triosphosphate isomerase genes in the inoculum and in E6 was 2.68% and 2.41%, respectively (Fig. 4). Fructose when converted to fructose-6-P will be catalyzed by 1-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.56, K00882). The relative abundance of genes related to this enzyme in inoculum biomass and E6 was 1.44% and 0.57%, respectively. At the same time as product formation from fructose (sucrose degradation by-product) occurs, the glucose-1-phosphate generated by sucrose phosphorylase is converted to glucose 6-phosphate mediated by phosphoglycomase (EC 5.4.2.2, K01835) (1.6% inoculum and 1.03% E6). As a result, a sucrose molecule can generate 2 mol of glucose-6-phosphate using a phosphoryl group donated from polyphosphate via pentose phosphate. In aqueous media, glucose-6-phosphate can generate two NADH, a 5-phosphate ribulose and a CO2 molecule through the activity of two enzymes, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49, K01803) and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44, K00033) [56]. Genes related to glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were identified in the inoculum sample and E6, corresponding to the total relative abundance of genes of 0.69 and 0.39% and 1.70 and 1.03%, respectively (Table 4). In the acidogenic stage, where there is extensive formation of carboxylic acids concomitantly with H2 production, genes related to pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) (EC 1.2.7.1; K03737) were identified with relative abundance of 18.68% in the inoculum and 19, 21% in E6. Due to the action of this enzyme there is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, transferring electrons to hydrogen synthesis [57]. According to Ref. [58], in the Clostridial pathway, the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is coupled with the reduction of ferredoxin, becoming the main mechanism of H2 production by subsequent oxidation of ferredoxin by FeFe-hydrogenases together with the reduction of protons. Considering the relative abundance of this enzyme's genes in E6, it is assumed that this route was one of the major H2-producing pathways in BW fermentation. In addition to this pathway, pyruvate can be oxidized by PFOR in acetyl CoA to form ethanol, acetic acid and H2. Both l-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27; K00016) and d-lactate dehydrogenase (3.97%; EC 1.1.1.28; K03778) catalyze the synthesis of different lactic acid stereoisomers (L or D) through reduction of pyruvate [45]. The fact that the identification of genes associated with lactate dehydrogenase was abundant in the inoculum biomass and in E6 (Table 4) can infer about the possibility of lactic acid production (1.6 g L−1) in this assay by this pathway (Fig. 4). Similarly [23], also reported the predominance of l-lactate dehydrogenase-related genes (6%) in the autochthonous coffee waste biomass of coffee pulp, husk and processing wastewater co-digestion. The authors associated this predominance with the production of HLa by Lactobacillus. Another enzyme that may have contributed to higher H2 production in E6 was 3-hydroxybutyril-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.157; K00074), whose relative abundance of genes related to the inoculum, and in E6 it was 2.35% and 1, 61%, respectively. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of butyryl-CoA, intermediate molecule for the generation of butanol and butyric acid. Acetate kinase-related genes (EC 2.7.2.1; K00925) were identified with relative abundance of 2.51% and 2.34% in the inoculum and in E6, respectively. This enzyme acts on autotrophic (using H2 and CO2 as electron donor) homoacetogenesis, heterotrophic (from organic compounds including sugars, alcohols, methanol and 2,3-butanediol) and mixotrophic (various substrates). Probably, the production of acetic, lactic, butyric acid and ethanol occurred in E6 by the action of this enzyme [59]. pH 7.5, 44 °C and headspace 40% conditions were imposed on E6, which probably favored this metabolism based on Clostridium, since bacteria similar to this genus perform homoacetogenesis [60]. The activity of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.1; K00001) is related to the bifunctional equation (Ethanol + NAD+ → acetaldehyde + NAD+ + H+ and acetaldehyde + NAD+ + CoA → acetyl-CoA + 2 NADH + H+) [49]. The first step in alcohol metabolism is the oxidation of acetaldehyde by the action of alcohol dehydrogenase, which converts alcohol into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid. This acid can be used as substrate for H2, ethanol and butyric acid production cooperating with higher H2 production and soluble metabolites in E6, in which the relative abundance of this enzyme in this assay was 1,51% (Table 4). Acetyl CoA synthase (ACS) (EC 2.3.1.169; K14138) (9.50 inoculum and 12.41% E6) catalyzes the equation of irreversible conversion of acetic acid and ATP to acetyl adenylate intermediate linked to the enzyme acetyl adenylate (acetyl-AMP). Acetyl-AMP is then converted to acetyl-CoA with AMP release [61]). Acetyl-CoA, in turn, may follow several pathways, including the heterolactic pathway [45] and those producing ethanol, acetic acid, butane and butyric acid [9]. Therefore, these enzymes probably may have acted in the acidogenic stage during banana fermentation, contributing to the production of hydrogen (38.08 mL), acetic acid (0.07 g L−1), ethanol (0.14 g L− 1) and butyric acid (1.19 g L−1) in E6."
12,Conclusion,"The three important factors affecting hydrogen production from banana waste by autochthonous inoculum using Plackett–Burman designs are initial pH, temperature and headspace. The maximum hydrogen production of 38.08 mL was obtained under pH 7.5, 15 g L−1, 44 °C, 40% headspace and 15% inoculum. The main end products obtained in all anaerobic reactors were acetic, butyric and lactic acid besides ethanol, with maximum production of 0.72 g L−1, 2.66 g L−1, 5.14 g L−1 and 0.64 g L−1, respectively. The predominance of Lactobacillus and Clostridium in the inoculum and E6 were associated with the production of these metabolites in BW fermentation, since genes associated with H2, HLa, HAc and HBu producing enzymes were identified in the biomass, including pyruvate ferredoxin, lactate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthase. Through metagenome analysis it was possible to identify genes encoding enzymes involved in acidogenesis and H2 production from sugars present in BW and establish metabolic association between the functional profile and autochthonous microbial biomass."
