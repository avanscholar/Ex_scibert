0,Introduction,"Protein-polysaccharide blends or combinations with biosynthetic polymers have increasingly attracted attention for biomaterial applications (Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Sun, Dai, & Gao, 2017a; Yuan et al., 2016). The functionality and cross-linking mechanisms for proteins -polysaccharides composite films have been reviewed (Azeredo & Waldron, 2016). Among the proteins used in the formation of edible films, zein (ZN), a prolamin protein from the corn endosperm is an interesting material due to its amphiphilicity and self-assembly capabilities through hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001). Owing to the high proportion (50%) of non-polar amino acid residues, zein does not dissolve in water but can be solubilised in acetone, ethanol, anionic detergents and high concentration of urea or alkali (pH ≥ 11) (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001). It is highly regarded for its potential in film formation (Wang & Padua, 2010), development of delivery systems (Liang et al., 2015) and fabrication of fibres and fabrics (Selling, Woods, & Biswas, 2011). Compared to other proteins, zein films present better water vapour barrier properties (Ghanbarzadeh & Oromiehi, 2008). However, they are constrained by fragility and poor extensibility (Argüello-García et al., 2014), limiting their use in tension-based applications. Chitosan (CS), a copolymer of α-(1 → 4) glucosamine, (C6H11O4N) n, is a cationic polysaccharide obtained by alkaline deacetylation of chitin. Besides biodegradability and renewability, its biocompatibility and non-toxic features permit applications in the food industry, particularly in the formulation of food materials, films and coatings (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). The presence of amino groups on the structure of chitosan enables it to undergo ionic or hydrophobic modifications under varying pH (Sun, Zhang, & Chu, 2007). As a widely investigated material for edible film production, notable properties of its products include clear, flexible and robust film materials with an adequate oxygen barrier and may possess antimicrobial properties. Like zein films, chitosan films lack flexibility due to high brittleness and exhibit weak water resistance characteristics (Suyatma, Tighzert, & Copinet, 2005). The weak structural integrity and poor functionality of ZN and CS have challenged the development of edible and biodegradable films. Modification approaches, including chemical and physical techniques, continue to remedy the shortcomings of the food contact materials through various crosslinking mechanisms (Azeredo & Waldron, 2016). Attempts by previous studies to involve ZN/CS blends in the formulation of edible films (Cheng, Wang, & Weng, 2015; Escamilla-García et al., 2013) or delivery systems involving nanoparticles (Liang et al., 2015) showed that additional cross-linking techniques such as the use of dicarboxylic acids or heat were required for improvement of mechanical and functional properties. However, the continued use of chemicals and energy inefficient modification techniques render these materials less attractive for food applications (Ashogbon & Akintayo, 2014). A major drawback to the use of chemicals is the occurrence of undesired changes and potential toxic effects (Sun et al., 2007). In addition, the majority of chemically and physically modified films and coating still exhibit poor mechanical and barrier properties (Azeredo & Waldron, 2016). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) is a biodegradable and non-toxic bio-synthetic polymer (Chiellini, Corti, D'Antone, & Solaro, 2003) used as an ingredient in the food and pharmaceutical applications, for example, in the production of coatings and films (Nakano et al., 2007; Wright, Andrews, McCoy, & Jones, 2013). The linear carbon backbone of PVOH is rich in hydroxyl (–OH) groups making it highly hydrophilic and dispersible in water. The chemical structure of PVOH permits various reactions through cross-linking between the −OH groups and other polar molecules to form entanglements and aggregates (Bercea, Morariu, & Teodorescu, 2016). Its excellent film forming ability has been used in combination with numerous biopolymers to enhance their mechanical properties and chemical resistance (Senna, Salmieri, El-naggar, Safrany, & Lacroix, 2010; Srinivasa, Ramesh, Kumar, & Tharanathan, 2003). Although there have been wide applications of ZN/CS blends in the formulation of delivery systems and nanoparticles (Luo, Zhang, Cheng, & Wang, 2010; Müller et al., 2011), applications in edible film formulations have only recently emerged (Cheng et al., 2015; Escamilla-García et al., 2013, 2017). Available literature shows that these materials are characterised by low TS and elastic modulus (5.4–5.6 MPa and 65 to 7 MPa respectively) (Escamilla-García et al., 2013), which may pose a challenge in food applications. Similarly, investigations involving ZN/PVOH suggested that unmodified blends could not be handled for food applications (Lacroix et al., 2014; Senna et al., 2010). Blending is a promising technique for improvement of functional properties of protein-polysaccharide edible films. The main advantages of the technique are the utilisation of distinct functional properties of each component to improve the overall functionality of the final product (Senna et al., 2010). Additionally, plasticization of biomacromolecules is an established and acceptable approach to alter their physicochemical properties and functionality during application. PEG400 is a widely investigated plasticizer for various food and pharmaceutical applications. It is a water-soluble, non-toxic and biodegradable synthetic polymer known for its colloidal stability and plasticising effects (Tillekeratne & Easteal, 2000). To date, little is known concerning the functionality of ZN/CS/PVOH blends in composite film formulations or whether the use of plasticizers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 can mitigate incompatibility and general weaknesses of these materials for food applications (Escamilla-García et al., 2017; Senna et al., 2010). Initially, understanding the solvent properties of these combinations is essential since the solvent determines the unfolding and dispersion of macromolecular chains, whereas its removal accelerates molecular aggregation into ordered microphases (Wang & Padua, 2010). The phase behaviour properties of macromolecules during self-assembly are determined by the solution properties including ionic strength, pH and the proportions of various compounds (Gaona-Sánchez et al., 2015). Therefore, varying the type and strength of the solvent can influence the microstructure and functionality of the formed aggregates (Wang & Padua, 2010). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of blending using ZN:CS ratio, PVOH, PEG400 and the concentration of ethanol on mechanical and physicochemical properties of composite films. The optimisation approach used in this study enabled the understanding of the effects of individual factors on the physical characteristics of the films using scanning electron microscopy, which were then related to the tensile, water interaction and permeability properties. Changes due to cross-linking and inherent interactions were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn zein (ZN) (Z 3625, molecular weight (Mw) 22–24 kDa) and 98% (w/w) protein, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) (Mw 89,000–98,000 Da, 99+% hydrolysed) and polyethylene glycol (PEG400) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Chitosan (CS) (Mw 890 kDa, 91% degree of deacetylation (DD)) was obtained from Waseta Int'l trading company (Shanghai, China). Glacial acetic acid (Univar, USA) and ethanol (99.5%) (Anchor ethanol limited, Auckland, NZ) were of analytical grade. The biopolymer/biosynthetic polymers used in the study are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) (U.S. code of federal regulations) (USFDA, 2018) under the sections; ZN (part 184.1984), CS (GRN 443) (FDA, 2013), PVOH (part 177). All reagents and chemicals were used as received."
3,Experimental design and optimisation,"2.2 Experimental design and optimisation Film formulations were optimised to verify the synergistic influence of the variables using Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD). Four independent variables were fixed at three equidistant levels; ZN:CS ratio (X 1 ), (1:3, 1:1, 3:1), ethanol (X 2 ) (40, 60, 80% v/v), PVOH (X 3 ) (0, 25, 50% w/v), and PEG400 (X 4 ) (15, 30, 45% w/w of total solids). The number of experiments (N = 27) (Table 1 ) was determined by N=2k (k – 1) + C 0 (where k is the number of factors and C 0 is the number of central points) (Yetilmezsoy, Demirel, & Vanderbei, 2009). The response variables were taken as the average values of tensile strength (TS) (Y 1 ), (MPa), Young's modulus of elasticity (EM) (Y 2 ) (MPa), elongation at break (%EAB) (Y 3 ), water vapour permeability (WVP) (g.mm/h.m2. kPa) (Y 4 ), water contact angle (WCA) (Y 6 ) and solubility in water (Ws) (Y 5 ). Optical properties including; overall colour change (ΔE) (Y 7 ) and opacity (Op) (AU nm/mm) (Y 8 ) were also determined. Film preparation and response characterisation for each formulation type was independently repeated three times."
4,Preparation of film-forming solutions,"2.3 Preparation of film-forming solutions Stock solution of CS (1.5%) (w/v) in 2% (v/v) acetic acid was prepared by stirring at 22 °C and 400 rpm for 12 h. PVOH, 10% (w/v) in deionised (DI) water was stirred (400 rpm) for 2 h at 75 ± 3 °C. ZN solution 1.2% (w/v) in 80% (v/v) ethanol-water solution was prepared by stirring (400 rpm) for 1 h at 22 °C. The solutions were equilibrated at 4 o C for 6 h then centrifuged (Beckman J-1, Beckman, USA) at 10,000 × g and 4 o C for 15 min."
5,Film casting,"2.4 Film casting Film forming solutions (FFS) were prepared by mixing the stock solutions as shown in Table 1. This was followed by stirring for 20 min and homogenisation at 8000 rpm for 2 min (IKA® T 50 ULTRA-TURRAX®, Krackeler Scientific, NY, USA). Thereafter degassing was carried out for 2 min at 25±3 °C in degassing mode (37 kHz) using ultrasonic machine (Elmasonic S 30 H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). The pH of the FFS increased from ∼4.50 with increasing volume fraction ethanol to ∼5.40 in FFS containing 80% ethanol. Films were cast on 10 cm × 10 cm polystyrene Petri dishes using a constant rate (∼0.04 g/cm2 total solids) in order to minimise variations in film thickness. The drying conditions were kept constant at 20 ± 2 °C using forced draft (airflow rate v = 0.5 m/s). Dried films were conditioned at 22 ± 2 °C in a vacuum desiccator equilibrated using magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg (NO3)2·6H2O) (53 ± 3% RH) for a minimum of seven days. The films were weighed, and the average mass of each component was calculated and reported as a weight fraction (wi) (wt. % dry basis)."
6,Physicochemical properties of composite films,"2.5 Physicochemical properties of composite films 2.5.1 Determination of film thickness and moisture content The thickness (T) of the films was measured at six random locations after seven days of conditioning at 53 ± 3% RH. A hand-held digital micrometre (Thorlabs, NJ, USA) was used to the nearest 0.01 mm. The moisture content was determined gravimetrically by drying ∼0.5 g sample in an oven at 105 ± 2 °C for 24 h (AOAC, 2005). 2.5.2 Scanning electron microscopy The surface morphology of the composite films was determined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The samples were mounted on stabs in triplicate, gold-coated (2 min, 2 mbar) and the micrographs were observed at 10 kV in a vacuum of 9.75 × 10−5 Torr. 2.5.3 Determination of tensile properties Tensile properties were determined on the conditioned films using a universal testing machine TA-HD plus (Stable Micro Systems Ltd, Godalming, UK) following a standard method (ASTM D638-02a (V)) (ASTM, 2003). Briefly, films were cut into a dumbbell shape (overall length (L0) 63.5 mm, gage length l = 7.62 mm, the width of the narrow section W = 3.18 mm). The test conditions included; a load cell of 50 N, a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min, pre-test speed of 4.8 mm/min, the post-test speed of 8 mm/min, initial separation of the grips 25.4 mm and a target distance of 30 mm. The cross-sectional areas of the test samples were determined immediately prior to the test using the thickness (T) of individual samples obtained at five arbitrarily chosen positions. The tests were conducted at 22 ± 2 °C and 45 ± 3% RH. The maximum stress (tensile strength, TS) (MPa), Young's modulus of elasticity (EM) (MPa) from the stress-strain curves and film extensibility (elongation at break, %EAB) from the force-distance curves were determined using Eqs. (1)–(3) respectively. At least six film samples were tested for each treatment. (1) T S ( M P a ) = F m a x / A o (2) E A B ( % ) = [ Δ l / l 0 ] × 100 (3) E M = L O ( F 2 − F 1 ) A O ( δ 2 − δ 1 ) where, F m a x is the maximum load for breaking the film (N), A o is the initial specimen cross-sectional area (T × W mm2), Δl is the change in length from the original length (l o) of the specimen between the grips. The force (F 1 , F 2 ) and displacement ( δ 1 , δ 2 ) values were obtained from the linear portion of a plot of displacement against the force. 2.5.4 Determination of water vapour permeability The water vapour permeability (WVP) was determined following a standard method (ASTM E96/E96-10) (ASTM, 2013b). Circular discs, 40 mm in diameter, were cut from independently prepared films. The discs were fitted in the closures of Schott bottle (100 mL) containing a 33 mm diameter hole and held in place using an O-ring (25 mm) diameter. The thickness of each film was measured at four random locations during the analysis. The Schott bottle was filled with 90 mL of water, and the assembly was weighed at a precision of 0.001 g to obtain w 0. The assembly was then placed in a chamber containing silica gel (10–15% RH) at 25 °C. The chamber was fitted with a fan to provide strong driving force across the film for water vapour diffusion. The shiny side of the films was always exposed to the atmosphere at the lowest RH. The RH was maintained constant by replacing the silica gel, after every reading using freshly dried gel. Six readings were taken at an 8-h interval for 48 h and the weight difference was plotted in a scatter plot (R2 = 0.99). The water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was calculated from the slope of the weight loss vs time plot (Eq. (4)) and WVP was calculated according to Eq. (5). (4) W V T R ( g / h · m 2 ) = ( Δ w / Δ t ) / A (5) W V P ( g · m m / m 2 · h · k P a ) = Δ w · T / A · Δ P where Δw is the weight change from the straight line (g), Δt is the time during which Δw occurred (h), A is the test area (cup mouth area, m2). T is the film thickness (mm), ΔP is the differential water vapour partial pressure across the film [ Δ P = (P 0 (kPa) × (RH1-RH2)/100: P 0 is the saturation vapour pressure at the test temperature (P 0 of water at 25 °C = 3.159 kPa). RH1 is the relative humidity inside the bottle and RH2 is the relative humidity outside the bottle. An assumption was made that the relative humidity inside the bottle (RH1) was 100% (ASTM, 2013b). The relative humidity outside the bottle (RH2) was measured using a temperature and RH logger, iButton (Maxim Integrated, CA, USA). 2.5.5 Determination of water solubility The films solubility in water was determined as described by Yuan et al. (2016) using films that were equilibrated at 53% RH for seven days. The films were dried at 60 °C and 40% RH for 24 h, then samples of about 3 × 3 cm were weighed (W 0 ) into 50 mL centrifuge tubes then the tubes were filled with 35 mL of deionised water containing 0.02% sodium azide. The tubes were sealed and incubated with shaking at 25 ± 2 °C for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The final weight of the total insoluble solids (W 1) was obtained after drying the sediments at 60 °C until they attained a constant weight. The films solubility in water (Ws) was calculated according to Eq. (6). (6) W S = ( W 0 − W 1 / W 0 ) × 100 2.5.6 Contact angle measurement The surface hydrophobicity of the composite films was estimated using goniometer (OCA 15 AMP, Dataphysics instruments, Stuttgart, Germany) with the help of the sessile drop method, based on optical contact angle technique described by Ferreira, Nunes, Delgadillo, and Lopes-da-Silva (2009). In this method, a droplet of deionised water (∼2 μL) was deposited on the airside (upper side during casting) of the film using a precision syringe installed on the instrument. The image of the drop was recorded at the point of contact with the surface to obtain static contact angle data, which was processed and numerically fitted to La Place-Young equation. Triplicate measurements were conducted for each film. 2.5.7 Determination of film colour The colour of the composite films was determined with a Minolta colourimeter, MiniScan EZ 4500 L (HunterLab, Virginia, USA) using instrumental colour values L* (lightness), a*(redness), b* (yellowness). A standard white tile (L* = 92.86, a* = 1.91, b* = −14.98) was used to calibrate the instrument and as a background during the measurements. An average of nine measurements recorded for each film and used to calculate the total colour difference (ΔE) according to Eq. (7) (Gutiérrez & Álvarez, 2016). (7) Δ E = ( Δ L ∗ ) 2 + ( Δ a ∗ ) 2 + ( Δ b ∗ ) 2 where ΔL*, Δa* and Δb* are the differential colour values between the sample colour parameters and those of the standard white tile used as the film background. 2.5.8 Determination of light transmission properties Opacity (Op) of the composite films was determined on rectangular strips (20 mm × 4 mm) directly placed in a UV–Visible spectrophotometer test cell (Ultraspec 3300 Pro; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) as described by Pena-Serna and Lopes-Filho (2013). The absorbance of the films was obtained at 600 nm in a UV–Visible spectrophotometer using air as a reference material. The Op of the films was expressed as A600/x, where A600 is the absorbance at 600 nm, and x is the film thickness (expressed as Absorbance Units/millimetres (AU/mm). 2.5.9 Determination of phase transition properties of the composite films Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed according to a standard method D3418 (ASTM, 2013a) and as described by Shen and Kamdem (2015). Samples conditioning was carried out at 0% RH, 22 °C for seven days, then (∼5 mg) were weighed and sealed into a ten μL DSC Tzero standard pan, and the test was conducted using DSC Q100 (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE, USA). An empty pan was used as an inert reference, and the calibration was performed using the indium standard. The instrument was maintained at an isothermal temperature for 2 min before heating the samples at 5 °C/min using a temperature regime of 25–225 °C and nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min. The glass transition temperature (Tg), melting transition (TM) and enthalpy of melting (ΔH) were analysed using the Thermal Analysis Universal 2000 version 4.5A software (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE, USA). The melting (TM) temperatures (Tc) were taken as the peak of the endothermic and exothermic curves, during heating. DSC analysis was conducted in triplicate for the selected formulations. 2.5.10 Thermogravimetric analysis of the composite films Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using (TGA, Q500, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) to record the weight-loss data of the film with changes in temperature. Samples of about 10 mg were heated by ramping the temperature between 25 and 750 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min. Each test was analysed in duplicate from two independently prepared films of the selected formulation type. 2.5.11 Determination of crystal structure using X-ray crystallography The distribution of the crystal structure in the matrix of the composite film was determined using X-ray diffraction on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD PW3040/60 diffractometer (Malvern PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) in the range of 5° < 2θ < 35° diffraction angles. Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) irradiation was used at 40 kV and 30 mA. Data were collected on a continuous scan mode with a step size of 0.008° and 10.075 s per step. All data analysis and processing were conducted using the X'pert accompanying software program X'Pert HighScore v4.0."
7,Validation of regression models and film optimisation,"2.6 Validation of regression models and film optimisation 2.6.1 Validation of regression models The validity of the models was determined by conducting additional experiments using conditions selected within the range of the BBD parameters. Triplicate experiments were performed using five formulations to compare experimental results with the predicted values. 2.6.2 Film optimisation Simultaneous optimisation of the multiple responses was conducted using the desirability function of Minitab. Obtaining desirability values enables optimisation by resolving multiple responses into a single response (Yuan et al., 2016). The maximum, minimum, and average values of the response variables experimentally achieved in the BBD experimental design (Table 2 ) were applied for the calculation of composite desirability (C d ) function. C d is the weighted geometric average of the individual desirability (d i ) and ranges between d = 0, for an undesirable response, and d = 1, for an entirely desired response, above which further improvements would have no importance (Pena-Serna & Lopes-Filho, 2013). Five experimental conditions using four responses (TS, EM, EAB and Ws) having a C d of 0.82–0.94, were obtained and considered for the validation and optimisation. Optimisation of the formulations was conducted on the basis of attaining maximum TS, medium EM, adequate EAB, and minimal Ws (Ortega-Toro, Jimenez, Talens, & Chiralt, 2014; Yuan et al., 2016). Since the selected regions for the responses did not lie on the same optimisation slope, constraints were set by setting targets, minimum and maximum values, for all independent variables and responses. 2.6.3 Study on swollen state properties of optimised films To study the behaviour of the optimised composite films in a wet environment, the films were further characterised using the swelling behaviour following the method described by Gutiérrez & Álvarez. (2016). Films were cut into circular discs (10 mm diameter), then immersed in tubes containing 10 mL of either hydrochloric acid (HCl) (pH 2, 0.1 M), potassium phosphate/sodium hydroxide (K2HPO4/NaOH) buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1 M), or deionised water at 23 °C. Sodium azide (0.02% w/v) was added to the solutions to prevent microbial growth. The tubes were covered and left undisturbed at 23 °C for 24 h. Since the films rapidly disintegrated when dipped in HCl, the immersion period was reduced to a maximum of 2 min to allow the recording of differences between various formulations. The swelling behaviour (S w ) was determined according to Eq. (8). (8) S w ( % ) = ( D 2 − D 1 /D 1 ) × 100 where D 1 and D 2 are the diameters of the films before (ø = 20 mm) and after immersion in the standard solutions respectively. Swollen state mechanical properties of the optimum films in the dry and wet conditions were also determined. Prepared films were further conditioned at 25 °C and 30 ± 3% RH for 24 h in a forced convention laboratory incubator (IL-11A, Biotechnical Services, CA, USA). These conditions allowed some degree of crosslinking to occur, which reduced the level of film disintegration in the wet environment and allowed physical handling. Dumbbell-shaped filmstrips were then obtained and dipped into phosphate/sodium hydroxide (K2HPO4/NaOH) buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1 M), for 2 ± 0.25 h before the tensile tests."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Regression analysis was carried out to test the significance of the regression relationship between the responses (Y i ) and the independent variables. Experimental data from each response was fitted to a second-degree polynomial model using backwards stepwise elimination (Chen et al., 2016) in Minitab (Version 17) (PA, USA). A non-linear quadratic model obtained from the design was in the form shown in Eq. (9). (9) Y i = β 0 + β i ∑ X i + β i i ∑ X i 2 ( i ≠ j ) + β i j ∑ X i X j + ε where Y i is the predicted response value; β 0 , βi, β ij and β ii are the regression coefficients of the model for the intercept, linear, quadratic and interaction coefficients respectively; Xi and X j are the independent variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine the significance of the models and the fit for the polynomial equations using F test and probability (p-values) (Chmiel, Kupska, Wardencki, & Namieśnik, 2017). The coefficient of multiple determination R 2 (squares of error/total sum of squares (SSR/SST) was used to describe the proportion of the variation in Y i explained by the independent variables X 1 to X 4 in the regression models. The presence of significant differences between the predicted and the experimental values was statistically determined using non–parametric Mann–Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank) (Yetilmezsoy et al., 2009) in SPSS (version 21, USA)."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Preparation of film-forming dispersions,"3.1 Preparation of film-forming dispersions The physical characteristics of the blends after 24 h storage at room temperature (22 °C) are summarised in Table 1. The findings show the presence of both segregated (repulsive interactions) and associated (attractive interactions) phenomena across the blends (Fischer, 2013). ZN may have settled in the form of yellow complex upon the reduction of ethanol content (40%) (Wang & Padua, 2010), whereas PVOH, CS and PEG400 phase separated as white lumps or gelling complexes at high ethanol (80%) content. Meanwhile, despite the signs of separation attributable to chitosan, PVOH and PEG400, the use of 60% ethanol resulted in predominantly yellowish solution phase. This was a possible indication of proper dispersion and solubilisation of ZN in the complexes (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001). Indeed, stable and uniform solution matrix were observed in complexes containing 60% ethanol and low content of the molecules of the more hydrophilic compound such as PVOH. The thickness of the composite films ranged from 0.04 ± 0.008 mm (Table 2) and significantly increased with an increase in the chitosan levels in the film forming solutions. However, increasing the levels of PVOH resulted in thinner films, which can be attributed to the development of a compact and crystalline film microstructure at the high PVOH content (Senna et al., 2010)."
11,Characterisation of the composite films,"3.2 Characterisation of the composite films 3.2.1 The effect of blending on films morphology and mechanical properties All blend formulations enabled preparation of continuous freestanding composite films that did not present any apparent defects. The surface morphology of the films was observed using FE-SEM as shown in Fig. 1 a. Incorporating PVOH or the combined effect of PVOH-PEG400 resulted in a smooth morphology, but the surface acquired groves and pinholes whose characteristics varied with the blend composition (Fig. 1a). For instance, the density of the pinholes and depth of the groves increased at low CS and PVOH or high ZN and PEG400. The compact structure observed at the high levels of PVOH (50% w/w of total solids) (Film 11) and low ZN or CS levels were related to the films exhibiting higher flexibility and low WVP. However, increasing weight fraction (wi) PEG400 at the low or total absence of PVOH resulted in more roughness, groves, and amorphous structure, bearing major morphological defects and poor mechanical properties (Film 19). Notably, the defects were evident at the extremes of low CS or high ZN contents. Moderate levels of ZN and CS seemed to interact in the absence of PVOH (Film 16) to acquire a compact and less defective structure, which showed high TS but low %EAB. The findings on the morphology of the films revealed the inner relationship between the microstructure, physicochemical and mechanical properties of the films. Mechanical properties depict the effect of various components on inter-/intra-molecular interactions and molecular chain mobility of the film matrix. The findings on mechanical properties were described using TS, EM and %EAB (Table 2). The data showed the existence of two major categories of stress-strain curves (Fig. 1b). One category was depicted by high brittleness as shown by linear stress-strain curves until the point of fracture, and the second category showed various degrees of toughness as evidenced by a yield point followed by an extensive elongation at approximately constant stress levels (Senna et al., 2010). Second order polynomial surface equations for predicting TS, EM and %EAB (Y 1 , Y 2 , and Y3 respectively) were constituted as shown in Eqs. (10)–(12). The linear-terms of all the independent variables were significant (p < 0.05) and the overall fit (R 2) accounted for ca. 93.90, 97.35 and 98.26% of the variation in TS, EM and %EAB respectively (Table 2). The prediction models pointed to a decrease in the magnitude of TS and EM with increasing levels of individual compounds. The findings further pointed to the reliance on the interaction between various factors (ZN:CS/PVOH and ZN:CS/PEG400) for improvements in mechanical properties. (10) Y 1 = 89.56 − 56.34 X 1 − 0.121 X 2 − 0.571 X 3 − 1.725 X 4 + 0.005 X 3 2 + 0.015 X 4 2 + 0.711 X 1 X 3 + 0.384 X 1 X 4 (11) Y 2 = 1485.2 − 291 X 1 − 3.614 X 2 − 17.14 X 3 − 33.06 X 4 − 307.2 X 2 1 − 0.0261 X 3 2 + 0.284 X 4 2 + 7.92 X 1 X 3 + 0.085 X 2 X 3 + 0.174 X 3 X 4 (12) Y 3 = − 36.2 − 407.2 X 1 + 4.875 X 2 + 2.075 X 3 + 2.049 X 4 + 174.3 X 2 1 − 0.020 X 2 2 + 0.041 X 2 3 − 0.032 X 2 4 − 1.148 X 1 X 2 + 6.037 X 1 X 3 + 5.248 X 1 X 4 − 0.077 X 2 X 3 − 0.025 X 2 X 4 Fig. 2 shows that increasing weight fraction zein (wi ZN) (X 1 ) at low levels of other compounds resulted in a brittle film matrix, thus lower TS. However, this effect was minimised by reducing ZN or increasing the levels of the other blend components (Fig. 2a). At low wi ZN and high weight fraction chitosan (wi CS), the films acquired high crystallinity due to the contribution from the rigid CS molecules and the interaction with ZN, thus high TS and EM (Srinivasa et al., 2003). In the same manner, PVOH (X 3 ) molecules and the interaction between the polar regions of zein, PVOH and CS could have resulted in the formation of crystalline phases (Senna et al., 2010), thus the increasing TS at high PVOH and CS. Such interactions increased polymer-polymer chain bonding forming a more compact film structure (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). On the contrary, TS and EM decreased due to PEG400 (X 4 ) as shown in Fig. 2(a and b). This may be related to the high levels of hydrophilic moieties in the backbone of PEG400 molecular chains (Han & Aristippos, 2005, pp. 239–262), which attracted water molecules to form hydrodynamic macromolecule-water complexes leading to the plasticization of the film. Plasticization of films increases their flexibility due to internal lubrication that weakens polymer-polymer interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, electrostatic or ionic interactions) (Han & Aristippos, 2005, pp. 239–262). The mean values for the %EAB are also summarised in Table 2. The findings revealed the effect of blends formulations on %EAB, where increasing levels of both PVOH and PEG400 resulted in higher flexibility (Fig. 2c). As expected, decreasing levels of plasticizers resulted in lower %EAB, in particular when high wi ZN was included in the formulations. The lack of films flexibility at high wi ZN (low wi CS ) may be related to the brittleness due to the enhancement of intramolecular hydrophobic interactions among asymmetric rods that make up the ZN meshwork structure (Arcan & Yemenicioğlu, 2013). High levels of ZN established stronger intramolecular hydrophobic interactions while reducing intermolecular covalent cross-linking and molecular chain mobility, thus forming a compact but brittle film structure (Masamba et al., 2016; Suyatma et al., 2005). Regarding the contribution of ethanol (X 2 ) to the overall mechanical properties, higher levels of the solvent led to lower TS and EM (Eqs. (10) and (11)). As a major solvent for zein (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001), ethanol was incorporated in the blends to allow the dispersion and unfolding of the protein and increase its interaction with other macromolecules. As expected, various levels of ethanol influenced the ionic environment, solubility and aggregation behaviour of ZN molecules, hence affecting the morphologies of ZN microphases (Wang & Padua, 2010). A high concentration of ethanol (∼80%) increased the hydrophobicity of the environment in the film forming dispersions (Wang & Padua, 2010), which was depicted as cloudiness at wi ZN > 0.40. The precipitate was attributable to the separation of macromolecules relying on hydrophilic interactions such as PVOH and CS (Bercea et al., 2016). At low ethanol concentration (≈0.40 wt%), a more hydrophilic environment and modification of the hydrophilic-hydrophobic character of the solution ensued (Zhang et al., 2007), thus influencing aggregation of ZN molecules (Wang & Padua, 2010). Thereafter, gelation of these compounds occurred as depicted by the formation of lumps in the film forming dispersions and later occurrence of groves in the films depicting low TS and EM (Fig. 1b). An increase in %EAB at approximately 60% ethanol (Fig. 2c) could be related to the improvement in the solubility characteristics of ZN (Wang & Padua, 2010). Adequate solubilisation of ZN created more inter-/intra-molecular interactions between similar ZN-chains or with other compounds (Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Masamba et al., 2016) resulting in homogenous and less brittle film matrices Fig. 1a (Film 16). These findings indicate that the solvent concentration, biopolymer ratio, and plasticization interacted to influence the mechanical properties of the films. 3.2.2 Effect of blending on water vapour permeability Water vapour permeability (WVP) is the diffusion of water molecules against the exposed film area, thickness and vapour pressure driving force. The WVP of biodegradable films is regulated by the relative humidity (RH), plasticizer type and amount, the chemical structure, molecular mass and degree of cross-linking of macromolecules. The thickness of the film influences the partial pressure on the high humidity side of the film, thus impacting on the diffusion of water molecules across the films (Masamba et al., 2016). This influence was minimised by controlling the thickness at approximately 0.04 ± 0.008 mm. The second-order polynomial regression model predicting WVP (Y 4 ) was developed as shown in Eq. (13). The model significantly (p < 0.05) explained 94.23% (R 2 ) of the variation in WVP. (13) Y 4 = 0.059–0.223X 1 + 0.003X 2 – 0.008X 3 + 0.018X 4 + 0.556X 1 2 – 2.200 × 10−4 X 4 2 – 0.008X 1 X 2 + 1.04 × 10−4 X 2 X 3 High wi ZN at any combination of the independent factors resulted in lower WVP (Fig. 2d). Due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of ZN microstructures (Wang & Padua, 2010), the wetting of the films’ surface on the high humidity side was minimised at the high wi ZN, thus decreasing the rate of water vapour transmission (Table 2). Also at ca 60–80% ethanol (at high wi ZN), a favourable hydrophilic-hydrophobic environment was established allowing adequate dispersion of ZN and the interaction between various compounds (Wang & Padua, 2010). This resulted in the formation of a compact film structure with low WVP. An increase in PVOH (Eq. (13)) can reduce the WVP, which is related to the increase in the crystalline regions in the film. Crystallinity originates from the PVOH molecules or its interaction with molecular chains of other macromolecules (Argüello-García et al., 2014). Higher WVP permeability rates were observed at high levels of PEG400 (Fig. 2d), perhaps due to its contribution to the hydrophilic nature and reduced crystallinity of the film (Han & Aristippos, 2005, pp. 239–262). The WVP values of the composite films obtained in the current study ranged from 0.14 to 0.45 g mm/m2·h·kPa. These values agreed with the earlier observed range 0.44–1.16 g mm/m2·h·kPa for ZN-oleic acid films and transglutaminase treated ZN-oleic acid composite films respectively (Masamba et al., 2016). Another study by Lacroix et al. (2014) had earlier reported a range of 0.18–0.24 g mm/m2·h·kPa for unmodified zein poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) films. The findings from the current study showed that low WVP could be attained at low weight fraction PEG400 (wi PEG400) irrespective of the combination with other blend components. 3.2.3 Moisture content, solubility in water and surface hydrophobicity Determination of the moisture content (MC) provides critical information on the stability of the composite films under varying relative humidity environments. It also relates to the ability of the films to maintain the moisture of the foods. Fig. 4a shows the relationship between the moisture content, mechanical properties and blend formulations. A high correlation (R2 89.13, p < 0.05) existed between the blend components and the final MC of the composite films The obtained values of MC (5–26%) were within the range observed for plasticised biodegradable films (Suyatma et al., 2005). The findings by Suyatma et al. (2005) reported an MC of 14.4–24.3% from chitosan-based films. It was apparent that increasing ZN, PEG400 and PVOH components resulted in lower moisture content in the films. The decline in MC at high wi ZN may be related to the higher amount of hydrophobic portions from the protein, which reduced the film matrix-water interactions (Hopkins, Chang, Lam, & Nickerson, 2015). However, such protein-plasticizer combination resulted in higher plasticization effect (Liu, Adhikari, Guo, & Adhikari, 2013) giving lower TS. On the contrary, higher levels of MC resulted in higher TS (Fig. 4a), which was contrary to the expected decrease in the magnitude of TS on plasticization with water (Braga & Cunha, 2004). Additionally, increasing the levels of PVOH and ZN (Fig. 4b) resulted in lower MC and higher %EAB. These findings reveal possible crosslinking provided by zein and other compounds in the blends. In addition, there was an evident contribution of the small amounts of plasticizer in the internal lubrication of the film matrix, to minimise the brittleness (Arcan & Yemenicioğlu, 2013). The solubility of composite films in water is an important factor determining the rate of breakdown during consumption and biodegradation (Laohakunjit & Noomhorm, 2004). Water solubility (Ws) values (Table 2) represent the water-resistance capacity, where high values indicate low water-resistance. The polynomial model for predicting Ws (Y 5 ) (Eq. (14)) was highly significant (p < 0.0001) and explained ∼ 93.63% (R2) of the variation in the observations. (14) Y 5 = 125.600–93.9X 1 – 1.205X 2 – 0.532X 3 – 1.940X 4 + 42.1X 1 2 + 0.004X 2 2 + 0.002X 3 2 + 0.023X 4 2 + 0.550X 1 X 2 + 1.132X 1 X 3 + 0.010X 2 X 4 + 0.008X 3 X 4 Ws of the composite films decreased due to the linear terms of individual compounds but showed enhancement due to the interactions and quadratic effects of various compounds. Considering the interactions between the blend components, the surface diagram (Fig. 3 a) indicated that increasing wi ZN at low (40%) or high (80%) ethanol led to high Ws. At low ethanol content, there was a decrease in polymer-polymer network formation from ZN due to the interruptions by the predominantly reactive hydrophilic moieties (hydroxyl (OH−) or amine (NH3+) groups) associated with ethanol, CS, PVOH and PEG400 (Yuan et al., 2016). ZN aggregation and precipitation led to the development of poor film matrix allowing rapid hydration and disintegration. Low solubility films (24%) were obtained at ca 60% ethanol, perhaps due to the resulting high interaction density between adequately dispersed molecules of ZN with other compounds in the blend. The low solubility was further enhanced at high wi ZN (0.58%), which was attributable to the high hydrophobic properties of ZN (Pena-Serna & Lopes Filho, 2015). Even though a highly soluble film is beneficial for cooking and consumption of coated foods, moist foods or those requiring storage in a moist environment may require a low solubility (Laohakunjit & Noomhorm, 2004). Therefore, specific solubility attributes may be positive or negative, depending on the intended use of the edible packaging. The findings on the moisture content, water solubility and water vapour permeability of the composite films were further elucidated by assessing the wetting properties of the surface of the films. Data on water contact angle (WCA) (Table 2) was used to evaluate the resistance of the film against water and determining the hydrophobic properties of the film surface. Generally, pure zein films are wetting materials with WCA-values of 60° to 75° and plasticizers can impart more hydrophilicity as observed in zein-glycerol films (WCA = 52°) (Muthuselvi & Dhathathreyan, 2006). On the other hand, chitosan films are more hydrophobic, WCA of 100° ± 5° (Silva et al., 2007). The polynomial model predicting the WCA (Y 6 ) (Eq. (15)) showed a decrease in the surface hydrophobicity with the increase in ZN component of the ZN:CS ratio. Previous studies on composite films involving chitosan in combination with proteins, for example, chitosan-whey (Ferreira et al., 2009), chitosan-gelatin (Chen, Wang, Mao, Liao, & Hsieh, 2008) and chitosan-soy (Silva et al., 2007) have reported a decrease in WCA with increasing protein content. (15) Y 6 = 105.91–106.7X 1 + 0.034X 2 + 0.56X 3 + 0.12X 4 – 0.005X 2 2 + 1.22X 1 X 2 – 0.027X 3 X 4 The model parameters showed that the interaction terms of ethanol (X 2 2 ) and PVOH/PEG400 (X 3 X 4 ) resulted in lower WCA. The data also revealed a decrease in WCA on increasing the content of ZN in the composite films. Even though ZN molecules possesses higher proportions of non-polar amino acid residues, the results showed its tendency to increase the hydrophilicity of the films. This behaviour has previously been attributed to the reorientation of the polar chemical components of the protein towards the hydrophilic (water) interface in solution and during the self-assembly process (Muthuselvi & Dhathathreyan, 2006). Fig. 4c shows that the interaction of the compounds at low plasticization and lower levels of ZN gave higher values of WCA and generally resulted in lower WVP. These findings show that increasing hydrophobicity generally reduced the wetting ability and therefore the diffusion rates of water vapour across the films (Han & Aristippos, 2005, pp. 239–262). As opposed to PEG400, lower levels of PVOH also resulted in high WVP, which corroborates the positive contribution of PVOH to WCA according to Eq. (15). Cast PVOH films were earlier reported to exhibit high WCA, which may have reduced the wetting ability of the films (Zuo et al., 2013). According to Zuo et al. (2013), the surface of PVOH films exhibits high hydrophobicity, with a WCA of up to 84% after treatment in ethanol (deuterated ethanol, 99%). 3.2.4 Colour and light transmittance of the composite films The colour and transparency of composite films can be used to determine their acceptability to the consumer (Gaona-Sánchez et al., 2015). Visual examination of the films revealed that they were translucent and high proportions of ZN resulted in more yellowness. The overall change in colour attributes (ΔE) (Y 7 ) was summarised in Table 2 and the prediction model in Eq. (16) (p < 0.05, R2 98.99%) (16) Y 7 = –1.700 + 40.000X 1 + 0.101X 2 – 0.058X 3 + 0.1608X 4 – 10.11X 1 2 – 0.320X 1 X 3 – 0.233X 1 X 4 – 0.003 X 2 X 4 ΔE-values ranged from 3.97 to 22.83 across the blends and was significantly influenced by the linear (X 1 , X 3 , X 4 ), quadratic (X 1 2 ) and the interaction–terms (X 1 X 3 , X 1 X 4 and X 2 X 4 ) of the independent variables. ΔE values increased with the increase in wi ZN and wi PEG400 and decreased with the increase in weight fraction PVOH (wi PVOH) ethanol content did not significantly (p > 0.05) modifying the overall colour change of the films. The response surface diagrams (Fig. 3b) were superimposable with those of b*-values (yellowness) (results not shown), implying that most of the observed changes in colour could be explained by the change in the factors influencing the yellowness of the composite films. The increase in the total colour difference due to the increase in wi ZN can be attributed to the natural colour and impurities (carotenoids, xanthophylls, and other colour pigments) of commercial ZN (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001; Zhang & Zhao, 2017). Opacity (Op) is an indicator of the light barrier property of a film, which describes the capacity of a film to shield a product against deterioration due to light. The effect of blending on opacity was summarised in Table 2, where low Op values depict higher transparency (Srinivasa et al., 2003). The polynomial model predicting the Op (Y 8 ) (Eq. (17)) showed that opacity increased with increasing wi ZN, whereas transparency increased with the increase in the concentration of ethanol. (17) Y 8 = 26.13 + 30.29X 1 – 0.677X 2 – 0.548X 3 + 0.292X 4 – 26.700X 1 2 + 0.007X 2 2 + 0.005X 3 2 + 0.145X 1 X 3 – 0.007X 2 X 4 + 0.002X 3 X 4 The response surface plots indicated that low Op values were obtainable at ca 60% ethanol (Fig. 3c). Ethanol concentration (60%) prevented phase separation of ZN (Wang & Padua, 2010) and increased intramolecular interactions between ZN molecules and intermolecular associations with other constituents. These interactions resulted in a continuous sheet of film network that increased the transmission of light (Pena-Serna & Lopes Filho, 2015). On the contrary, opacity was high at 80% ethanol suggesting that increasing non-polar environment in the solution (Zhang et al., 2007) resulted in possible separation and precipitation of hydrophilic compounds in the blend. This was also possible at low ethanol content (40%), where ZN molecules separated from other components in the blend. Both situations resulted in a dense film matrix doped with aggregated compounds, resembling a heterogeneous structure that provided a high barrier to light transmission (Pena-Serna & Lopes-Filho, 2013). Generally, ZN has been reported to bestow opacity and yellowness on the films (Zhang & Zhao, 2017), while its interaction with the solvent and other macromolecules causes the variation between the formulations (Pena-Serna & Lopes Filho, 2015). Apart from ethanol, PVOH was the next greatest contributor to the high transparency of the composite films (Fig. 3c). The interactions between PVOH and PEG400 or ZN may increase the opacity due to the compaction of the polymeric chain and increased crystallinity, leading to the modification of the refractive index and interference with the transmission of light (Ortega-Toro et al., 2014). Besides the inter-/intra-molecular interactions involving PVOH, the reduction in the opacity of the films containing low ZN content may be due to the simple dilution effect of PVOH (Vanin, Sobral, Menegalli, Carvalho, & Habitante, 2005). The findings of the current study showed that there were no completely opaque films. The lowest opacity (high transparency) values (2.28 AU/mm) were observed at the lowest wi ZN (0.07) and the highest wi PVOH. The range of opacity values obtained (2.28–19.32 AU/mm) were in good agreement with the Op of ZN–oleic acid–xanthan gum (8.49 AU/mm) and ZN–oleic acid (5.19 AU/mm) films reported by Pena-Serna & Lopes Filho. (2015)."
12,The effect of independent variables on thermal properties,"3.3 The effect of independent variables on thermal properties Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted to characterise the thermal characteristics of the composite films in relation to their microstructure. The method was also useful in examining the miscibility and compatibility of macromolecules (Sun et al., 2007). Typical DSC thermograms of films prepared from pure ingredients and a selected combination of independent factors are shown in Fig. 5 a. Regarding the films prepared from pure ingredients, the endothermic peak of CS at 154.86 °C was in the range of documented values (Sun et al., 2007). Pure ZN (uncentrifuged), gave an endothermic peak at 163.69 °C, whereas centrifuged ZN showed a peak at (178.22 °C), which were similar to the documented values 165 °C (Shukla & Cheryan, 2001) and 170–180 °C (Senna et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2017) respectively. The high endothermic peak depicted by centrifuged ZN, imply that centrifugation (10,000 × g at 5 °C) improved the purity of ZN (Sun et al., 2017b). Generally, ZN films had higher melting temperatures (TM) compared to other ingredients, which suggested the existence of a compact molecular structure arising from the assembly of small spherical particles that required a higher temperature to destroy (Wang & Padua, 2010). Compared to the melting of pure ingredients, endothermic peaks of the blends were shifted towards the higher temperatures (Table 3 ). The higher temperature requirements by the composite films demonstrated the need for more activation energy to destroy the developed compact structures of the films (Senna et al., 2010). Low ethanol content (40% v/v), high wi PVOH/wi PEG400 or low wi ZN generated shallow curves displaying indistinct endothermic peaks (Fig. 5a). The broader endothermic peaks in these formulations suggested the existence of a more hydrophilic environment in the FFS due to the low ethanol, high wi PEG400 and wi PVOH in the blend. The interaction between the film components in a hydrophilic environment possibly resulted in the formation of interstices during complexing and subsequent development of amorphous structures (Sun et al., 2007). Consequently, strong inter -/intra-molecular hydrogen (H-H) linkages and rigid molecular chain backbone were formed, but these degraded before reaching the melting point, thus undefined melting peaks (Sun et al., 2007). With regard to PEG400, reduced enthalpy (ΔH) values suggested the weakening of intermolecular interactions (e.g. CS-ZN or CS-PVOH) and perhaps increasing the mobility of the macromolecules in the amorphous regions, thus weakening the film microstructure (Sun et al., 2007). Nevertheless, at low PEG400 and in the absence of PVOH the melting peaks shifted towards higher temperatures. In addition, low levels of PVOH or its absence led to a decrease in the amorphous state of the films resulting in the formation of denser matrices and distinct degradation patterns (Senna et al., 2010). DSC traces of the composite films with low or no PVOH depicted the melting of a homogenous/pure substance, suggesting proper complexation or miscibility of the ingredients (Sun et al., 2007). Increasing wi ZN and weight fraction CS (wi CS) ≥ 0.31 resulted in higher melting temperatures without necessarily increasing ΔH values. This increase in the TM is attributable to the strong intermolecular interaction through electrostatic complexation of ZN and CS (Park, Park, & Kim, 2015; Yu et al., 2017). High ethanol content induced possible precipitation of polar hydrophilic macromolecules resulting in poor miscibility as reflected in the multiple melting peaks on the DSC curve. The shifting of melting temperatures and the variations between formulation types collaborated the changes in TS, EM, %EAB (Table 2) and changes in the XRD patterns (Fig. 6 )."
13,Thermogravimetric analysis of the composite films,"3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis of the composite films Thermal stability of the composite films was characterised using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. 5b and c. Thermal decomposition of the films occurred in two distinct phases; the first phase occurred at ca.100 °C and the second between 260 and 440 °C (Fig. 5b). The initial weight loss at 100 °C may be attributed to the removal of water and decomposition of PEG400 (Nakano et al., 2007). As far as the blend composition is concerned, the absence of PVOH in the blends increased the thermal instability (Fig. 5c). The total mass loss (%) shown in Table 4 decreased with decreasing wi PVOH, which was also related to the increase in the wi ZN and wi CS (Table 1). This observation suggested the development of thermostable film matrices due to the formation of dense film network between ZN, CS and PEG400 and limited polymer chain mobility due to lack of interferences from PVOH (Nakano et al., 2007). Notably, formulation eight had the highest wi CS in the design, which led to an early onset of degradation. However, the solid network of the film due to ZN-PEG400 interactions reduced the overall degradation. These findings concur with the high TS, EM, and low %EAB and Ws observed for the formulations (Table 2). The findings from this study suggest that ZN films modified using CS and PEG400 have more thermo-stability compared to PVOH modified films. 3.4.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Changes to the crystalline structure of the composite films were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of films from pure compounds and selected formulations are shown in Fig. 6. It was seen that zein did not display apparent diffraction peaks but two broad regions were observed at 2θ = 8.8° and 20.5° depicting the amorphous nature of the protein (Sun et al., 2017a). Pure chitosan, a partially crystalline polysaccharide, showed two diffractions peaks at 2θ = 11.6° and 18.9°, which are attributable to its regular chain. PVOH showed a diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.6°. A comparison between XRD patterns of different blends indicates possible crosslinking and alteration of the peak position or replacement with an amorphous region. For instance, Film 16 (Fig. 6) shows that the interaction of various compounds (without PVOH) resulted in more crystallinity of the blend, which was exhibited as enhancement of the peaks 11.6° and 18.3°. These findings suggest the positive contribution of CS to the overall crystallinity, mechanical and thermal properties of the films. Likewise, the incorporation of PVOH enhanced the films crystallinity (Film 11, 12 and 21), but the chitosan peak in these films (2θ = 11.6°) changed to a broad amorphous region (Film 12, 19 and 21), whereas the peak at 18.9° was shifted to the right. In addition, these interactions minimised the influence of the zein amorphous structure as shown by the non-existent peak regions of unblended zein. The changes are attributable to the intermolecular interactions of the polar zein moieties and hydroxyl residues of CS and PVOH forming intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Senna et al., 2010). The crystallinity data from XRD validates the changes observed in the physicochemical, mechanical and barrier properties of the composite films."
14,The validity of regression models and optimal film formation,"3.5 The validity of regression models and optimal film formation Experimental responses of the predicted values indicated the suitability of the methodology developed for the optimisation of the composite films, and validity of the surface responses obtained by the Box–Behnken experimental design as shown in Table 5 a. The agreement between the experimental data and the predicted values confirmed the predictive ability of the RSM model according to the optimised conditions. The physicochemical properties of the optimised formulations investigated in both dry and swollen states were summarised in Table 5(a, b). Increasing wi CS or reducing wi PVOH caused a rapid increase in the films swelling index in water (Sw) irrespective of wi ZN (Fig. 7 ). The high swelling index at high wi CS or in the absence PVOH is attributable to the increase in the molecular relaxation of the composite film due to a possible reduction in crystalline regions (Ortega-Toro et al., 2014). It was interesting to note that the swelling index in deionised water (pH 7) and hydrochloric acid (0.1 M, pH 2) was 6–45 times higher than in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5) (swelling index in buffer (Sb), 2.9–5.83%). This was attributable to the responses of the compounds to the negatively charged ions (PO4 3− and −OH) at high pH (Sağlam, Venema, de Vries, & van der Linden, 2013). The buffer (pH 7.5) was above the isoelectric point (pI) of ZN and CS (≈pH 6.2) (Bharmoria, Singh, & Kumar, 2013; Sun et al., 2017a), which reduced the degree of ionisation and led to acquisition of negatively charged ions on molecular surfaces (Sağlam et al., 2013). The reduced degree of ionisation or high net negative charge increased the tendency of self-aggregation through inter-/intra-molecular hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions, resulting in the development of a more compact film structure (Wang, Jiang, Duan, & Shao, 2013), therefore less swelling (Fig. 7A and B). In earlier studies, Wang et al. (2013) observed a decrease in the swelling index of gelatin films at pH above 8.0. The data showed that the swelling behaviour of some formulations in acid (Sa) could not be determined due to their rapid disintegration. Soaking the films in HCl (high H+) favoured molecular relaxation and disentanglements leading to the breakdown of film networks, thus rapid swelling and dissolution of the film (Masamba et al., 2016). The TS, EM and EAB at the dried state increased with increasing CS (Table 5a) but TS and EM decreased by 30–70% and 95% respectively in the swollen state. However, the swollen state elongation at break in the buffer (%EABb) remained constant or increased by ca 60% (Table 5 b). Films containing high wi CS (wi ZN/wi CS 0.25/0.52) showed the highest swelling (Sb) 6.6% but still resulted in the highest swollen state tensile strength (TSb) and elongation (%EABb), 24.56 MPa and 144.51% respectively. These findings are likely due to the absence of PVOH in the blend, since in the absence of PVOH molecules, the films acquired less hydrophilic surface in the buffer, perhaps easing the polar tension on the surface of ZN, CS and their cross-linked structures (Park et al., 2015). As a consequence, the interactions between ZN and CS through electrostatic linkages became stronger, enabling the formation of a denser film network (Fig. 7b) (Park et al., 2015). With regards to the soaking of the composite films in the buffer at pH near the pI of ZN and CS, the possible burying of the hydrophobic regions occurred, which minimised water-macromolecule/ions interactions (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). Accordingly, the relaxation and weakening of the film was minimised, which preserved its integrity thus a high TS and %EAB, which contrasted dipping in water and HCl (results not shown). In addition, the high CS content imparted greater chain mobility and high elongation in the swollen state and subsequently reducing EM (11.01 MPa). Optimum films (Fig. 7b) were obtained under the weight fractions ZN/CS/PVOH, 0.35/0.29/0.13 (0.23 wi PEG400 and 60% ethanol). The dry state mechanical properties (TS, EM, EAB) were 24.21 MPa, 356.62 MPa, 84.23% respectively. The swollen state mechanical properties of the optimal formulation in buffer TSb, EMb, EABb, Sb and Ws were 18.61 MPa, 14.84 MPa, 127.74%, 2.43% and 33.71% respectively."
15,Conclusions,"Blending and solvent properties had a statistically significant effect on physicochemical and mechanical properties of the composite films. Based on the SEM micrographs of the freestanding films, high levels of ZN and PEG400 resulted in roughness with major film defects, but these were minimised at high levels of CS or PVOH. In addition, XRD analysis indicated potential cross-linking interactions through hydrogen bonding between the polar groups of ZN and hydroxyl moieties of PVOH and CS. These findings were in agreement with the data from stress-strain curves, WVP, Ws and WCA. Increasing polar residues in the film forming solution at low ethanol content or increasing non-polar environment at high ethanol content showed adverse effects on the responses. This study demonstrated the influence of critical interactions between solvent features (polarity) and interfacial properties of ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG400. The observed crosslinking behaviour suggested the effectiveness of blending technique in improving the compatibility of biopolymers and overall functionality of edible films."
