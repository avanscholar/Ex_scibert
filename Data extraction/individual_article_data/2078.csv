0,Introduction,"Utilization of biomass to produce transportation fuels and chemicals is considered a sustainable, renewable and a more environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. This has led to intensified research over the last decade on developing technologies and processes to unlock the full potential of biomass. The strategies that have been developed often require the use of hydrogen and effective heterogeneous catalysts to remove problematic oxygenates while mitigating excessive consumption of expensive hydrogen. Despite the significant strides, the production of liquid fuels from biomass continues to be a formidable challenge, and as a consequence several research groups have argued for more concerted efforts toward the production of value-added chemicals in order to improve the economic viability of the lignocellulose-derived biorefinery [1]. The different structures and chemical properties of lignocellulosic biomass indicate that a wide variety of chemicals can be obtained after transformation into simpler fractions. In particular, the chemical dehydration of biomass-derived sugars to produce furfural and hydroxymethylfuran (HMF) is regarded as critical chemical intermediates to form a variety of useful products [1–4]. Direct transformation of furfural to compounds such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furan, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), among others, has been the focus of intense research due to its industrial relevance. For example, FOL is used in the manufacture of lysine, lubricants and plasticizers, while 2-MF is used as an important intermediate in the fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and perfume industries [2-4]. 2-MTHF is also useful as an oxygenate additive in fuels and maybe useful for the production of polymer fibers [2]. The conversion of furfural proceeds via different pathways, including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation, ring opening, and aldol-condensation reactions, depending on the type of catalyst or reaction conditions. It typically proceeds on heterogeneous catalysts and has been studied in both liquid and vapor phase. An overview of the performance of some of the heterogeneous catalysts used for this reaction and their selectivity towards 2-MF is presented in Table S1 (supplementary material). These include monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, transition metal carbide catalysts, and amorphous catalysts, among others [2,5–22]. Although furfuryl alcohol is a valuable chemical product, production of 2-MF is highly desirable because it has been found to be a promising oxygenated fuel additive with a high octane number (RON = 131) and low water solubility [13,23]. According to literature studies, 2-MF is produced by either hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol or selective hydrodeoxygenation of furfural. As shown in Table S1, the selectivity towards 2-MF is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, the type of reactor, and the nature of catalyst used. The reported 2-MF has generally been low, with Cu-based catalysts as notable exceptions [15–17]. This is probably due to the oxophilic character of Cu which preferentially interacts with carbonyl group to facilitates cleavage of CO bond of furfural [6,12]. This demonstrates the potential of oxophilic elements in the conversion of furfural. Rhenium is an oxophilic element whose catalytic activity in HDO reactions has recently been investigated by Escalona et al. [24–30]. Re-based phases, including ReS2, metallic Re and ReOx dispersed on a variety of supports have exhibited moderate to high activity in the HDO of phenolic compounds (guaiacol, anisole, phenol, o-cresol). In particular, ReOx catalysts were found to be adept at CO bond cleavage while minimizing aromatic ring hydrogenation [26,30]. However, the studies have been limited to lignin model compounds, providing a rational to expand the investigation to compounds derived from the hemicellulosic fraction of woody biomass. To our knowledge, there is no report on the conversion of furfural on ReOx catalyst. In order to investigate the viability of ReOx catalysts for the conversion of furfural, it is important to provide insights into key catalyst parameters that govern reactivity, such as metal loading, nature of support, and reaction conditions. In this study, the effect of support (SiO2, Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3) and metal loading (0.5–1.8 atoms per nm2) was evaluated in the liquid phase conversion of furfural at 200 °C and 4 MPa. The most active catalyst was selected for additional studies at pressure range of 3–5 MPa and temperature range of 150–250 °C."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Commercial silica (SiO2, Grace Davison 432), alumina (γ-Al2O3, GFSA 401), and silica-alumina (SiO2-Al2O3, Ketene HA 100 SP, 26.2% Al2O3) were ground and sieved to 100–140 am particle size and used as supports. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous solution containing the required amount of NH4ReO4 (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by drying at room temperature for 24 hand at 110 °C for 12 h. The samples were calcined under static air at 300 °C (ramp rate of 10 °C min−1) for 0.5 h. This temperature was chosen to prevent sublimation of NH4ReO4 at temperature above 300 °C [31]. The catalysts prepared with different loadings were denoted as ReOx(X)/SiO2, where X corresponds to the nominal Re loading in atoms nm−2, while those with the same Re loading but different supports were denoted as ReOx(1.4)/support."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Rhenium content of the catalysts was determined by ICP-MS using a PerkinElmer Elan 9000 ICP Mass Spectrometer. The samples were digested in a microwave digester using concentrated HNO3 acid prior to analysis. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the catalysts were obtained at −196 °C using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen flow. The BET specific surface area (SBET ) was calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherms in the range 0.05 ≤ P/P ≤ 0.25 and the total pore volume (Vp ) was recorded at P/P0 = 0.99. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained using a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer equipped with a Ni-filtered CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The standard scan parameters were 15–90°2θ with a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 0.4 s per step. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DR-UV–vis) spectroscopy of well-dried samples was measured by a JASCO V-650 UV–vis spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance sphere for powder analysis. The samples were milled using an agate mortar and diluted with BaSO4 to maximize reflectance. The DR UV–vis spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 200–900 nm at ambient conditions. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD-NH3) was measured using a Micromeritics TPD-TPR 2900 system with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The sample was pretreated in He (50 mL min−1) at 110 °C for 0.5 h, and then subjected to pulses of NH3 until saturation of the catalyst surface at 120 °C. Then, the sample was cooled to ambient temperature and purged in He to remove physically adsorbed NH3. Once the TCD baseline was stabilized, NH3-TPD was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 700 °C in He (50 mL min−1). The amount of NH3 desorbed per gram of catalyst was calculated from ammonia mean calibrated areas and ammonia TPD analytical areas and the TPD profiles were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (Gaussian) in order to deconvolute the curves. The R2 value for the fitting was above 0.97. H2-Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of the supported catalysts was measured using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument fitted with a TCD. Prior to the analysis, 50 mg of catalysts was loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor and dried in He (50 mL min−1) at 110 °C for 0.5 h to remove any weakly retained moisture. TPR was performed from 50 °C to 700 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 under 5% H2/Ar (50 mL min−1). The effluent gas was passed through a cold trap filled with a mixture of isopropanol and liquid nitrogen to remove water vapor before entering the TCD detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer fitted with a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) photon source. The samples were pre-reduced at 300 °C for 1 h in a pretreatment chamber and transferred to the spectrometer without exposure to air. The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the C 1s level at 284.8 eV. An estimated error of ±0.1 eV can be assumed for all measurements. Intensities of the peaks (Re4f, Si2p, Al2p and O1s) were calculated from the respective peak areas after background subtraction and smoothing. The spectra were fitted by the standard computer based statistical analysis which included fitting the experimental spectra to a sum of Gaussian and Lorentzian lines (90G-10L) using a least squares minimization procedure for χ2 with the help of the XPS peak software. However, some broadening in the Re 4f region was unavoidable due to differences in crystal sizes and metal-support interaction. The R2 value for the fitting was 0.95. Relative surface atomic ratios were determined from the corresponding peak areas, corrected with tabulated sensitivity factors [32], with a precision of 7%. Further details on how the surface atomic ratios were estimated are given in the supplementary material."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The catalysts were evaluated for furfural conversion in a 300 mL autoclave reactor operating in batch mode (Parr Model 4841) at 200 °C and under a hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa for 4 h. The liquid mixture consisted of 1.5 mL of furfural (99%, Merck) and 700 μL of hexadecane (an internal standard, 99%, Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in 80 mL of solvent dodecane (99%, Merck). Approximately 100 mg of the calcined catalyst was added to the mixture in the reactor. Then, the reactor was sealed and flushed with N2 (99.995%, Linde) for 20 min to evacuate air from the system, and the temperature was raised to 200 °C while stirring at 600 rpm. In this experimental condition the internal and external mass transfer limitations were minimized [31]. The reactor was then pressurized with hydrogen to 4 MPa once the desired temperature was reached (this is assumed to be the start of the reaction). The pressure was kept constant during the course of the experiment. Aliquot of around 0.5 mL were periodically withdrawn during the course of the reaction and analyzed by a Perkin Elmer (Clarus 400) gas chromatography equipped with DB-1 column (Agilent, 30 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness of 0.25 μm) and a FID detector. The products were identified by their column retention time in comparison with available standards. The effect of reaction temperature (150–250 °C) was determined at 4 MPa H2, while the effect of hydrogen pressure (3–5 MPa) was investigated at 200 °C following the procedure described. The conversion of furfural (XFURL ) was calculated from: (1) X FURL % = n FUFL 0 - n FUFL i n FUFL 0 × 100 where n FUFL 0 is the initial moles of furfural in the solution (mol) and n FUFL i is the moles of furfural at time i (mol). Mass balances and carbon balances were around 90%. Mass balance was determined by comparison of conversion calculated by disappearance of reactants to that calculated as a function of the reaction products, while carbon balance was calculated by ∑ c a r b o n n u m b e r × n product / n F U R L × 5 . The values obtained are a reasonable consequence of the formation of oligomers of furfural at high reaction temperature. The activity was expressed as specific rate rs (i.e. the moles of furfural converted per gram of catalyst and expressed as mol∙gcat −1∙s−1) and calculated from the initial slope (b(s−11)) of the conversion vs. time plot, after the induction period, according to Eq. (2): (2) r s = b × n FURL 0 m where m (g) is the mass of the catalyst. Based on Weisz-Prater and Mears criteria, the reported reaction rates were not limited by internal and external mass transfer. The product selectivity was calculated from Eq. (3): (3) Selectivity m o l % = n productj n FURLconverted × 100 where n productj is the moles of product j (mol) and n FURLconverted is the moles of furfural converted (10 mol%)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Sample characterization,"3.1 Sample characterization Table 1 summarizes the theoretical and real Re content in wt% and in atoms of Re per nm2. The latter was calculated according to Eq. (4), using ICP-MS and SBET results: (4) Re a t o m s / nm 2 = Wt Re × N 1 - Wt Re × MW Re × S BET support where Wt Re is rhenium loading (wt%), N is the Avogadro’s number, MW Re is the atomic weight of rhenium (186.207 g/mol) and S BET support is the specific surface area of the support. The theoretical Re content agrees well with the real content in all the catalysts. The BET specific surface area of the SiO2-supported catalysts ranged from 261 to 303 m2 g−1 and the total pore volume ranged from 0.89 to 1.09 cm3 g−1. As expected, SBET and Vp of SiO2 decreased after Re impregnation and became more pronounced with increasing Re loading. The pore size distribution (Fig. S1) of the catalysts were identical, indicating that the decrease in surface area was not due to pore blockage but was rather due to a dilution effect arising from the presence of Re species in the catalysts. This behavior is also observed when comparing the pore size distributions of ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 to those of their respective supports. Thus, it can be deduced that the majority of the Re species are primarily located outside the pores. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . For the ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts, diffraction peaks corresponding to hexagonal ReO3 phase and NH4ReO4 were observed. The most dominant phase present in the calcined catalysts is not clear because it is not possible to distinguish between the ReO3 and NH4ReO4 phases from the most intense peaks at low diffraction angles. The presence of NH4ReO4 indicates incomplete decomposition of the precursor salt due to the low calcination temperature (300 °C) and short time (0.5 h) used. This condition was chosen to prevent sublimation of NH4ReO4 which occurs at higher temperature [31]. However, previous studies have shown that both ex situ reduction in hydrogen at 300 °C and in situ reduction during the course of a reaction at 300 °C leads not only to partial reduction of ReOx but also to complete decomposition of NH4ReO4 [26,33], and for that reason NH4ReO4 is not expected to be present during catalytic reaction. Fig. 1a shows that crystalline ReO3 and NH4ReO4 species were barely present in catalysts with Re content less than 0.8 atoms of Re per nm2 of support because this loading is close to the reported maximum surface density of rhenium oxide on silica (0.5 atoms nm−2) [34]. Fig. 1 also shows the presence of crystalline ReO3 and NH4ReO4 phases in catalysts with higher Re contents, consistent with the well-known formation of crystallites with increasing loading. Diffraction patterns of the catalysts with the same Re loading but different supports are shown in Fig. 1b. While the diffraction patterns of the ReOx(1.4)/SiO2and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts show crystalline ReO3 and undecomposed NH4ReO4 species, that of ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 catalyst only show peaks corresponding to the support (mostly the γ-alumina phase). This result suggests that Re species were more highly dispersed on the alumina than on the other supports, likely due to stronger metal-support interaction. The acidic properties of the catalysts were probed by NH3-TPD and the results are shown in Fig. 2 and presented in Table 2 . Acidity of the ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts is probably associated with hydroxyl groups on the support and Lewis acidity of the rhenium oxides [35]. The TPD profiles of the ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 2a) exhibit a weak low temperature peak (≤100 °C), an intense peak centered at ca. 200 °C, and a broad high-temperature peak between 400 and 600 °C temperature range. The low-temperature peak is associated with acid sites on the SiO2 support, while the peak around 200 °C, in which the intensity increases with Re loading, likely corresponds to ammonia desorbed from Lewis acid sites of ReOx species. Broad features around 450 °C are also observed which could be due to ammonia from partially decomposed precursor. Table 2 lists the total amount of acid sites and the distribution of acid sites, determined by fitting the NH3-TPD curves with a Gaussian function and calculating the area corresponding to weak (T < 300 °C), medium (300 °C < T < 500 °C) and strong (T > 500 °C) acid sites [36]. The data reveals that weak acid sites, associated with both acid sites on SiO2 support and ReOx species, account for 52–55% of the total acidity. As expected, the total acidity increased with increasing Re loading, reflected in the increasing concentration of medium acid sites of the ReOx/(X)/SiO2 catalysts. The total amount of ammonia desorbed per gram of precursor decreases with increasing NH4ReO4loading, implying contribution to the total desorbed ammonia from partially decomposed NH4ReO4. It is difficult to distinguish between ammonia adsorbed on acid sites and those linked to NH4ReO4 precursor from these TPD analysis; however, difference in acidity for the catalysts with different Re loading is not envisioned to significantly impact the overall reactivity since the concentration of strong acid sites is similar. Fig. 2b shows the TPD-NH3 profiles of the ReOx(1.4)/support catalysts. The desorption profiles of the γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 supports show broad features spanning the entire temperature range, indicating the presence of acid sites of different strength. Although it was not possible to precisely distinguish between the peaks corresponding to the supports and those related to ReOx acid sites on the ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts, the higher amount of acid sites of the catalysts in comparison to the corresponding support is due to the additional presence of ReOx sites or non-decomposed NH4ReO4. It is also important to point out that despite ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 containing the highest amount of acid sites, it possessed half the amount of strong acid sites as ReOx (1.4)/SiO2 and ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3. This may be due to the presence of large NH4ReO4 crystallites blocking access to strong acid sites on SiO2-Al2O3 support. The reduction behavior of the calcined catalysts was evaluated by H2-TPR to ascertain metal-support interaction due to their relevance to the in situ generation of active ReOx sites [26,30]. It should be noted that although pressure of H2 in the TPR experiment is much lower than that in the liquid-phase reaction, TPR results can provide adequate insight into the reduction behavior of reducible ReOx catalyst and the nature of ReO4 − present. Fig. 3 a shows the TPR profiles for ReOx(X)/SiO2. A single peak at 353 °C was observed for ReOx(0.5)/SiO2, ascribed to the reduction of ReO3 to Re0 [37]. This was confirmed by conducting a second TPR on the reduced sample; no hydrogen consumption was observed from the second TPR. Deconvolution of the peak reveals the presence of two species with almost indistinguishable reducibility. There is a noticeable shift of this peak to lower temperature with increasing Re content, indicating that Re oxide species interact less strongly with the support at higher loadings (larger crystallites), in agreement with the findings by Arnoldy et al. [37]. Thus, it can be inferred that surface reduction of ReO3 to Re species of lower oxidation state occurs more easily at higher loadings, leading to greater amount of active oxygen vacancy sites. Fig. 3a also shows the appearance of a shoulder peak at 310 °C for catalysts with Re content ≥1.1 atoms of Re per nm2 of support which is attributed to the reduction of ReO4 − to Re0. The distinction in reduction temperature of ReO4 − and Re6+ species has previously been observed by Martinez et al. [28] and is consistent with XRD results which showed the existence of hexagonal ReO3 and undecomposed NH4ReO4 species (ReO4 −) on the SiO2-supported catalysts. The reduction profiles of the ReOx(1.4)/support catalysts are shown in Fig. 3b. The temperature of the peak corresponding to the reduction of ReO3 to Re0 increase in the order, ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 (352 °C) < ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 (357 °C) < ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 (370 °C), reflecting ReOx-support interaction. This trend is not unexpected because it is well-documented that γ-Al2O3 interacts more strongly with several metal oxides than SiO2 and SiO2-Al2O3 [38,39]. A shoulder peak can also be observed for ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 (at 312 °C) and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 (324 °C) but is absent for ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3. This discrepancy in behavior could be due to the existence of specific sites on the support (probably associated with silica) that binds and promotes the formation of Re6+ during calcination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to provide complementary information on the presence of any additional amorphous and/or highly dispersed Re species on the catalyst surface. In a previous study of the same catalytic systems, XPS spectra of the Re 4f region of calcined ReOx/SiO2 revealed two Re 4f7/2 contributions with binding energy (BE) of 45.9 ± 0.3 eV and 47.5 ± 0.2 eV, assigned to Re oxide species with minor oxygen atoms in its environment (ReOx) and Re7+ (Re2O7 or ReO4 −), respectively [33]. These are consistent with the existence of multiple Re oxide species deduced from TPR results. Furthermore, no N1s peak was observed in the survey spectrum of representative catalysts (see Fig. S2 in the supplementary material), indicating a complete decomposition of the ammonium salt in the near-surface region during calcination step. This result is in contrast to the XRD results, suggesting that the bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are different. To augment these results, the catalysts were reduced in situ by H2 at 300 °C for 1 h prior to XPS analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4. This was done even though it is acknowledged that the gas-phase reduction at 300 °C for 1 h under atmospheric H2 is not the same as in situ partial reduction during the course of the liquid-phase reaction under 4 MPa H2. Nevertheless, the results are relevant to highlight the susceptibility of calcined ReO4 − oxide species to undergo partial reduction to ReOx species. Previous results by Takeda et al. [40] found no difference in the nature of ReOx species on silica-supported Re catalyst during reduction in either the gas phase or liquid phase. The authors, however, found that the main effect of the two activation methods was on the ratio of the Re species, in which Re metallic species were more prevalent under gas-phase reduction condition. Hence, the discussion of the XPS results in this study is focused on the nature of Re species and not on the proportion. Fig. 4a shows the Re 4f core-level spectra (Re4f7/2 and Re4f5/2) of ReOx(1.4)/SiO2, displaying two partially overlapped doublets. The spectra of the other ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts are similar (Fig. S3 in the supplementary material). The BE values of Re 4f7/2 (Table 3 ) appear at 40.3–40.6 and 42.1–42.4 eV, assigned to Re0 and Re4+, respectively [41,42]. In particular, the presence of Re4+ species is an indication that partial reduction occurs and is in agreement with XPS results of spent Re oxide catalysts reported by Escalona and coworkers under similar conditions [26,30]. As previously stated, Re4+ sites are cited as being primarily responsible for cleaving CO bonds in phenolic compounds. The oxidation states of Re on the catalysts were identical regardless of loading, suggesting that the nature of the active sites did not change with increase of Re content. Fig. 4b and c and Table 3 show that the Re 4f core-level spectra of ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 exhibit identical signals to the ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 catalyst, evidence by Re 4f7/2 values of 40.3 eV and 42.1 eV which corresponds to Re0 and Re4+, respectively. The identical spectral lines suggest that generation of ReOx sites is likely to occur on all three supported catalysts. Table 3 lists the XPS Re/Si atomic ratio, which corresponds to the coverage of Re species on the surface of the support and hence provides a relative comparison of the concentration of accessible Re sites. As expected, the surface Re/Si atomic ratio increases with Re surface density of the ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts. However, there is a decrease above 1.4 atoms of Re per nm2 of support, attributed to aggregate formation at higher loading. For the different supported catalysts, the Re surface coverage increase in the order: ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 > ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 > ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3. This is in accordance with the observed trend of metal-support interaction deduced from TPR results, confirming that strong metal-support interaction promotes distribution of metal/metal oxide species on the surface of the support."
7,Conversion of furfural,"3.2 Conversion of furfural The catalytic conversion of furfural under H2 in both liquid and vapor phase proceeds through three possible primary reaction pathways (Fig. 5 ) and have been reported for various heterogeneous catalysts [4–14,43,44]: carbonyl group (CO) hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), decarbonylation to furan, or selective deoxygenation to produce 2-methylfuran (2-MF) as primary products. Furan and 2-MF can also be derived from furfuryl alcohol as secondary products via CO and CC hydrogenolysis, respectively; ring hydrogenation of FOL to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and demethylation of 2-MF to furan can also occur. Other possible tertiary products include ring hydrogenated products such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), ring-opening C4 products such as butanal, butanol and butane, and C5 ring-opening products such as 2-pentene-1-ol, 1-5-pentane diol and 1,2-pentane diol. The C4 products are derived from furan while C5 products are formed from FOL and/or 2-MF [12]. Most of these products are industrially relevant because they are used as precursors in the fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and perfume industries. Nevertheless, in the context of fuel production 2-MF is the most desirable product because of its high octane number and low water solubility; furthermore, 2-MF formation involves O removal without CC bond cleavage, while also avoiding excessive H2 consumption [12,13]. Therefore, the performance of the ReOx-based catalysts in this study will be evaluated based on their overall activity and selectivity towards 2-MF (while suppressing the formation of furan and ring hydrogenated products). 3.2.1 Effect of loading Fig. 6 shows the conversion of furfural and the yield of products on ReOx(0.8)/SiO2and ReOx(1.8)/SiO2catalysts at 200 °C and 4 MPa H2 (the results of the other ReOx(X)/SiO2 [X = 0.5 and 1.1] catalysts are shown in Fig. S4). The concentration profiles of the products are similar for all the silica-supported catalysts, in which FOL was observed as the most abundant product, followed by 2-MF. The concentration of FOL continued to increase with increasing temperature, indicating incomplete reaction after 4 h. However, the slope of the yield of FOL was less steep at longer reaction time which suggests that it is a primary product. Other products detected, but in significantly less quantities, are furan and 2-MTHF. Finally, trace amount of products with total yield of 1.5 mol% are lumped together as others (THFOL, THF, C4 and C5 ring opening products). Thus, on ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalysts, the prominent pathways for furfural conversion are CO hydrogenation to produce FOL and subsequent CO hydrogenolysis to form 2-MF, and selective deoxygenation of furfural to produce 2-MF. Hence, 2-MF is both a primary and secondary product from the conversion of furfural on ReOx catalysts. Decarbonylation to produce furan and ring hydrogenation to yield 2-MTHF also occurred but to less extents. These observations are consistent with several other previously reported studies [5–14,43,44]. The observed similarity of the relative products yield on the catalysts with different Re loadings is accentuated by the products distribution compared at the same level of conversion (10%). Fig. 7 a shows 60–70% selectivity towards FOL and 28–35% selectivity towards 2-MF. The selectivity towards furan was less than 5%. The consistent preference for hydrogenation of CO over decarbonylation on all the catalysts regardless of Re content indicates that the nature of active sites on the SiO2-supported catalysts does not change with crystallite size, as shown by characterization results, and is in agreement with the application of this active phase for the conversion of phenol and guaiacol [30,45]. Although 2-MF can be produced via either CO hydrogenolysis of FOL or selective deoxygenation of furfural, the former is the likely dominant route based on literature studies. To distinguish between the two pathways and shed more light on the results from the conversion of furfural, the conversion of FOL and 2-MF was tested on ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 at the same reaction conditions as used with furfural (Fig. S5 in the supplementary material). The conversion of FOL yielded 2-MF as the main product, in addition to furan, 2-MTHF and others (THFOL, THF, C4 and C5 ring opening products). Of greater interest is the higher formation rate of 2-MF (3.4 µmol g−1 s−1) from FOL conversion than that obtained from furfural conversion (1.7 µmol g−1 s−1), which indicates that 2-MF produced preferentially through CO hydrogenolysis of FOL. This is consistent with experimental results on SiO2-supported Ni and Ni-Fe catalysts previously reported by the group of Resasco et al. [12]. Furthermore, the over 60% selectivity towards 2-MF from FOL conversion reinforces the theory that oxophilic Re promotes deoxygenation while it minimizes CC bond breaking. A similar enhanced 2-MF selectivity from FOL was obtained with the increased addition of oxophilic Fe to Ni/SiO2 catalyst [12]. Fig. S5 shows that2-MF was more reactive than FOL on ReOx(1.4)/SiO2. The products from 2-MF conversion were furan, 2-MTHF, and others (comprising THF and C4 ring opening products). The higher reactivity of 2-MF suggests that the presence of FOL suppresses ring hydrogenation and ring opening reactions of 2-MF, probably due to the affinity of Re for interaction with O of the carbonyl group over the furanic ring. In a broader context, the 35% selectivity towards 2-MF obtained in the 200–250 °C compares favorably to other catalytic systems reported in the literature (Table S1) for both liquid and vapor phase conversion of furfural. In addition, the existence of a direct route suggests that the activity and selectivity of the Re-based catalyst can be enhanced when paired with other elements such as Cu, which will minimize excessive hydrogen consumption. The reason for the moderate2-MF selectivity can be attributed to the oxophilicity of rhenium. Resasco et al. [12] found through DFT calculations and IR spectroscopic studies that strong interaction between the carbonyl O and the oxophilic Fe atoms stabilized the η 2-(C,O) surface species and weakened the CO bond, favoring hydrogenation to FOL and subsequent hydrogenolysis to 2-MF. The authors also found that without the presence of Fe, the η 2-(C,O) surface species was converted into a surface acyl species which was decomposed to furan. Therefore, by extension, the in situ creation of oxophilic reducible ReOx sites has strong affinity for η 2-(C,O) surface species and breaking of CO bonds. The latter behavior has also been observed during the conversion of phenolic compounds [26,30,45]. Experiments to distinguish between the various proposed pathways are ongoing. The catalytic activity of ReOx(X)/SiO2 is expressed by the initial reaction rate rs (moles of furfural converted per gram of catalyst per second), calculated from the initial slope of the conversion vs. time plot, as described in Eq. (2). The values, shown in Table 4 and Fig. 7b, increase with increasing Re content to a maximum value at 1.4 atoms of Re per nm2 but then decreases at higher loading. Activity of solid catalysts for HDO reactions is typically linked to the nature and dispersion of the active phase and the total acidity of the catalysts. However, XRD and XPS results show that the nature of Re oxide species is insensitive to Re loading, consistent with the results of Wachs et al. [46] who showed through Raman spectroscopic analysis that only one surface Re oxide species is present on SiO2 support regardless of loading. However, the amount of active Re sites could change as different Re species are formed at higher loadings. Table 3 shows that the surface concentration of Re species (Re/Si atomic ratio) as a function of loading goes through a maximum at 1.4 atoms of Re per nm2. Since the active sites on reducible Re oxide has been reported to be oxygen vacancy sites [29], the linear increase in activity for the ReOx(X)/SiO2 catalyst with loading up to 1.4 atoms of Re per nm2 is related to increasing amount of oxygen vacancy sites, whereas the subsequent slight decline in activity at higher loading is due to loss of surface Re species through agglomeration. To probe the intrinsic activity, the initial reaction rates are normalized by exposed Re surface species (derived from XPS surface atomic ratio), as calculated in Eq. (5). The intrinsic rate (i.e. molecules of furfural converted per exposed surface Re atom per second and expressed in molecFURatomRe −1 s−1) is calculated by: (5) r i = r s × MW SiO 2 1 - Wt Re ∙ g m × R e / S i XPS where rs is the initial reaction rate (mol g−1s−1), MWSiO2 is the molar mass of SiO2 (60.08 g mol−1); WtRe is the Re loading (wt%), and (Re/Si)XPS is the XPS surface atomic Re/Si ratio (atom atom−1). Fig. 7b shows the intrinsic activity results. Normalizing the initial rate by exposed Re shows a continuous increase of activity with loading, indicating that catalytic activity is not governed solely by exposed Re species because not all of them are catalytically active. Results from TPR show a slight shift to lower temperature with increasing Re surface density, indicating increased ease of reduction of ReOx species with increasing Re content, and consequently increased availability of catalytically active low-valent ReOx sites [47,48]. 3.2.2 Effect of support The dependence of the catalytic characteristics of ReOx active phase on the surface properties of three supports (SiO2, γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3) for the conversion of furfuryl is evaluated. Fig. 8 shows no notable differences of the concentration profiles. Again, FOL and 2-MF were the main products. Fig. 9 a shows minor difference from the products distribution calculated at 10% furfural conversion of the catalysts (although ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 presents a slightly higher 2-MF selectivity), contrasting the drastic differences reported for supported Pt catalysts by Bhogeswararao and Srinivas [8] and An et al. [10]. These studies credited the differences to synergistic effects arising from charge transfer interaction between Pt and the acidic surface of the oxide support. While Bhogeswararao and Srinivas [8] found a direct correlation between acidity of the catalysts and 2-MF selectivity, the results for the ReOx(1.4)/support catalysts clearly do not correlate with the acidity (i.e. total acidity varied as follows: ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 (2.98 mmol g−1) > ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 (1.62 mmol g−1) > ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 (1.23 mmol g−1), which contrasted with the selectivity towards 2-MF). The group of Somarjai [10,11] reported that the reaction pathway (CO hydrogenation vs. decarbonylation) on Pt nanoparticles with the size ranges of 1.5–7.1 nm supported on mesoporous oxides is particle size-dependent. It is well-known that the electronic effect of the support can modify the adsorption and catalytic properties of the active phase, a phenomenon which is most pronounced for small particles because large particles tend to form multiple atomic layers which weaken the support’s influence on selectivity. This might be the reason for the lack of clear difference between the supported ReOx catalysts in this study. Another possible explanation is that the conversion of furfural is catalyzed by the metal-support interface which is less sensitive to differences in particle size and surface acidity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the reaction pathway is dictated by the presence of oxophilic ReOx sites and acidic ReOx-support sites which diminishes the role of the support, and provide flexibility in catalyst design strategies to utilize reducible rhenium oxide for the transformation of biomass derivatives. Table 4 and Fig. 9b show that the initial reaction rates (activity based on mass of catalyst) decrease as follows: ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 > ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 > ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3. This does not correlate with surface Re/S (S = Si, Al, and Si + Al) atomic ratio which could be due to the support’s ability to influence the nature of ReO4 species. As discussed earlier, only one type of ReO4 species exists after calcination of SiO2-supported Re catalysts. However, Wachs et al. [49] revealed the existence of two types of surface ReOx sites on calcined supported ReOx/Al2O3 catalysts, denoted as ReO4-I and ReO4-II species. The authors estimated the concentration of the catalytically active surface ReO4-II sites on Al2O3 from experimental data from their study and other literature studies: for a Re surface density of 1.4 atoms nm-2, only ∼40% of the ReO4 species are of the ReO4-II variety. The prevalence of these less reactive ReO4-I sites on Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 is due to stabilization by surface Al3+ sites. Therefore, in the context of the present study, a significant fraction of the exposed Re species on Al2O3 and perhaps on SiO2-Al2O3 constitutes inactive Re species for furfural conversion, leading to the lower activity of ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 and ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts compared to ReOx(1.4)/SiO2. Fig. 9b and Table 4 also reports activity based on the exposed Re species determined by XPS. The intrinsic activity increase in the order ReOx(1.4)/Al2O3 < ReOx(1.4)/SiO2-Al2O3 < ReOx(1.4)/SiO2, which contrasts the interaction of Re oxide with the support deduced from TPR measurements. Therefore, the activity of supported Re oxide for furfural conversion is governed by the reducibility of the catalysts and its ability to generate active ReOx sites during the reaction. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction conditions The effect of reaction temperature and H2 pressure on the conversion of furfural over the catalyst with the highest activity and 2-MF selectivity, ReOx(1.4)/SiO2, was investigated. First, the reaction temperature was varied from 150 to 250 °C at 4 MPa H2 pressure and an initial furfural concentration of 0.232 mol L−1. Fig. 10 shows obvious differences in the level of conversion and concentration profiles of the products as a function of temperature. The overall furfural conversion increased from 7% at 150 °C to 93% at 250 °C after 4 h of reaction. The high conversion obtained at the higher temperature enables differences in concentration profiles of products, which are not evident at low conversion, to be seen. Specifically, FOL is clearly consumed during the course of the reaction to produce 2-MF, furan and THFOL, and became insignificant at 4 h: this confirms FOL as both a primary product and an intermediate product. Another notable observation at 250 °C is the higher yield of 2-MF at both low and high furfural conversion, confirming the possible existence of the selective deoxygenation pathway (Fig. 5). Fig. 11 a better illustrates this interpretation: products distribution, calculated at 5% furfural conversion, shows clear increase in the production of 2-MF at the expense of FOL 250 °C. The dominance of selective deoxygenation and/or CO hydrogenolysis at high temperatures is possibly due to the higher activation of these reactions. Fig. 11a also shows that selectivity towards furan increased with increasing temperature, consistent with previously reported studies in the literature that decarbonylation is favored at high temperature due to endothermicity of this reaction [5,50,51]. The enhanced selective deoxygenation activity of the ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 catalyst at high temperatures can also be rationalized to be due to the higher tendency for in situ reduction of ReOx to generate oxygen vacancy sites at higher reaction temperature. The electron-rich Re sites repel the electron-rich carbonyl group, leading to diminished CO hydrogenation but enhanced selective deoxygenation reaction. The propensity of ReOx catalyst for direct deoxygenation at elevated temperature has been previously reported by our group [30] for phenol hydrodeoxygenation. In relation to furfural conversion, a number of studies have reported that higher reaction temperature promotes 2-MF formation through the sequential CO hydrogenation/CO hydrogenolysis route [5,8,52–54]. However, direct evidence of the existence of selective deoxygenation of furfural to 2-MF was reported by Bhan et al. [8] over molybdenum carbide catalysts, indicating that the nature of the active phase is as instrumental as the reaction temperature in dictating the reaction pathway. In fact, 2-MF selectivity obtained on the silica-supported ReOx catalyst is superior to that obtained on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for the liquid-phase conversion of furfural at comparable reaction conditions. Therefore, the results for ReOx(1.4)/SiO2 further highlight the ability of oxygen vacancy sites on reducible rhenium oxide to bypass FOL to produce 2-MF. Fig. 10 also shows the dependence of furfural conversion on H2 pressure over ReOx(1.4)/SiO2, in which the H2 pressure was varied from 3 to 5 MPa at 200 °C and an initial furfural concentration of 0.232 mol L−1. The difference in concentration profiles of the products was not as dramatic as that observed for the effect of temperature. For example, while the yield of FOL eventually reached a plateau at higher conversion, it was still the most dominant product observed after 4 h. The distinct difference in the relative yield of products is most obvious at the tail end of the reaction. Thus, product selectivity is calculated after 4 h of reaction and compared to that calculated at 20% furfural conversion (Table 5 ). Selectivity towards FOL increases from 60 to 72% with H2 pressure at 20% furfural conversion due to increase availability of dissociated hydrogen which can bind to the oxygen on the adsorbed furfural species to promote CO hydrogenation. This is also reflected in the linear dependence of initial reaction rates on H2 pressure (Fig. 11b), and is in agreement with literature studies over other catalytic systems [53]. Table 5 shows that although FOL is still the main product after 4 h, its selectivity decreased from 72% to 52% at 5 MPa H2, coinciding with an increase in 2-MF selectivity from 23 to 39%. This behavior could also be related to higher concentration of dissociated hydrogen reacting with adsorbed pre-formed FOL to promote CO hydrogenolysis to 2-MF (a secondary reaction step as shown in Fig. 7), in line with results from other hydrogen-dependence study on the conversion of furfural [13]."
8,Conclusions,"The conversion of furfural, an important lignocellulosic biomass-derived platform chemical, is studied over supported ReOx catalysts containing different Re surface concentrations and supports in a batch reactor. The reaction produced a variety of industrially relevant chemicals, namely furfuryl alcohol (the most abundant product), 2-methylfuran (a major product), furan (detected in measurable quantities), and ring-hydrogenation and ring-opening products (combined yield of <1 mol%). The activity based on mass of the SiO2-supported ReOx catalysts increased with loading up to 1.4 atoms of Re per nm2 of support, attributed to continuous increase of active sites. A subsequent decrease at higher loading was attributed to loss of active sites due to the formation of aggregates. The activity based on surface Re species, derived from XPS analysis, increased continuously with Re loading. This results is taken to mean that either the activity is not solely dependent on exposed Re sites or that not all the accessible sites are catalytically active. However, a direct correlation between activity and reducibility exists, consistent with the speculation that the conversion of furfural is catalyzed by partially reduced ReOx sites generated in situ by hydrogen. There was no significant difference in product selectivity which is linked to the identical nature of the active sites on these catalysts within the range of loading used. The influence of support on product distribution was minimal which is either due to the high loading used (which reduced support effects) or to the dominance of ReOx species in this reaction. Reactions at different conditions of temperature and H2pressure revealed strong dependence on reaction pathways due to their influence on the rate of in situ generated ReOx active sites, availability of activated hydrogen and thermodynamic effects. For example, formation of 2-methylfuran is favored at high temperature and low H2 pressure, while that of furan is favored at high temperature but is insensitive to H2 pressure. The results from this study provide direct evidence of the viability of reducible ReOx catalyst for the conversion of furfural to 2-methylfuran."
