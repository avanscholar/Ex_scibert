0,Introduction,"Rapid globalization substantially leads to environmental contamination by the release of high levels of toxic metals, including copper (Cu) to the environment. Cu is emitted from different anthropogenic sources into the atmosphere, such as metal extraction, mining, burning of carbon fuel, particulate emissions, solid waste disposal, municipal and commercial wastes, biofuel application and organic manure (Sytar et al., 2013; Rehman et al., 2016). Cu serves as a vital micronutrient required for the normal growth and development of plants, and regulates variety of cellular enzymes, and acts as an important factor of a number of oxidation-reduction reactions (Pichhode and Nikhil, 2015; Karmous et al., 2015). On the other side, the surplus Cu induces oxidative burst, contributes to the production of reactive oxidative markers, which triggers modification of chloroplast ultra-structure, stomatal behavior, root surface morphology, cell viability, photosynthetic efficiency and growth characteristics of plants (Nazir et al., 2019b). High accumulation of Cu in plants inhibits photosynthesis by impeding biosynthesis of chlorophyll (Chl), Rubisco activity and effectiveness of PSII (Sirhindi et al., 2015; Feigl et al., 2015). Furthermore, the disruption of the stomatal structure due to Cu-stress negatively influences photosynthetic machinery, resulting in reduced CO2 assimilation because of lower conductance of stomata (Avinash, 2017; Nazir et al., 2019b). Plant growth regulators (PGRs) could be exogenously applied as a prospective strategy under environmental stress circumstances and strengthens plant resilience. Among the different signal molecules, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a significant signaling messenger in plant tissues that has acquired significance due to its numerous and multifaceted characteristics including compact size, neutral charge, free radicals and greater half-life and also governs innumerable growth and development processes. At lower levels, it acts as a signal molecule in cellular and intracellular signaling to induce downstream reactions (Camejo et al., 2016; Saxena et al., 2016), while inducing the oxidative burst at excess levels (Petrov et al., 2015). There is a plethora of information regarding the fundamental roles of H2O2 in various plant cellular processes of plants, such as chloroplast ultra-structure, stomatal opening and closing, root structure, cell viability, photosynthetic machinery and growth responses of plants under HM stresses (Černý et al., 2018; Nazir et al., 2020). The exogenously-sourced H2O2 has the potential to affect plant resilience to drought, salinity, temperature and HM stress in a number of plants (Ellouzi et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2019; Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). In addition, H2O2 could lead to an increased net photosynthetic rate, growth attributes and activated antioxidant defense system that could mitigate Cu-inflicted growth retardation and oxidative damage (Mostofa et al., 2015). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of naturally occurring polyhydroxylated sterol derivatives that promote plant metabolism and maintain various environmental stresses (Zhou et al., 2018; Hussain et al., 2019). 24-epibrassnolide (EBL), an effective by-product from brassinolide biosynthesis has been reported to have the potential to govern a number of morpho-physiological processes including chloroplast ultra-structure, stomatal movement, root morphology, cell viability, growth, photosynthesis, leaf exchange attributes, protein synthesis, induction of osmoprotectant and antioxidant enzymes (Ahmad et al., 2018; Sanjari et al., 2019; Nazir et al., 2019a). The capacity of BRs to boost the antioxidant defense system of plants is extensively used to provide tolerance to multiple abiotic factors, including HMs, salinity, water and thermal stress (Jan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018). Recent developments in the interplay of plant hormones have shown the integral role of plant growth regulators in the management of various abiotic circumstances (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). However, there is an apparent lack of work to address the roles of H2O2 and BRs in ameliorating Cu stress. Therefore, the current study was performed with the purpose of how the exogenously-sourced EBL (foliar spray) and/or H2O2 (root dipping) to stress free and stressed plants could influence photosynthetic efficiency, chloroplast-ultrastructure, stomatal behavior, root surface morphology, cell viability and minimize the acquisition of Cu and oxidative markers (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals), and improve the growth biomarkers in Solanum lycopersicum."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant material,2.1 Plant material Standard and healthy tomato seeds (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. S-22 were rinsed multiple times and disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min. Seeds were constantly rinsed with double distilled water (DDW) prior to sowing.
3,Preparation of EBL and H2O2 solutions,"2.2 Preparation of EBL and H2O2 solutions EBL and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. India. The stock solutions of EBL and H2O2 were established by taking the required amount of EBL or H2O2 and dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol in 100 mL bottle and the ultimate volume was maintained to 100 mL by using DDW. Desired concentrations of EBL (10−8 M) and H2O2 (0.1 mM) were prepared by dilution of the stock solution. 0.1% (v/v) Tween- 20, the surfactant was appended into the solution prior to application."
4,Source of copper stress,2.3 Source of copper stress Copper sulphate (CuSO4.5H2O) was used as the source of Cu stress at various concentrations of 10 or 100 mg kg−1 of soil.
5,Treatment sequence and experimental layout,"2.4 Treatment sequence and experimental layout The surface disinfected seeds were seeded in earthen pots in order to build a nursery. Transplantation of seedlings from nursery to earthen pots (25 × 25 cm) was performed at 20 d after sowing (DAS). Each pot holding five plants cultivated under circumstances similar to those of nursery pots. At the time of transplantation, a reliable basic dosage of N, P, and K was given to the soil. The 20 d old plants were uprooted and plunged in 0, 0.1 mM H2O2 for 4 h prior to transplantation (shotgun approach). After thinning, three plants were grown in each pot and the experiment was carried according to a fully sequential block layout and number of replicates for each treatment were five (n = 5). At 20 d after transplantation (DAT), plants were subjected to different concentrations of Cu (10 or 100 mg kg−1) implemented through the soil. At 30 DAT, plants were sprinkled with water or EBL solution. Plants were irrigated with tap water when necessary to maintain the uniform growth of the seedlings. At 40 DAT, plants were collected to evaluate different morpho-physiological attributes as well as biochemical parameters."
6,Photosynthetic traits,"2.5 Photosynthetic traits 2.5.1 Evaluation of SPAD value of chlorophyll and fluorescence i.e. maximum quantum yield of PSII The SPAD chlorophyll meter (SPAD- 502; Konica, Minolta sensing, Inc., Japan) was used to gauge SPAD value of chlorophyll in the fully grown leaves of the plants. The leaf chamber fluorometer (Li-COR 6400–40, Li-COR, and Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to evaluate chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm). All readings were carried out at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1500 μmol m−2 s−1 with a constant airflow rate of 500 μmol s−1. The minimum fluorescence level (F0) was calculated by calibrated light, that was minimal enough (<1 μmol m−2 s−1) not to generate any extensive differential fluorescence. Optimal fluorescence (Fm) was computed with a 0.8 s saturation level on dark-adapted leaves at 4200 μ mol m−2 s−1 (30 min). The leaf sample was darkly modified for 30 min prior to measurement of Fv/Fm. 2.5.2 Evaluation of leaf gas exchange parameters The third fully grown leaves were used to evaluate the gas exchange attributes using a portable infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) photosynthetic system (LI-COR 6400, LI-COR, and Lincoln, NE, USA) between 11:00 and 12:00 h. The air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were kept at 25 °C, 85%, 600 μmol mol−1 and 800 μmol mol−2 s−2 for the evaluation of net photosynthetic rate (PN) and its related parameters [stomatal conductance (gs) transpiration rate (E) and internal CO2 concentration (Ci)]. 2.5.3 Evaluation of electrolyte leakage (EL) and leaf water potential (LWP) The protocol proposed by Sullivan and Ross (1979) was the basis for the evaluation of EL. The electrolyte leakage was assessed using the equation: Electrolyte leakage ( % ) = [ ( EC b - EC a ) / ( EC c ) × 100 where, ECa is the initial conductance, ECb is the elevated temperature conductance, and ECc is the final conductance. Leaf water potential (LWP) was evaluated using Psypro water potential system (Wescor, Inc. USA)."
7,Growth biomarkers,"2.6 Growth biomarkers Plants were gently pulled out of the pots, rinsed to take away adhered soil. The plants were kept in a hot air furnace working at 80 °C until a steady mass was attained and then their dry mass was calculated. Leaf area meter (LA 211, Systronics, New Delhi, India) was used to gauge the leaf area."
8,Microscopic studies,"2.7 Microscopic studies 2.7.1 Transmission electron microscopy The preparation of leaf samples for chloroplast ultrastructure was carried out in accordance with the method specified by Sandalio et al. (2001) with some minor changes. Initially, leaves were cut into 1 × 1 mm sections with sharp knife and mounted with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, these segments were post-mounted in 1% osmium tetroxide in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30 min accompanied by repeated washing with a simplified series of ethanol (30–100%, v/v) for about 15–20 min at each stage. Ultraportable portions obtained by Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome coated with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were examined under transmission electron microscope (ZEOL 2100F, USA) with a differential voltage of 120KV and a magnification of 6000 ×. The chloroplast ultra-structure (thylakoid membranes) was studied from TEM visualizations. 2.7.2 Compound microscopy for analysis of stomatal width aperture The protocol of Wang et al. (2011) was followed to evaluate the stomatal width aperture by compound microscopy with slight changes. Five leaf samples were taken from each treatment and dipped in 10% NaOH solution for 4 h for easy leaf peeling. Lower surface leaf peels were chosen and then affixed on glass slide, and examined under a compound microscope equipped with NIKON digital camera at a power of 40 ×. Micrometer scale was used to gauge the stomatal width aperture for each treatment. 2.7.3 Electron microscopy 2.7.3.1 Scanning electron microscopy Stomatal behavior and surface root morphology were studied by scanning electron microscopy as outlined by Daud et al. (2009) with little modifications. In desiccators, leaf and root tissues were subsequently air dried and then split into 2 × 2 mm segments. These segments were initially placed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing an equal amount of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde for more than 4 h, accompanied by washing in phosphate buffer for 15 min. After that, post fixation of the samples with 1% osmium oxide in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was undertaken for 1 h and then washed repeatedly with the same phosphate buffer for 15 min. Afterwards, samples were rinsed with standard ethanol (50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%) series for about 15–20 min. The dehydrated specimen was wrapped up by gold-palladium and observed under the splatter coater tool (JEOL JFC-1600) at relatively high oscillation or voltage capacity. Stomatal shots were captured at a voltage of 15 KV and a magnification of 4000 × and root images were taken at a voltage of 15 KV and a magnification of 2000 × 2.7.3.2 Confocal electron microscopy 2.7.3.2.1 Cell viability The roots were washed constantly and then sliced with the help of a razor and placed in a 25 mM propidium iodide dye for a time span of 30–35 min. These cut thin tips of the root were placed on the glass plate and viewed under a confocal microscope. 2.7.3.2.2 Localization of H2O2 in the roots Root tissues of 1–2 cm in length were plunged into the 12.5 μM 2, 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) in a petridish for 15 min accompanied by washing at least thrice using double distilled water. Stained samples were put on a glass slide and examined under a confocal microscope using 488 nm excitation and 525 nm emission spectra (Zhang et al., 2001)."
9,Biochemical biomarkers,"2.8 Biochemical biomarkers 2.8.1 Assay for carbonic anhydrase (CA) The CA activity in the leaves was assessed in accordance with the method described by Dwivedi and Randhawa (1974). The leaf tissues were divided into small fragments and then placed in the test tubes comprising 10 mL of 0.2 M cysteine hydrochloride solution which were maintained at 4 °C for 20 min and subsequently filtered. The filtrate was relocated into a separate beaker having 4 mL phosphate buffer of pH 6.8. To this, 4 mL of 0.2 M NaHCO3 (pH 6.8), 0.2 mL of 0.002% bromothymol blue, and the methyl red indicator, at the last was appended. 0.05 N HCl was employed as a titrating solvent for the reaction to occur. Enzyme activity was reflected on per gram fresh mass (FM) basis. 2.8.2 Assay for metal content in shoot and root Shoot and root samples were rinsed under flowing tap water and dried in the incubator for 48 h at 80 °C for the assessment of the metal content. The dried sample was weighed, squashed into fine powder with a motor and pestle, and then mingled with concentrated HNO3/HClO4 (3:1, v: v). The content of Cu was assessed by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GBC, 932 plus; GBC Scientific Instruments, Braeside, Australia), and computed as μg g−1 dry mass (DM). 2.8.3 Oxidative stress markers 2.8.3.1 Assay for hydrogen peroxide content The H2O2 content in leaves was estimated by the method as proposed by Patterson et al. (1984). Leaf tissues (0.5 g) were homogenized in 10 mL cold acetone using mortar and pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000×g for 15 min and the supernatant was kept. Residue was again extracted with acetone. 1 mL of the supernatant was taken in the test tube and 2 mL of 17 M ammonia and 2 mL of 20% titanium chloride (prepared in conc. HCl) were added. The supernatant was again extracted with acetone, accompanied by an infusion of 10 mL 2 N H2SO4 to absorb it properly. The reaction mixture was again centrifuged to remove the undissolved inputs. The optical density was measured at 410 nm on a spectrophotometer against blank. Content of H2O2 in the plant samples was assessed in relation to the standard curve adopted from the known concentration of H2O2 and was formulated as μ mole g−1 FM. 2.8.3.2 Assay for superoxide anion production rate Superoxide anion (O2•–) content was assayed by the method as outlined by Wu et al. (2010). Leaves (0.5 g) were ground in 65 mM phosphate buffer comprising of 1% PVP. The contents were centrifuged for 15 min at 5000×g. The reaction was triggered by putting 1 mL of supernatant to the beaker containing 65 mM of phosphate buffer and 10 mM of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and subsequently incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. To this, 7 mM of 1-napthylamine and 58 mM of metanilic acid were appended and incubations were again undertaken for 20 min at 25 °C, after which the absorbance were measured at 530 nm. Generation of superoxide anion in the plant samples was assessed in relation to the standard curve adopted from the known concentration of O2•– and was formulated as μ mole g−1 FM. 2.8.3.3 Histochemical staining method Localization of O2•– and H2O2 radicals in leaves by nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed by the protocol of Wang et al. (2011) with minor modifications. The leaf samples (2 leaves) from each treatment were immersed in NBT (1 mg mL−1) solution dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and in DAB (1 mg mL−1) solution dissolved in double distilled water (pH 3.8) under darkness at ambient temperature for a time span of 6 h. Blue (NBT staining) or brown (DAB staining) spots developed and these stained leaf tissues were immersed in pure alcohol and then boiled at 100 °C until the whole chlorophyll was removed. After that, leaves were kept aside to cool down and then transferred to 20% glycerol. Photographs were captured with the NIKON digital camera (COOLPIX110). 2.8.4 Assay for total protein content and antioxidant enzymes Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were homogenized with chilled motar and pestle in an ice cold extraction buffer comprising 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylflouride (PMSF), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2% (w/v) polyvinyl pyrollidone (PVP). The homogenate mixture was transferred to micro centrifuge tubes and spun at 12,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was used for the determination of antioxidant enzymes and proteins. 2.8.4.1 Total protein content Total protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (1976). A 200 μL supernatant was pipette out of the mixture in the test tube and 4 mL of Bradford reagent was added to the test tube and was shaken gently and immensely. Incubation of the samples was carried out at 25 °C for 5–10 min and then the optical density was measured on spectrophotometer at 595 nm. The amount of total protein was estimated from standard curve obtained from the absorbance plotted against known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the protein content was estimated as mg g−1 FM. 2.8.4.2 Antioxidant enzyme activity The activity of catalase (CAT) in leaves was estimated adopting the protocol of Aebi (1984) to evaluate the disappearance of H2O2 during the initiation of the reaction. The reaction mixture was made up by 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH7.0), 15 mM H2O2 and 100 μL of enzyme extract. The optical density of the mixture was read at 240 nm for 2 min with a time span of 30 s each at 25 °C. The control set comprised of all the above reagents except the enzyme extract. The method of Sanchez et al. (1995) was followed for the assay of peroxidase activity (POX) with minor changes. The reaction mixture for sample was prepared by 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 mM guaiacol, 1.5 mM H2O2 and 100 μL enzyme extract. The activity was determined on a spectrophotometer at 436 nm for 1 min at 25 °C. Test tube which contained all the above solutions except the enzyme extract served as control. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was estimated by the protocol of Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971) by determining its capability to supress the photochemical reduction of nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT). The 40 μL enzyme extract was suspended in a reaction mixture prepared from 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 9.9 mM L-methionine, 55 μM NBT, 2 mM EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100 and 1 mM riboflavin which was added at last in the reaction mixture. Control set was prepared in the same manner. The absorbance was recorded at 560 nm for 2 min at 25 °C. One unit of SOD activity was computed as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit NBT by 50% at 25 °C. 2.8.5 Assay for proline content The procedure of Bates et al. (1973) was followed for the assay of proline content. 0.5 g fresh leaf samples were ground with 5 mL of 3% sulphosalicylic acid using motor and pestle. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 mL each of glacial acetic acid and acid ninhydrin to the homogenized mixture. Incubation was carried out in a water bath at 100 °C for 1 h, after which the processes was finalized by transferring the test tubes to the ice bath. 4 mL of toluene was poured into the mixture, accompanied by an immediate stirring. The toluene layer (upper) squeezed and warmed to ambient temperature. The optical density was determined on a spectrophotometer at 528 nm. The proline content was measured on fresh mass basis of the sample."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis Data were statistically evaluated and standard errors (±) were computed (n = 5). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using SPSS (ver. 17 for windows, IBM Corporation, 1 New 171 Orchard Road, Armonk, New York 10,504–1722, United States 914- 499–1900) to assess the least significance difference (LSD) at the 5% level of probability. Least significant difference (LSD) was used for the data to evaluate the difference in the mean of the treatment. Results are shown as mean ± SE (n = 5)."
11,Results,
12,Photosynthetic traits,"3.1 Photosynthetic traits 3.1.1 Chlorophyll content (SPAD values) and maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) The plants arising from Cu (100 mg kg−1) stress exhibited lower values for SPAD chlorophyll and Fv/Fm. The decrease in SPAD and Fv/Fm was 30.32% and 29.0%, less to the controls respectively (Fig. 1 A, B). However, the plants treated with EBL (10−8) and H2O2 (0.1 mM) had significantly more increase in SPAD and Fv/Fm, but the cumulative treatment of EBL and H2O2 was very prominent than their individual treatment. Moreover, the maximum increase in SPAD value of chlorophyll by 50.41% and Fv/Fm by 41.45% was noted in plants which received the blend treatment of EBL and H2O2 together with 10 mg Cu kg−1 soil, compared to the control. However, the toxicity triggered by higher concentration of Cu (100 mg kg−1) was totally negated by the blend treatment of EBL and H2O2. 3.1.2 Net photosynthetic rate and related traits Plants grown with 100 mg Cu kg−1 soil showed substantial decrease in net photosynthetic rate (PN) and associated traits (internal carbon dioxide concentration, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate) in comparison to water sprayed control plants (Fig. 1C-F). Supplementation of EBL and H2O2 alone or in combination improved all the photosynthetic attributes in the absence of Cu, while the cumulative application of H2O2 plus EBL along with lower concentration of Cu (10 mg kg−1soil) proved best and more prominently increased PN by 46.82%; gs by 45.97%; Ci by 47.04% and E by 47.92% over the respective control, at 40 DAT. Moreover, the detrimental impacts induced by surplus Cu (100 mg kg−1) were totally negated in the plants which were given the blend treatment of EBL and H2O2. 3.1.3 Electrolyte leakage The plants given Cu (100 mg kg−1) had considerably increased EL by 28.70% in comparison to their control plants (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of H2O2 and EBL individually or in blend to non-stressed plants decreased EL, while combined treatment of H2O2 and EBL also significantly decreased compared to the Cu (10 or 100 mg kg−1) treated plants. However, the blend application of H2O2+ EBL to Cu (100 mg kg−1) stressed plants proved most effective and decreased EL, as compared to the Cu treated plants. 3.1.4 Leaf water potential Copper stress severely affected LWP in comparison to the non-stressed plants (control). The plants which received H2O2 and/or EBL had higher LWP as compared to control in the absence/presence of Cu, but combined treatment of H2O2 and EBL proved more effective and increased the LWP by 11.12% as compared to control (Fig. 2B). However, the detrimental impact induced by Cu-stress on LWP was completely ameliorated by the combined treatment of H2O2 as compared to the control."
13,Growth traits,"3.2 Growth traits 3.2.1 Shoot and root dry mass Growth characteristics were also altered by different treatments (Fig. 2. C, D). Plants grown with surplus Cu (100 mg kg−1) led to significant reduction in shoot and root dry mass by 33.34% and 29.63%, respectively relative to the controls. Exogenously-applied H2O2 and EBL individually or in blend significantly improved the above traits, but the maximum improvement was observed by the combined application of EBL plus H2O2 together with 10 mg Cu kg−1 soil and increased the respective dry masses by 42.92% and 37.87%, over control plants. Follow up application of EBL plus H2O2 to Cu-stressed plants completely nullified the negative impacts triggered by the higher concentration of Cu. 3.2.2 Leaf area Copper treatment (100 mg kg−1) decreased leaf area by 34.48% compared to the control plants (Fig. 2E). Foliar spray of EBL and root dipping of H2O2 individually or in combination to plants grown without metal stress increased the leaf area, but the blend application of EBL and H2O2 along with 10 mg Cu kg−1 soil proved best and considerably improved the leaf area by 44.87% respectively, in comparison to water sprayed plant (control) at 40 DAT. The subsequent combined treatment of EBL and H2O2 to metal (100 mg Cu kg−1) treated plants completely overcame the negative impacts of metal on the leaf area."
14,Microscopic studies,"3.3 Microscopic studies 3.3.1 Transmission electron microscopy The detailed ultrastructure changes in chloroplasts by transmission electron microscopy were demonstrated in Fig. (3.1 A-F) . Relative to control, the chloroplasts of Cu-stressed plants were swollen and separated from the plasma membrane and almost all of the stroma lamellae were completely disintegrated and their structures practically disappeared. However, the root dipping treatment of H2O2 and foliar application of EBL to non-stressed plants greatly modified the chloroplast ultrastructure with intact mesophyll cells and integrated chloroplasts having compactly arranged thylakoids as well as well-compartmentalized grana stacks were observed. More prominent and well organized membrane system in chloroplast structure was noted in the plants which were given blend treatment of H2O2 and EBL than their respective controls at 40 DAT (Fig. 3. D)."
15,Compound microscopy for assessment of stomatal width aperture,"3.4 Compound microscopy for assessment of stomatal width aperture The stomatal behavior was assessed with compound microscopy. Under normal conditions, stomata were of proper shape with open stomatal pore and well-arranged guard cells. Stomata from Cu-treated plants exhibited disrupted guard cells and closed stomatal pore in comparison to their control at 40 DAT (Fig. 3.3E). However, exposure of plants to EBL (foliar spray) and H2O2 (root dipping) in the absence or presence of Cu significantly modified the structure of stomata having increased stomatal pore width, but the combined treatment of EBL and H2O2 was more relevant and expanded the stomatal pore compared to control plants (Fig. 3.3. B, C, D and F). 3.4.1 Electron microscopy 3.4.1.1 Scanning electron microscopy 3.4.1.1.1 Stomatal studies The observations of compound microscopy were further modified by SEM analysis (Fig. 3.4). Scanning electron microscopy corroborated the findings generated through the compound microscopy for different treatments. 3.4.1.1.2 Root surface morphology Treatment of plant with Cu (100 mg kg −1) resulted in disfigured root surface morphology as compared to the controls, at 40 DAT (Fig. 3.2F). Application of H2O2 (0.1 mM) and EBL (10−8 M) alone or in blend improved root morphology, however, the blend treatment of H2O2 plus EBL to the plants under non-stress conditions proved more effective and improved root surface morphology relative to the control plants (Fig. 3.2 A-E). 3.4.1.2 Confocal electron microscopy 3.4.1.2.1 Cell viability The results from Fig. 4.1 showed that the plants supplied with EBL (10−8 M) and H2O2 (0.1 mM) had improved cell viability as indicated by lesser red fluorescent spots. Combined treatment of EBL and H2O2 induced maximum increase in number of viable cells than the control plants. Moreover, the plants exposed to soil applied Cu (100 mg kg−1) had decreased cell viability as more prominent red stains were found in these cells compared with the control plants. The follow-up combined treatment of EBL + H2O2 to metal treated plants completely nullified the metal-inflicted loss in cell viability in comparison to their controls. 3.4.1.2.2 Localization of H2O2 in the roots In tomato roots, reactive oxidative radicals such as H2O2 were localised by using DCF-DA dye (Fig. 4.2). The plants supplied with Cu (100 mg kg−1) had maximum green fluorescence indicating the presence of H2O2 radical compared with the control plants. Exogenously-sourced H2O2 as root dipping and EBL as foliar spray individually or in blend significantly lowered H2O2 radicals as evident by minimum green fluorescence, but more effectively in plant roots supplied with blend application of EBL and H2O2 at 40 DAT, over their corresponding control plants. The oxidative burst generated by the surplus Cu (100 mg kg−1) was totally nullified by the combined application of EBL and H2O2."
16,Biochemical parameters,"3.5 Biochemical parameters 3.5.1 Carbonic anhydrase activity Activity of CA was considerably decreased in plants grown under Cu (100 mg kg−1 soil) stress (30.95% less from the control) (Fig. 5 A). Exogenously-applied H2O2 (root dipping) and EBL (foliar spray) individually or in blend to plants without metal treatment enhanced CA activity, but the combined effect of H2O2 and EBL together with 10 mg Cu kg−1 soil generated more favorable impact and enhanced CA activity by 48.10% compared to the control (Fig. 5A). In plants treated with higher concentration of Cu, combined supplementation of H2O2 and EBL had reversed the metal-inflicted effects and increased the CA activity to about 15% in Cu-treated plants compared to the control. 3.5.2 Content of Cu in shoot and root The increase in metal content in shoot and root was observed in plants treated with both concentrations (10 or 100 mg kg−1) of Cu, but the maximum accumulation was noted with 100 mg Cu kg−1 soil and the values were 0.160 μg−1 DW (shoot content) and 1.944 μg−1 DW (root content). Supplementation of EBL and H2O2 alone or in combination to stressed and non-stressed plants reduced the metal content, and a significant reduction was found with the cumulative dose of EBL and H2O2 in comparison to the control (Fig. 5C, D). 3.5.3 Total protein content The combined treatment of H2O2 and EBL together with lower concentration of Cu (10 mg kg−1) significantly increased the protein content by 47.68% compared to the control. Besides this, the plants grown under higher concentration of Cu (100 mg kg−1) showed significant reduction in the protein content and this loss was fully recovered by the combined application of EBL plus H2O2 to metal treated plants (Fig. 5B). 3.5.4 Oxidative stress markers 3.5.4.1 Hydrogen peroxide content and superoxide anion production rate Treatment of H2O2 and/or EBL alone or in combination led to reduction of H2O2 (Fig. 6.1G) and O2•– anion production rate (Fig. 6.2G), but the combined treatment of H2O2 and EBL was found most effective and significantly reduced the H2O2 by 41.34% and O2•– anion by 32.72%, in comparison to control. Cu (100 mg kg−1) exposed plants had increased generation of H2O2 by 84.35% and O2•– anion by 60.0%, over the control. In addition, the subsequent application of metal treated plants with H2O2 and/or EBL decreased the contents of H2O2 and O2•– in comparison to control plants (Fig. 6.1G and 6.2G). 3.5.4.2 Histochemical localization of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical Brown and blue spots in the leaves by DAB and NBT were used for the histochemical localization of H2O2 (Fig. 6.1 A-F) and O2•– anion radicals (6.2. A-F) in the leaves. The plants supplied with Cu (100 mg kg−1) had more O2•–and H2O2 radicals as stained marks were more apparent in metal-treated leaf samples than that of the control. However, the plants supplied with EBL and/or H2O2 had lesser number of stained spots in the leaf tissues, thus indicating the lower levels of H2O2 and O2•–anion radicals, but the combined treatment of EBL and H2O2 proved most effectual than their individual treatments. 3.5.5 Activities of antioxidant enzymes The plants grown in soil treated with H2O2 (0.1 mM; root dipping) and EBL (10−8 M; foliar spray) and/or different concentrations of Cu (10 or 100 mg kg−1) exhibited significant values for CAT, POX and SOD, over to the controls, respectively (Fig. 7. A, B and C). However, the blend treatment of H2O2+ EBL along with 100 mg kg−1 of Cu induced optimal increase of CAT, POX and SOD which were 82.07%, 88.18% and 80%, more than the control. 3.5.6 Proline content Plants treated with metal (10 or 100 mg kg−1), H2O2 and/or EBL exhibited significant accumulation of proline over their respective control (Fig. 7D). The lower concentration of Cu (10 mg kg−1) did not generate any significant change in proline content. However, the maximum content (81.26% more from the control) of proline was reported in plants which were treated with H2O2+ EBL together with Cu (100 mg kg−1)."
17,Discussion,"Agricultural soil pollution by excess Cu has become a major menace to the efficient crop production and hampers the uptake of essential mineral nutrients, homeostatic balance and growth of crop plants (Mwamba et al., 2016). Brassinosteroid and minute concentration of hydrogen peroxide as a signaling molecule could modify growth and development of plants by improving stomatal movement, root morphology, photosynthetic efficacy and antioxidant production, thereby, alleviated Cu stress and improved the plants tolerance (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). It was observed from this study that Cu stress adversely affected chlorophyll content, gas exchange attributes, leaf water potential and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and resulted in the reduced net photosynthetic rate (Fig. 1A). The impact could be due to restricted blockage of electron transport from PSII to PSI which further damage antenna pigments, and also retarded chlorophyll synthesis, reduced activity of enzymes of Calvin cycle, destruction of mesophyll tissue, reduced number and size of stomata in leaves as well as reduced availability of CO2 prompted by the diminished feasibility of photosynthetic enzymes (Bhardwaj et al., 2016; Akhtar et al., 2018; Nazir et al., 2019b). Decreased efficacy of carboxylation and activity of the main enzymes of Calvin cycle leading to reduced activity of CA activity is also reported, which might be caused by the disabling of the Rubisco enzyme. It is proposed that EBL and/or H2O2 application to Cu stressed plants enhanced SPAD values which could have improved photosynthesis. Increased SPAD values of chlorophyll by BRs might be because of the activation of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes (Fariduddin et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2016; Kohli et al., 2018; Siddiqui et al., 2018). BR mediated increased activity of enzymes like Rubisco and CA, which could be due to improved CO2-assimilation rate controlled by particular genes implicated in the process, is also the obvious reason triggered through EBL and improved photosynthesis under Cu or Ni-stress (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). Additionally, impairment of photosynthesis by Cu stress was further improved by application of H2O2 due to accelerated cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI which might be necessary for the maintenance of the catalytic activity of the CO2- assimilated enzymes, such as Rubisco activase and Fru-1, 6-bisphosphatase because of reduction of plastoquinone by NADPH (Guo et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2019). The ultrastructure of chloroplast was impaired at a higher level of Cu, and showed distortions or changes in mesophyll cells and even the appearance of spherical chloroplasts with disorganized thylakoid membranes (Fig. 3.1). These ultrastructural modifications could be due to a reduction in the cellular metabolism culpable for plant growth (Minkini et al., 2019). Conversely, treatment of EBL and/or H2O2 individually or in combination decreased ROS levels and improved chlorophyll content in plants and all this could have protected ultrastructure of chloroplast. Thus, EBL and H2O2 treated plants had highly complex chloroplast with highly organized thylakoid membrane (Fig. 3.1). In our present study, higher dose of Cu resulted in substantial closure of stomata by triggering sequential changes in guard cells (Figs. 3.3 and 3.4). Nevertheless, supplementation of EBL and H2O2 triggered opening of stomata which were partially or totally closed in Cu-stressed plants. Application of EBL and H2O2 in Solanum lycopersicum improved the stomatal conductance and their combined effect induces osmotic changes that attenuate the stomatal opening (Nazir et al., 20019a, b). Furthermore, Xia et al. (2014) further strengthened the positive correlation between EBL-driven stomatal changes in tomato plants, with redox stability in guard cells and vibrant adjustments in H2O2, indicate that H2O2 at its low concentration acts as a signaling molecule that contributes to stomatal opening, while at its higher concentration it triggers closure of stomata. In the present study, the surplus Cu (100 mg kg−1) resulted in altered root morphology (Fig. 3.2) as well as a decrease in all growth attributes which were manifested in the form of reduced dry mass of root and shoot and also the leaf area (Fig. 2. C, D and E). Nevertheless, the follow up treatment of H2O2 and EBL either alone or in blend strengthened the root surface morphology and growth parameters (dry mass of root and shoot and leaf area) of plants grown with non-stress and under Cu stress. H2O2 caused the stimulation of brassinosteroid signal processing through activation of a specific receptor (BZR1) which may elicit the modulation of root dynamics by BR and redox stimuli, which are considerable for prominent growth of plants (Tian et al., 2018). Combined application of EBL and H2O2 had a significant influence on root morphology and growth characteristics of tomato plants under Cu stress mainly due to synergistic or additive effects. Application of H2O2 and EBL decreased Cu accumulation in the roots and shoots of tomato plants subjected to Cu stress (Fig. 5. C, D), which were revealed recently by Nazir et al. (2019a, 2019b). H2O2 hinders the absorption and translocation of Cu from roots to shoots due to deposition of precipitates at the root surface, resulting in a reduction in the transport of Cu from root to xylem and an improvement in the uptake of Ca, thus impeding uptake of Cu due to competition (González et al., 2015). In addition, EBL improves the absorption of K+, Ca2+, Fe2+and Mg2+ in the roots and shoots, and these mineral ions are preferably translocated to younger leaves through xylem and phloem tissues to minimize oxidative damage (Jan et al., 2018). Our current study unveiled a remarkable increase in the production of H2O2, O2•– (Fig. 6 ) and leakage of ions (Fig. 2A) in tomato plants subjected to Cu stress, relative to their control plants. This increase might be because of the Cu prompted free radical production, which results in the membrane destabilization and thus increase its permeability (Takagi et al., 2016; Nazir et al., 2019b). These observations were further verified by histological and confocal microscopic studies which revealed significant change in H2O2 and O2•– radicals in root cells and leaves of Cu stressed plants. H2O2 maintain the normal pool of osmolytes and water content inside cells, which decreases the generation of free radicals as has been noticed in maize and tomato plants exposed to Cu stress (Guzel and Terzi, 2013; Nazir et al., 2019b). In Cu-stressed tomato plants, application of EBL led to reduced rate of O2·− and H2O2 production and decreased the electrolyte leakage by reducing the overall ROS production and thus protected photosynthetic machinery (Nazir et al., 2019b). Generation of ROS due to Cu stress also results in a loss of cell viability in the roots (Fig. 4.1) of tomato plants subjected to Cu stress, resulting in tissue damage as illustrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In our present study, plants exposed to higher concentration of Cu stress displayed a maximum number of dead cells as specified by the maximum red fluorescence of propidium iodide (PI) in roots of tomato. Another method used to pinpoint intracellular oxidative damage (Fig. 4.2) in tomato root tissues was with the assistance of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFD) which provide green fluroscence spots (Tyburski et al., 2009) indicating oxidative burst. Moreover, the exogenously-sourced of EBL and H2O2 alone or in blend resulted in a minimum intensity of red and green fluorescence (Fig. 4.1 and 4.2), indicating less or almost no tissue damage. Our observations are aligned with the results of Sirhindi et al. (2017) and Hussain et al. (2019a) who showed minimum intensity of red and green fluorescence in mustard root tissues supplied with HBL and EBL. The antioxidant system is an essential protagonist in the amendment of ROS generated oxidative stress (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). Treatment with EBL and H2O2 enhanced antioxidant enzymes in untreated and Cu-treated tomato plants (Fig. 7A, B and C). EBL-mediated higher activities of antioxidant enzymes were mainly due to activation of gene expression of SOD, APX, and CAT (Sharma et al., 2016). Combined application of EBL + H2O2 efficaciously increased CAT, POX and SOD activities than the individual treatments in tomato plants under HM stress (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b). Proline is deemed to be principal strategy under HM stress. In Cu-fed tomato plants, proline content increased substantially when treated with H2O2, EBL or both (Fig. 7D). Combined application of H2O2 + EBL improved acquisition of osmolyte in Cu-treated plants due to the potentiality cumulative impact on the activation of proline biosynthetic genes and stimulation of proteins related to water relations (Nazir et al., 2019b). As a result, the increase in proline content in both treated and non-treated plants with the supplementation of H2O2 and EBL was apparent and could increase the osmotic potential, resulting in increased water uptake fundamentally influenced photosynthetic machinery in metal stressed plants (Nazir et al., 2019a, 2019b)."
18,Conclusion,"It was revealed that morpho-physiological and biochemical attributes of tomato under Cu stress were maintained by BRs and H2O2. Cu stress triggered oxidative damage in the Solanum lycopersicum plants due to the accumulation of higher ROS levels and enhanced metal concentration resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency, affected stomatal behavior, root morphology, cell viability, chloroplast ultrastructure, and growth, but accelerated the activity of antioxidant enzymes, proline content and electrolyte leakage in the leaves. The supplementation of EBL (through foliage) and H2O2 (root dipping) alone or in combination significantly improved the photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal movement, root morphology, cell viability, chloroplast ultrastructure, and ultimately growth under Cu stress and stress-free circumstances, by modulating the activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes, mainly catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and increased accumulation of proline (osmolyte). The up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, and proline by the combined application of EBL and H2O2, had retained the resilience ability to surplus Cu in Solanum lycopersicum plants. The increased resilience of tomato plants towards Cu stress triggered by EBL and H2O2 could also be ascribed because of their capability to affect the uptake of excess Cu, minimize Cu-induced oxidative damage as evident from the reduced ROS contents (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals) and electrolyte leakage in Cu stressed plants. EBL and H2O2 could be implicated in the management of photosynthesis and growth of plants under Cu stress."
