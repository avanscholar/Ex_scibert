0,Introduction,"Energy generation has long been known to be a major environmental issue [1], particularly because the processes used to convert a raw material into energy are mostly based on fossil fuels. The growing awareness of the society concerning these issues, especially the emission of greenhouse gases, has given rise to significant efforts in developing new clean technologies with a sustainable profile. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are an alternative for clean power generation. Several features may be pointed out favoring the use of such devices, such as their high power density; moderate temperature operation; production of little or no pollutants and use of hydrogen as a fuel. As a matter of fact, hydrogen comes out as a promising carbon-free energy carrier, which may be produced from biomass and its derived liquids. As a consequence, it does not contribute to CO2 emissions due to the well-known carbon cycle. Amongst such a wide variety of possible renewable feedstocks, using ethanol for hydrogen generation is rather attractive as it is non-toxic, easy to handle and allows a sustainable development as it can be produced from different crops. Moreover, it is already used as fuel in some countries and it is thus conceivable to have decentralized production facilities. In order to ensure long and efficient use of hydrogen-fueled PEM fuel cell, highly pure hydrogen must be delivered as the cell electrodes are poisoned by even small amounts of CO [2]. Hence, the economical viability of the use of fuel cell energy generation depends on the development of an efficient fuel processor system. Integrated reaction units have been widely used to accomplish such a goal even though different approaches have been proposed for each process step; basically fuel reforming and CO clean-up [3]. Steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR) can be pointed out as some processes for hydrogen production from hydrocarbons and alcohols. Steam reforming of ethanol has been proposed and it is generally claimed as the most effective process. However, this route presents some disadvantages such as the formation of by-products and strong catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, it is a highly endothermic reaction, which would thus demand an extra thermal energy. Partial oxidation systems, on the other hand, have fast start up and response time, which make them attractive for following rapidly varying loads. Moreover, the POX reactor is more compact than a steam reformer, since it does not need the indirect addition of heat via a heat exchanger. As regarding CO removal, water–gas shift reaction (WGS), for preliminary purification with additional hydrogen generation, followed by preferential oxidation (PROX), pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or methanation is among the possible technologies [4]. The water–gas shift reaction is well established in conventional large steady-state operations, such as ammonia plants, but it has found new purpose and challenges to fit the requirements for energy power generation through fuel cells [2,5]. More active catalysts are necessary as large volumes of shift reactors are usually required, being responsible for about 50% of the volume of the whole fuel processor [5]. Furthermore, the tendency of some catalysts to methanate both CO and CO2 must also be considered as well as the catalyst lifetime under the actual reformer outlet composition. Development of suitable catalysts for each of these reactions is one of the technical barriers to be overcome for cost-effective fuel processing, especially in small fuel cell systems. This contribution reports the performance of catalysts used to provide fuel cell grade hydrogen from ethanol in a combined system. Attention was focused on the activity of two CeO2-supported catalysts on both partial oxidation of ethanol and water–gas shift reaction. Whereas Rh-based system was used to generate hydrogen from ethanol partial oxidation, a vanadium-modified Pt/CeO2 catalyst was investigated for WGS. Considering the current mechanistic proposals for this reaction [6,7], the formulation of such WGS catalyst was motivated by the well-known redox-active properties of dispersed vanadium oxides."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation 2.1.1 Partial oxidation (POX) catalysts CeO2 support was prepared by the decomposition of cerium (IV) ammonium nitrate (Aldrich) at 1073K for 1h in a muffle. Rhodium (1.0wt.%) was added to CeO2 by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution containing RhCl3·H2O. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 393K and calcined under air (50cm3/min) at 673K, for 2h. 2.1.2 Water–gas shift (WGS) catalysts For these systems a CeO2 support was prepared by a different method described elsewhere [8]. Briefly, it was synthesized by precipitation from an aqueous solution of cerium (IV) ammonium nitrate (Aldrich) with NH4OH. The gel was calcined at 773K for 1h originating the sample labeled CeO2 ppt hereinafter. A modified support was prepared by wet impregnation with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 (Merck) and oxalic acid (Merck), with a 2:1 molar ratio, in which the concentration was calculated to result in the formation of a V2O5 monolayer. This solution was added to ceria and the resulting suspension was kept under agitation in a rotary evaporator for 4h at room temperature. Afterwards, water was slowly removed at 335K under vacuum. This solid was dried at 393K and calcined at 773K for 2h (V–CeO2) in air. The 1.0wt.% Pt catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a H2PtCl6 (Merck) solution. These shift catalysts were submitted to a final calcination step in air at 773K for 2h."
3,Standard characterization,"2.2 Standard characterization Chemical analyses were obtained in a Bruker S-4 Explorer X-ray fluorescence equipment with a rhodium tube. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in a Philips X’Pert powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406Å), operating at 30kV and 40mA. Analyses were carried out with a 0.05°/step and 2s/step over a 2θ range within 20–80°. Scherrer equation was used to estimate the crystallite mean diameter based on the (111) CeO2 plane. Specific area measurements were obtained at 77K in a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 equipment. The samples were pre-treated under vacuum at 423K."
4,Laser Raman spectrometry (LSR),"2.3 Laser Raman spectrometry (LSR) The supports used to prepare the shift catalysts were analyzed on a Nicolet 950 FT-Raman spectrometer. The experimental data were obtained with a resolution of 4cm−1, a frequency laser of 9793.64cm−1 using an InGaAs detector, collection length of 629.95s, apodization Happ-Genzel, CaF2 beam splitter, mirror velocity of 0.3165cm/s, aperture at 150, 120 scans at sample gain of 8. The Raman spectra were collected from sample wafers under ambient conditions."
5,Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS),"2.4 Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) DRIFTS analyses were used for monitoring ethanol partial oxidation. The experiments were carried out in a Nicolet Magna 560 spectrometer, equipped with a high temperature chamber fitted with ZnSe windows (SpectraTech), which was used as reforming reactor for in situ reaction measurements. Spectra were taken at resolution of 4cm−1 and 256 scans to improve the signal to noise ratio. Before the analysis, the sample was reduced with H2 at 773K, for 2h. It was then cooled down to room temperature under helium and the reference spectra were collected. The reactants were fed to the cell by bubbling air through a saturator containing ethanol at 319K, in order to obtain the desired ethanol/O2 ratio (2:1). The spectra were collected at different temperatures."
6,Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR),"2.5 Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) was carried out in a microreactor coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS422, Balzers). Before TPSR analysis, the sample was reduced under H2 at 773K for 1h. After reduction, the system was purged with helium at 773K for 30min and cooled to room temperature. Ethanol was adsorbed at room temperature until the surface was saturated. After adsorption, the sample was purged with a 5% O2/He mixture (60cm3/min) and the temperature was raised at a 20K/min rate to 823K."
7,Catalytic evaluation,"2.6 Catalytic evaluation Prior to reaction, both POX and WGS catalysts were submitted to in situ reduction step at 773 and 623K, respectively, for 1h under pure hydrogen flow (30cm3/min). Ethanol partial oxidation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. In order to avoid hot spot formation and temperature gradients, the sample (160mg) was diluted with SiC (catalyst/SiC ratio=1:3) to form a small catalyst bed (<5mm in height). The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured through a thermocouple inserted in a small cavity on the reactor wall. The reactants were fed to the reactor by bubbling air (30cm3/min) and N2 (30cm3/min) through a saturator containing ethanol at 313K, in order to obtain the desired ethanol/O2 molar ratio (2:1). The reaction was carried out at different temperatures and W/Q =0.16gs/cm3 (W =weight of catalyst; Q =volumetric flow rate). The exit gases were analyzed using a chromatograph (Micro GC Agilent 3000 A) containing two channels equipped with thermal conductivity detectors and two columns: a molecular sieve and a plot U. The water–gas shift reaction was performed as the first step of the H2-rich stream purification process (Scheme 1 ). It was conducted at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed tubular reactor attached to a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a packed column Supelco (HayeSep Q) associated with a molecular sieve. The reaction was conducted with different residence times depending on the type of experiment: (i) reaction rate calculation, which was determined under differential conditions, (ii) long term stability tests (W/Q =0.8gs/cm3), (iii) evaluation of the conversion as a function of reaction temperature. A synthetic reactant mixture was primarily composed by CO, H2, CO2 and CH4 (Linde) simulating the exact reformate composition from ethanol partial oxidation. In all experiments shift catalysts were also diluted with SiC (catalyst/SiC ratio=1:5) and the temperature of the catalyst bed was measured through a thermocouple inserted in a small cavity on the reactor wall."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization The metal loading obtained for all samples is summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that the actual noble metal and vanadium content in the prepared catalysts are close to the nominal values. The cerium oxide prepared by precipitation (CeO2 ppt) exhibited the highest surface area (Table 2 ), which is in agreement with previous published results [8] concerning the same preparation method. The drop in the surface area observed when vanadia was added to this oxide (V–CeO2) might be related to the additional calcination step. The value determined for the CeO2 powder prepared by nitrate decomposition was pretty low as a consequence of such a high calcination temperature (1073K). XRD patterns of the supports are presented in Fig. 1 . The peak broadening of cerium materials was used to estimate the mean CeO2 crystallite size by Scherrer equation, and these data are also shown in Table 2. It can be seen that it follows an opposite trend when compared to the surface area values; CeO2 support presented the highest crystallite size while a slight difference was determined for unmodified and V-modified CeO2 powder. All materials exhibited basal reflections corresponding to the fluorite type structure of CeO2. Peaks at 2θ =28.6; 33.1; 47.5 and 56.5° are related, respectively, to the planes (111), (200), (220) and (311). However, it can be noticed that the reflections intensities of CeO2 were higher than those observed for CeO2 ppt and V–CeO2, indicating that it is more crystalline than the others as could indeed be expected by applying high calcination temperature. Apart from the CeO2 reflection, the diffractogram of the V–CeO2 sample also presented quite small lines corresponding to a V2O5 phase. To rely no doubt on such oxide phase identification, this sample was then characterized by laser Raman spectroscopy as this technique is much more sensitive to the presence of V2O5 crystallites and can even identify different vanadium species depending on the nature of the support [9]. The Raman spectra of both CeO2 and the V-modified supports as well as those corresponding to V2O5 and CeVO4 standard samples are depicted in Fig. 2 . The intense absorption observed for the supports at around 461cm−1 is characteristic of a Fm-3m space group structure and it can thus be assigned to the CeO2 phase. As for the vanadium-modified support, some extra absorption bands may also be seen at 995, 284cm−1 along with a broad peak at around 700cm−1, which are typically ascribed to the presence of V–O–V active vibrations due to nanocrystalline V2O5 particles [10,11]. The later band might combine vibrations caused by the formation of CeVO4 as well; however, such phase may not be undoubtedly identified. It should be noted that no absorption band attributable to VO vibration in a highly distorted superficial VO4 [12], typical of dispersed VO x species, could be observed. The presence of these compounds may be responsible for the decrease in the CeO2ppt surface area after introducing vanadium as showed previously in Table 1."
10,Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy,"3.2 Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy The DRIFTS spectra obtained at different temperatures for reduced Rh/CeO2 catalyst are presented in Fig. 3 . The spectrum obtained at room temperature exhibits bands at 1045, 1082, 1269, 1403, 1452, 1638 and 2027cm−1. According to the literature [13–19], ethanol adsorbs on the surface of metal oxides by the scission of the OH bond, forming ethoxy species. In this work, the bands at 1045, 1082, 1403 and 1452cm−1 can be attributed to ethoxy species. The band at 1269cm−1 has been reported to ethanol molecularly adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of the oxide [19]. The assignment of the band at 1638cm−1 is controversial. Several authors have suggested that the acetyl species is an intermediate that takes part in the reaction mechanism of the oxygenated compounds decomposition on the metal surface [13,20–25]. These oxygenated compounds are produced by dehydrogenation of ethoxy species. According to the literature, the ν(CO) mode corresponding to acetyl species range from 1610cm−1 on Pd (110) [20] to 1684cm−1 on Pd/CeO2 catalyst [21]. The decarbonylation of ethanol also proceeds via acetyl intermediate on other Group VIII metals such as Pt (111) [22] and Ni (111) [24]; it has been seen that the ν(CO) band of acetyl species also varies as a function of metal nature. Zhao et al. [22] showed that the ν(CO) band of acetyl species was at 1647cm−1 on Pt (111). Furthermore, Shekhar et al. [20] reported that acetyl species on metal surfaces exhibit a high degree of back bonding and the CO stretching frequency is strongly dependent on the coordination number of surface metal atoms. Therefore, the band at 1638cm−1 could be probably associated to the ν(CO) vibrational mode of acetyl species. The band at 2027cm−1 has been attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on metal particles [16,26–28]. This result suggests that the ethanol decompose to CH4, H2 and CO even at room temperature [16]. By increasing the temperature, the disappearance of the bands related to ethoxy and acetyl species as well as those indicating the formation of acetate species (1336, 1550cm−1) may be observed. Considering the cerium oxide capacity of release/storage oxygen, it is conceivable that these species were formed by the reaction of the ethoxy species with the oxygen provided by the support [15,16,21]. Furthermore, raising the temperature led to an increase in the intensity of the bands corresponding to CO linearly adsorbed on metal particles (2084–2044cm−1), reaching a maximum at 673K. The bands associated to acetate species were still present at 773K. It is also worth mentioning that the presence of the bands corresponding to CO2 formation (2300–2400cm−1) was observed at temperatures higher than 573K. Concerning the band due to CO adsorption on metal surface, its intensity increased continuously as a function of temperature and is the highest at 673K. Sheng et al. [14] observed the same behavior on their IR studies of ethanol adsorbed on ceria supported Rh-based catalyst. TPD and IR studies of adsorbed ethanol have reported that the production of CO at low temperatures could be assigned to the decomposition of dehydrogenated species [15,16,29,30]. However, ethoxy species were no longer detected at high temperatures, indicating that CO formation stem from another pathway on Rh/CeO2 catalyst. Several authors [13,14] suggested that the ethanol reaction pathway is similar on Pt and Pd, but it is quite distinct on Rh. For Pt and Pd, adsorption of ethanol gives rise to ethoxy species, which are dehydrogenated, producing acetaldehyde. As for Rh-based catalysts, the ethoxy species lose one H atom from the terminal methyl group and then is adsorbed in a cyclic configuration (oxametallacycle intermediate) [13,14]. In this work, the bands corresponding to oxametallacycle intermediate that occur below 1000cm−1 could not be detected due to the poor resolution of the DRIFTS spectrum in this region. Moreover, the bands associated to the five-membered-ring oxametallacycle species above 1000cm−1 are similar to the bands related to ethoxy species and could not be distinguished. This intermediate is more stable on Rh than η 2(C,O) and η 1(O) configurations of acetaldehyde and it should be decomposed at higher temperature [13]. The decomposition of this oxametallacycle intermediate produces CO, CH x and C x , which are oxidized to CO2. This fact could explain the large CO and CO2 formation from 673K over Rh/CeO2 catalyst."
11,Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR),"3.3 Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) TPSR profiles for Rh/CeO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . Ethanol and acetaldehyde desorbed at around 361K. There was also the simultaneous formation of H2, CH4, CO and CO2, with a peak at 365K. Above 400K, only CO and CO2 were formed. The simultaneous appearance of CO, CH4, and H2 at the low-temperature region during TPD analysis of adsorbed ethanol has been attributed to the decomposition of ethoxy species [15,16,29,30]. The formation of CO, CO2, CH4 and H2 at high temperature on the TPD of adsorbed ethanol was associated to the decomposition of acetate species through carbonate formation. Recently, Mattos and Noronha [16] performed TPSR of ethanol on Pt/CeO2 catalyst. They also observed the decomposition of ethoxy species at low-temperature region. However, methane was also produced along with CO and CO2 at high temperature, which did not occur in this work. This result is likely due to the formation of the oxametallacycle intermediate on Rh/CeO2 catalyst, whose decomposition leads to the production of CO and CO2 only [13]."
12,Catalytic evaluation,"3.4 Catalytic evaluation Partial oxidation of ethanol was carried out in a wide range of temperatures (473–1073K) over Rh/CeO2 catalyst. The contribution from the homogeneous gas phase reaction was previously investigated by our group and was reported elsewhere [16]. Ethanol conversion (X ethanol) and the products distribution obtained are displayed in Fig. 5 . Complete ethanol conversion was found to be accomplished at temperatures as low as 673K. Hydrogen production revealed to be strongly affected by the reaction temperature. As a matter of fact, only traces of hydrogen were detected at 573K. High productivities were only achieved upon heating reaching a maximum at 873K and kept a roughly constant value from then on. A different trend was observed for the CO formation. High amounts were produced even at the lowest temperature studied (473K) with a slight decrease from 873K. CO2 formation followed a similar behavior. Along with these main products, traces of acetaldehyde and CH4 were also detected. These results are pretty different from what has been seen over other noble metal catalysts, such as Pt and Pd, and suggest that the CO and H2 do not come from the decomposition of ethoxy species formed on the catalyst surface. Indeed, the high selectivity to CO and CO2 and the small amounts of methane on Rh/CeO2 catalyst is in close agreement with the reaction mechanism previously proposed through DRIFTS analyses. According to this mechanism, over Rh based catalyst, the CO and CO2 production could be attributed to the decomposition of oxametallacycle intermediate, as previously described. Fig. 6 depicts the molar composition at two selected temperatures, which evidences the differences in products distribution. The values are displayed considering the N2 used as balance (around 65%). These results reveal that Rh/CeO2 system is efficient for hydrogen generation from partial oxidation of ethanol; however, it is also clear that higher reaction temperatures are more suitable as higher hydrogen production, lower CO amounts and no by-products are formed. Therefore, the reaction condition must be adjusted to reach a more efficient process focused on maximizing the hydrogen production and deplete the CO formation. Considering these results, the reformate obtained at 1073K was fed into the water–gas shift reactor as the first step for CO removal as illustrated in Scheme 1. At this stage, additional steam was supplied to adjust the H2O/CO ratio. The activity of the two different catalysts, unmodified and modified Pt/CeO2, was firstly examined by calculating the reaction rate under differential conditions at 573K (Table 3 ). The Pt/V–CeO2 was found to be more active; its better performance was indeed observed within a wide range of temperature as depicted in Fig. 7 . As a consequence, superior CO minimization was possible for all temperatures studied reaching a maximum at 598K. Fig. 8 presents the evolution of products concentration in the water–gas shift reactor outlet for both catalysts. The expected increase in the H2 and CO2 yields are noted whereas no methane formation could be detected, revealing that no methanation processes took place during the reaction over any sample. The results presented in Table 3 and Fig. 7 indicate that CO content at the outlet of the reactor can be reduced from 6 (reformer outlet) to about 1.4vol.% at that temperature as the conversion amounted 78% over the modified catalyst. As a matter of fact, CO levels lower than 2vol.% can be accomplished from 573K in contrast to the Pt/CeO2 sample. The reasons for the beneficial effect brought about by adding vanadium to this system should be investigated through the understanding of the reaction mechanism. As a matter of fact, a great discussion has recently arisen in the literature due to the renewed interest in the water–gas shift reaction. The two most cited mechanism proposals are the redox mechanism [6,7], which is based on CeO2 redox properties, and the associative mechanism [31,32], where formate species are considered as a reaction intermediate. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that the presence of vacancies seems to be a common requirement of both mechanistic approaches. Their essential role in the redox mechanism, which would allow the CO oxidation to CO2 by using the supports labile oxygen, is well fulfilled by ceria and other reducible oxides [33]. On the other hand, it has also been claimed to play an important role in the creation of the active sites for the formate-based mechanism, called bridging OH groups [34]. These hydroxyls species are easily formed over ceria surface as a consequence of the reduction process [32]. Vanadium oxide, that was found to be formed on the studied modified catalyst, is known to present high oxygen mobility when it is partially reduced. This characteristic is also a consequence of the capacity of structural defects generation [35], which makes vanadium a worth investigating compound for water–gas shift reaction. The reaction conditions used in this study ensures that vanadium is in a reduced oxidation state, which would facilitate the creation of those adequate sites just after catalyst activation, and thus establish the necessary redox cycle. However, the crucial role of CeO2 to provide the bridging OH groups should not be ruled out so far. The results presented herein might be taken as a basis to assume the possibility of an associative/redox coupled mechanism as has indeed been recently proposed by some groups who investigated different water–gas shift catalytic systems [36]. It seems that this new comprehension of the active sites for WGS has been rationalized. After analyzing the catalytic activity of the WGS catalysts, the stability was investigated. Both unmodified and V-modified catalysts were roughly evaluated by following the CO conversion and the exiting gases concentration for 48h. Such experiments revealed that the ceria-supported catalyst started deactivating after the first 10h while the vanadium-modified water–gas shift catalyst exhibited good stability under the operating conditions within the monitored reaction period. The time-dependent concentration profiles of all gases produced in the water–gas shift reactor over the Pt/V–CeO2 catalysts is presented in Fig. 9 . The stream compositions obtained at each step of the integrated system investigated are summarized in Table 4 . Since 1–2vol.% of CO is higher than the upper acceptable limit for the inlet concentration in the fuel cell, the hydrogen rich stream can be further purified in a PSA device as presented in Scheme 1. Focusing on the catalytic steps involved in the whole process, the catalysts developed in this study presented suitable activities. The results suggested that the catalysts presented in this contribution may be used in a fuel processor system for fuel cell applications. Moreover, a single water–gas shift reactor may be adopted."
13,Conclusion,"The partial oxidation of ethanol on Rh/CeO2 is favored at high reaction temperatures; under these conditions it provides higher hydrogen production, lower amounts of carbon monoxide and no by-products. CO removal from ethanol reformate can be carried out over unmodified and V-modified Pt/CeO2 catalysts. The higher activity accomplished over the Pt/V–CeO2 catalyst is suggested to be related to the presence of a V2O5 phase, much probably due to its redox properties. The proposed fuel processing system fed with ethanol as a renewable feedstock and composed by a reformer followed by a water–gas shift unit operating with the ceria supported catalysts studied in this work showed good performance in producing hydrogen and removing CO. The final reformate composition is sufficiently clean and hydrogen-rich to be attached to a PSA system before the fuel cell."
