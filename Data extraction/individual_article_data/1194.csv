0,Introduction,"The development of industry and the lack of environmental awareness have resulted in the deterioration of the quality of the environment globally. Scientists have discovered that hydrogen is not a pollutant and exhibits a high fuel value [1]. Therefore, it is important to develop ways to achieve hydrogen evolution to realize green development. Numerous scientists have focused on the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production. It is hypothesized that the process of photocatalytic hydrogen generation (from water) can help develop the field of energy technology [2–4]. Various semiconductors, such as TiO2 [5–7], CeO2 [8], Co3O4 [9], g-C3N4 [10,11], Cu2O [12] and WO3 [13], have been used to realize photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Various phosphides, such as MoP [14], Cu3P [15,16] and CoP [17] have also been used for the process of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. Molybdenum-based sulfides stands out from many transition metal sulfides. Molybdenum sulfide is considered as an excellent substitute for precious metals due to its special electronic properties at the edges [18–19]. Previous reports have indicated there are many active sites of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in Mo-S due to the presence of a large amount of unsaturated sulfur at the edge of Mo-S [20,21]. A large number of unsaturated sulfur atoms exposed at the edge attract H+ in the solution to form hydrogen [22]. In recent years, CeO2 has attracted immense attention, and it has been used in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as it is cost-effective and exhibits a stable performance. It can be potentially used in the field of catalysis [23–25]. However, as CeO2 is characterized by a wide bandgap and weak light absorption ability, it cannot be efficiently used to realize photocatalytic hydrogen generation [26]. Numerous researchers have addressed these problems by constructing heterojunctions to improve the light absorption performance ability of CeO2. This helps in improving the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution ability [27,28]. It has been reported that the construction of a S-scheme heterojunction can efficaciously promote the separation and transfer of carriers. The process can also help improve the redox ability of the conduction band [29–31]. It has been widely reported that the construction of S-scheme heterojunctions, such as NiS2/MoSe2 [32], GD-CuI-NiTiO3 [33] and Cd0.8Mn0.2S/MoO3 [34] can help improve the activity of the systems. The morphology regulation and matching of the photocatalyst is one of the significant ideas in the early design of photocatalytic hydrogen generation. We have exploited the unique structural features of CeO2 and Mo-S to prevent the formation of Mo-S nanospheres agglomerates. This has also helped to uniformly couple Mo-S with the CeO2 system characterized by a sheet structure. The CeO2 content was optimized to understand the laws behind the acceleration of the process of electrons migration. The samples were characterized, and the results revealed that Mo-O bonds were formed between the catalysts. This promoted separation and migration of electrons. The construction of the built-in electric field can effectively accelerate process of the electron transfer occurring between catalysts, thus, thereby promoting more useful electrons could be used to reduce H+. The experimental results reveal that 10%-COMS, a composite catalyst, exhibits the best hydrogen evolution activity (4.3 mmol h−1g−1). The formation of the Mo-O bonds and the construction of the S-scheme heterojunction collectively helped in the acceleration of the process of electrons transfer occurring at the catalyst interfaces. The results presented herein can help gain insights into the unique design and process of construction of the S-scheme heterojunction."

8,Results and discussion,
9,XRD analysis,"3.1 XRD analysis XRD patterns were recorded and analyzed to determine the crystal structure of the obtained samples. Fig. 2 (a) presents the XRD pattern recorded for the sample Mo-S. It was observed that the structures corresponded to Mo2S3 (PDF#65–6963) and Mo15S19 (PDF#40–936). The characteristic peaks appearing at 2θ = 12.10° and 18.48° were attributed to the (101) and (013) crystal planes of Mo15S19 (PDF#40–936), respectively. Similarly, the characteristic peaks appearing at 2θ = 32.50°, 43.02° and 57.42° could be attributed the (003), (−113) and (020) crystal planes of Mo2S3 (PDF#65–6963), respectively. Analysis of Fig. 2 (b) revealed that that the purity of pure CeO2 was high. The results agreed well with the results obtained from the standard card of CeO2 (PDF#4–593). The characteristic peaks 2θ are located appearing at 2θ = 28.52°, 33.15°, 47.46°, 56.33°, 59.08°, 69.43°, 76.70° and 79.06° corresponded to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) crystal planes of CeO2, respectively. It was observed that the peaks corresponding to CeO2 and Mo-S were present in the patterns recorded for the composite catalyst COMS (Fig. 2 (c)). The preliminary results obtained indicated the successful synthesis of the hybrid catalyst COMS."
10,SEM and TEM analysis,"3.2 SEM and TEM analysis The SEM and HRTEM techniques were used to understand the morphology and microstructure of all the samples. Analysis of Fig. 3 (a) reveals that CeO2 is characterized by a sheet-like structure with a smooth surface. Thus, it can be efficiently used to load of Mo-S. In Fig. 3 (d), the sample Mo-S appeared to be a uniform nanosphere (Fig. 3 (d)). It was also observed that Mo-S could be agglomerated. The SEM image recorded for the hybrid 10%-COMS sample is shown in Fig. 3 (c). It was observed that the Mo-S nanoballs were regularly distributed on the surface of CeO2, indicating that the sheet structure of CeO2 promoted Mo-S loading. The HRTEM image recorded for the 10%-COMS system is shown in Fig. 3 (d-e). Analysis of Fig. 3 (d) that the Mo-S nanoballs were uniformly on the CeO2 sheets. This further indicated that the ribbon-shaped CeO2 helped generate an interface where Mo-S nanospheres could be efficiently dispersed. The lattice fringes of dimensions 0.31 nm and 0.73 nm can corresponded to the (111) and (101) planes of CeO2 and Mo-S, respectively (Fig. 3 (e)). The EDX profiles of the hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS were recorded, and it was observed that five elements (Ce, O, C, Mo, and S) were present in 10%-COMS (Fig. 3 (f)). This further proved that 10%-COMS was synthesized successfully."
11,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis The surface elements and valence states of sample CeO2, Mo-S and 10%-COMS were analyzed using the XPS technique. The full XPS profiles recorded for pure CeO2, Mo-S and 10% COMS are presented in Fig. 4 (a). Analysis of Fig. 4 (a) revealed that the O and Ce elements were present in pure CeO2. The XPS profile recorded for the Mo-S nanosphere contained peaks corresponding to Mo and S. Peaks corresponding to Mo, Ce, O, S, and C were observed in the profiles recorded for 10%-COMS. This indicated the successful synthesis of the 10%-COMS system. Analysis of the XPS the XPS (fine spectrum) profile revealed the presence of eight characteristic peaks of Ce 3d (Fig. 4 (b)). The characteristic peaks of Ce appearing at binding energies of 882.50 eV, 884.64 eV, 889.05 eV and 898.49 eV could be attributed to Ce 3d94f2L n −1, Ce 3d94f1L n , 3d94f1L n −1 and Ce 3d94f0L n , respectively [35,36]. The characteristic peaks appearing at binding energies of 901.08 eV, 903.38 eV, 907.62 eV and 916.91 eV could be attributed to the Ce3+ unit in Ce 3d3/2 [37,38]. The peaks positions corresponding to the Ce 3d unit in the hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS were not the same as the peak positions corresponding to Ce 3d in pure CeO2. This indicates that the presence of a coupling effect between the CeO2 and Mo-S systems. Fig. 4 (c) presents the XPS fine spectral profile of O 1 s. The characteristic peaks appearing at the binding energies at of 529.52 eV and 531.34 eV could be attributed the lattice oxygen (OL) and oxygen-deficient regions (OV), respectively [39]. The characteristic peak of O 1 s in the composite catalyst 10%-COMS shifted significantly. The peak position was not the same as the peak position of O 1 s present in pure CeO2. This indicates that there is a powerful reciprocity between the CeO2 and Mo-S unit. Fig. 4 (d) reveals that Mo exists in multiple chemical valence states. Peaks corresponding to Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2 appear at binding energies of 228.65, 231.83 (233.15 eV) and 235.81 eV, respectively [40,41]. It is noteworthy that a new peak appeared at the binding energy of 235.31 eV in the profile recorded for the composite catalyst 10%-COMS. This could be attributed to the formation of the Mo-O bonds [42]. This further illustrates that the presence of a strong interaction between the catalyst CeO2 and the Mo-S unit when they were completely mixed. The characteristic peaks appearing at the binding energy of 225.72 eV is attributed to the S2 2- and S2- units present in of Mo-S [43]. The binding energy value of the peak corresponding to Mo 3d in 10%-COMS was not the same as the binding energy value of the peak corresponding to the same unit in pure Mo-S. This indicated that the Mo-S particles were close-knit and formed associations with the CeO2 sheets. Fig. 4 (e) presents the XPS fine spectrum profile of the S element. The characteristic peaks appearing at binding energies of 161.44 eV and 162.72 eV could be attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 units in the S2- form [44]. The peak at 168.77 eV could be attributed to the SO4 2- [45,46]. The binding energy value of the peak corresponding to S 2p in 10%-COMS was not the same as the binding energy value of the peak of the same unit in Mo-S. This reveals a powerful mutual effect between Mo-S and CeO2. The XPS data of all catalysts were carbon corrected, and the diffraction peaks appearing at the binding energies of 284.80 and 289.37 eV were attributed to the CO bond and O-CO bond, respectively [47]."
12,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis The influences of the specific surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume of sample CeO2, Mo-S and the 10%-COMS on the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the catalyst were tested by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The equation (1) of BET is as follows: (1) V a V m a = c ( p / p ∗ ) ( 1 - p / p ∗ ) { 1 + ( c - 1 ) p / p ∗ } V: adsorption capacity under pressure p; V: maximum adsorption capacity of monolayer; p*: saturated vapor pressure; c : the adsorption constant It is not difficult to judge from Fig. 5 (a-c) that pure CeO2, Mo-S and 10%-COMS all showed typical IV isotherms. The relative standard pressure of H3 hysteresis loop of all samples is between 0.5 and 1, indicating that all samples belong to mesoporous structure. As shown in Fig. 5 (d), the average pore diameters of samples CeO2, Mo-S and the 10%-COMS are mostly distributed between 2 nm and 50 nm, which indicates that all the samples pertain to the mesoporous structure. Table 1 shows that the SBET of the 10%-COMS decreased relative to Mo-S, which may be caused by the change of CeO2 content. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the 10%-COMS is much higher than that of pure Mo-S, which shows that the change of the SBET of the catalyst has no necessary relationship with the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. This also shows from the side that improving the light-absorbing ability and electron-trapping ability of the catalyst is the internal factor for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity [33]. The hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS has larger pore size and pore volume compared with CeO2 and Mo-S, which shows that the pore volume and pore size of the catalyst can affect the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity to a certain extent. The increase in pore size and pore volume of the catalyst facilitates the adsorption of EY and the infiltration of sacrificial reagents, and accelerates the reduction of H+ [15]."
13,Performance of the catalyst during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.5 Performance of the catalyst during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The H2 production kinetics of each sample was further studied using a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiment. All the photocatalytic hydrogen generation reactions of all samples were carried out under visible light. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), CeO2 exhibited poor photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. The poor performance could be attributed to the light absorption ability of CeO2 [48]. The photocatalytic hydrogen production ability (215 μmol) of the compound catalyst 10%-COMS was 2.4 times higher than that of the pure Mo-S (90 μmol) system. The values were recorded within 5 h from the start of the reactions. This revealed that 10%-COMS exhibited photocatalytic performance. The performance of the hybrid catalyst was further optimized by adjusting the CeO2 content. It was observed that the hydrogen generation ability of the hybrid catalyst continued to increase with the continuous continued increase in the CeO2 content (Fig. 6 (b)). When the CeO2 content was 10%, the maximum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability was recorded The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability of 10%-COMS decreased with an increase in the CeO2 content. This is because when the CeO2 content reaches a certain value, the light absorption ability of Mo-S decreases. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation ability of 10%-COMS was also studied under disparate pH conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 (c), the photocatalytic H2 evolution ability of 10%-COMS gradually increases with an increase in the alkalinity of the system. The optimal photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was recorded at pH = 9. The increase in the activity can be attributed to the fact that TEOA gets protonated when the alkalinity of the system is significantly low. The photocatalyst can potentially get corroded under acidic conditions. This can significantly hinder the H2 production process [49,50]. When the system is highly alkaline, a high the concentration of OH – is present in the system. Under these conditions, the concentration of H + gets significantly reduced, hindering the process of hydrogen production [51]. The results reveal that the process of photocatalytic water splitting is promoted under mild alkaline conditions. We conducted the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction using 10%-COMS in the presence of different sacrificial reagents to further explore the effect of different sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic hydrogen generation ability of the catalyst. The result is shown in Fig. 6 d ,. It was observed that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the composite catalyst 10%-COMS in 15% TEOA solution was better than the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity recorded in 10% methanol solution, 10% lactic acid solution and Na2S (0.35 M)/Na2SO3 (0.25 M) solution. This indicates that the system consisting of 15% TEOA is the best sacrificial reagent for the 10%-COMS system. The effect of the EY content on the activity of the composite catalyst 10%-COMS was further studied. It was observed that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the composite catalyst 10%-COMS gradually increased with an increase in the amount of EY increases. However, when the amount of EY exceeds 10 mg, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is decreases. This can be attributed to the fact that an excess of EY affects the light absorption ability of the 10%-COMS system. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation abilities of pure EY and 10%-COMS in 15% TEOA system were 1.65 and 1.98 μmol, respectively ( Fig. 6 (f)). The amount of hydrogen evolution is very small compared with 10%-COMS and EY mixed in 15% TEOA solution. This revealed that the contributions of EY and 10%-COMS toward the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process were comparable. We studied the performance stability of the hybrid catalyst by conducting the cycling experiment with the 10%-COMS system. The composite catalyst 10%-COMS was subjected to two cycle test, and the 10%-COMS system was placed in the dark place for a period of 10 h ( Fig. 6 (g)). Following this, the two cycles were performed. It was observed that 79% of the initial performance could be retained even after 30 h of operation when the composite catalyst was used ( Fig. 6 (g)). This shows that the 10%-COMS system was quite stable. The structural stability of the composite catalyst 10%-COMS was further proved by analyzing the XRD patterns. The XRD patterns were recorded before and after conducting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. It was observed that the major peaks characterizing the system were present in the XRD patterns recorded with the used 10%-COMS system ( Fig. 6 (h)). This indicated the structural stability of the catalytic system. The composite catalyst 10%-COMS was recovered and analyzed using the XPS technique following the process of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The profiles recorded did not present peaks corresponding to Mo and Ce, indicates that metal precipitation in did not occur ( Fig. 6 (i-j)). The AQE of the catalyst is an important indicator of photocatalytic activity under conditions of visible light irradiation [13,46]. 10 mg 10%-COMS and 10 mg EY were mixed and dissolved in the 15% TEOA solution (30 mL). A 300 W Xenon lamp was used for irradiating the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution bottle (3 × 4 cm) using filters of different wavelengths. The AQE has been presented in Fig. 6 (k). Formula (2) was used to calculate the AQE and the results revealed that the 10%-COMS system could be used to obtain the best AQE (3.02 %) at 450 nm. (2) AQE = 2 × the number of evolved hydrogen molecules the number of inciden photon × 100 % In order to further highlight the superiority of the synergy between the S-scheme heterojunction and the Mo-O bonds, the reports of related catalysts were compared as the amount of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Table 2 shows that this work is superior to other related reports, which fully demonstrating the superiority of the synergistic effect of the S-scheme heterojunction and the Mo-O bonds."
14,UV–vis DRS and PL analysis,"3.6 UV–vis DRS and PL analysis The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is closely related to the light absorption ability of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the light absorption capacity of the photocatalyst was analyzed using the UV–vis DRS technique. CeO2 exhibits poor light absorption ability This is consistent with the results obtained by analyzing the hydrogen evolution kinetics. The visible light response of pure CeO2 is around 475 nm. The results agree well with previously reported results [38]. It was observed that pure Mo-S exhibited excellent light absorption ability Surprisingly, the system composed of a mixture of pure CeO2 and Mo-S exhibited excellent light absorption properties. This can be attributed to the introduction of the CeO2 nanosheets, which helps prevent the formation of Mo-S agglomerates and promotes the light absorption performance of the composite catalyst. The typical Tauc equation (3) is used to calculate the Eg of CeO2 (Fig. 7 (b)). The band gap potential of pure CeO2 was calculated to be 2.66 eV. (3) ( α h ν ) 1 n = A ( hc λ - E g ) α : t h e absorbance index; h :the planck constant; ν :the frequency; A:the constant; E g : band gap of semiconductor; c:speed of light; λ : t h e wavelength of light; The PL spectral profiles were analyzed, and transient fluorescence lifetime tests were conducted for the CeO2, Mo-O and 10%-COMS systems to further determine the carrier separation efficiency and transient fluorescence lifetime of the catalyst in the EY system. The stronger the PL intensity, the higher the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers [55]. All catalysts and EY exhibited the strongest PL signal at 542 nm ( Fig. 7 (c)). The PL signal corresponding to pure EY was the strongest. This reveals that photogenerated carriers can readily migrate to the surface of EY. The protons on the surface exert an adsorption limiting effect. Hence, most of the photogenerated electrons associated with EY are not involved with the process of photocatalytic hydrogen generation [56]. It was observed that the intensity of the corresponding PL signal decreased following the addition of the CeO2, Mo-S and 10%-COMS catalyst. The addition of the 10%-COMS exerted the maximum effect on the PL signal intensity. This indicates that the addition of the 10%-COMS can effectively reduce the extent of recombination of the photo-generated carriers. It also induces photo-generated electrons to take part in the photocatalytic H2 production reaction. All samples were analyzed using the transient fluorescence spectroscopy technique to further explore the interaction between the catalyst and EY to determine the lifetimes of CeO2, Mo-S and composite catalyst 10% COMS. The attenuation curve obtained was fitted using the following formula (4): (4) I ( t ) = B + A e - t τ 1 Double exponential fluorescence decay kinetics was determined to further describe the fluorescence decay of EY in the presence CeO2, Mo-S and CeO2/Mo-S. The fluorescence decay curve corresponding to EY and after curve obtained following the introduction of the corresponding catalysts in EY was fitted using by formula (5). The life expectancy of the electrons was determined using the formula (6). (5) I t = ∑ i = 1 , 2 B i exp - t / τ i I: normalised emission intensity; i: the time after the pulsed laser excitation; B: the amplitude (pre - exponentia 1factor); τi: the TPRL decay time. (6) τ ave = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i τ i 2 ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i τ i τ: the emission lifetimes; A: the correspond ing amplitude. The average life spans of EY, EY + CeO2, EY + Mo-S and EY + 10%-COMS were calculated to be 0.540, 0.006, 0.007 and 0.916 ns, respectively. Formula (6) was used for the calculations. The detailed information is presented in Table 3 . Analysis of the data reveals that the formation of the S-scheme heterojunction and Mo-O bonds helps increase the migration rate of surface electrons. It also helps to significantly reduce the rate of recombination of the photo-induced carriers. Under these conditions, the average lifetime of the photo-generated electrons increases."
15,Determination of the photoelectric performance,"3.7 Determination of the photoelectric performance The reason behind the generation of the high photocatalytic activity of the composite catalyst was explored by conducting photoelectrochemical experiments. The transient photocurrent responses generated by pure CeO2, Mo-S and 10%-COMS are presented in Fig. 8 (a). The stronger the photocurrent response, the lower the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers under conditions of visible light irradiation [57]. The hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS generates a stronger photocurrent response (stronger than that generated by CeO2 and Mo-S) when the simulated light is turned on. This indicates that the introduction of CeO2 promotes the process of carriers separation in Mo-S. The effect of the catalyst CeO2 on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was determined by analyzing the electrochemical polarization curve [58]. The H2 evolution potentials corresponding to pure CeO2, Mo-S and hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS are presented in Fig. 8 (b). The 10%-COMS system exhibits a good hydrogen evolution potential, indicating that the Mo-O bonds play a significant role in reducing the hydrogen evolution potential. The resistance faced by the electron transfer process occurring at the catalyst interfaces was further studied using the EIS technique [59]. It was observed that the smaller the radius of curvature, the smaller was the resistance faced at the catalyst interfaces. Analysis of Fig. 8 (c) reveals that the 10%-COMS hybrid catalyst was characterized by the smallest radius of curvature, indicating that the formation of the Mo-O bonds and the construction of the S-scheme heterojunction by the combination of CeO2 and Mo-S is contribute to accelerate the electron transfer between the catalyst interfaces. The energy level structures of pure CeO2 and Mo-S were analyzed by the Mott-Schottky effect. The photogenerated charge transfer mechanism of the composite catalyst was further studied by the energy level structure. Fig. 8 (d-e) presents the Mott-Schottky curves corresponding to CeO2 and Mo-S. The flat band potentials corresponding to CeO2 and Mo-S were calculated using the formula (7). (7) 1 C 2 = 2 ( N D e ε ε 0 ) - 1 × ( E - E fb - k T / e ) C: space charge region N: carrier concentrat ion e: electron charge ε: dielectric constant ε: vacuum dielectric constant E: electrode applied potential E: flat potential k: boltzmann constant T: absolute temperature The tangent to the Mott-Schottky curves corresponding to CeO2 and Mo-S was generated under conditions of y = 0 (baseline). It was observed that the slopes of the curves corresponding to single CeO2 and Mo-S were greater than zero. This indicated that CeO2 and Mo-S functioned as n-type semiconductors [60]. The Efb of n-type semiconductors is very close to the CB. The Efb of pure CeO2 and Mo-S are −0.51 eV and −0.77 eV, respectively. It has been previously reported that in n-type semiconductors, the ECB of the semiconductor is approximately 0.1 eV or 0.2 eV smaller than the Efb of the semiconductor [61]. That is, the ECB values corresponding to CeO2 and Mo-S were approximately −0.71 eV and −0.97 eV, respectively (vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). The ECB of CeO2 and Mo-S were calculated to be −0.47 eV and −0.73 eV (vs. NHE; (ENHE = ESCE + 0.241 eV), respectively. The band gap of CeO2 was calculated to be 2.66 eV, and the band gap of Mo-S was reported to be 1.84 eV (Fig. 7 (b)) [43]. According to the formula (EVB = ECB + Eg), the VB values corresponding to pure CeO2 and Mo-S were calculated to be 2.19 eV and 1.11 eV, respectively. The band positions of pure CeO2 and Mo-S are shown in Fig. 8 (f)."
16,Potential reaction mechanism,"3.8 Potential reaction mechanism In the S-scheme heterojunction, the Fermi level of the catalyst can directly affects the charge transfer between the catalyst interfaces. Fig. 9 (a) shows that the Fermi level of CeO2 (5.64 eV) is smaller than that of Mo-S (5.57 eV) [62,63]. After Mo-S and CeO2 are fully contacted by solvothermal method, electrons will migrate due to the difference in Fermi level until the Fermi level between the catalysts tends to balance Fig. 9 (b). Mo-S loses some electrons, CeO2 gains some electrons, which makes an internal electric field was built on the interfaces. At the same time, the band edge of Mo-S gradually bends upwards due to the loss of electrons and the band edge of CeO2 gradually bends downwards due to the get of electrons. A probable mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was proposed through related characterization analysis. As shown in Fig. 9 (c), CeO2 and Mo-S exciting carriers under the irradiation of visible light, and then the excited electrons migrate to the CB of the semiconductor. The useless electrons on the CB of CeO2 and the useless holes on the VB of Mo-S are recombined under the driving of band edge bending, Mo-O covalent bond, internal electric field and coulomb force. Meanwhile, useful electrons on the CB of Mo-S participate in photocatalytic water splitting, and redundant holes on the VB of CeO2 oxidize TEOA to form TEOA+."
17,Conclusions,"Mo-S with agglomeration characteristics was successfully synthesized following a simple hydrothermal method. The ribbon-shaped CeO2 system was introduced to realize morphology control to form a S-scheme heterojunction, which significantly reduces the degree of agglomeration of the Mo-S systems. The formation of the heterojunction helps improves the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Mo-S. The construction of the S-scheme heterojunction and the introduction of the Mo-O bonds in the S-scheme heterojunction can effectively promote the process of electron transfer occurring at the catalyst interface. The CeO2 content in the composite catalyst was tuned to achieve the optimal photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability. The amount of hydrogen produced within 5 h using the 10%-COMS was 2.4 times higher than the amount of hydrogen produced using pure Mo-S. The XPS technique was used to confirm the formation of the Mo-O bonds between CeO2 and Mo-S. The formation of the bonds validated the fact that the catalysts interacted with each other. The energy band structure of the catalyst was determined by analyzing the Mott-Schottky plots. Analysis of the LSV curve proves that the hybrid catalyst 10%-COMS exhibited the optimal H2 generation potential. The construction of the S-scheme heterojunction and the formation of the Mo-O bonds significantly promoted the processes of electron transfer and utilization. In conclusion, a new strategy for the construction of S-scheme heterojunction has been proposed, and the results can potentially be used to gain insights into the process of introducing covalent bonds into the S-scheme heterojunctions to promote the process of electrons transfer [62,63]."
