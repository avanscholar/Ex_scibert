0,Introduction,"Electromagnetic interference (EMI) pollution has become an issue of widespread concern due to the explosive use of mobile communication devices and electronic components in our daily life [1–9]. The excessive electromagnetic waves not only cause interference to some electronic components [10,11], but also are harmful to human health [12] because of the thermal effect on the organism. EMI shielding materials could block electromagnetic waves by reflecting or transferring the electromagnetic energy into heat energy namely reflection and absorption [13–20]. Given the trend of miniaturization and skin-fitting of electronic devices, the market demand for thermally conductive, ultrathin, lightweight, and high-efficient EMI shielding materials has experienced tremendous growth [21–29]. And conductive polymer composites (CPCs) consisting of conductive filler and insulating polymer matrix have gradually developed into the new favorite of the market due to their lightweight, corrosion resistance, and inexpensive characteristics [30–35]. Owing to the skin effect of electromagnetic waves, the EMI shielding performance of EMI shielding materials mainly depends on the thickness and electrical conductivity [36,37]. Therefore, for the ultrathin EMI shielding materials, increasing the filler content is a principal way to improve the EMI shielding performance [38,39]. What's more, adding more fillers also improves the thermal conductive performance [40]. However, excessive filler loading will negatively affect the mechanical properties [40], thereby reducing the service life. Some efforts have been made to improve the mechanical properties of CPCs. Constructing a tough interface is an essential method to help enhance the mechanical properties via improving the compatibility between filler and polymer matrix and filler distribution [41–43]. For example, Yan et al. [44] prepared a graphene/carbon nanotubes/elastomeric ionomers composite through dynamic anion-π interaction possessing an enhanced fracture strength of 10.3 MPa, which is 168 times that of the composites without interfacial interaction. Furthermore, the composite also exhibited a high EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of 32 dB at a thickness of 0.5 mm. Song et al. [45] reported a flexible Fe3O4@Ti3C2Tx MXene/3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid-epoxidized natural rubber elastomers composite with metal-ligand coordination crosslinking interaction having dramatically enhanced tensile strength of 14.15 MPa with a filler loading of 10 wt%, which surpasses the conventional composite by 307%. The composite shows an EMI SE of 31.18 dB at 1.2 mm thickness. Moreover, another challenge of adding too much filler is the poor processability due to the sharply rising viscosity. The solution-blending method could solve the problem of processability, but most of the organic solvents are toxic. In this case, waterborne polyacrylate latex has attracted much attention because of its low viscosity and solvent-free characteristics [46,47]. What's more, by adding functional monomer, polyacrylate polymer chains possess many active functional groups such as epoxy [48], carboxyl [49], amino [50], and hydroxyl [51] groups, which could form interfacial interactions with fillers [52]. Although some researchers have made many efforts to help solve the above problems, the situation is more complicated for waterborne polyacrylate latex-based composites [53]. The most commonly used waterborne polyacrylate latex is anionic polyacrylate latex. For the anionic polyacrylate latex, the electrostatic repulsion of the latex particles is a crucial factor affecting the dispersion stability of the latex [54,55]. The changes in the concentration of H+/OH− caused by the water evaporation during the film formation could affect the electrostatic repulsion, thereby the dispersion stability of the latex. Therefore, the dispersion stability of latex is highly related to the initial pH value during the film formation. With the evaporation of water, the pH value, the electrostatic repulsion, and the dispersion stability would gradually increase with the increasing OH− concentration if the initial pH value surpasses 7, they would gradually decrease if the initial pH value is below 7. In general, the initial pH value in the film formation process is adjusted to be mild alkaline (7.5–8.5) to maintain the latex stable by the electrostatic repulsion of anions [52]. Therefore, when compounded with anionic latex, fillers are usually modified to be negatively charged due to the same reason [56]. However, the electrostatic repulsion also hinders the contact between the filler and the polymer, thereby weakening the filler-polymer matrix interaction. Therefore, it is still a challenge to both improve the dispersion stability of filler and the interfacial interaction in the anionic composite latex. In this work, a simple strategy of adjusting the initial pH value in the film formation process of anionic composite latex is proposed to engineer the filler-polymer matrix interaction. Polydopamine (PDA) was anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheet (GNS) by an in-situ polymerization method to improve the water dispersibility of GNS. Then, GNS@PDA was integrated into an anionic polyacrylate latex by a blending method. By adding base or acid, the phenolic hydroxyl groups of PDA could deprotonate to form electrostatic repulsion with anionic latex particles or re-protonate to construct hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups of polyacrylate. Therefore, adjusting the initial value reasonably in the film formation process could transform the electrostatic repulsion to the hydrogen bond attraction as the water evaporates, thereby solving the contradiction between the dispersion stability of filler and the filler-matrix interaction. The effect of the pH value on the filler-matrix interfacial interaction is investigated. The composites exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, high-efficiency EMI shielding performance, and remarkable thermal conductivity."

7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization The pH value of the composite latexes was measured by a PHS-3C desktop acidity meter (INESA Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd, China). Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of the composite films was characterized using a Vertex-70 FT-IR instrument (Bruker, German) with an attenuated total reflectance in the range of 500–4000 cm−1. FT-IR spectra of the GNS and GNS@PDA were tested using the same equipment by tableting method with potassium bromide (spectroscopic pure) as a substrate. Raman spectra of GNS and GNS@PDA were obtained by a DXR Raman Microscope (THEM, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to examine the thermal stability of GNS and GNS@PDA by a STA7200RV thermogravimetry/differential thermal analyzer (Hitachi, Japan). X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) were recorded by a Rigaku D/max2200pc type X-ray diffraction meter (XRD, Japan) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) source. The morphologies of the GNS and GNS@PDA were observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN, USA). The freeze-fractured surfaces of the composites were observed by a Hitach S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Japan). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the composites was measured using a Q200 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA, USA) with nitrogen as a purge gas and at a constant heating rate of 5 °C/min and temperatures from −60 to 60 °C according to ASTM D7426-2008 (2013).

8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of GNS@PDA,"3.1 Characterization of GNS@PDA GNS@PDA was prepared via a noncovalent modification due to the π–π stacking interaction between GNS and PDA. The modification of GNS by PDA was first confirmed by FT-IR (Fig. 1 a). The peaks in the FT-IR spectrum of GNS may belong to the residual chemical reagents used during the exfoliation process of graphene. After modification with PDA, the new peaks at 2925 cm−1, 2854 cm−1, and 1458 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetrical stretching vibration, symmetrical stretching vibration, and in-plane bending vibration of –CH2 in PDA [57]. The peak at 1670 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of CO belonging to PDA [58], indicating the existence of dopamine quinone in PDA. The peaks at 1585 cm−1 and 1406 cm−1 are the skeletal vibrations of the aromatic ring [59]. All the differences in the FT-IR spectra of GNS and GNS@PDA could prove that GNS@PDA is available after in-situ polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Fig. 1b displays the Raman spectra of GNS and GNS@PDA. The D band at 1340-1350 cm−1 and the G band at 1580-1590 cm−1 correspond to the defect of graphene and the in-plane bonding stretching motion of sp2 carbon atoms, respectively. And the intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG) is used to present the ordered degree of graphene. GNS shows a lower ID/IG value (0.104) than that of GNS@PDA (0.191). The higher ID/IG value of GNS@PDA is attributed to the PDA modification on the surface of GNS. Moreover, the G band of GNS@PDA depicts a red shifting compared with that of GNS, confirming the electron transfer effect caused by the π-π interaction between PDA and GNS [46]. Fig. 1c shows the TGA curves of GNS and GNS@PDA. GNS exhibits excellent thermal stability. Even at 800 °C, 96.51 wt% of the residues still remain. While the residues of the GNS@PDA only remain 83.53 wt%. According to the report by Ai et al. [60], PDA is an excellent carbon precursor which remains about 54 wt% after calcination under nitrogen atmosphere. Therefore, the calculated mass ratio of PDA to GNS is about 0.44. Furthermore, it can be seen from the TEM image of GNS@PDA (Fig. 1d) that PDA nanoparticles with a diameter of 50–200 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of GNS, while the TEM image of GNS in Fig. S1 doesn't exist any particles, thus verifying the modification of GNS by PDA. Moreover, after modification, the GNS@PDA possesses a two-dimensional sheet morphology, and the PDA nanoparticles could also prevent the GNS from stacking, which was also proved by the XRD patterns of GNS and GNS@PDA as shown in Fig. S2 (details of the analysis are provided in Supporting Information)."
10,Interaction between GNS@PDA and P(St-BA),"3.2 Interaction between GNS@PDA and P(St-BA) After modification, due to the electrostatic repulsion caused by the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of PDA, GNS@PDA possesses good water dispersibility as shown in Fig. S3. The phenolic hydroxyl groups in PDA is pH-sensitive, suggesting that the ionized phenolic hydroxyl groups could re-protonate after adding H+. As the pH value decreases, the protonated phenolic hydroxyl groups could serve as proton donors to construct hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups (proton acceptors) of P(St-BA) latex. Meanwhile, the electrostatic repulsion is weakened because of the reduction of negatively charged groups. Therefore, the interaction between the GNS@PDA and the P(St-BA) latex should be a dynamic balance of hydrogen bond attraction and electrostatic repulsion with the change of pH value. And there will be a crucial transition pH value below which the hydrogen bond attraction will begin to be dominant, rather than electrostatic repulsion. Interestingly, we found that the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite latexes would aggregate automatically when the pH value was decreased to about 6.1, and GNS@PDA could re-disperse uniformly in the P(St-BA) latex by adding alkaline solution. Repeated aggregation-redispersion behavior at different pH values is also available, as shown in Fig. 3 g, verifying the existence of the crucial transition pH value. And the pH value of 6.1 was defined as the transition pH value (pHt) of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite latex. Based on the self-decreasing behavior of pH values of the anionic P(St-BA) latex under acidic conditions as water evaporates, we proposed a strategy of adjusting the initial pH value during the film formation process to regulate the dynamic balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic repulsion. As shown in Fig. 2, the initial pH value of the composite latex during the film formation was adjusted to a mild acidic value, which is a little higher than pHt. Then the composite latex could keep stable under the dominant electrostatic repulsion in the early stage of film formation. Afterward, as the water evaporates and so the pH value decreases gradually below the pHt, the growing hydrogen bonding turns to be dominant and strengthen the interface interaction between the GNS@PDA and the P(St-BA). Meanwhile, the increasing viscosity guarantees the dispersion stability of GNS@PDA. As a result, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites strengthened by hydrogen bonding are available. In this system, the solid content of the latex is another important issue to achieve this strategy. According to the film formation mechanism [61] of the waterborne polymer latex, when the solid content of the latex reduces to 60 wt%, the latex particles will squeeze and rearrange. Meanwhile, the filler in the film will be not displaced due to the increased viscosity. Therefore, the pH value of the latex with 60 wt% solid content is a critical parameter. As well known, when the concentration of H+ increases tenfold, the pH value will only drop 1. If the initial solid content of latex is too high, there is not enough water to ensure that the pH value after the water evaporates would be below pHt (6.1). Therefore, the initial solid content of the latex was adjusted to 13 wt%, thereby the theoretical change of the pH value of the whole system would surpass 1 as the solid content drops to 60 wt%. The initial pH value of the composite latex during the film formation was adjusted to different values (pH = 5.8, 6.4, 6.8, 7.5) to further investigate the interaction between the GNS@PDA and polyacrylate latex. It's well established that a strong interaction between the fillers and polymer matrix could help transfer applied load from the polymer matrix to fillers by the interface, thereby strengthening the tensile properties [62,63]. Fig. 3a–c shows the tensile properties of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite at different initial pH values during the film formation. As shown in Fig. 3a, the composites at the initial pH = 6.4 exhibits a higher tensile strength in comparison with that of the composites at the initial pH = 7.5. The tensile strength enhancement in Fig. 3b also agrees with the results. The results could be ascribed to that when the initial pH value is 7.5, the pH value of the composite latex would always surpass 7.5 as the water dries, thus the growing electrostatic repulsion weakens the interface. However, at the initial pH = 6.4, the pH values of the composite latexes would gradually decrease as the water evaporates. Once the pH value below pHt (6.1), the hydrogen bonding would dominate the interaction between the filler and polymer. Given the greatest difference in tensile strength enhancement of the composites at a filler loading of 1.5 wt% at different pH values, P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-1.5 wt% composite was selected to investigate the effect of pH value on tensile strength. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the pH value shows no obvious effect on the tensile strength of the neat P(St-BA). However, when the initial pH value is 7.5, the composite shows the lowest tensile strength, which is nearly equal to that of the neat P(St-BA). As mentioned above, the electrostatic repulsion between the filler and polymer is not conducive to transfer applied load from polymer to filler. When the initial pH value falls between 6.1 and 7, the tensile strength undergoes an increase with the decreased pH value. It also indicates that the growing hydrogen bonding improves the efficiency of load transfer. However, due to the mechanical defects and stress concentration points in the matrix caused by the aggregation of filler, the composite at the initial pH = 5.8 also exhibits the worst tensile strength, which is nearly equal to that of the neat polymer. To have an in-depth understanding of the effect of pH value on the interfacial interaction, FT-IR spectra were employed to further investigate the hydrogen bonding between the filler and matrix [63]. It's well established that the peaks of the proton donors would downshift due to the increased bond length caused by the attraction of the proton acceptors in the FT-IR spectra [64]. Fig. 3d shows the FT-IR spectra of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-1.5 wt% composites under different initial pH values. The peaks at around 3400 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of O–H. And the peaks show a downshift from 3442 cm−1 to 3411 cm−1 and then 3408 cm−1 at initial pH values = 6.8, 6.4, and 5.8, proving that the hydrogen bonding leads to longer O–H bond lengths [64]. However, the composite at initial pH = 7.5 shows almost no peaks at around 3400 cm−1 due to the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group. This analysis is also confirmed by the DSC curves of the neat P(St-BA) and the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-1.5 wt% composites at different initial pH values. In general, the interaction between filler and polymer matrix can also restrict the movement of polymer segments, leading to a higher Tg due to that the movement requires more energy [65,66]. As depicted in Fig. S4, the Tg of the neat P(St-BA) at different initial pH values remains almost unchanged. While the Tg of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-1.5 wt% composites increases gradually with the decreased pH values, verifying the growing interaction between filler and polymer. Nevertheless, due to the point distribution of PDA on the surface of GNS, the restriction effect of the fillers to the polymer segments is not so dramatic, thereby the Tg only has a light increasing trend from 15.38 to 16.02 °C. To further reveal the hydrogen bonding between the phenolic hydroxyl groups of PDA and the carbonyl groups of polyacrylate, Materials Studio (MS) 8.0 was used to calculate the binding energy (E Bind ) between PDA and polyacrylate. C83H110O10 was used as a model of P(St-BA). C32H22N4O8 was used as a model of PDA without deprotonation [67]. C32H14N4O8 was used as a model of PDA after deprotonation, and 8 Na+ were added to compensate for the net charge in the simulation box [68]. The E bind between P(St-BA) chain and PDA was calculated as follows [69]: (4) E b i n d = − E i n t e r = E t o t a l − ( E P ( S t − B A ) + E P D A ) where E inter is the interaction energy, E total is the total energy of each system in equilibrium, E P(St-BA) and E PDA are the single point energies of P(St-BA) and PDA, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 3f and Table S1, the E bind of C83H110O10/C32H22N4O8 is 74.76 kcal/mol, which is higher than that of C83H110O10/C32H22N4O8 (64.74 kcal/mol). The result of molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the interaction between PDA and P(St-BA) was increased after the protonation of the ionized phenolic hydroxyl group of PDA by adding acid, demonstrating a tough interface based on hydrogen bonding has been built up in the composites as displayed in Fig. 3h. In addition, the strategy of constructing hydrogen bonding by altering the initial pH value could also be used for other waterborne polymer latex/GNS@PDA composites. As depicted in Fig. S5, at different pH values, the tensile strength of the PA/GNS@PDA composites shows a similar variation trend with that of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites, indicating that the combination of PDA modification and constructing hydrogen bonding by altering the initial pH value might be a universal strategy for preparing mechanically strong waterborne polymer latex-based composites (details of the analysis are provided in Supporting Information)."
11,Morphologies and mechanical properties of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites,"3.3 Morphologies and mechanical properties of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites GNS@PDA can uniformly disperse in waterborne latex due to the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of PDA. Fig. 4 shows the morphologies of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite with different GNS@PDA loading. The dispersion of filler in the polymer matrix is a crucial factor to the properties of the composites with a low filler loading. The composite with 5 wt% GNS@PDA doesn't exist any aggregation of GNS@PDA as shown in Fig. 4b, indicating a homogeneous dispersion of GNS@PDA in polymer matrix due to the PDA modification. In particular, the PDA nanoparticle could act as a steric barrier to prevent the stacking of GNS. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding between GNS@PDA and polymer matrix is also beneficial for the uniform dispersion of filler. However, for the composites with high filler loading, the dispersion of filler is not a problem anymore. As shown in Fig. 4d and e, the composites with 15 wt% and 20 wt% show plenty of physical connections of GNS@PDA. And owing to the layered structure and high rigidity of GNS@PDA, the composites present the aerogel-like structure [46], but there are much more voids, which may worsen the mechanical properties. Fig. 5 a depicts the stress-strain curves of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite. Generally, the tensile strength of the composite could be enhanced by effectively transferring the applied force from polymer matrix to rigid fillers by the strong interface between them. In Fig. 5b, with the incorporation of 10 wt% GNS@PDA, the composite shows the highest tensile strength of 10.97 MPa, which is increased by 137% compared with that of the neat polymer matrix. The enhanced strength can be attributed to the reinforcement effect of the hydrogen bonding as confirmed by FT-IR spectra, DSC curves, and molecular dynastic simulation. In addition, the π-π interaction between the styrene group in P(St-BA) and the GNS, as proved in the previous work [46], also reinforces the interface, thus improving the tensile strength. The robust interface can effectively transfer the applied force to the rigid GNS@PDA. However, when the filler loading surpasses 10 wt%, the tensile strength of the composites undergoes a decrease due to the existence of the voids, which weakens the tensile strength. Nevertheless, the tensile strength of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% is still higher than that of the initial matrix. However, the incorporation of rigid fillers reduces the toughness of composites owing to the fact that the filler would act as a stress concentration point [70,71]. Moreover, the restrictive effect caused by the interconnected filler network to the polymer chain movements also leads to a lower toughness. Therefore, the elongation at break of the composites decreases gradually along with the incorporation of GNS@PDA (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, the Young's modulus of the composites shows a same trend as the tensile strength. The composite filled with 10 wt% GNS@PDA possesses the maximum modulus of 198.4 MPa. However, after integrating 15 wt% and 20 wt% GNS@PDA with polymer matrix, the Young's modulus of the composites also decreases due to the existence of the voids. The mechanism for improving the mechanical properties can be ascribed to that the tough interface has been built up, which could effectively transfer the load to GNS@PDA."
12,Electrical conductivity and EMI shielding performance of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites,"3.4 Electrical conductivity and EMI shielding performance of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites Electrical conductivity is one of the most crucial factors that determines the EMI shielding performance of CPC due to the strong skin effect of electromagnetic waves. Fig. 6 a displays the DC conductivity of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite films as a function of the filler loading. It can be observed that the DC conductivity of neat P(St-BA) is only 7.14 × 10−12 S/m. With the incorporation of 1 wt% GNS@PDA, the DC conductivity of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-1 wt% was improved to 6.2 × 10−3 S/m, which is almost 9 orders of magnitude higher than that of neat P(St-BA). With further increasing the filler loading, the DC conductivity of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% could be enhanced to 442.5 S/m, which could easily light LED under 3 V power when used as wire in circuit as displayed in the inset picture of Fig. 6a, showing great potential for high-efficiency EMI shielding application. To further figure out the insulation-conduction transition behavior, the percolation threshold (pc) of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite was calculated using the classical percolation theory. The pc of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite was obtained by fitting the DC conductivity (σ) as a function of the volume fraction of GNS@PDA (p) as follows [72]: (5) σ ∝ ( p − p c ) α where α is the critical exponent which is used to describe the type of the conductive network. When α > 2, the CPC possess a three-dimensional conductive network [72]. As shown in Fig. 6b, the α value is 2.734, which means a three-dimensional conductive network of GNS@PDA was constructed successfully in the composites. In our previous work [46], the P(St-BA)/S-GNS composites have a p c value of 1.986 vol% (2.88 wt%). However, the p c value of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites decreased to 0.995 vol% (0.735 wt%). The lower pc value of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites originates from the decoration of the PDA particles, which prevents the GNS from stacking. And the DC conductivity of GNS and GNS@PDA is 57471 S/m and 23380 S/m, respectively. The highly conductive GNS@PDA results in the high DC conductivity of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites. The extremely high DC conductivity indicates that the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite possesses great potential to serve as high-efficiency EMI shielding material. It is well known that EMI SE increases with conductivity. Fig. 7 a displays the EMI SE of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite with different filler loading at the same thickness of 0.21 mm. As can be seen, the EMI SE increases with the filler loading, which could be corresponding to the increased conductivity. When filler loading is over 10 wt%, the EMI SE values of the composites are both higher than 20 dB, meaning their high potential in the commercial application. For example, the average EMI SE of the composite is 30 dB with the filler loading of 20 wt%, indicating that 99.9% electromagnetic wave power is blocked. In general, the EMI shielding mechanism mainly contains reflection and absorption. The higher the conductivity of the composite is, the higher the reflectivity of the composite. SE Ref is usually to present the reflectivity of EMI shielding materials to the electromagnetic waves, and SE Abs is utilized to evaluate the dissipation capacity of EMI shielding materials to the incident electromagnetic waves inside the material. Fig. 7b compares the SE Total, SE Abs, and SE Ref of the composites as a function of filler loading at the frequency of 10.3 GHz. It is clear that the SE Ref and SE Abs increase with the filler loading, demonstrating that the increased conductivity not only could improve the reflection, but also would enhance the dissipation capacity by the improved conduction loss. Although the SE Abs is much higher than SE Ref, it doesn't mean that the main shielding mechanism is absorption. The shielding mechanism could be depicted by comparing the power coefficient [73–75]. Fig. 7c displays the power coefficients of the composite at the same thickness of 0.21 mm. The R coefficient and A coefficient correspond to the proportion of reflection and absorption in the entire shield, respectively. And R values are much higher than A values, indicating the main shielding mechanism by reflection. Due to the strong skin effect of electromagnetic waves, sample thickness also plays an important role for the EMI shielding performance. Skin depth (δ) is the depth at which the amplitude of the incident electromagnetic waves attenuates by 1/e [76]. Therefore, when the thickness is higher than δ, a good EMI shielding performance could be guaranteed. As displayed in Fig. 7d, δ was calculated to figure out the specific shielding mechanism as follows [77]: (6) δ = 1 π f μ σ , w h e n σ ≥ 2 π f ε 0 , μ = μ 0 μ r where μ is the magnetic permeability of materials (H/m), σ is the conductivity (S/m), Ɛ 0 is the permittivity of free space (equal to 8.854 × 10−12 F/m), and μ 0 is the permeability of free space (equal to 4π × 10−7 H/m). Due to the high conductivity, the δ value of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite is only 0.236 mm. When the ratio of sample thickness to δ is lower than 1.3, the composites can be treated as electrically thin materials, in which the multiple reflection cannot be ignored [78]. The thickness of all the composites in Fig. 7a is 0.21 mm, and all the composites should be treated as electrically thin materials. Therefore, the multiple reflection should be an important reason for the high-efficiency EMI shielding performance. Fig. 7e depicts the EMI SE of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite at different thicknesses. When the thickness is only 0.1 mm, the average EMI SE value of the composite is 20 dB, which satisfies the commercial standard of EMI shielding materials. The EMI SE of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite could reach 58 dB at a thickness of 0.6 mm. For electrically thin materials, the SE value could be calculated as follows [79]: (7) S E C a l = 20 l o g ( 1 + Z 0 t σ 2 ) where Z 0 is 120π, t is the sample thickness. As can be seen in Fig. 7f, when the thickness is less than 0.1 mm, the SE Cal values of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composites are near to the measured average SE Total. However, as the thickness surpasses 0.1 mm, the measured SE Total value is higher than SE Cal. The main reason is that the porous structure could further increase the multiple reflection. Therefore, the main shielding mechanism of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite is reflection. The high-efficiency EMI SE could correspond to the synergistic effect of high conduction loss and multiple reflection. An excellent EMI shielding material should possess good stability, flexibility, and high shielding efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. 8 a, the EMI SE of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite remained nearly unchanged even after bending 1000 times, verifying its good stability and flexibility. The shielding effectiveness/thickness (SE/t, dB/mm) was employed to further demonstrate the high-efficiency EMI shielding performance of the composites. Compared with other reported materials, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composites show much higher shielding efficiency (Fig. 8b), indicating their great potential in the application of flexible electronics. In addition, the shielding performance of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite film at a thickness of 0.2 mm in the practical application was also explored by using an electromagnetic radiation tester. As shown in Fig. 8c, the tester recorded the radiation intensity of a wireless charger, a power strip, and an electronic panel of microwave oven at fixed distances under the electric field intensity of 250 V/m, 187 V/m, and 125 V/m, respectively. After employing a piece of P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite film as a shield, the corresponding value sharply decreased to 0 V/m, 8 V/m, and 1 V/m, respectively. However, the magnetic field intensity remained almost unchanged even after employing our shielding material. What's more, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite can also be coated on other solids. As shown in Fig. 8e–i, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite coated leather shows good flexibility, conductivity, and EMI shielding performance, verifying the great potential as a coating material. Given the high shielding performance for the electric field, the composite material can be applied to the surface of clothes to protect the human body from the electromagnetic radiation generated by many common electrical appliances."
13,Heat dissipation performance,"3.5 Heat dissipation performance The heat dissipation performance is another important capacity for the EMI shielding materials due to the incident electromagnetic energy is transferred into thermal energy by absorption. For the application in electronic fields, the EMI shielding materials are also supposed to help dissipate heat into the environment to prolong its lifetime. Owing to the high thermal conductivity (TC) of the graphene, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites also possess outstanding thermal conductive performance. Fig. 9 a shows the TC of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites with different filler loading. The TC of the neat P(St-BA) is 0.12 W/m·K, while TC of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-15 wt% composite reaches 1.67 W/m·K, which is about 14 times that of the neat P(St-BA). However, the TC almost stays unchanged as the filler loading increasing to 15 wt%. To evaluate the effective practicability of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-15 wt% composite used as a heat dissipation material, an IR thermal camera was applied to measure the surface temperature of the sample during the heat dissipation process as displayed in Fig. 9b. A circle sample of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-15 wt% composite with a thickness of 0.6 mm was heated to 80 °C by a hot plate and then moved to a thermally insulated stage. Fig. 9c depicts the cooling curve of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-15 wt% composite as a function of cooling time. The surface temperature sharply decreased from 72 °C to 58.3 °C only in 7 s. It gradually cooled to ambient temperature in the following 32 s, demonstrating its potential application in electronics to serve as a heat dissipation material."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, this work demonstrates the preparation of flexible and mechanically robust waterborne P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites with high-efficiency EMI shielding and heat dissipation performance via a blending-casting method. The filler-polymer matrix interfacial interaction, mechanical properties, EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and the practical application performance of the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composites were systematically investigated. Benefitting from the combination of PDA modification and adjusting the initial pH value in the film formation process of anionic composite latexes, the interaction between P(St-BA) and GNS@PDA transforms from electrostatic repulsion to hydrogen bonding as the water dries, guaranteeing both the high dispersion stability of fillers and strong interfacial interaction between filler and polymer matrix. A strong interface based on hydrogen bonding has been established for enhancing the mechanical properties. The resultant composite filled with 10 wt% GNS@PDA possesses the maximum tensile strength of 10.97 MPa, which is increased by 137% compared with that of the neat P(St-BA). Moreover, with the incorporation of 20 wt% GNS@PDA, the P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA composite shows a high EMI SE of 58 dB at only 0.6 mm thickness. Due to the multiple reflection of electrically thin materials and the conduction loss caused by the high conductivity, a high EMI SE of 20 dB was obtained at a thin thickness of 0.1 mm, which satisfies the commercial requirement of EMI shielding materials. The P(St-BA)/GNS@PDA-20 wt% composite also exhibits a high thermal conductivity of 1.68 W/m·K. Besides, the practical application of composite coated leather proves its great potential to be used as a flexible coating material on other solids. We believe that the combination of PDA modification and constructing hydrogen bonding at the interface between filler and polymer allows the practical fabrication of flexible and mechanically robust waterborne composites with high-performance EMI shielding and heat dissipation properties for wide applications such as wearable devices, telecommunication systems, and human protection."
