0,Introduction,"As a kind of endogenously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important role in immune respiratory burst under the invasion of microorganism [1]. Emerging research papers manifest that H2O2 has close relationship with cell signaling pathways and can regulate various physiological processes related to the growth, development, and fitness of living organisms [2–6]. Overabundance of H2O2 could cause extensive cellular and tissue damage accompanied by various diseases, including cancer [7,8], diabetes [9,10], cardiovascular [11,12], and neurodegenerative diseases [13,14]. All above mentioned diseases give credit to the produced oxidative stress and inflammation events stimulated by abnormal concentration of H2O2. Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop novel strategies to monitor H2O2-a potential diagnostic marker. Traditionally, various fluorophore release strategies have been developed for imaging of H2O2 in vivo, including boronate-based probes [15–18], and benzil molecule [19]. Under the stimulation of H2O2, fluorophore will be released accompanied by breaking of chemical bonds or intramolecular probe rearrangement. Chemiluminescence (CL) of luminol is a well-established sensitive technology for biological analysis, such as enzyme activity assays, flow-injection analysis, reactive oxygen species assays, and immunoassays [20]. Luminol is not appropriate for use in vivo for its highly reactivity [21,22]. Recently, some scientists have incorporated luminol into living system for imaging the related target molecular through chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) [23–25]. However, luminol was treated as an energy donor in this system, and probe design was restricted by the degree of overlapping between the chemiluminescence of luminol and absorbance of the acceptor. To overcome the limitation of fluorophores selection and realize universality, chemiluminescence of luminal was used as a signal transduction trigger for fluorophore release. Hence, design and development of a chemiluminescence triggered fluorophore release for in vivo fluorescence imaging of H2O2 is necessary. Because of stability, sensitivity, and easy functionalization, stimuli-responsive micelles system have advantages in design and development of biosensors. Most frequently employed biological triggers are pH [26], biomolecules [27], enzymes [28], redox potential [29], ROS [30], gases [31], temperature [32], and light [33]. Inspired by the precedents, we constructed three-component system using chemically decorated amphiphilic polymer micelles for chemiluminescence-triggered fluorophore release, as it is shown in Scheme 1 . An o-benzyl alcohol-decorated blockpoly(carbonate)s copolymer, viz. PMPC−ONA, was synthesized. Depend on ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, amphiphilic block copolymers were formed. Then, we employed the copper-catalyzed ‘click’-reaction to afford formation of H2O2 responsive micelles with luminol, fluorescence dye (SQ), and hemin wrapped inside. It is worth pointing out that the hydrophobic-end of amphiphilic copolymers decorated with the recognition sites for identification by chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescence of luminol acts as a signal transduction tool induced fluorophore SQ, release through a two-step process. Firstly, H2O2 diffuses into the nanoparticles and reacts with hemin [25], generating high-energy reactive oxygen within the nanoparticles. Then the oxygen chemically excited the luminol and generated chemiluminescence in the emission region of 400−425 nm [20], which was nicely overlapped with photo cleaved nitrosobenzaldehyde of those recognition sites (350−450 nm) [34]. Secondly, after activation of the nitrosobenzaldehyde recognition sites, the hydrophobic-ends were transformed into hydrophilic, which would destabilize the micelles and release enwrapped fluorophore SQ dye. Fluorescence recovery of the dye was due to the increased distance with fluorescence quencher Hemin and disappeared quenching effect. The process is accompanied by the hemin oxidation, fluorophore release, and fluorescence imaging of H2O2 in vivo. The micelle formation, chemiluminescence-responded fluorophore release, imaging of cancer cells and mice were investigated. Importantly, chemiluminescence-triggered micelle successfully created a signal trigger for the release of fluorophore."
1,Experimental section,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Monomethoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG5k, M n = 5000), 2,2-bis(hydroxyl methyl)propionic acid, 3-Bromopropionyl chloride, ethyl chloroformate, (2-nitrophenyl)methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Triethylamine, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethylformamide (DMF), and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene(DBU) were treated by calcium hydride and distilled under reduced pressure."
3,Preparation of Micelles and three-component loaded Micelles,"2.2 Preparation of Micelles and three-component loaded Micelles Micelles of PEG−b−poly(MPC) and PMPC−ONA were prepared by a dialysis method. The 25.0 mg of amphiphilic block copolymer was dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) stirred vigorously. After that DI water (10 mL) was dropwise added. The resulting solution was stirred vigorously for 2 h at RT, and then dialyzed against DI water (renewed every 4 h) to remove DMF (MWCO 1 kDa). Final micelle concentration was attenuated to 0.5 mg mL−1 by adding DI water. In the case of encapsulating, 2 mL DMF solution contained with the three-component (luminol, hemin, and SQ dye) mixed in ratio of 1: 1.2: 1 was added to solution of PMPC−ONA micelle solution (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 5 h at RT. The resulting solution was dialyzed against DI water for every 4 h to remove redundant DMF (MWCO 1 kDa) and any possible reagents. The final concentration of micelle was also attenuated to 0.5 mg mL−1."
4,Imaging of H2O2 generated in living systems,"2.3 Imaging of H2O2 generated in living systems For imaging the H2O2 generated by NADPH-oxidase (Nox), HeLa cells were incubated with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA (0.5 mg mL−1) for 2.0 hs as control. To further investigate the function of Nox, the cells were processed with stimulant phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (1.0 μM) or inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) (1.0 μM) for 1.0 h, and then loaded with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA (0.5 mg mL−1) for 2.0 hs. The images were obtained from the red channel (610–650 nm) with excitation wavelength of 595 nm. For in vivo imaging of endogenous H2O2 levels in inflamed model of BALB/c nude mice, five groups of mice were put into investigation and the ﬂuorescence signals were obtained. The mice were given a left hind limb injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1.0 g mL−1 in saline) for 2.0 hs to induce acute inflammation, and then injected with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA (100 mg mL−1) in 100 μL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (20 mM, 10% DMSO, pH7.4). As a control, untreated (only saline) or unstimulated (with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA) or inhibited (treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (1.2 × 10−2 M in 100 μL saline) and then L/H/S@PMPC−ONA were also prepared by left hind limb injection. Two groups of mice were investigated for imaging of endogenous H2O2 levels in entire organism. One group of mice were given a peritoneal cavity injection of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA (500 mg mL−1) in 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (20 mM, 10% DMSO, pH7.4). The other group of mice were injected with the same volume of buffered saline as control. in vivo imaging mentioned above were performed in Xenogen IVIS Spectrum instrument (Caliper Life Sciences) 2 h after injection."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Synthesis and self-assembling behavior of amphiphilic block copolymer,"3.1 Synthesis and self-assembling behavior of amphiphilic block copolymer Monomers of (2) ONA−N3 and (4) MPC were synthesized according to the procedure as shown in Scheme S1. Copolymer PMPC−ONA was prepared through a two-step method. First, the PEG−b−poly(MPC) copolymer (5) was synthesized via the ROP of (4) MPC with m−PEG as the macroinitiator. The 1H NMR spectrum of PEG−b−poly(MPC) in CDCl3 is shown in Fig. S1C. By comparing the integrals of peaks at δ = 3.33 (CH3O–) with δ = 4.25 (–C(O)OCH2CCH2O–), the degree of polymerization determined to be 10, which is nearly equal to the value calculated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) as shown in Table S1. The copolymer also has a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.05 and M n of 7263 g moL−1 in the GPC investigation as shown in Fig. S2, which is in line with the results of 1H NMR analysis. Second, as shown in scheme S1, the chemiluminescence triggered copolymer PMPC−ONA was prepared via ‘click’ reaction by modification PEG−b−poly(MPC) and purified by dialysis. Then, 1H NMR spectra of ONA−N3, PMPC−ONA, and PEG−b−poly(MPC) were compared (Fig. S1). Signal at δ = 2.52 (protons of alkynyl groups of PEG−b−poly(MPC)) in 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1C) disappears after ‘click’ chemistry modification (Fig. S1B), indicating that the propargyl groups of PEG−b−poly(MPC) have been completely reacted with ONA−N3. Compared with Fig. S1A and S1C, Fig. S1B reveals that signals assignable to ONA−N3 are at δ 2.50–3.00, 3.50–4.00, and 7.45–8.10, while signals at δ 1.22, 3.37, 3.65, and 4.26 owing to PEG−b−poly(MPC) are detected over the PMPC−ONA copolymer. Moreover, a weak signal at δ = 7.45 is attribute to the proton of triazole ring, suggesting the attachment of ONA−N3 branches to polyester backbone. The GPC results reveal that the PMPC−ONA copolymer has a narrow PDI of 1.0937 and M n of 10,369 g mol−1, and the data correspond to end group analysis results (Table S1). Compared with unmodified copolymer PEG−b−poly(MPC) the GPC trace of grafted copolymer PMPC−ONA has lower retention time and the similar dispersity as shown in Fig. S2, which reveals that the grafted copolymer PMPC−ONA has been readily synthesized via ‘click’ reaction. The self-assembly of PEG−b−poly(MPC) and PMPC−ONA into micelles (Scheme1) are studied in detail with technologies of fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is convenient that the critical micellar concentration (CMC) and self-assembly processes can be resolved by means of dye solubilization method, in which Nile Red as a fluorescence dye [35]. With increasing micelles concentration the fluorescence intensity of NR gradually increases and blue shifted (Fig. S3), meaning that the micelles spontaneously form via self-assembly. PMPC−ONA shows a CMC value similar to that of PEG−b−poly(MPC) (0.01201 mg mL−1 vs. 0.01159 mg mL−1), which are in line with the reported values in literature [35,36]. It suggests that the self-assembled micelles are thermal dynamically stable."
7,Establishment of chemiluminescence-triggered fluorophore release agent and its working principle,"3.2 Establishment of chemiluminescence-triggered fluorophore release agent and its working principle With the compolymer PMPC−ONA in hand, we first optimized the loading amount of three-component. Normalized chemiluminescence intensity of luminol (1.0 μM) changes with H2O2 (2.0 μM) in buffer solution were tested with the increasing concentration of hemin (0−1.2 μM) as shown in Fig. 1 . There is an obvious enhancement of chemiluminescent intensity with addition of hemin. The chemiluminescent efficiency of luminol reached a plateau with the hemin concentration of 1.2 μM. Entrapment content of SQ dye was further investigated. Hemin can quench the fluorescent intensity of many dyes due to its paramagnetism [37]. In order to achieve the optimal effect of fluorescent signal, the low background of the nanosystem is necessary. Therefore, the quenching efficiency (QE%) of hemin to SQ (1μM) was investigated with increasing the concentration of hemin (Fig. 1B) and the QE% got to the maximum (after addition of hemin (1.2 μM)) (inset of Fig. 1B). After confirming the optimal proportion of wrapped three-components, we further prepared the three-component contained micelle, viz. L/H/S@PMPC−ONA, and researched its responsible mechanism to make sure that the confirmed L/H/S@PMPC−ONA whether can be used for H2O2 recognition (Scheme 1). SEM and DLS were applied to monitor the morphology and size of the micelles. The micelles are discretely and uniformly distributed with an average size about 50 nm and 90 nm for three-component system L/H/S@PEG−b−poly(MPC) and L/H/S@PMPC−ONA micelles, respectively (Fig. S6). DLS-determined diameter of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA micelles are larger than that of the L/H/S@PEG−b−poly(MPC) micelles, which gave the credit to the expanded hydrophobic nucleus of the former. In the presence of H2O2, the L/H/S@PMPC−ONA micelles with recognition site of o-benzyl alcohol-decorated were activated under the excitation of chemiluminiscence, which lead to destabilization of the micelles and generation of intertwined copolymer (Fig. S6D). Micelles without the recognition site could not be activated as shown in Fig. S6C. Bycontrast, average size determined by DLS change obviously from 103.3 nm (Fig. S5B) to 11.2 nm (Fig. S5D) with the presence of recognition sites. The destabilized micelles are dialyzed against DI water and then lyophilized for 1H NMR analysis. One can see that the signals at δ 7.53, 7.65, 7.78, and 8.10 disappears and weak signals at δ 2.16, 4.69 and 7.28 arise (Fig. S4), meaning the response site was released when expose to targets. However, the PEG−b−poly(MPC) micelles with no recognition sites show unchanged of morphology (Fig. S6C) and DLS average size (Fig. S5C) remained the same in comparison to Fig. S6A and Fig. S5A, respectively. After corroboration, the response mechanism clearly suggested that the three-component based micelle can respond to H2O2 in a good manner."
8,Sensitivity and specificity of chemiluminescence as a trigger for release of fluorophore,"3.3 Sensitivity and specificity of chemiluminescence as a trigger for release of fluorophore The chemiluminescence responsible probe, viz. L/H/S@PMPC−ONA was further applied to quantify the concentration of H2O2. Fluorescence spectra of the SQ dye were tested in PBS solution. The increased concentration of H2O2 resulted in increased amount of high-energy reactive oxygen within the nanoparticles, followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence that make more nitrosobenzaldehyde cleaved. That process resulted in micelles destabilize and release of fluorophore in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 1C. The linear ranges were obtained between 0.02 and 100 μM. The response kinetics of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA toward H2O2 was also tested by real-time monitoring of the fluorescence intensity changes of SQ dye with additions of H2O2 (Fig. 1D). Collectively, the low detection limit (0.01 μM) of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA toward H2O2 indicates that this nanoprobe can be used to detect the production of H2O2 in living systems. Furthermore, the selectivity of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA was studied in living system. In the presence of cell lysis buffer, the fluorescent intensity changes moderately as shown in Fig. S7A, and the cell lysis buffer solution treated by catalase shows hardly enhancement. However, the fluorescent intensity enhanced obviously, when cell lysis buffer solution was treated by catalase and following addition of H2O2. The phenomenon of chemoselectivity to various biologically relevant ROS were observed in Fig. S7B. There are no fluorescence changes in the presence of some biologically relevant ROS, including OH, ClO−, 1O2, NO, CH3COOOH and TBHP (tertiary butyl hydrogen peroxide). The probe is slightly sensitive to O2 − and ONOO−, although previous literature reported that luminol is sensitive to them [38]. That is because O2 − or ONOO− reacted with probe and produced ultraweak chemiluminescence [22], which couldn't cause lots of SQ dye release for enhancement of fluorescence. Meanwhile, ultra-low concentrations of O2 − and ONOO− in biological systems can hardly generate fluorescent enhancement [38]. Therefore, the L/H/S@PMPC−ONA micelle can eliminate the interference of other ROS successfully in H2O2 detection."
9,Imaging of H2O2 in live cell and mice,"3.4 Imaging of H2O2 in live cell and mice Encouraged by the promising results in vitro, we next proceeded to evaluate the possibility for imaging of H2O2 in live cell and mice. Before imaging, the long-term cytotoxicity of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA probe toward HeLa cells was measured with MTT analysis. The probe present outstanding biocompatibility due to its poly(carbonate)s skeleton. As shown in Fig. S8A, little cytotoxicity was observed, when the concentration of probe was increased to 4 mg mL−1. The excellent biocompatibility of the probe was provided with potential for realizing cell and mice imaging. Furthermore, the long-term stabilities were detected in cell lysate-contained biological fluids (LBF) as shown in Fig. S8B through testing its fluorescence intensity at different storage time. It is convinced that L/H/S@PMPC−ONA probe was stable under biological environment. Based on previous research, the new designed nano probe was applied to image of H2O2 in living cells. It is remarkable that HeLa cells incubated with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA exhibit ﬂuorescence signal, indicating that this probe not only can penetrate the cell membrane but also may respond toward endogenous H2O2 (Fig. 2 A). To demonstrate this assumption, we treated the parallel cells with PMA for 1.0 h, then with L/H/S@PMPC−ONA for 2 h subsequently, Fig. 2B shows that the fluorescence was significantly increased, suggesting that PMA activates the NADPH-oxidase (Nox) redistribution of PKC and phosphorylation of several proteins to generate H2O2 [39]. In contrast, when another parallel cells were pretreated with DPI (a broad-spectrum Nox inhibitor [40]) for 1 h and then incubated with nanoprobe for 2 h, fluorescent intensity decreased in distinct amount (Fig. 2C). Moreover, there were hardly changes of fluorescence signal in the control cells that were pretreated with DPI after further incubation of the PMA for 1.0 h and then loading with the nanoprobe (Fig. 2D), meaning that intracellular H2O2 is mainly generated from the Nox and inhibited Nox lead to a small amount of H2O2 production [40]. According to the previous literatures, H2O2 concentrations in stimulated or stressed cells can reach micromolar level [17], which is nicely overlapped with the detection range of our probe. Collectively, the designed probe is able to visualize the changes of endogenous H2O2 produced by Nox through PMA stimulating in tumor cells. Since the overproduction of H2O2 in vivo is associated with numerous inflammatory diseases, we developed an inflamed model in BALB/c nude mice to test whether L/H/S@PMPC−ONA has potential for mapping fluctuations of H2O2 in vivo. Five groups of mice were investigated by recording ﬂuorescence signals (Fig. 3 ). Fluorescence images clearly revealed that nanoprobe-loaded mice fluoresced notably (Fig. 3B), but no significant ﬂuorescence was observed when mice was treated with buffer only (Fig. 3A), suggesting that L/H/S@PMPC−ONA may visualize endogenous H2O2 levels produced in mice model. To verify this assumption, we then changed the concentrations of endogenous H2O2 by treating mice with LPS (another irritant of endogenous produced H2O2) [41] (Fig. 3C) and NAC (an antioxidant) [16] (Fig. 3D) before loading of L/H/S@PMPC−ONA. One can see that LPS-treated mice show brighter fluorescence than the free one, but NAC-treated mice exhibit significantly reduced fluorescent signals. Moreover, there were hardly changes of fluorescence signal in the control cells pretreated with NAC (Fig. 3E), meaning that H2O2 is mainly generated from the inflammatory diseases and inhibited samples leads to a small amount of H2O2 production [41]. These results demonstrated that L/H/S@PMPC−ONA has good capability for imaging of fluctuations of H2O2 level in situ. Encouraged by the promising results, we next employ this tool for visualizing endogenous H2O2 in entire organism. Two groups of BALB/c nude mice were adopted to test whether L/H/S@PMPC−ONA has potential for mapping H2O2. Fluorescence images clearly revealed that nanoprobe-loaded mice fluoresced distinctly (Fig. 4 B), while no significant fluorescent signals were observed when the mice was treated with buffer (Fig. 4A). The fluorescent signals of mice were mainly distributed in all fours, abdomen and heart. The primary reason is that fairly strong physiological activity take place in these regions. Meanwhile, increased quantity of mitochondria and enhanced NADPH oxidase (Nox) expression in cells of those areas were the main stream of elevated levels H2O2 [42]. These results provide substantial evidences that L/H/S@PMPC−ONA is a useful tool for visualizing endogenous H2O2 fluxes of mice either in situ or in entire organism."
10,Conclusion,"We have developed a three-component system, viz. L/H/S@PMPC−ONA, as a fluorophore release strategy for in vivo imaging of H2O2, in which chemiluminescence of luminol was designed as a signal transduction trigger. The proofed system combining the poly(carbonate)s micelle, luminol, and hemin displayed excellently H2O2 discrimination either in cells or in vivo, demonstrated great performance of our design methodology. Compared with the conventional fluorophore release strategies, the proposed scaffold offers unique advantages and capabilities: Firstly, chemiluminescence of luminol as a trigger for fluorophore release would benefit fluorophore selection in probe design. Secondly, the designed approach modulated an indicator recognition unit via ‘click’ reaction, making it generalizable to other biomarkers of interest. Finally, the set-up is easily prepared and stored during the processing of in vivo imaging. The powerful chemiluminescence of luminol is successfully exploited to mediate signal transduction in living system, which may be beneficial to applications in other fields, especially in biochemical sensor design."
