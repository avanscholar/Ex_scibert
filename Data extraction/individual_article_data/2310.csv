0,Introduction,"Renewable energy has received considerable attention lately because of the high price of fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2) from the utilization of these fossil fuels [1]. Hydrogen is recognized as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels because of its high energy density of 122 kJ/g (2.75 times greater than the hydrocarbon fuel) [2] and its environmentally friendly characteristics i.e. after its combustion with oxygen, water is the only by-product. Dark fermentative hydrogen production can utilize various kinds of renewable materials (e.g. agricultural waste, food waste or the manufacturing wastewater from bio-industries) as substrates [3–6] with high hydrogen production rates and low cost of operation in comparison to photo-fermentation [7]. Dark fermentative hydrogen production under thermophilic conditions has recently drawn the interest of researchers due to higher rates of biochemical processes, less variety of fermentation end-products than mesophilic conditions and a reduction in the contamination of hydrogen-consuming microorganisms. Therefore, this study has employed thermophilic bacteria to produce hydrogen under a non-sterile condition. Bio-hydrogen can be produced by both pure and mixed cultures. However, the production of hydrogen by the mixed cultures has the drawbacks due to the variable compositions of the microbial communities [8] led to the difficulty in the optimization of the bio-hydrogen production conditions. In this study, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 (GenBank Accession no. JN020648) which was isolated from the hot spring sediment in our previous research was used as the hydrogen producer [9]. The strain KKU19 is capable to utilize various kinds of carbon sources in which xylose was preferred carbon source while peptone was the preferred organic nitrogen source. Currently, as much as 624,000 ha of land in Thailand are used for oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) cultivation, and 81 million cubic meters of old palm trees are generated annually, mainly as a result of the need to replace aging trees after 20–25 years [10]. The oil palm trunks (OPT) are made up of 34.5% cellulose, 31.8% hemicellulose (mainly xylan) and 25.7% lignin [3]. After the hydrolysis of these components, the fermentable sugars obtained can be used as substrate to produce hydrogen using microbes. Therefore, the bioconversion of the lignocellulosic materials into biofuels such as hydrogen and ethanol could be one way to make use of these OPT. In previous studies, the hydrolysis of OPT by microwave assisted sulfuric acid pretreatment was conducted in which a glucose concentration of 8.95 ± 0.99 g/L, xylose concentration of 8.29 ± 0.43 g/L and arabinose concentration of 4.57 ± 0.14 g/L were obtained [11]. Due to the fact that the hydrolysate of OPT is mainly composed of glucose, xylose and arabinose, this results in a low total COD (tCOD) to total nitrogen (TN) ratio (greater than 1000:1) while a suitable tCOD/TN for anaerobic digestion is reported to be 33:1 to 45:1 [5,6]. Therefore, the OPT hydrolysate is not suitable for the production of hydrogen. Thus a search for a nitrogen source to co-digest with OPT hydrolysate is needed in order to improve the hydrogen production rate from OPT and to supply a more balanced ratio of tCOD/TN. In this study, a slaughterhouse wastewater (SHW), which is rich in nitrogen content from clotted blood, was chosen to co-digest with OPT hydrolysate. In order to enhance bio-hydrogen production, the key factors affecting the production of hydrogen must be optimized. Initial cell concentration is one of the key factors that is important in hydrogen production under non-sterile conditions. This is because the inoculums augmented into the fermentation system at a low concentration might not be able to compete with the normal flora presence in the fermentation broth under non-sterile conditions. In addition, a suitable tCOD/TN ratio could enhance the productivity of hydrogen production [12,13] because the microorganisms utilize nitrogen for cell growth as well as hydrogen production. Iron has a great influence on the fermentative hydrogen production since it is a co-factor of the hydrogenase enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of hydrogen [14]. However, the hydrogenase enzyme could be inhibited by iron in high concentrations. NaHCO3 functions as a buffer to counteract with a decrease of pH due to an accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the fermentation broth during fermentative hydrogen production [15]. In contrast, a high concentration of NaHCO3 can result in an increase in CO2 caused by the dissolution of carbonate in the system, thus decreasing the hydrogen content in the gas phases [16]. Magnesium ions are required for the activity of many enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructo-1-kinases, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenases and enolases. The ions help stabilize cell membranes and help in the cell growth of hydrogen producers such as Clostridium sp. [17]. Copper can stimulate the activity of microorganisms and enzymes (in the glycolysis pathway) [18]. In regard to the above information, it can be seen that in order to achieve maximum hydrogen production potential (P s ), these key factors must be optimized. Most of the studies involving the optimization of the process parameters for hydrogen production have been investigated using a one-factor-at-a-time approach (a conventional technique). This method is time-consuming and often leads to misinterpretation of results when interactions between different components are present. Therefore, in order to get rid of these problems and to predict the interaction between the process parameters, the response surface methodology (RSM) has been used. Accordingly, this study aimed to enhance bio-hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate by co-digestion with SHW using a statistically based experimental design. Key factors affecting hydrogen production from the co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate and SHW was first screened using the Plackett–Burman method. Then, the key factors that influenced the P s were optimized using RSM with central composite design (CCD). The information from this study provides the optimum conditions that can maximize P s obtained from a co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism,"2.1 Microorganism T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 (GenBank Accession no. JN020648) was used as the hydrogen producer. It was isolated from hot spring sediment (Betong, Yala Province, Thailand) and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence in our previous research [9]. The strain KKU19 was cultivated in basal anaerobic (BA) medium [19] with 10 g/L glucose as a carbon source. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.5 by 5 N HCl or 5 N NaOH. The culture was incubated at 60 °C in a water bath for 24 h."
3,OPT hydrolysate and SHW,"2.2 OPT hydrolysate and SHW OPT was collected from the farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. It was chopped by knife, ground using a food blending machine and passed through a 2 mm screen. The ground OPT was pretreated using the microwave assisted sulfuric acid method, which follows the protocol of Khamtib et al. [11]. The resulting OPT hydrolysate was used as the substrate in this study. The SHW was obtained from the Nong Kae Municipal Slaughterhouse, Khon Kaen, Thailand at which there are ten pigs and two cows slaughtered daily. The average volume of wastewater is 2000 L/day. The SHW contains dilute and clotted blood, fat and some internal organs. The SHW containing debris was blended in food blender before being filtered through a 2 mm screen to remove any coarse particles. This filtrate was used as the nitrogen source throughout the study. The OPT hydrolysate and SHW were stored at −20 °C prior to use. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the OPT hydrolysate and SHW."
4,Plackett–Burman design,"2.3 Plackett–Burman design The Plackett–Burman design was used to screen and identify the key factors used to enhance hydrogen production from the co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate and SHW by KKU19. The investigated parameters were initial cell concentration (X 1), tCOD/TN ratio (X 2), FeSO4 concentration (X 3), NaHCO3 concentration (X 4), MgCl2 concentration (X 5) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6). The P s was selected as the dependent output variable. Based on the Plackett–Burman experimental design, each factor was prepared in two levels: −1 for low level and +1 for high level. Six assigned variables and 5 dummy variables were screened in twelve experiments formulated by Design Expert 7.0.0 Demo version (Stat-Ease Inc., MN, USA). The levels of each factor used in the experimental design and the design matrix are shown in Table 2 . The effect of each variable was determined using the following equation: (1) E ( X i ) = 2 ( ∑ M i + − M i − ) N , where, E ( X i ) is the concentration effect of the tested variable; M i+ and M i− are P s from runs where the variable (X i ) measured was present at the high and low concentration, respectively, and N is the number of runs. The factors at the 95% level (p ≤ 0.05) were considered to have a significant effect on P s and were used in the optimization step by RSM with CCD. In order to approach or locate the area of the optimum, the next step was conducted following the path of steepest ascent."
5,Response surface methodology (RSM),"2.4 Response surface methodology (RSM) RSM with CCD was used to evaluate the main and interaction effects of the affected factor obtained from the Plackett–Burman design. The P s was selected as the dependent output variable and a predictive polynomial quadratic equation was used in order to correlate the response variable to the independent variables. (2) Y i = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β i i x i 2 + ∑ β i j x i x j , where Y i is the predicted responses, x i is the parameters, β 0 is a constant, β i is the linear coefficients, β ii is the squared coefficients, and β ij is the cross-product coefficients. A differentiation calculation was then employed to predict the optimum values of the different factors giving the maximum P s . The quality of the fit of the quadratic model was expressed by the coefficient of determination, R 2, and its statistical significance was checked using F-test."
6,Batch fermentative hydrogen production,"2.5 Batch fermentative hydrogen production Batch fermentation was conducted in 120 mL serum bottles with a 70 mL working volume. The fermentation medium contained OPT hydrolysate, SHW, FeSO4, NaHCO3, MgCl2 and CuSO4. The inoculum was the cell pellets of the strain KKU19 obtained by the centrifugation of a suspension of the strain KKU19 at 5000 rpm for 20 min. After obtaining the cell pellets at a designated cell concentration, the cell pellets were re-suspended into the fermentation medium. The tCOD/TN ratio, FeSO4, NaHCO3, MgCl2 and CuSO4 were set according to the design. The medium was adjusted to the initial pH of 6.50 with 3 N HCl or 3 N NaOH. The serum bottles were capped with a rubber stopper, purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to create anaerobic conditions and then incubated at 60 °C in a water bath. During fermentation, the volume of biogas was measured by releasing the pressure in the serum bottles using wetted glass syringe. The fermentation process continued until biogas was no longer produced. All experiments were performed in triplicates."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). One unit of absorbance was equal to 0.5024 g dry cell/L. The concentrations of VFAs and alcohols were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu LC-10AD) with an Aminex HPX-87H column, which followed the method of Fangkum and Reungsang [20]. Carbohydrate concentration was determined using the colorimetric method [21]. TN was measured using the persulfate method [22]. The tCOD, soluble COD (sCOD), total solids (TS), total volatile solids (TVS), volatile suspended solids (VSS) and alkalinity were all measured using standard methods [23]. The tCOD/TN ratio was calculated using the following equation: (3) tCOD TN = tCOD OPT V OPT + tCOD SHW V SHW TN OPT V OPT + TN SHW V SHW , where, tCOD is the total COD of mixed OPT hydrolysate and SHW; TN is the total nitrogen of mixed OPT hydrolysate and SHW; tCODOPT and TNOPT are the total COD and total nitrogen of OPT hydrolysate; tCODSHW and TNSHW are the total COD and total nitrogen of SHW. The volume of biogas was determined using 20–50 mL wetted glass syringes [24]. The biogas produced was analyzed for hydrogen content by gas chromatography (GC) (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a 2 m stainless column packed with Shin carbon (50/80 mesh) following the method of Fangkum and Reungsang [20]. The cumulative hydrogen production (mL/L substrate) was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of hydrogen produced at each time interval was calculated using the mass balance equation [25]. A modified Gompertz equation was used to fit the cumulative hydrogen production curves to obtain the P s (mL H2/L substrate) as explained by Khanal et al. [26]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Screening of key factors affecting the co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW,"3.1 Screening of key factors affecting the co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW The relative importance of initial cell concentration (X 1), tCOD/TN ratio (X 2), FeSO4 concentration (X 3), NaHCO3 concentration (X 4), MgCl2 concentration (X 5) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6) for hydrogen production were investigated by Plackett–Burman design (Table 2). All 12 experiments that were designed by Design Expert software, are listed in Table 3 . A P s ranging from 117 ± 13 mL H2/L substrate to 1577 ± 39 mL H2/L substrate was obtained. Regression coefficient, F-values, P-values and effect values ( E X i ) were analyzed from six factors as shown in Table 2. The result of E X i , indicated that the initial cell concentration (X 1), tCOD/TN ratio (X 2), MgCl2 concentration (X 5) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6) had a positive effect on P s . A suitable initial cell concentration of the strain KKU19 is needed to outcompete normal flora contained in the SHW. A suitable tCOD/TN ratio is required because the nitrogen is needed for cell growth and cell metabolism [5,6]. The microelements such as magnesium, copper and chloride are important for hydrogen production since they are the cofactors of enzymes in the glycolysis pathway e.g. hexokinase, phosphofructo-1-kinases, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenases and enolases that enables the cell growth of Clostridium sp. [17,18,27]. In contrast, the FeSO4 concentration (X 3) and NaHCO3 concentration (X 4) showed a negative effect on P s . Although the iron is a cofactor of hydrogenase, which is important for hydrogen production, a high concentration of iron can inhibit hydrogen production [14]. The dissolution of carbonate at high concentrations of NaHCO3 can increase CO2 in the hydrogen production system, which in turn decreases the hydrogen content in the gas phase [16]. A high F-value and confidence levels greater than 95% (p-value ≤ 0.05) of initial cell concentration (X 1), tCOD/TN ratio (X 2) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6) indicated that they were statistically significant factors. Therefore, these three variables were selected for further optimization in order to obtain a maximum response in the next step. The FeSO4 concentration (X 3), NaHCO3 concentration (X 4) and MgCl2 concentration (X 5) were fixed at 25, 3000 and 1000 mg/L, respectively, in the optimization experiment."
10,The path of steepest ascent,"3.2 The path of steepest ascent The path of the steepest ascent was used to find the correct directions of changing variables. The directions of changing the initial cell concentration (X 1), tCOD/TN ratio (X 2) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6) are tabulated in Table 4 . The maximum P s of 2307 ± 91 mL H2/L substrate was obtained at 220 mg dry cell/L of initial cell concentration, 50 of tCOD/TN ratio and 15.00 mg/L of CuSO4 concentration (Run 2). Thus, this condition was used as the central point in the optimization experiment using RSM with CCD."
11,Effect of the key factors on a co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW,"3.3 Effect of the key factors on a co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW The effects of inoculum concentration (X 1), C/N ratio (X 2) and CuSO4 concentration (X 6) on P s ( Y P s ) were investigated during hydrogen fermentation. The maximum P s of 2655 ± 82 mL H2/L substrate was obtained in run 7 (initial cell concentration of 220 g dry cell/L, tCOD/TN ratio of 50 and CuSO4 concentration of 15 mg/L) while the lowest P s of 1230 ± 39 mL H2/L substrate was found in run 16 (initial cell concentration of 186.4 g dry cell/L, tCOD/TN ratio of 50 and CuSO4 concentration of 15 mg/L). The multiple regression analysis of experimental data (Table 5 ) resulted in the quadratic equation shown below (Eq. (4)) (4) Y P s = 2546.79 + 140.75 X 1 − 33.43 X 2 − 90.23 X 6 + 12.51 X 1 X 2 − 4.94 X 1 X 6 − 77.54 X 2 X 6 − 380.54 X 1 2 − 205.35 X 2 2 − 135.53 X 6 2 . The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the model indicated that the model significantly represents the experimental data (p-value < 0.0001). A high determination coefficient (R 2) of 0.9840 and the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2) of 0.9695 suggested that the model can explain 97–98% variability of the response variable. In addition, lack of fit of the model was insignificant (p-value = 0.5314) indicating that Eq. (4) properly described the P s (Table 6 ). The response surface plots based on the graphical representations of quadratic regression equation Eq. (4) are shown in Fig. 1 A–C. The P s increased with an increase in initial cell concentration (X 1) from 200 to 223.78 mg dry cell/L and then decreased with a further increase in initial cell concentration greater than 223.78 mg dry cell/L (Fig. 1A and B). Under a non-sterile condition, the indigenous microflora present in the substrate i.e. mixed OPT hydrolysate and SHW might outcompete the strain KKU19 at low initial cell concentrations. An increase in initial cell concentration of the strain KKU19 to a concentration greater than the optimum value could contribute to a production and accumulation of fermentation metabolites i.e., VFAs, causing a rapid drop of pH in the fermentation broth, which could inhibit the growth of hydrogen producers [28]. Moreover, with a high accumulation of VFAs in the fermentation broth, the ionic strength of the solution will increase, resulting in a switch from hydrogen and acids productions to solvent production [29]. Therefore, the initial cell concentration should be compatible with the available substrate for maximizing bacterial activity. An increase in the tCOD/TN ratio (X 2) from 40 to 49.87 resulted in an increase in P s (Fig. 1A and C). However, a further increase in the tCOD/TN ratio (X 2) above 49.87 caused a reduction in P s . At the optimum tCOD/TN ratio, the microbes use nitrogen from the substrate to enhance cell growth and hydrogen production [5,6]. However, a low tCOD/TN ratio (excess N content) could decrease hydrogen production because ammonium ions generated from protein and nitrogen complex degradation can inhibit cell growth and hydrogen production. A high tCOD/TN ratio (low N content) could decrease hydrogen production efficiency because nitrogen is deficient for cell growth [30]. The optimum tCOD/TN for hydrogen production from co-digestion was reported to be in the range of 33:1 to 45:1 [5,6] depending on the types of substrate and microorganisms. Our results showed a similar trend in which the optimum tCOD/TN ratio was 49.87. The effect of CuSO4 concentration (X 6) was similar to the effect of inoculum concentration (X 1) and tCOD/TN ratio (X 2) on P s in which the P s increased with an increase in CuSO4 concentration (X 6), from 10 to 13.33 mg/L, and then decreased when the CuSO4 concentration (X 6) was further increased above 13.33 mg/L (Fig. 1B and C). It was reported that Cu2+ at a concentration of 8 mg/L had a stimulating effect on the activity of microorganisms [31] and on the activation or function of microbial enzymes and coenzymes such as glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, and hydrogenase [18]. However, hydrogen production could be over 50% decreased when the Cu2+ concentration was as high as 30 mg/L. This is because Cu2+ is toxic to the microbial cells [32]."
12,Optimization and confirmation of the experiment,"3.4 Optimization and confirmation of the experiment The predicted optimum conditions for a maximum P s were an initial cell concentration of 224 mg dry cell/L, a tCOD/TN ratio of 49.87 and a CuSO4 concentration of 13.33 mg/L, in which a maximum predicted P s of 2575 mL H2/L substrate was obtained. To validate the adequacy of the model, five experiments were conducted under the optimum, high (run 11), medium (run 6) and worst (run 13) conditions (Table 7 ) as well as the control, which was the treatment where only the OPT hydrolysate was used as the substrate to produce hydrogen using the strain KKU19. Under the optimum conditions, the observed P s of 2604 ± 86 mL H2/L substrate was obtained, which is only 1.10% different from the maximum predicted P s (2575 mL H2/L substrate). The result indicated that the statistical experimental design i.e. RSM with CCD, is a useful tool for optimizing fermentative hydrogen production conditions. In addition, the P s at optimum conditions i.e., OPT hydrolysate co-digested with SHW (2604 mL H2/L substrate) was comparable to the P s obtained when the OPT hydrolysate (control) was supplemented with yeast extract at the same tCOD/TN ratio (Table 7). The results suggested that SHW can replace the costly nitrogen source i.e. yeast extract, in this case, which in turn can reduce this abundant waste. At the optimum condition, the main soluble metabolite products (SMPs) were butyric acid (48.81%), acetic acid (24.55%) and ethanol (20.83%) (Table 7). The presence of high amounts of butyrate and acetate in this study indicated that the hydrogen fermentation was butyrate-acetate type fermentation. Comparisons of the results on P s obtained in this study to the other literature searches are shown in Table 8 . The P s obtained in this study (2604 mL H2/L substrate) was approximately 1.34 times higher than the results obtained when only OPT hydrolysate was used as the substrate to produce hydrogen using hot spring enriched cultures (1948 mL H2/L substrate) [11]. However, the P s from our co-digestion study is lower than the studies of Hniman et al. (2011) [4] who used only OPT hydrolysate as the substrate to produce hydrogen using hot spring enriched cultures. The differences in the hydrogen production might be due to the differences in the types of microorganisms, hydrolysis conditions, compositions of the hydrolysate and fermentation conditions."
13,Conclusions,"This study successfully enhanced hydrogen production by co-digesting the OPT hydrolysate with SHW. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production from co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW were identified as an initial cell concentration of 224 mg dry cell/L, at COD/TN ratio of 49.87 and a CuSO4 concentration of 13.33 mg/L. The P s from the confirmation experiment under optimum conditions was 2604 ± 86 mL H2/L substrate, which was only 1.10% different from the predicted P s (2575 mL H2/L substrate). The main SMPs were butyric acid (48.81%) and acetic acid (24.55%). In addition, co-digestion of OPT hydrolysate with SHW gave a comparable P s (2604 ± 87 mL H2/L substrate) to the OPT hydrolysate supplemented with the yeast extract at the same tCOD/TN ratio (2604 ± 87 mL H2/L substrate). Our results indicated that SHW can be used to replace the costly nitrogen source."
