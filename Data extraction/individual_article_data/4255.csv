0,Introduction,"In order to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems, which are mainly caused by the widespread utilization of fossil fuels, various green energy storage and conversion systems are attracting more and more interest [1–3]. Among them, hydrogen-based fuel cell is considered as one of the most sustainable and clean power sources because it can efficiently convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to electric energy to power future electric cars and mobile applications without generating any greenhouse gases or toxic products [4,5]. However, as is well known, the hydrogen gas is still confronted with difficulties in the transportation and storage, and its industrial production is accompanied with huge energy consumption and large amounts of greenhouse gases release [5,6]. Therefore, increasing efforts are devoted to develop technologies for in situ hydrogen production from a stable liquid fuel under mild conditions [7], and the most critical factor for practical applications is to find an appropriate liquid organic molecule as the hydrogen carrier. Recently, many liquid organic hydrogen carriers including methanol, ethanol, glycerol and ethylene glycol, have been taken into consideration as the feed of proton exchange membrane fuel cells [8,9]. There are many advantages to handle and transport these liquids, such as high energy density, low cost, added safety, and possibility of utilization of existing oil infrastructures. However, for those organic molecules with multi-carbons, the cleavage of the strong C–C bond usually needs to overcome a high barrier and the electrooxidation product distribution is hard to control [10]. Therefore, methanol (CH3OH), as the simplest mono-carbon alcohol, is considered as a prominent and promising fuel with an energy density of 15.6 MJ⋅L−1, several times larger than that of liquid hydrogen (4.7 MJ⋅L−1) [11]. On top of this, methanol can be renewably produced from biomass and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as methane (CH4), contributing to the carbon cycle in nature [12]. All of these advantages enable direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) to have the potential as alternative power sources to solve energy shortage and environmental pollution issues. Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is an important process in DMFCs and plays a significant role in the cell performance [13]. To enhance the reaction rate and tune the product selectivity, many research efforts have been devoted to seek an efficient and durable catalyst in the past decades. For instance, the interactions between methanol molecules and pure transition metal surfaces, such as Pd, Pt, Ni, Rh, Cu, etc., have been theoretically studied [14–17]. The results demonstrate that although these pure metal surfaces, especially various Pt surfaces, can show outstanding performance in the initial stage, their active sites are easily occupied by the produced carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen atoms, leading to a significantly decreased reaction rate [14–17]. To modify the electronic structure and improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst, alloying Pt with other metals is a promising strategy, which can exert the ligand effect on Pt and reduce its usage to some extent [13,18–20]. However, the energy barriers of methanol decomposition on bimetallic Pt-based catalysts are still very large and the catalyst cost is also unaffordable for industrial applications, so novel non-noble metal catalysts are needed to further improve the reaction activity and reduce the cost. Since the successful preparation of grapheme [21], two-dimensional (2D) materials have been applied in many electrochemistry areas and exhibited excellent performance [22–25], which is due to that they usually possess the advantages of unique structures, low-coordination environment, large specific surface area, high carrier mobility and excellent durability [26]. However, the reaction mechanism of MOR on 2D materials has been rarely studied, hence it is worth wondering whether 2D materials can act as novel catalysts to give a better performance than traditional Pt-based catalysts. Additionally, the MOR mechanism is generally considered to involve two parts that include the methanol decomposition process and the further oxidation of the decomposition intermediates [7,11,16,27]. Based on previous studies, it can be found that adsorbed CO species usually appears as the final product of methanol decomposition on traditional catalysts and the further oxidation of the reaction intermediates are relatively difficult [14,28,29]. In most cases, the over-strong adsorption of CO can even poison the active sites and limit the catalyst durability [14,28]. On the contrary, the produced formic acid (HCOOH) from the further oxidation of the decomposition intermediates can be easily dissolved in alkaline media, avoiding the block of active sites [11]. Moreover, the selective conversion of methanol to formic acid can avert the release of undesirable gases, such as CO or CO2, and the commercial value of formic acid is also fourfold higher than that of methanol, contributing to reduce the overall fuel cost [30,31]. Therefore, while the conversion of methanol to formic acid does not allow the complete extraction of the fuel energy, it is still economically profitable and sustainable to find an eligible catalyst to further oxidize the decomposition intermediates to formic acid. It can be known from previous studies that due to excellent electronic properties, Mo-based carbides have been used in many electrochemical reactions and exhibited promising performances [7,32,33]. Since phosphorus atoms have more abundant electronic structures than carbon atoms, Mo-based phosphides are also expected to possess desirable electrochemical properties. Furthermore, Shao et al. [34] have found that the Mo2P monolayer with hexagonal structure has metallic characteristics, high stability and excellent mechanical properties. Therefore, in this work, we theoretically investigated the MOR mechanism on the Mo2P monolayer based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The initial bond scission is systematically analyzed based on the steric effect, activation Gibbs free energy decomposition and the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationships. To identify the facile reaction pathway, we calculated the Gibbs free energies of activation and reaction of each elementary step involved in the MOR process. The generated CO species is combined with the adsorbed OH group and H atom to form HCOOH, which has a higher commercial value than CH3OH and can be easily dissolved in alkaline media to avoid the block of active sites. Therefore, this study can not only help us better understand the MOR mechanism, but also provide an efficient and cost-effective bifunctional catalyst for MOR."
1,Computational details,"Based on DFT, the spin-polarization method was adopted for all theoretical calculations carried out in DMol3 program [35,36]. The electronic exchange–correlation energy was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the form of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [37], and the dispersion force was corrected by using the Grimme method [38]. Besides, the double-numerical basis with polarization (DNP 4.4) scheme was used to describe the valence electron functions and the DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSPP) was adopted for core electrons treatment [39]. The thermal smearing values and the convergence criteria for force, energy and displacement during the geometric optimization are the same as those in our previous studies [40,41]. The water environment was simulated by the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) with a dielectric constant of 78.54 [42]. A 4 × 4 supercell for the Mo2P monolayer was constructed to explore the MOR process and the vacuum thickness in the z-direction was set as 20 Å to avoid the interactions between imaginary atoms. The reaction intermediates were adsorbed on one side of the Mo2P monolayer without symmetry restrictions, and all atoms in the adsorbed system were optimized to the equilibrium state with the k-point grids and the global orbital cutoff set to be 6 × 6 × 1 and 5.0 Å, respectively. Furthermore, 10 × 10 × 1 k-point grids were adopted to calculate the electronic properties including density of states and electron density difference. The adsorption Gibbs free energy of each reaction intermediate was defined as (1) G ad = E sub - adsorbate - E sub - E adsorbate + Δ H vib + Δ ZPE - T Δ S where E sub , E sub - adsorbate and E adsorbate stand for the energies of the substrate without and with the adsorbate adsorption, and the adsorbate in the isolated state, respectively, and T is the temperature (298.15 K). According to the previous studies, the vibrational contributions to the enthalpy (H vib), zero point energy (ZPE), and entropy (S) can be obtained from the calculated vibrational frequencies [41]. More importantly, only the adsorbed species in the adsorption system were employed to compute vibration frequencies to reduce computational cost. To confirm the reliability of this simplicity, we compared the adsorption Gibbs free energies obtained from the partial and whole vibrational frequency calculations. For the whole vibrational frequency calculations, the adsorption Gibbs free energies of CH3OH, CH3O and CH2O species on the Mo2P monolayer are −0.62 eV, −3.54 eV and −2.39 eV, respectively, which are very close to those computed from the partial vibrational frequencies (−0.64, −3.55 and −2.42 eV, respectively). Therefore, only calculating the partial vibrational frequency for adsorbed species can not only significantly reduce the computation cost, but also ensure the high quality of results. To examine the thermal stability of the Mo2P monolayer and predict the feasibility of its experimental fabrication, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed in a canonical ensemble (NVT) with the time step and the total simulation time set to be 2.0 fs and 10.0 ps, respectively. The Nosé−Hoover chain thermostat was used to keep the system at 500 K [43,44]. Besides, the cohesive energy was also evaluated via (2) E coh = ( E 2D - N Mo E Mo - N P E P ) / ( N Mo + N P ) where E 2D , E Mo , and E P represent the energies of the 2D material, the isolated Mo atom, and the isolated P atom, respectively. N Mo and N P are the numbers of the Mo and P atom, respectively. To illustrate the kinetic barriers in the MOR process, transition state (TS) searches were performed with the complete linear synchronous transition/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method [45]. The TS structures were found to show only one imaginary frequency. The activation Gibbs free energy (G act) and reaction Gibbs free energy (G rea) were calculated through (3) G act = G TS - G IS (4) G rea = G FS - G IS where G IS, G TS, and G FS are the energies of initial state, transition state, and final state, respectively. Besides, the transition-state theory (TST) formalism [46] was used to predict the rate constants of all the elementary steps and it was demonstrated as (5) k = k B T h Q TS Q IS exp - G act RT = A exp - G act RT where kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck’s constant, R is the gas constant, and A is the pre-exponential factor [17]. Q TS and Q IS are the partition functions at the initial state and transition state, respectively. To explore further insights into the factors governing the selectivity of the bond scission, the energy barrier of each elementary reaction (E act) can be divided into six parts and its definition is demonstrated as follow (6) E act = Δ E sub + Δ E AB def + E AB IS + E int TS - E A TS - E B TS where Δ E sub = E sub TS - E sub IS exhibits the effect of the structural change of the substrate from IS to FS on the activation barrier ( E sub TS and E sub IS represent the energies of the substrate at TS and IS, respectively). Δ E AB def refers to the deformation energy, defined as the energy difference of AB in the TS and IS. In the initial bond scission stage, AB represents CH3OH and B represents H or OH. According to the definition of adsorption Gibbs free energy in the main text, the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the Mo2P monolayer can be described by E ad = E sub - adsorbate - E sub - E adsorbate . Therefore, E AB IS and E A TS ( E B TS ) are the minus adsorption energies of AB in the IS and A (B) in the TS without B (A), respectively. E int TS is the interaction between A and B in the TS geometry and it usually includes two parts, i.e. the direct Pauli repulsion between A and B, and the bonding competition effect caused by sharing substrate atoms between A and B [47,48]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,"Structural, electronic and stability properties of the Mo2P monolayer","3.1 Structural, electronic and stability properties of the Mo2P monolayer After the full optimization of atomic positions and lattice vectors, the stable structure of the pristine Mo2P monolayer is displayed in Fig. 1 a. It can be found that the Mo2P monolayer possesses a hexagonal structure with the space group P 6 ¯ m 2 , similar to the structures of our previously studied Fe2P and BP monolayers, which exhibit outstanding activity in electrocatalysis reactions [24,41]. The lengths of the Mo–Mo and Mo–P bonds are 3.12 Å and 2.37 Å, respectively, and the lattice constant is 3.09 Å, all of which are consistent with previous studies [34], confirming the reliability of our calculation results. As shown in Fig. 1b, the electronic properties of the Mo2P monolayer are calculated. Obviously, the total density of state (DOS) of the Mo2P monolayer has large values around the Fermi level, which is mainly contributed by the d-orbitals of the Mo atoms. Therefore, the Mo2P monolayer is metallic and has high carrier mobility, promoting electron transfer and methanol activation during the MOR process. Furthermore, the d-orbitals of the Mo atoms have a good degree matching with the p-orbitals of the P atoms below the Fermi level, indicating that strong hybridization can be formed between these constituent atoms and the monolayer system has a good structural stability. The cohesive energy is also calculated through Eq. (2) and the absolute value is 4.85 eV·atom−1, which is significantly higher than that of phosphorene (3.30 eV·atom−1) [49], silicene (3.98 eV·atom−1) [50], and Fe2P monolayer (4.33 eV·atom−1) [24], demonstrating the great feasibility of experimental fabrication. To explore the thermal stability of the Mo2P monolayer at high temperature, AIMD simulations were performed at 500 K for 10 ps and the results are presented in Fig. 1c–e. It can be clearly found from Fig. 1c that the constituent atoms just slightly vibrate around their equilibrium states and the structure has ting change after annealing. Besides, the system temperature also fluctuates in a narrow range (Fig. 1d) and the normalized radial distribution function g(r) still exhibits discrete peaks in the long range, illustrating that the Mo2P monolayer possesses excellent thermal stability and can maintain good crystallinity even at 500 K."
4,Adsorption properties of methanol and its oxidation intermediates,"3.2 Adsorption properties of methanol and its oxidation intermediates In this section, we carried out a systematic investigation on the adsorption of methanol and its oxidation intermediates on the Mo2P monolayer. The most stable adsorption configurations of the surface intermediates CH x OH y (x = 0–3, y = 0–1) are displayed in Fig. 2 , and the corresponding adsorption Gibbs free energies as well as structural parameters are listed in Table 1 . As demonstrated in Fig. 2, CH3OH binds to the Mo2P monolayer at the TMo site through the O atom with a O–Mo distance of 2.23 Å. It can also be known from Table 1 that CH3OH is chemisorbed on the Mo2P monolayer with the adsorption Gibbs free energy of −0.64 eV, indicating that the methanol molecules can be quickly captured by the catalyst and the catalytic efficiency can be significantly enhanced. Besides, the bond lengths of adsorbed CH3OH are calculated to be 0.98 Å (0.97 Å) for O–H and 1.46 Å (1.43 Å) for C–O, which are slightly larger than the corresponding values of gas-phase CH3OH (in parentheses), while the C–H bond length has no change after adsorption. This is mainly due to that the O–H bond is closer to the catalyst than the C–H bond and the O atom has a strong interaction with the surface Mo atom, weakening the O–H and C–O bond strengths. Methoxy (CH3O) is upright adsorbed on the Mo2P monolayer at the F3Mo site via the O atom (Fig. 2), which is similar to the previous result on Rh (111) surface[17].There has a strong interaction between CH3O and the Mo2P monolayer with the adsorption Gibbs free energy of −3.55 eV (Table 1), which is greatly smaller than that of the CH3OH adsorption (−0.64 eV), hence the initial O–H bond scission is thermodynamically favorable. In addition, the O–Mo bond length in the adsorbed CH3O system (2.21 Å) is slightly shorter than that in the adsorbed CH3OH system (2.23 Å), further confirming the stronger attraction between CH3O and the catalyst surface. As is well known, formaldehyde (CH2O) is an important intermediate during both the decomposition and synthesis of methanol. It prefers to be adsorbed at the F3Mo site via the η3(C)–η1(O) mode with the C–O bond length of 1.39 Å (Table 1). Besides, the adsorption of CH2O on the Mo2P monolayer can release large amounts of energy (2.42 eV), hindering desorption of CH2O from the catalyst surface and facilitating its further dehydrogenation to formyl (CHO). The adsorption Gibbs free energy of CHO (−3.52 eV) is also significantly smaller than that of the CH2O adsorption (−2.42 eV), further indicating that the conversion of CH2O to CHO may be favorable. Additionally, it can be concluded from Fig. 2 that the C–H bond scission products including hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), hydroxymethylene (CHOH) and hydroxymethylidyne (COH) prefer the H3Mo adsorption site through both the C and O atoms. As listed in Table 1, the adsorption Gibbs free energy of CH2OH (−3.36 eV) is less negative than that of the CH3O (−3.55 eV), which is due to that the CH3 group is far away from the catalyst surface, leading to a reduced steric effect and a stronger CH3O adsorption strength. In contrast, the adsorption Gibbs free energies of CHOH and COH are −4.95 eV and −4.94 eV, respectively, which are evidently more negative than those of CH2O (−2.42 eV) and CHO (−3.52 eV), respectively. This is because that the steric effects of CHOH and COH are smaller than those of CH2O and CHO, respectively. The steric effects are mainly induced by the repulsive interaction between different atoms with like charge. Based on Hirshfeld calculations, the Mo and H atoms usually possess positive charges due to their relatively small electronegativity, while the C, O and P atoms have negative charges. It can be found from Fig. 2 that the C atoms of the CHOH and COH species are located at the H3Mo site and bonded with three Mo atoms, while the C atoms of the CH2O and CHO species prefer the F3Mo site above the P atom, leading to a repulsive interaction between the C atom and the P atom because of like charge. Besides, all the H atoms in the CH2O and CHO species point toward the Mo atoms, and they have a closer distance than those in the cases of the CHOH and COH adsorption, further enhancing the repulsion between the CH2O (CHO) species and the Mo2P monolayer, and reducing their adsorption strengths. As the final decomposition product of CH3OH, CO is usually the main factor causing the deactivation of catalysts [14,28]. Here, CO is stably adsorbed onto the B2Mo site via the η2(C)–η1(O) mode on the Mo2P monolayer and the adsorption Gibbs free energy is −2.31 eV (Table 1), which is more negative than those on the surfaces of other methanol decomposition catalysts such as Pt (111) (−1.82 eV) [14], Pd (100) (−1.87 eV) [51], Rh (111) (−2.00 eV) [17], and Pt3Ni (100) (−2.14 eV) [13]. Therefore, to avoid the poison of the Mo2P monolayer by CO, it is desirable and valuable to find an efficient way for the removal of CO from the catalyst surface. As is well known, the hydroxyl (OH) group can often be seen on the catalyst surface during the MOR process in the water environment. It may origin from the methanol or water dissociation and plays a key role in the removal of CO. OH is preferably adsorbed at the F3Mo site through the O atom with the adsorption Gibbs free energy of −4.29 eV (Table 1), which is smaller than previous studies[16] and favors the reaction between CO and OH. Additionally, the water dissociation process on the Mo2P monolayer is displayed in Fig. 3 a. It can be found that the G act and G rea are 0.44 eV and −1.37 eV, respectively, illustrating that the H2O dissociation is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable. More importantly, the H2O dissociation barrier on the Mo2P monolayer is smaller than that on the bifunctional Pt1/MoC(111) catalyst (0.56 eV) [7], indicating that it is easier for the former catalyst to provide OH species for the removal of CO. Atomic H is the main product of each elementary step of methanol decomposition and it binds to the Mo2P at the H3Mo site (Table 1). As presented in Fig. 3b, the G act of H movement from one stable adsorption site to another is very small (0.17 eV), contributing to hydrogenation utility in DMFCs. According to previous studies, the adsorbed CO can be transformed to CO2 or HCOOH [7,11]. As displayed in Fig. 2 and Table 1, both CO2 and HCOOH are chemisorbed on the Mo2P monolayer through the η2(C)–η1(O)–η1(O) mode. The adsorption Gibbs free energy of CO2 (−1.85 eV) is significantly smaller than that of HCOOH (−1.03 eV), demonstrating that desorption of HCOOH from the Mo2P monolayer is easier. Moreover, it is a known fact that OH group can be adsorbed on the catalyst surface as pre-adsorbed species in the alkaline environment. Therefore, to explore the effect of base condition, we further optimized the structure of the Mo2P monolayer with the co-adsorption of HCOOH and OH species. The calculated adsorption Gibbs free energy of HCOOH is significantly reduced from −1.03 eV to −0.76 eV, indicating that the desorption barrier can be easily overcome under ambient conditions [52]. After the formed HCOOH species being dissolved in alkaline media, the CH3OH molecules can be adsorbed and reduced on the Mo atoms again to release hydrogen. Hence, it is more desirable to convert the adsorbed CO species to HCOOH in this work."
5,Initial bond scission in MOR,"3.3 Initial bond scission in MOR Based on aforementioned analysis, it can be known that CH3OH can be stably chemisorbed on the Mo2P monolayer with the adsorption Gibbs free energy of −0.64 eV, which is smaller than those on Pt (111) surface (−0.33 eV) [14], Pd (100) surface (−0.52 eV) [51], and Rh (111) surface (−0.58 eV) [17]. Therefore, methanol molecules can be easily captured and activated by the Mo2P monolayer, which contributes to the promotion of the MOR process and the enhancement of the conversion efficiency. To provide an intuitive view about the interaction between the CH3OH molecule and the Mo2P monolayer, the deformation electron density of the most stable adsorption configuration was calculated and presented in Fig. 4 a. It can be found that the electron redistribution occurs between the CH3OH molecule and the Mo2P monolayer, showing the existence of interaction between them. Based on Hirshfeld calculations, we also quantitatively obtain the transfer charge from the CH3OH molecule to the catalyst is 0.14e. Moreover, there is an electron accumulation region close to the O atom and above the Mo atom, indicating that the O atom can attract electrons from the Mo atom and a covalent bond is formed between the O atom and the Mo atom. As is well known, the methanol decomposition reaction is a complex network, but the initial bond scission of the activated CH3OH species can directly determine the primary pathway and the selectivity of products. Therefore, it is important to investigate the initial step of the methanol decomposition on the Mo2P monolayer. The first step of the methanol decomposition involves the O–H, C–H or C–O bond scission. As listed in Table 2 , the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of all elementary reactions involved in the methanol decomposition were calculated, and the corresponding structures of the IS, TS and FS involved in the competitive route of methanol decomposition are displayed in Figs. 5 and 6 . It can be obtained from Table 2 that the initial C–O bond scission has a rather high G act (1.23 eV), implying that it is very difficult to take place at ambient temperature. This phenomenon is similar to previous studies, and thus the C–O bond scission is usually not taken into consideration [13,14]. In contrast, the initial O–H and C–H bond scissions have relatively low G act (0.29 eV and 0.49 eV, respectively). Hence both bond scissions can occur under ambient conditions. It is worth noting that the O–H bond scission is more favorable than the C–H bond scission because the scission of the O–H bond has a lower G act value. When explicitly considering the solvent effect, the Mo2P monolayer is usually pre-covered by the OH and H species, which come from the water and the base or acid dissociation. To explore the effect of adsorbed OH and H species on the MOR process, we calculated the activation barriers of methanol decomposition on the Mo2P monolayer with the pre-adsorption of OH and H species. The computed Gibbs free energy barriers of initial CH3OH decomposition via O–H and C–H bond scissions are 0.21 and 0.44 eV, respectively, which are close to the values obtained on the bare catalyst surface (0.29 and 0.49 eV, respectively). Moreover, in both cases, the O–H bond scission is more favorable. Therefore, it can be found that although the adsorbed OH and H species may change the calculated Gibbs free energy diagram, the reaction trend has no change and the obtained intrinsic activity of the bare Mo2P monolayer can also provide a useful guidance for experimental studies. There are several reasons to explain why the O–H bond scission is easier than the C–O and C–H bond scissions. First, the nature of the initial bond scission can be understood based on the steric effect. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that to decrease the steric effect of the CH3 group, CH3OH binds to the monolayer through the O atom and the CH3 group is far away from the surface. Consequently, the O–H bond takes a closer position to the Mo2P monolayer than the C–H and C–O bonds, leading to remarkable charge redistribution in the O–H bond. Besides, it can also be known from above analysis that the bond lengths of O–H and C–O are elongated from 0.97 Å and 1.43 Å to 0.98 Å and 1.46 Å, respectively, while the C–H bond length has no change. Although the C–O has the largest bond length change, which is mainly due to the strong repulsion between the CH3 group and the monolayer surface, the C–O bond strength is significantly larger than that of the O–H and C–H bonds, so it still consumes large amounts of energy for C–O bond scission. More importantly, as illustrated in Fig. 5a and b, the TS1 has a more similar structure to the adsorbed CH3OH species than that of the TS2, reducing the repulsion between adsorbed fragments and increasing the stability of the transition state. Second, the selectivity of the O–H, C–H and C–O bond scissions can be understood by analyzing the relationships between the G act and G rea in each elementary step, also known as the BEP relationship[53]. As demonstrated in Fig. 4b, all elementary steps involved in methanol decomposition reaction are written as exothermic steps and the IS as well as FS are determined. It can be found that a rough linear BEP relationship is obtained for each type of bond scission and the beelines for the C–H and O–H bond scissions are close to each other, indicating that these two bond scissions have intense competition in the MOR. The linear regression equations for the C–H, O–H, and C–O bond scissions are G TS = 1.18 G FS + 1.69 (eV), G TS = 0.98 G FS + 1.34 (eV), and G TS = 1.06 G FS + 3.80 (eV), respectively. The square of the correlation coefficients for the C–H and O–H bond scissions are 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. The intercept of the C–O bond scission (3.80 eV) is remarkably larger than those of the other two beelines, so the C–O bond scission is very difficult to occur. Besides, the intercept of the O–H bond scission is slightly smaller than that of the C–H bond scission, implying that the former reaction is more favorable. More importantly, these constructed linear relationships can help us quickly predict the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of any elementary step involved in the methanol decomposition process. Third, the selectivity of the C–H and O–H bond scission can also be understood based on their product stabilities. It can be observed from Table 1 that the adsorption of CH3O is more stable than that of CH2OH on the Mo2P monolayer (−3.55 eV vs −3.36 eV), accounting for the preference of the initial O–H bond scission. This is similar to the preference of the initial O–H bond scission on the PtRu (111) surface, on which the adsorption of CH3O is more strong than that of CH2OH (−2.26 eV vs −2.14 eV)[54], and different from the preference of the initial C–H bond scission on the Pt (111) surface, on which the adsorption of CH3O is less stable than that of CH2OH (−1.54 eV vs −1.98 eV)[14]. To explore further insight into the factors governing the selectivity of the bond scission, the energy barrier of each elementary reaction is decomposed. As show in Table 3 , the substrate undergoes a subtle change in all elementary steps and its value has a neglect effect on the selectivity of bond scission. For the initial decomposition of the adsorbed CH3OH species, E AB IS has the same value in the scissions of the O–H, C–H and C–O bonds, which is mainly due to that they have the same reactant. Regarding of the initial C–O bond scission, Δ E AB def and E A TS have significantly larger and smaller values than the other two bond scissions, respectively, both of which help to evidently increase the activation energy of the C–O bond scission. Moreover, the smallest E A TS of the C–O bond scission also confirms the aforementioned analysis that there is a strong steric effect in the adsorbed CH3OH species, which is caused by the CH3 group. For the initial O–H bond scission, the interaction between two dissociated fragments in the TS ( E int TS = 2.70 eV) is smaller than that of the initial C–H bond scission ( E int TS = 2.83), consistent with the above structural analysis. Besides, the adsorption of CH3O in the TS is stronger than that CH2OH ( E A TS , 2.79 eV vs 2.64 eV), helping to stabilize the TS. Therefore, the O–H bond scission has smaller activation energy than the C–H bond scission and is more preferable to occur."
6,MOR mechanism,"3.4 MOR mechanism In this section, we first identify the facile pathways for methanol decomposition on the Mo2P monolayer. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of all elementary steps involved in the methanol decomposition have been calculated and listed in Table 2, and the corresponding IS, TS as well as FS structures are presented in Figs. 5 and 6. From the analysis in Section 3.3, it can be known that the initial C–O bond scission is significantly difficult to take place, while both the initial O–H and C–H bond scissions can occur at ambient temperature. Moreover, the decomposition of CH3OH to CH3O is more favorable than to CH2OH from both the perspectives of kinetics and thermodynamics. These results can also be clearly and easily obtained from Fig. 7 a. Firstly, it is worth noting that the final-state energy of one elementary step is different from the initial-state energy of the following elementary step in Fig. 7a. For instance, for the reaction CH2O* → CHO* + H*, the relative Gibbs free energy of the final state (CHO* + H*) is −1.78 eV, while the relative Gibbs free energy of the initial state for the nest reaction CHO* → CO* + H* is −1.03 eV. This energy difference (−1.78 eV vs −1.03 eV) is mainly caused by the removal of H atom. It can be known from Fig. 3b that the G act of the H atom movement is very small (0.17 eV), indicating high mobility on the monolayer. Therefore, it is easy for the H atoms to be utilized in DMFCs after being released from methanol and its decomposition intermediates. Here, to efficiently compare different elementary steps and identify the decomposition mechanism, we neglect the small effect of H coverage on the decomposition barrier of methanol oxidation intermediates. The further dehydrogenation of CH3O to CH2O has a large G act of 0.69 eV, showing that this elementary step is not kinetically facile. In contrast, the decomposition of the generated CH2OH to CH2O has a low G act close to zero and its G rea is −1.27 eV, which is much smaller than the G rea of the CH3O dehydrogenation reaction (−0.54 eV). Therefore, the O–H bond scission of CH2OH is more favorable than the C–H bond scission of CH3O from both the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects (Fig. 7a). To explain the intrinsic reason for this preference, as shown in Table 3, the contribution factors of the activation barrier were comprehensively investigated. It can be found that the E AB IS of CH3O decomposition via C–H bond scission (4.20 eV) is evidently larger than that of CH2OH decomposition via O–H bond scission (3.23 eV), indicating that the strong interaction between CH3O and the Mo2P monolayer accounts for the high activation barrier of CH3O decomposition. Then, the formed CH2O species can be subsequently dehydrogenated to CHO and CO with very low G act values of 0.16 eV and 0.03 eV, respectively, which are mainly caused by the very high E A TS value (4.00 eV) and the very low E int TS value (0.39 eV), respectively. Besides, these two dehydrogenation barriers are remarkably smaller than the desorption barrier of CH2O from the monolayer surface (2.42 eV), facilitating the complete extraction of hydrogenation energy stored in the CH3OH molecule. More importantly, these two dehydrogenation steps are exothermic, demonstrating that they are also thermodynamically feasible. As is well known, in addition to the O–H bond scission, the CH2OH decomposition may also proceed via the C–H bond scission with G act and G rea of 0.14 eV and −0.69 eV, respectively. Obviously, the O–H bond scission of CH2OH is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than the C–H bond scission. Furthermore, unlike the facile dehydrogenation of CH2O and CHO, both the CHOH dehydrogenation via the O–H bond and the COH dehydrogenation have relatively large G act values (Table 2), which are mainly caused by the strong attraction between the Mo2P monolayer and the CHOH as well as COH ( E AB IS = 4.64 eV and 4.56 eV, respectively). Therefore, it can be concluded from above results that the methanol decomposition reaction on the Mo2P monolayer may proceed via two competitive pathways, i.e., CH 3 OH → CH 3 O → CH 2 O → CHO → CO and CH 3 OH → CH 2 OH → CH 2 O → CHO → CO . To provide further insights into the methanol decomposition pathway, the pre-exponential factor and the rate constant of each elementary step were estimated and presented in Table 2 as well as Fig. 7b. It can be found that the rate constant (k) of the initial C–O bond scission (2.08 × 10−7 s−1) for methanol decomposition is much smaller than those of the initial C–H (2.17 × 104 s−1) and O–H (4.78 × 108 s−1) bond scissions, implying that the C–O bond scission is not competitive for methanol decomposition. While the initial O–H bond scission occurs faster than the initial C–H bond scission, the k of the further dehydrogenation of CH2OH via the O–H bond scission (2.15 × 1013 s−1) is significantly higher than that of the further dehydrogenation of CH3O (1.24 × 102 s−1). Therefore, the initial decomposition of CH3OH may also occur through the competitive scission of the C–H bond. Besides, the sequential dehydrogenation of CH2O to CHO and CO can occur easily and the corresponding k values are 4.38 × 1010 s−1 and 1.23 × 1013 s−1, respectively. In contrast, the dehydrogenation of CHOH via the O–H bond scission and the dehydrogenation of COH have relatively smaller k values (2.74 × 107 s−1 and 1.73 × 106 s−1, respectively) than those of the sequential dehydrogenation of CH2O to CHO and CO. Therefore, the decomposition of the generated CH2OH is more likely to proceed via the O–H bond scission than the C–H bond scission, which is consistent with the conclusion based on the calculated G act values. Considering all elementary steps of the whole MOR process, the route CH3OH → CH2OH → CH2O → CHO → CO indeed is more favorable than the route CH3OH → CH3O → CH2O → CHO → CO. This is mainly because that the former route has a smaller barrier in the rate determining step (0.49 eV vs 0.69 eV). However, the initial CH3OH decomposition via the O–H bond scission has a significant smaller barrier than that via the C–H bond scission, and the further dehydrogenation of CH3O to CH2O can also be overcome under ambient conditions [52]. Thus the latter route is still facile and will compete with the former route. This phenomenon is similar with the MOR mechanism on the Pt3Ni (100) surface [13]. Besides, it is noteworthy that the formation of CH3O has a much smaller activation barrier than its dehydrogenation, which may cause CH3O accumulation and induce the catalyst poison. Considering the following dehydrogenation reactions with very small activation barriers and the competing C–H bond scission route of methanol decomposition, the conversion of CH3O to CH2O can be promoted and the formation of CH3O can also be inhibited to a certain extent. Therefore, the CH3O poisoning effect can be significantly reduced. To better understand the excellent activity of the Mo2P monolayer for methanol decomposition, the calculated results are compared with previous studies. The activation barriers of the rate-determining steps on the Pt (111) surface [14], the Pt1/MoC catalyst surface [7], and the Rh (111) surface [17] are 0.51, 0.67 and 0.72 eV, respectively. All these surfaces have been believed to be efficient catalysts for methanol decomposition, but the usage of noble metals limit their commercial applications. Here, the Mo2P monolayer not only has a smaller activation barrier for methanol decomposition than those three surfaces, but also just consists of earth-abundant elements. Therefore, the Mo2P monolayer may be a promising catalyst for methanol decomposition. From above analysis, it can be known that only considering the methanol decomposition process, the Mo2P monolayer can act as an efficient catalyst in DMFCs to facilitate the dehydrogenation of CH3OH. However, desorption of CO from the Mo2P monolayer (G ad = −2.31 eV) has the same difficulty with those from the Pt (111) surface and the Rh (111) surface [14,17], which are easily poisoned by the adsorbed CO species after initial reaction stage. According to previous studies, it is desirable to convert the adsorbed CO species to CO2 or HCOOH to avoid the deactivation of the catalyst [7,54]. It has been clarified in the above section that the dissociation of water molecules can form some OH groups on the catalyst surface, and thus the reactions between the surface OH group and the CH2O, CHO as well as CO intermediates are systematically investigated and the results are displayed in Fig. 8 . It is a known fact that CH3O and CH2O are usually important intermediates in the MOR process and can be easily formed. As shown in Fig. 8a, the reaction between the adsorbed CH2O and CH3O species on the Mo2P monolayer needs to overcome a very high barrier of 2.38 eV, which is significantly higher than their dehydrogenation barriers. For the TS structure, it can be observed that the O-C bond of the CH3O species inclines to the monolayer, increasing the repulsion between the CH3 group and the monolayer. Therefore, it is difficult for the combination of CH2O and CH3O species. Besides, CH2O may also be oxidized by the OH group. The G act and G reaof the oxidization reaction are 1.96 and 1.71 eV (Fig. 8b), respectively, implying that the reaction between CH2O and OH is kinetically and thermodynamically difficult to occur. Similarly, the reaction between CHO and OH also has large positive G act and G rea values. Therefore, CH2O and CHO prefer the dehydrogenation rather than the oxidation reaction, which contributes the utility of the hydrogen energy stored in CH3OH. As presented in Fig. 8d and e, the adsorbed CO species can be oxidized to CO2 or COOH by the OH group. It is worth noting the G act of the CO2 production (1.70 eV) is much higher than that of the COOH production (1.08 eV), which is comparable to the barriers for the further conversion of CO to CO2 on the Pt (111) surface (1.15 eV) and the Pt1/MoC catalyst (0.91 eV) [7]. Furthermore, the combination of the generated COOH and H species has a low G act of 0.77 eV, indicating that this reaction can readily occur under ambient temperature. In conclusion, the further oxidization of the adsorbed CO species on the Mo2P monolayer is easier than desorption from the monolayer surface and the catalytic activity is comparable to Pt-based catalysts."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, based on first-principles calculations, the MOR mechanism on the Mo2P monolayer is systematically studied. The results show that the Mo2P monolayer has large values of total electron distributions around the Fermi level, indicating that the monolayer is metallic and has high carrier mobility. It can also be found from the AIMD simulations that the structure of the Mo2P monolayer can remain very well even at 500 K, showing high thermal stability and great promise for experimental fabrication. Then the initial bond scission of CH3OH is comprehensively investigated. Compared with the initial C–H and C–O bond scissions, the initial O–H bond scission is found to be the most favorable and bears the lowest G act. Based on the analysis of steric effect and the G act decomposition, the higher G act values for the initial C–H and O–H bond scissions are mainly caused by the strong repulsive interaction, large structural deformation, and the low adsorption ability of the decomposed fragments in their transition states. The BEP linear relationships are also constructed to compare the O–H, C–H and C–O bond scissions. The intercept of the C–O bond scission is remarkably larger than those of the other two beelines, and the C–O bond scission is very difficult to occur. More importantly, these constructed linear relationships can help us quickly predict the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of any elementary step involved in the methanol decomposition process. After the initial decomposition of CH3OH, the further dehydrogenation of CH2OH via the O–H bond scission has a significantly lower G act than the dehydrogenation of CH3O. Therefore, the initial C–H bond scission can actually occur and the methanol decomposition reaction on the Mo2P monolayer may proceed via two competitive pathways, i.e., CH 3 OH → CH 3 O → CH 2 O → CHO → CO and CH 3 OH → CH 2 OH → CH 2 O → CHO → CO . Additionally, the generated CO species is found to be able to react with the OH group, which is produced by the dissociation of water molecules on the Mo2P monolayer, and the G act of the oxidization reaction is greatly lower than the desorption Gibbs free energy of CO. On top of this, the formed HCOOH has a higher commercial value than the fuel itself and can be easily dissolved in alkaline media to avoid the block of active sites. Besides, the Mo2P monolayer has a comparable activity with the Pt-based catalyst for methanol dehydrogenation and the further oxidization of CO [7].Therefore, this study not only provides a better understanding of the MOR mechanism, but also finds an efficient and cost-effective bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen and formic acid production in the MOR process."
