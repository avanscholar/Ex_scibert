0,Introduction,"To this date, it is well known that hydrogen is an excellent energy carrier [1]. Due to the unavoidable depletion of fossil fuel resources (oil, coal and natural gas) and the absolute necessity to drastically reduce CO2 emissions, H2 is expected to play a key role in near-future energy systems, such as fuel cells. As an example, since 2014, H2-fuel cell vehicles are commercialized by some of the main automotive manufacturers [2]. The main challenge nowadays is related to the efficient and environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. In this sense, catalytic steam reforming of methane is the main large-scale H2 production process [3], which accounts for 96% of the currently H2 production. However, the severe reaction conditions of this technology (high temperatures ~800 °C), together with the low purity of the H2 produced (the product stream is a mixture of H2, CO and CO2) motivated the search for alternative technologies. Water electrolysis is a “state-of-the-art”, well developed, clean technology, and it has been employed for commercial production of pure H2 for many decades [4]. The main drawback of this process is related to the unfavourable thermodynamics for the electrochemical splitting of the water molecule, which requires electrical potentials of at least 1.23 V at reaction temperatures below 100 °C (which is typically the case). Hence, even under the most optimistic situation, water electrolysis process is highly energy demanding, achieving values typically around 50–60 kWh/kgH2 in commercial water electrolysers [5]. In order to overcome this issue, in the last years, alcohols electrolysis has gained growing attention for efficient production of hydrogen [6–10]. The thermodynamics for the electro-oxidation of alcohols is significantly favoured compared to that for water electrolysis (1–2 orders of magnitude, depending on the alcohol: 106 mV for 2-propanol, 84 mV for ethanol and 16 mV for methanol [11]). Therefore, in theory, this technology would allow drastically enhancing the production of hydrogen at lower electrical potentials. The operational system of an electrochemical alcohol reformer is similar to a water electrolysis cell. Under alkaline environment, the electro-oxidation of the alcohol takes place at the anode (e.g. Eq. (1) for methanol), while water electro-reduction reaction takes place at the cathode, with the subsequent production of pure H2 (Eq. (2)). (1) Anodic reaction: CH3OH + 6 OH− → CO2 + 5 H2O + 6 e− (2) Cathodic reaction: 2 H2O + 2 e− → H2 + 2 OH− Previous studies of alcohol electrolysis have commonly used different membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) configurations based on commercially available acid (Nafion) [12–14] or alkaline (Fumapem, Tokuyama) [15,16] membranes. Nonetheless, a previous study of our group [17] has demonstrated the possibility of working in a membrane-less reactor configuration, using a liquid electrolyte, which may solve the main stability and degradation issues related to the use of these polymeric membranes [18,19]. High temperatures could lead to an inadequate humidification which would result in mechanical membrane failures, such as pinholes, cracking, tearing or blistering. Besides, a non-uniform pressure between electrodes or the presence of radicals formed during cell operation could also deteriorate mechanical, chemical or electrochemically the membrane [20]. However, in all of these previous studies, faradaic hydrogen production rates have been always experimentally measured in good agreement with the electrochemical nature of the reactions occurring under electrochemical reforming conditions (e.g. Eqs. (1) and (2) for the case of methanol). As a result, the energy consumption per kg of hydrogen in all of those systems increased with the current density values (i.e., hydrogen production rates). Consequently, the hydrogen production is energy demanding. We propose to overcome this limitation by operating the alcohol electrolyser under electrochemical promotion of catalysis conditions. The phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC), discovered and developed by the group of Prof. Vayenas [21–23], is based on the activation of an heterogeneous catalyst by the electrochemical supply of promoter ions from a solid electrolyte. This phenomenon allows promoting and enhancing the catalytic reaction rates by the application of electrical polarizations. The EPOC phenomenon has been proved for a wide variety of catalytic processes [22,24–26], mainly in high temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells for gas-phase catalytic reactions operating between 250 and 600 °C. However, some few studies have also reported the EPOC effect in low temperature liquid phase systems (based on liquid electrolyte configurations) for different catalytic reactions such as: the hydrogen oxidation [27–30], the oxidation of aldehydes [31], the hydrogenation of maleic acid [32] and the oxidation of hydrazine [33]. For instance, according to Anastasijevic et al. [31], the current efficiency of hydrogen evolution during the oxidation of formaldehyde can exceed 100% efficiencies due to reaction sequences which do not include an electron transfer, although they are still potential dependent. Furthermore, the work of Neophytides et al. [27,28] reported a non-Faradaic enhancement in a liquid alkaline solution for H2 oxidation on Pt electrodes. This electrochemical promotion is the result of the effect of the applied potential on the work function and chemisorptive properties of the electrodes surface. In this study, for the very first time in literature, the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis under liquid phase conditions has been coupled with an alcohol electrolysis system in order to obtain over-faradaic hydrogen production rates. Under the explored reaction conditions, the applied electrical current served for both: performing the electrochemical reactions and enhancing the coverage of promoter ions on the anode to boost the catalytic H2 production rates via methanol decomposition. Hence, in a first stage, we have demonstrated that over-faradaic hydrogen production rates can be obtained in an alcohol electrolysis cell based on an alkaline ionic commercial membrane (PEM cell) working under methanol cross-over conditions. Then, in a second stage, we have developed a membrane-less alcohol electrolyser configuration (MOFE) which may allow simplifying the further scale up of this concept working in a single electrochemical/catalytic reactor. This way we combined the electrolysis of an alcohol molecule (methanol) with the catalytic methanol dehydrogenation reaction enhanced by means of the low-temperature liquid EPOC phenomenon. This novel electrocatalytic configuration leads to an “over-faradaic” efficiency in the hydrogen production rate which results into a drastic decrease in the energy consumption values."
1,Experimental,
2,Electrodes preparation,"2.1 Electrodes preparation Commercial Pd supported on Carbon Vulcan XC-72 (20 wt% Pd/C, Alfa Aesar) and commercial Pt on Carbon black (20 wt% Pt/C; Alfa Aesar) were used as the cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. In each case a catalyst ink was prepared (by mixing each catalyst powder with isopropanol) and then sprayed on Carbon Paper (Fuel Cell Earth) with an aerograph. The metal loading was controlled by weight measurements until it reached a value of 1 mg·cm−2 for each electrode."
3,Polymer electrolyte membrane reactor,"2.2 Polymer electrolyte membrane reactor The initial experimental tests were performed in a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolysis cell (schemed on the Figure S1, supporting information) with a geometric electrode area of 6.25 cm2. The Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) was composed of these two electrodes and an Alkaline Exchange Membrane (Fumapem FAA-3-50, Fuel Cell Store). The MEA was introduced between two Teflon gaskets to ensure sealing and a proper physical separation between anodic and cathodic compartments. Graphitic bipolar plates with channel grooves to supply the liquid solutions were placed on both sides of the MEA. All elements were finally placed between two external Teflon plates covered with metallic end plates and were uniformly tighten with nuts and bolts. Electrochemical tests were performed using a Vertex 5A.DC potentiostat-galvanostat electrochemical analyser (Ivium Technologies). The anodic and cathodic compartments were fed with different aqueous solutions (as shown in Fig. 1 a) at a constant flow rate of 10 mL·min−1 using a peristaltic pump (Pumpdrive 5001, Heidolph). The gas phase of the cathodic out-stream was separated from the liquid one (by condensation) and measured by a gas volumetric flowmeter. The gas phase flowrate was measured with a gas volumetric flowmeter, where the time needed for the displacement of 20 mL of volume was measured three times at each applied current (and an average value was taken with a margin error less than 5%). The H2 gas-flow rate was compared to the theorical one obtained via Faraday’s Law calculations, based on the cell current. Gas products were analysed by using a double channel gas chromatograph (Bruker 450 GC), equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors capable of detecting H2, CO, CO2 and light carbonaceous compounds (methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic and acetic acids, …). No gas-flow products were detected in the anodic compartment of the electrolysis cell in any case. The liquid feed streams were recirculated to the feeding reservoirs with an overall solution volume of 2 L. Three kind of electrochemical tests were performed at 65 °C: linear sweep voltammetry measurements at a scan rate of 10 mV·s−1 in an applied potential range between 0 and 1.2 V, galvanostatic transients from 0 to 0.5 A, to experimentally measure hydrogen production rates, and a chronopotentiometry test at 0.5 A for 8 h for stability analysis. Liquid phase products from this chronopotentiometry were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, which was carried out on a SPECTRUM TWO spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer) in transmission mode (550–6000 cm−1)."
4,Membrane-less reactor,"2.3 Membrane-less reactor In the second part of the study, a membrane-less electrochemical reformer (schemed on Figure S2, supporting information) with a geometric electrode area of 10.5 cm2 and a liquid solution as electrolyte was used to perform further experimental tests. In this system, the cathode and the anode are exposed to the same fuel-electrolyte mixture solution in a single chamber reactor configuration. Electrodes (distanced 3.5 mm from each other) were placed between ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) gaskets and Teflon (PTFE) frames and were in touch with the bipolar plates which served as current collectors. Two external Teflon plates covered with metallic end plates finally sealed the uniformly tight cell. Electrochemical tests were performed using the same potentiostat-galvanostat and the same feeding system. In this reactor, the aqueous fuel-electrolyte solution was fed at a much larger constant flow rate of 23 mL·min−1. The cell outlet stream was cooled down to 20 °C to separate the gas-liquid phases. The gas stream went through the flowrate measurement device and was further analysed in the gas chromatograph (Bruker 450 GC). The liquid stream was again recirculated to the feeding reservoirs with an overall solution volume of 2 L. Two different alkaline electrolytes (KOH, NaOH) and two alcohol molecules (methanol and ethanol) were tested with a concentration 1 M on each one. Experimental tests were performed at different reaction temperatures by different electrochemical tests: linear sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV·s−1 in 0–1.4 V range, galvanostatic transients experiments from 0.1 to 1 A to experimentally measure hydrogen production rates and chronopotentiometry test at 0.8 A for stability analysis. Liquid samples from this test were analysed in order to quantify the total carbon concentration using a Multi N/C 3100 Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyser (Analytik Jena)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Activity measurements in the polymer electrolyte membrane reactor,"3.1 Activity measurements in the polymer electrolyte membrane reactor Firstly, the electrochemical performance of the PEM reactor based on the alkaline membrane was studied for the three different configurations schemed in Fig. 1a. The feed streams were modified in both compartments, depending on the PEM configuration studied. Configuration 1 was designed for conventional water electrolysis, with an alkaline aqueous solution (1 M KOH) fed to both compartments. Configuration 2 depicts a standard configuration for alkaline PEM alcohol electrolysis cells [15,34] where 1 M MeOH solution (in 1 M KOH) was fed to the anodic compartment, and a 1 M KOH solution was fed to the cathodic one. Configuration 3 was developed as a new approach to combine methanol electro-oxidation (at the anode) with methanol catalytic conversion enhanced via EPOC (at the cathode). In this case, anodic and cathodic compartments were both separately fed with 1 M MeOH (in 1 M KOH) aqueous solutions. Linear sweep voltammetry experiments were carried out in a potential range from 0 V to 1.2 V, at a scan rate of 10 mV·s−1 and at a constant temperature of 65 °C. Fig. 1b shows the electrochemical performance of the three configurations above described. As expected, no current was obtained in this range of cell potentials in Configuration 1, since the minimum thermodynamic potential required for water electrolysis is 1.23 V. In Configuration 2, an almost linear increase of the obtained current values was observed as the applied potential increased. As previously reported for the alkaline electrolysis of organic molecules [15,34], it could be attributed to the methanol electrolysis process, where water is reduced at the cathode to produce pure H2 (Eq. (2)), and methanol is electro-oxidize at the anode (Eq. (1)). Ideally, the electro-oxidation of methanol on Pt-based anodes in alkaline medium involves several steps, leading to its total conversion to CO2 (Eq. (1)) [35]. However, no gas flow at all was observed in the anodic chamber in any of the experimental configurations. If the complete oxidation reaction occurred, CO2 formed could further react to produce carbonate species dissolved in the aqueous solution (Eq. (3)) [36]. The absence of gaseous products could also be explained on account of the partial electro-oxidation of methanol, which could lead to the production of soluble reaction intermediates such as formaldehyde, formate and methyl formate (Eqs. (4)–(6)) [35–37]. (3) CH3OH + 8 OH− → CO3 2− + 6 H2O + 6 e− (4) CH3OH + 2 OH− → H2CO + 2 H2O + 2 e− (5) CH3OH + 5 OH− → HCOO− + 4 H2O + 4 e− (6) 2 CH3OH + 4 OH− → HCOOCH3 + 4 H2O + 4 e− In the case of Configuration 3, where a separated methanol alkaline solution was also fed into the cathodic chamber, the electrochemical cell performance was not affected, obtaining similar electrical currents to those in Configuration 2. In other words, the presence of the alcohol on the cathode under the explored reaction conditions seemed to have a negligible effect on the electrochemical cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (Eq. (2)), showing that no additional electrochemical process (e.g., a hypothetical methanol electro-reduction reaction) is taking place. In order to investigate the amount and composition of the hydrogen produced in these configurations, the gas production rate and composition of the outer cathode stream was experimentally measured for Configurations 2 and 3 via gas-volumetric flow measurements and gas chromatography analysis. For that purpose, galvanostatic transient experiments were performed from 0 to 0.5 A (20-min step change of 0.1 A), at T = 65 °C (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the Faradaic efficiency (Λ) was calculated by Eq. (7): (7) Λ % r H 2 − r 0 H 2 I n · F · 100 where: rH2 and r0H2 refer to the experimental hydrogen production rate measured upon polarization and under open circuit potential conditions, respectively; I is the applied current (in A); n is the number of exchanged electrons = 2; and F is Faraday’s constant (96,485 C mol−1). It should be emphasized that, in all the experiments, hydrogen was the only gas product detected in all chromatographic analysis of the cathode feed (as shown in the supporting information, Figure S3), which confirmed a ≥99.99% hydrogen purity. Neither CO nor CO2 were detected at all according to our low detection limit of 0.5 ppm in the gas stream. Furthermore, no carbonaceous species were detected in the FID analysis. As it can be observed in Fig. 2, under open circuit potential conditions (no electrical current applied), no hydrogen was produced in any of the configurations ( r 0 H 2 = 0) . Upon polarization, the standard alcohol electrolysis configuration (Configuration 2) led to experimental hydrogen production values practically identical to the ones calculated via Faraday’s Law, as expected, leading therefore to Faradaic efficiency values of ~100%. This observation is in good agreement with all of the previous studies reported in literature on electrochemical reforming of methanol [38], ethanol [39] or glycerol molecules [34,39,40]. However, the experimental measured hydrogen production values obtained in Configuration 3 at the five different explored current values were higher than those predicted by the Faraday law. In other words, Faradaic efficiencies under the presence of methanol in the cathodic compartment exceed 100%, reaching a value up to 145% at 0.5 A. Considering that the electrochemical response for both Configurations 2 and 3 is similar, i.e., the same current-potential values were obtained during the linear voltammetry shown in Fig. 1b, the additional production of hydrogen observed on Fig. 2 could not be attributed to an electrochemical process. As the unique difference between Configurations 2 and 3 is the presence of methanol in the cathode, the most plausible explanation is that an additional catalytic reaction can take place in the cathode producing hydrogen from methanol. Taking into account the negligible hydrogen production measured at Open Circuit Conditions, this reaction is promoted by the polarization. Hence, the water electro-reduction (Eq. (2)) is coupled with the catalytic methanol dehydrogenation into hydrogen (reaction mechanism will be later developed) at the cathode, activating electrochemically the catalyst. It implies that, upon positive potentials, the Pd/C simultaneously behaves both as a cathode for the faradaic H2 production and as a catalyst for the methanol dehydrogenation reaction producing an additional amount of hydrogen. The electrochemically promoted methanol dehydrogenation at the cathode can be explained according to the promotional rules of Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis [41]. Briefly, upon the application of positive cell polarizations, the OH− ions migrate from the cathode to the anode (Eq. (2)). At the same time, the cationic species (in this case, K+ ions contained in the aqueous KOH liquid electrolyte) will be attracted to the cathode (the negative pole). Consequently, the coverage of K+ species on the Pd/C cathodic catalyst will increase, then modifying the electronic properties of Pd. The promotional effect of alkali ions, such as K+, on the catalytic activity of noble metals has been extensively studied in literature for a wide variety of catalytic processes [26]. In general, the presence of these cationic promoters allows decreasing the work function of a catalyst surface, enhancing the chemisorption of electron-acceptor species, and/or weakening the chemisorption of electro-donor compounds present in the reaction media. For instance, in a previous study, Gonzalez-Cobos et al. [42] reported that at 360 °C, the addition to a Ni-based catalyst of K+ ions electrochemically supplied from a solid electrolyte material could dramatically enhance the gas phase methanol dehydrogenation reactions. Based on these assumptions, we propose a global mechanism (schematized on Fig. 3 ) to explain the overproduction of hydrogen on the Pd cathode based on two separate processes. This mechanism describes a catalytic pathway for methanol dehydrogenation which does not involve any electrons transfer, in contrast with what happens in the case of the electrochemical reactions shown before (Eqs. (1)–(6)). The dissociative chemisorption of methanol on metal surfaces by the O–H bond breakingto produce CH3O intermediates is commonly accepted as the first step in catalytic methanol dehydrogenation [43]. As reported by Yang et al. [44], in alkaline medium, the O–H bond breaking in Pd catalysts is more kinetically favourable due to the catalytic reaction between the methanol and the hydroxyl species from the aqueous electrolyte (Eq. (8)), leading to the formation of adsorbed methoxy-intermediates. (8) CH3OH + OHad → CH3Oad + H2O These methoxy intermediates can be further decomposed into formaldehyde (Eq. (9)) [42] and eventually to formic (HCOO−) and carbonate (CO3 2−) species [31], with the subsequent production of hydrogen via a catalytic route (Eqs. (10)–(15)). (9) CH3Oad → H2COad + Had (10) CH2O + OH− → CH2(OH)O− (11) CH2(OH)O− → CH(OH)Oad − + Had (12) CH(OH)Oad − → COad + OH− + Had (13) COad + OH− → HCOO− (14) HCOO− + OH− → CO3 2− + H2 (15) 2 Had → H2 (16) Overall reaction: CH3OH + 2 OH− → CO3 2− + 3 H2 ΔG0 f = −47.16 kJ·mol−1 According to previous studies on catalytic methanol dehydrogenation and reforming reactions [42], CH3Oad species behave as electron acceptor molecules. Hence, as the applied polarization increases, the electrochemically driven K+ ions supplied from the solution to the Pd cathode can enhance the chemisorption of methoxy species and their further dehydrogenation, leading to the production of hydrogen. As previously mentioned, the carbon-derived compounds produced at the cathode (formaldehyde, formate, etc) are soluble in the alkaline solution. That might explain why only H2 was the only one gas detected at the cathode, as shown in the supporting information, Figure S3. In order to analyse the stability of the system and to qualitatively study the presence of these carbon-derived compounds in the alkaline solution, a chronopotentiometry test (shown in the supporting information, Figure S4) was performed at 0.5 A for 8 h. The cathodic liquid phase was sampled at different times and was analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) (Fig. 4 ). In first place, this experiment confirms the good stability of the system for mild operation times leading to over-faradaic H2 production rates (Figure S4). On the other hand, some differences were observed on weaker bands of the FTIR analysis attributed to a slight modification of the catholyte recirculated composition solution (the strong bands remained constant). Strong bands appearing at 3300, 2120, 1640 and 625 cm−1 are characteristic of OH bonds from aqueous the KOH solution, as it can be observed in the supporting information (Figure S5). Weaker bands observed at 2990, 2905, 1405, 1385, 1110 and 1015 can be attributed to C–O and O–H alcohol bonds, as shown in an aqueous methanol spectrum (supporting information, Figure S5). Nonetheless, the increase and appearance of weak bands between 1500 and 850 cm−1 frequencies supported the evidence of carbon-derived intermediates formation. Carboxylic acids and aliphatic aldehydes absorb weakly in 1440–1395 and 1440–1325 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, carboxylic acids can be responsible for the increase in 1260–1200 cm−1 and formates for the ones in 1080–1000 cm−1 [45]. Finally, weak-to-medium intensity bands in the 975–780 cm−1 region can be attributed to an aldehydic C–H deformation vibration or an out-of-plane deformation band characteristic of carboxylic acids [45]. In summary, even if the strongest bands showed no differences, the slight differences in medium and weak intensity bands suggested that intermediate carbonaceous species were present in the cathodic outlet liquid phase (formic, aldehydes and formates), in agreement with the methanol dehydrogenation reaction mechanism (activated under polarization by EPOC) previously shown (Eqs. (10)–(15)). In any case, these experiments demonstrate, for the very first time, the possibility to produce an “over-faradaic” H2 production rate in a liquid alcohol electrolysis cell at low potentials. These results also evidence the interest of using an electrochemical reactor for boosting methanol dehydrogenation at almost room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions."
7,Activity measurements in the membrane-less reactor,"3.2 Activity measurements in the membrane-less reactor Considering that over-faradaic hydrogen production rates were obtained in the polymer electrolyte membrane reactor, just exclusively working under methanol cross-over conditions, a membrane less-reactor configuration was developed. This single chamber reactor would allow directly supplying the MeOH-KOH aqueous solution to both electrodes, looking for non-faradaic hydrogen production rates in a simplified reactor design. In addition, the removal of the alkaline membrane is completely justified in this system considering the absence of O2 gas evolution as well as any other gas molecules, (e.g., CO or CO2) neither in the anode and the cathode under the explored alkaline environment (as already shown on the PEM reactor section). Two alcohol molecules (methanol and ethanol) as well as two different alkali electrolytes (KOH and NaOH) were fed to the single chamber membrane less reactor configuration, as shown in Fig. 5 . The different composition inlets tested were 1 M EtOH and 1 M KOH, 1 M MeOH and 1 M NaOH, and 1 M MeOH and 1 M KOH. In these experiments, galvanostatic transient experiments were performed from 0.1 to 1 A (20-min step change of 0.1 A), at T = 65 °C, determining the gas composition (Figure S6) and the H2 production rates via gas chromatography and gas-volumetric flow measurements in each applied current. Besides, the inset of the Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical performance of the three different composition inlets tested via linear sweep voltammetry experiments at a scan rate of 10 mV·s−1 and a 0–1.4 V range, and at T = 65 °C. In first place, it can be observed that a similar electrochemical behaviour of the two fuel solutions including KOH as liquid electrolyte was attained. However, lower current density values were obtained by feeding NaOH as liquid electrolyte, which can be attributed to the lower ionic conductivity of this latter [46]. It may potentially hinder the OH− pathway along the ionic liquid electrolyte from the cathode to the anode. Comparing both alcohol molecules, a slightly better electro-catalytic performance is obtained under methanol vs. ethanol (with the same liquid electrolyte), due to the higher kinetics of the electro-oxidation of the former (high binding energy of C–C in ethanol), in good agreement with previous studies [39,47]. However, the most interesting part of the figure comes from the different experimental H2 production measurements. It can be observed that the H2 production were always Faradaic for the case of MeOH-NaOH and EtOH-KOH feeding solutions. Over-faradaic hydrogen production rates were only observed when MeOH-KOH solution was fed, in good agreement with the experiments in the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) reactor discussed in the previous section. These results demonstrated that the additional amount of H2 produced via catalytic dehydrogenation of the alcohol assisted by EPOC could only be obtained under very specific condition, with MeOH as organic molecule (MeOH) and K+ as promoter ion. This could be easily rationalized considering that the catalytic decomposition of methanol is kinetically favoured vs. ethanol decomposition reaction. In fact, previous studies have shown that H2 production via catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol may occur at temperatures below 95 °C under aqueous alkaline conditions [48], while ethanol dehydrogenation reaction takes place at temperature above 200 °C [49]. Regarding the alkali ion, in general, heavy alkali ions promote basic-catalysed reactions in a more pronounced way than light alkali ions, since the basicity of the counterion present in the solution (OH− in this case) is controlled by its size [50]. Therefore, potassium has a higher electronic promoter effect compared to sodium, due to its bigger atomic radium. In fact, potassium has been reported as the alkali which possesses the strongest influence on metals such as platinum [51]. Concerning the composition of the outlet gas streams, ≥99.99% hydrogen purity streams were always obtained for all the cases, as verified by detailed TCD analysis of the GC. In the supporting information (Figure S6) some examples of the GC analysis under H2 over-production conditions are shown, which evidenced again the absence of any hydrocarbon in the outlet gas stream under all the explored reaction conditions. Moreover, a chronopotentiometry test was performed at 0.8 A for 180 min and at T = 65 °C to analyse the stability of the system (Figure S7a). The outlet liquid phase samples from this test were analysed in order to quantify the carbon concentration (ppm) using a Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyser (Figure S7b). Over 180 min test, total carbon concentration remained constant, proving, once again, the absence of hydrocarbon in the outlet gas. Fig. 6 shows the influence of the reaction temperature on the experimentally measured hydrogen productions rates obtained under a series of galvanostatic transient experiments (from 0 to 1 A). As it can be observed from this figure, at the same applied current, hydrogen production rates were higher at higher reaction temperatures, i.e., higher faradaic efficiencies were obtained. As an example, the figure shows the H2 faradaic efficiency values calculated via Eq. (7) at 1 A at the three explored reaction temperatures. The increase in the faradaic efficiency with temperature demonstrates that the contribution of the catalytic H2 production rate vs. the electrochemical one, at fixed current, becomes more important at higher reaction temperatures. It agrees well with the proposed mechanism displayed on Fig. 3 to explain the non-faradaic hydrogen production rates observed in this study. In fact, one of the aspects that also points out the catalytic nature of this over-faradaic hydrogen is its behaviour with temperature. Following the Arrhenius Equation, the reaction rates are sensitive functions of temperature. Hence, it is logical to expect a higher hydrogen production via the catalytic route already discussed (Eqs. (10)–(15)) as temperature increased. Indeed, the obtained over-production hydrogen production rates fitted well to the Arrhenius Equation (Figure S8). In this figure, hydrogen over-production rates obtained from Fig. 5 at three different temperatures and at two applied currents (0.5 and 1 A) were fitted to the Arrhenius Equation, obtaining a lower activation energy at a higher current. As already described, catalytic dehydrogenation is only activated upon polarization, and the coverage of K+ species on the Pd/C cathodic catalyst increases with the applied polarization promoting the catalytic route described (Eqs. (10)–(15)) and decreasing its activation energy."
8,Energetic analysis of the different electrolysers configuration,"3.3 Energetic analysis of the different electrolysers configuration According to the obtained results, the energy requirements for the production of 1 kg of hydrogen were calculated (Fig. 7 ) at different applied currents for Configurations 2 and 3 in the PEM reactor (results from Fig. 2) and for the membrane-less reactor (results from Fig. 6). In first place, it can be observed that lower energy requirements where obtained at the same current value for the case of the membrane-less reactor. Considering that the same anode and cathode materials as well as the same experimental conditions (T = 65 °C and 1 M MeOH–1 M KOH solution) were employed in both systems, the higher ionic conductivity of the liquid KOH electrolyte vs. the commercial Tokuyama membrane should explain the results. The results were in good agreement with the higher current density values obtained in linear sweep voltammetries (Figs. 1 and 5) and also, with the previous study where a membrane-less reactor was firstly tested [17]. As expected, values obtained from Configuration 3 were lower than those for Configuration 2, due to the additional over-faradaic hydrogen production rates. It is also worth noticing that while in Configuration 2, a typical linear increase in the energy demand with the applied potential was obtained, Configuration 3 and the membrane-less reactor allowed increasing the hydrogen production rate without any additional increase in the relative energy. The energy consumption values upon current density values of 60 mA·cm−2 became nearly constant. In other words, in these cases, the growing amount of catalytically H2 produced with the polarization compensates the typical linear energetic increase in the electrocatalytic H2 production process. Therefore, these results demonstrate the interest of this novel electrolysis configuration concept for the development of highly efficient electrolysis systems of low electrical energy demands. It may contribute to the field of hydrogen production via renewable energy resources (electrical energy and bioalcohols streams)."
9,Conclusions,"Firstly, it has been demonstrated that the electrolysis of methanol in alkaline media led to an over-faradaic hydrogen production rate when methanol was co-fed to both, the anodic and the cathodic chambers of an alkaline membrane electrode assembly. Under these conditions, faradaic efficiencies in hydrogen production up to 145% were observed in the cathode of the PEM reactor. This phenomenon was linked with the coexistence of two processes: an electrochemical reaction (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction) and a catalytic reaction (methanol dehydrogenation). The former would lead to a faradaic production of hydrogen, while the latter would lead to an additional production of hydrogen enhanced via the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis occurring under liquid phase conditions. Further studies in a membrane-less electrolyser corroborated the catalytic origin of this over-faradaic hydrogen production. Interestingly, it only occurs under specific conditions (MeOH-KOH solution) and follows an Arrhenius behaviour. In addition, the outlet gas phase still contained ≥99.99% hydrogen in all cases, as carbon-derived compounds are all soluble in the alkaline solution, leading to the production of high purity hydrogen. In any case, due to the H2 overproduction, this electrocatalytic configuration exhibits extremely lower energy consumption per unit of H2 produced vs. the conventional alcohol electrolysis systems. This MOFE could therefore be considered as a break-through step forward in view of the development of a new generation alcohol-based electrolysers for efficient production of H2 from renewable resources."
