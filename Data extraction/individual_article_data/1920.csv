0,Introduction,"Compared with traditional hydrogen production from fossil energy, biological hydrogen production is an energy-saving, environmentally friendly and renewable process. In general, there are three methods to produce hydrogen biologically: photolysis of water, photodecomposition of organic compounds and dark fermentation of organic compounds, of which dark fermentation has shown potentials for industrial application [1,2]. Various microorganisms can be harnessed to generate hydrogen through anaerobic dark fermentation, including Clostridium sp. [3], Citrobacter sp. [4], Enterobacter sp. [5] and Escherichia coli [6]. Currently the general bottleneck of these microorganisms is the relatively low yield of hydrogen from the substrates [2]. Enterobacter aerogenes, a facultative anaerobic bacterium, has a high hydrogen-evolving rate and a high growth rate during dark fermentation [7]. This bacterium can utilize a wide range of carbon sources to produce hydrogen [8,9], which is a benefit for developing the large-scale production process. To implement genetic modifications and enhance the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes, it is crucial to understand the metabolic networks pertaining to hydrogen production. Two hydrogen-producing pathways are known to be involved in the hydrogen production of E. aerogenes [10,11]. One is called “formate pathway”, which is based on the decomposition of formate mediated by the formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) system. This pathway is commonly seen in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae [12], in which hydrogen and carbon dioxide with a 1:1 molar ratio are produced. Based on the stoichiometry of the intracellular reactions, the maximum yield of hydrogen through the formate pathway is 2 mol H2/mol glucose. Our previous study suggested that the hydrogen yields through the formate pathway can be enhanced by genetic manipulation of the FHL system, including knocking out the hycA gene which encodes the FHL repressor protein, deactivating the uptake hydrogenase by deleting its small subunit hybO, and a combination of them [13]. The other hydrogen-producing pathway is called “NADH pathway”, which includes the reoxidation process of NADH generated in glycolysis with H+ as an electron acceptor [10,11,14]. This pathway is believed to maintain the intracellular redox balance by consuming “excess NADH”, and the reaction is facilitated by a putative membrane-bound NAD(P)H-dependent hydrogenase [11,15]. A maximum yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose is expected through the NADH pathway, if all the reducing equivalents acquired in the glycolysis can be used to produce hydrogen [16]. Aside from the reduction of protons into hydrogen molecules, the cofactor pair NADH and NAD+ are also involved in over 300 oxidation–reduction reactions in microbial metabolism [17]. It is interesting and important to apprehend how to tune the intracellular redox state of NADH/NAD+ pools to redirect the electrons to the protons for hydrogen evolution and to maximize hydrogen production. In addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, E. aerogenes mainly produces 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, lactate, succinate and acetate from glucose anaerobically, of which the first four metabolites are formed at the cost of intracellular NADH reoxidation [18]. Therefore, it is possible to increase hydrogen production through the NADH pathway by blocking other NADH-consuming metabolic fluxes. A mutant strain E. aerogenes HZ-3 was constructed by proton suicide method, which showed reduced lactate production and increased hydrogen production, and the amount of hydrogen evolved by the mutant was 1.5-fold higher than that evolved by the wild-type strain in batch culture [9]. By using the Voges–Proskauer test to decrease alpha-acetolactate synthase activity in the 2,3-butanediol pathway, two mutant strains E. aerogenes VP-1 and VP-2 showed a lower 2,3-butanediol yield and a higher hydrogen yield from glucose than the wild-type strain [19]. These successful experiments demonstrate that enhancing the availability of NADH is an effective way to increase hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. Instead of being confined to the NADH-consuming pathways toward the major end-products, in this study we focused on manipulating the NADH dehydrogenase, an important NADH-consuming enzyme in cell metabolism. NADH dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible electron transport process between NADH/NAD+ pools and ubiquinone pools [20]. In early investigations of this enzyme, more attention was paid to its role in the respiratory chain with oxygen as an electron acceptor [21,22], rather than its function in anaerobic metabolism. It is known that two NADH dehydrogenases, the 14-subunit intrinsic membrane protein NDH-I and the peripheral membrane enzyme NDH-II, exist in E. coli [23,24]. NDH-I and NDH-II are encoded by the nuo A-N and ndh genes, respectively. It has been reported that NDH-I- and/or NDH-II-deficient strains exhibited higher production of d-lactate, ethanol, formate and succinate in the exponential growth phase, compared with the parent strain E. coli MG1655 [25]. This result indicates that inactivation of NADH dehydrogenase redirected the metabolic fluxes to maintain a proper intracellular redox balance of NADH/NAD+ pools. However, the effect of inactivation of NADH dehydrogenase on hydrogen production in E. coli or Enterobacter. sp. remains largely unknown. In this study we aimed at the impairment of NADH dehydrogenase in the wild-type strain E. aerogenes IAM1183, its hydrogenase gene (hycA)-deleted mutant of IAM1183-A and the hybO-deleted mutant of IAM1183-O, in order to systematically examine the effect of NADH dehydrogenase on hydrogen production and carbon flux redistributions under anaerobic conditions. The nuo genes encoding a 13-subunit NADH dehydrogenase were cloned from E. aerogenes IAM1183 in this work. Then, a hydrophilic subunit NuoB of NADH dehydrogenase was impaired by knocking out nuoB in the wild-type strain of E. aerogenes IAM1183 and the two mutants with the pYM-Red recombination system of bacteriophage lambda [26], respectively. In order to quantitatively analyze how the deficiency of NADH dehydrogenase regulates the anaerobic metabolism in E. aerogenes, a metabolic network model was employed to calculate the changes of metabolic flux distributions in these three different nuoB-deleted strains. The activities of several key enzymes in NADH-consuming pathways were also measured to understand the redistribution of the intracellular reducing power in the nuoB-deleted mutants."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Microorganisms, plasmids and medium","2.1 Microorganisms, plasmids and medium Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . The wild-type strain E. aerogenes IAM1183 was purchased from the Institute of Applied Microorganisms at the University of Tokyo, Japan. The single mutant ΔnuoB, the double mutants ΔhycA/ΔnuoB and ΔhybO/ΔnuoB, were designated as E. aerogenes IAM1183-B, IAM1183-AB, IAM1183-BO in this study, respectively. E. aerogenes IAM1183-p-red and its mutants were created on the wild-type strain by the pYM-Red recombination system [26] derived from λ recombinase method of chromosomal disruption [27]. Single gene disruption sites were verified by genomic PCR. The wild-type strain E. aerogenes IAM1183, its mutants, and E. coli which served as the host strain for DNA manipulation, were all cultured aerobically in Luria broth (LB) (per liter: 5 g yeast extract, 10 g tryptone, 5 g NaCl, 15 g agar powder added in solid medium) medium at 37 °C. Antibiotics were added to the growth medium in accordance with the experimental need at the following concentrations: 100 μg/mL ampicillin (Amp), 4 μg/mL tetracycline (Tet), 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol (Chl). Glucose medium containing (per liter) 15 g glucose, 5 g tryptone, 14 g K2HPO4, 6 g KH2PO4, 2 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O was used for measuring hydrogen production in batch culture."
3,Primers and PCR conditions,"2.2 Primers and PCR conditions All restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, and T-vector system were purchased from TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd (TaKaRa, China) and used according to the technical manuals provided by the manufacturer. RNase A, lysozyme, and proteinase K were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. LLC (Sigma, USA). PCR products were extracted using the Promega Gel and PCR Clean-Up System Kit (Promaga, USA). E. aerogenes IAM1183 chromosomal DNA was isolated using the Wizard® Genomic DNA Isolation System (Promaga, USA) by following the manufacturer's guidance. Plasmids were sequenced at the Invitrogen Corporation (Shanghai, China) on an Applied Biosystems 3730/3730XL DNA Analyzer. All primers were designed with the aid of Premier 5.0 software according to the homologous conserved regions of bacterial strains' NADH dehydrogenase published in GenBank (Table 2 ). The 50 μL reaction system contained 15 pmol primers, 100 ng template DNA, 2.5 unit Taq DNA polymerase, 2.5 mM buffer and 2.5 mM dNTPS. The PCR conditions were described sequentially as follows: initial temperature of 105 °C for 1 min, predenaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 40 s at 50–65 °C and extension for 1–4 min at 72 °C. The final extension step was carried out for 10 min at 72 °C. A pair of degenerate primers [29], nuo-fw-1 and nuo-rv-1, was designed according to the conserved region of nuoBC/D genes published in GenBanK. In order to obtain the complete nuo cluster, inverse-PCR amplification was performed in E. aerogenes IAM1183 based on the principle of chromosome walking. The primers nuo-R-fw and nuo-R-rv were designed from the nuoBC fragment. The genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme BssHII and self-ligation DNA as a template. A 1200 bp fragment was amplified and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) was used via the internet (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). The DNA fragment was partial 3′-nuoA and partial 5′-nuoC/D. Thus, partial gene cluster nuoABC/D of E. aerogenes IAM1183 was obtained through the nuoBC/D 750 bp fragment ligation with a 1200 bp fragment. The upstream primers, such as nuo-fw-2, nuo-fw-3, nuo-fw-4, etc, were designed according to the known sequences, while the downstream primers were designed according to the nuo gene of other species of Enterobacters published in GenBank."
4,Construction of plasmids and recombinant strains,"2.3 Construction of plasmids and recombinant strains Standard molecular genetic techniques were used in this study according to the reference [29]. The linear pNUOB-tet DNA vector was amplified from the tetracycline cassette of plasmid pACYC184 [28] using the primers nuoB-tet-fw and nuoB-tet-rv. The underlined 5′ ends of primers (Table 2) corresponded to 40 bp of the overhanging sequence, which was homologous to a portion of the target nuoB. Competent cells of E. aerogenes IAM1183-p-red [26], E. aerogenes IAM1183-A and E. aerogenes IAM1183-O [13] containing the pYM-Red recombination system were transformed with pNUOB-tet (Table 1) linear DNA via electroporation, respectively. The transformed cells were cultured for 2 h at 30 °C and spread on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol (30 μg/mL) and tetracycline (4 μg/mL), and were subsequently cultured at 37 °C overnight. PCR analysis confirmed that the colonies capable of growing on the double antibiotics plates possessed the desired ΔnuoB, ΔhycA/ΔnuoB and ΔhybO/ΔnuoB genotypes, respectively."
5,Batch cultivation,"2.4 Batch cultivation The anaerobic cultivation of the microorganisms were done in 50-mL serum bottles. Each serum bottle containing 20 mL medium was sealed with an airtight butyl rubber stopper. Aseptic nitrogen was sparged for 5 min to purge the residual air from the bottles thereby creating the anaerobic conditions. The serum bottles were then inoculated with seedling cells and cultivated at 37 °C for 2–16 h. Measurements of cell density, pH and metabolite concentrations were performed at the corresponding cultivation time. In all batch cultivation experiments, the wild-type strain E. aerogenes IAM1183 served as a control for the other three mutant strains constructed in this study. Three replicates were done for individual experiments and standard deviations were calculated and shown in the results."
6,Assay of enzyme activities,"2.5 Assay of enzyme activities The assay of all enzyme activities was operated under anaerobic conditions and the reaction systems were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Shelton Bactron II, USA). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspened in a buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH = 7.0). Cell-free extracts were prepared by ultrasonication. Total hydrogenase (EC 1.18.3.1) activity was measured by the decrease in absorbance of dithionite-reduced methyl viologen (MV+) in a rubber-sealed cuvette at room temperature [30]. The reaction system contained 1 mL of 0.1 wt% Triton X-100, 1 mL of 0.025 mM Tris–HCl (pH = 7.4), 30 μL of 20 mM MV, 10 μL of 64 mM Na2S2O4 and 0.4 mL cell-free extracts. We also introduced a method in this study to monitor the activity of the NADH-dependent hydrogenase by measuring the decrease in absorbance of NADH. The reaction system was 1 mL Imidazole–HCl (pH = 6.7), 100 μL of 10 mM NADH, 1.5 mL deionized water and 0.5 mL cell-free extracts. This measurement is based on the reaction NADH + H+ = NAD+ + H2 catalyzed by this putative NADH-dependent hydrogenase. The absorption spectroscopy of NADH is used to calibrate and measure the concentration of NADH to determine the specific enzyme activity. The specific activity of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27, LDH) was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance of NADH. The reaction system contained 1 mL Imidazole–HCl (pH = 6.7), 50 μL of 10 mM NADH, 1.5 mL of 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate 0.5 mL cell-free extracts. The measurements of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1, ADH) and butanediol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.4, BDDH) activities were carried out with the same procedure as that of LDH, except that in the reaction system 1.5 mL of 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate was replaced with 1.5 mL of 0.5 mM acetaldehyde and 1.5 mL of 10 mM acetoin, respectively. The absorbances of MV+ and NADH were determined by an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1206, Japan) at wavelengths of 604 nm (MV+ absorptivity ɛ MV, 604 nm = 13.9 mM−1 cm−1) and 340 nm (NADH absorptivity ɛ NADH, 340 nm = 6.3 mM−1 cm−1), respectively. The concentration changes of the substrates in a given period of time were calculated through Beer–Lambert law and the specific enzyme activities were obtained."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods Cell density (OD600) was measured by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1206, Japan) at 600 nm. Dry cell weight (DCW) was subsequently calculated by DCW (mg/ml) = 0.132 × OD600 for E. aerogenes [31]. The pH of the bacterial culture was measured with a pH meter (Orion 828, USA). The total volume of gas produced in the serum bottle was measured by displacing saturated NaHCO3 solution within an inverted gas cylinder. The composition of the gas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) (Shimadzu GC-8A, Japan), which was equipped with a Parapak Q column (80/100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector. The temperatures of the injector, column and detector were 120 °C, 80 °C and 120 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. Cells were centrifuged after cultivation at 13,000× g for 10 min using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C (Kubota 6930, Japan). The supernatant after centrifugation was collected for analysis of glucose and metabolites. The concentrations of glucose, organic acids and alcohols in the culture media were analyzed through a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Shimadzu 10A, Japan). The HPLC system was equipped with an organic acid analysis column (Shimadzu SCR-102G, Japan) and a refractive index detector (Shimadzu RID-10A, Japan). 0.1 percent of aqueous perchloric acid solution was used as the mobile phase. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C."
8,Metabolic flux analysis,"2.7 Metabolic flux analysis A metabolic flux model was described in our previous work [32] based on the reported metabolic map of E. aerogenes [11,18,33]. Briefly, the model assumed pseudo-steady-state of all intracellular metabolites, which indicated that there was no accumulation of metabolites inside the cells. Using glucose as a substrate, the extracellular metabolites included formate, acetate, lactate, succinate, ethanol, 2,3-butanediol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide in this model. Hydrogen was produced through both the formate pathway and the NADH pathway as described in the introduction section. Under anaerobic conditions, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were considered to be inactive in E. aerogenes. The intracellular reactions involved in this model are described in Appendix A. This model was applied to analyze the redistributions of metabolic fluxes in anaerobic fermentation of E. aerogenes due to the inactivation of NADH dehydrogenase."
9,Results,
10,Isolation of NADH dehydrogenase nuo cluster from E. aerogenes IAM1183,"3.1 Isolation of NADH dehydrogenase nuo cluster from E. aerogenes IAM1183 A 750 bp fragment was isolated from E. aerogenes IAM1183 using the pair of primers nuo-fw-1 and nuo-rv-1. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that this DNA fragment shared significant similarity with nuoB gene of other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family [34]. This result suggested that a homologous nuo gene was present in E. aerogenes IAM1183. In total, six rounds of chromosome-walking PCR amplification were carried out with five pairs of PCR primers (Table 2), and five DNA fragments were obtained. After splicing the five fragments, a total of 14857 bp DNA sequence was determined. This DNA sequence contained 3′-partial nuoA, complete nuoBI/DEFGHIJKLM, 5′-partial nuoN and a 1284 bp open reading frame of a hypothetical protein between nuoH and nuoJ [GenBank No: JX129363–JX129375]. The multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the proteins encoded by the E. aerogenes IAM1183 nuo cluster shared a high identity with those from other members of Enterobacteriaceae [35]. The putative amino acid sequence showed more than 72% identity with NuoABCDEFGHIJKLMN from other species of Enterobacters. Interestingly, the highest identity which this sequence shared was 98% with Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp, a more distantly related bacterial species. The basic information of the nuo cluster of E. aerogenes IAM1183 was listed in Table 3 ."
11,Batch culture performance of the mutants,"3.2 Batch culture performance of the mutants During the 16-h batch cultivation, the pH in the culture medium of each mutant decreased at a slower rate than that of the wild-type strain, as shown in Fig. 1(a). This finding is especially significant for the single mutant ΔnuoB during the exponential phase of cell growth. The final values of pH (4.8–4.9) for all three mutants were a little higher than that of the wild-type strain (4.76) after 16-h cultivation. According to the growth curves of all strains in Fig. 1(b), it was observed that all three mutants reached higher cell densities than the wild-type strain at the end of the 16-h cultivation, the time when the plateau values of cell densities were reached for all the strains. We estimated the exponential phase of each strain by recording the time when the cell density achieved 10% and 90% of maximal cell density (on the basis of OD600). Compared with the 4.1-h exponential phase of the wild-type strain, the prolonged exponential phases (7.2, 4.8, and 5.3 h) were shown for the mutants IAM1183-B, IAM1183-AB and IAM1183-BO, respectively. Significant enhancement in cumulative carbon dioxide production was found for all three mutants, compared with the wild-type strain. According to Fig. 1(c), the evolved carbon dioxide reached plateau after around 9-h cultivation for the wild-type strain, while the three mutants kept producing carbon dioxide until 16 h. Interestingly, the production of carbon dioxide in the single mutant IAM1183-B showed a lower-convex curve during the exponential phase, which differed from the other strains. Fig. 1(d) shows that improvement of hydrogen production was achieved in the batch culture of all three mutants. Compared with the performance of the wild-type strain, the overall hydrogen production of the mutants IAM1183-B, IAM1183-AB and IAM1183-BO increased by 49.2%, 54.0%, and 52.4%, respectively. Similar to the production process of carbon dioxide, all three mutants showed extended production periods of hydrogen in batch culture."
12,Changes in final metabolite concentrations in the mutants,"3.3 Changes in final metabolite concentrations in the mutants Table 4 summarizes the concentrations of major excreted final metabolites as well as consumed glucose after 16-h batch cultivation of the wild-type strain and all three mutant strains. A balance of carbon recovery was performed for all strains and the results are shown in Table 4. All strains maintained near 100% carbon recoveries if experimental errors were considered, indicating that the carbon fluxes in main anaerobic metabolic pathways of E. aerogenes were accurately captured in all strains. From the standpoint of glucose consumption, all mutant strains showed higher capabilities of consuming glucose in batch culture without pH control. Strain IAM1183-BO possessed the highest efficiency of glucose usage, which was 27.8% higher than that of the wild-type strain with the same composition of the culture medium. This feature could benefit the fermentation to minimize the cost of the substrates by consuming more carbon sources. In addition to the changes in hydrogen and carbon dioxide evolved by the mutants, we also observed significant changes in other extracellular metabolites which were secreted in the culture media and analyzed by HPLC. Generally, the three mutants exhibited similar changes in the excretion of acids and alcohols. Lactate production reduced in all mutant strains, of which the double mutant strain IAM1183-BO showed the lowest concentration of lactate (53.5 mM), a 23.4% decrease compared with the wild-type strain. Increases in acetate and ethanol productions were found in all three mutant strains, suggesting an enhanced synthesis of their precursor, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). All mutant strains exhibited dramatic enhancement of 2,3-butanediol and succinate production, with 3.67–5.22 times and 2.59–2.69 times as many as those produced by the wild-type strain, respectively. In Table 4, we also compared the hydrogen yields of all three mutant strains with that of the wild-type strain. The deletion of nuoB gene in the single mutant IAM1183-B increased the hydrogen yield from 1.16 mol H2/mol glucose to 1.38 mol H2/mol glucose during dark fermentation after the 16-h batch cultivation. Additionally, two double mutants also showed higher hydrogen yields than the wild-type strain. The double knock out of nuoB and hycA genes created the mutant IAM1183-AB with the highest hydrogen yield among all the strains, 1.48 mol H2/mol glucose."
13,Metabolic flux analysis of the wild-type strain and the mutants,"3.4 Metabolic flux analysis of the wild-type strain and the mutants Table 4 shows the absolute concentrations of the metabolites, however, it does not reflect the intracellular metabolic fluxes directly. Based on the information in Table 4 and the metabolic flux model we built previously [11,32], we performed the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) for all strains and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . The uptake of glucose by each strain was normalized and set to be 100 on a molar basis in Fig. 2. The flux to biomass did not increase in any mutant strain according to the MFA despite that all mutant strains exhibited higher absolute amount of biomass than the wild-type strain. The redistributions of the fluxes to major metabolites in the mutant strains, as shown in Fig. 2, revealed similar trends as the changes of absolute concentrations of the metabolites. Generally, all three mutants obtained higher fluxes toward the production of hydrogen, ethanol, acetate, 2,3-butanediol and succinate. Decreases in the fluxes toward lactate production were observed in all three mutants in varying degrees. The results of MFA also show the fluxes of two hydrogen-producing pathways in Fig. 2: formate pathway (v 9) and NADH pathway (v 12). Interestingly, although the impaired nuo gene encoded an NADH-dependent enzyme, the main contribution to the increases in hydrogen-producing fluxes was through the formate pathway (33.8% increase for IAM1183-B, 41.5% increase for IAM1183-AB, 30.7% increase for IAM1183-BO) rather than the NADH pathway (no increase for IAM1183-B, 9.8% increase for IAM1183-AB, 3.9% increase for IAM1183-BO)."
14,Changes in specific enzyme activities in the ΔnuoB mutant,"3.5 Changes in specific enzyme activities in the ΔnuoB mutant To examine how the impairment of nuo gene affected the activities of several key oxidoreductases involved in the anaerobic metabolism of E. aerogenes, we show in Fig. 3 the comparison of specific enzyme activities between the wild-type strain and the single mutant strain IAM1183-B. The enzyme activities were measured both in the middle of the exponential phase of cell growth (t 1/2 ODmax: the time when cell density reached half of the maximum value) and at the end of the batch cultivation (t 16 h: 16 h after inoculation). Note that these two strains reach the stationary phase in different time periods and the experimental data at t 16 h is used merely as an estimation of the enzyme activities at the stationary phase. Fig. 3(a) and (b) showed specific hydrogenase activities using MV+ and NADH as electron donors, respectively. In the middle of the exponential phase, the mutant strain IAM1183-B exhibited a 9.0-fold increase in the MV+-based hydrogenase activity and a 49.0% increase in the NADH-based hydrogenase activity compared with the wild-type strain. After 16-h cultivation, the MV+-based hydrogenase activity in IAM1183-B dropped from 1527 mU/mg DCW at t 1/2 ODmax to only 123 mU/mg DCW, which was almost the same as that in the wild-type strain. However, the NADH-based hydrogenase activity in IAM1183-B was much higher than that in IAM1183 at the end of the 16-h fermentation mainly due to the activity loss in the wild-type strain. Dramatic enhancement was not only observed in hydrogenase activity in IAM1183-B, but also in the specific activities of NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDDH). At t 1/2 ODmax, the ADH and BDDH activities in IAM1183-B were 2.54 and 10.3 times as many as those in the wild-type strain, respectively. At t 16 h, the ADH activity dropped while the BDDH activity rose in both strains compared with the corresponding values at t 1/2 ODmax. However, no significance difference was found in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity between the wild-type strain and the mutant IAM1183-B at t 1/2 ODmax. At t 16 h, the LDH activity in IAM1183-B was slightly higher than that in IAM1183, but not in a drastic way compared to ADH and BDDH."
15,Discussions,"NADH dehydrogenase plays an important role in cell anabolism and the maintenance of intracellular redox balance. In this study, we focused on the manipulation of a hydrophilic subunit NuoB in the NADH dehydrogenase, which was obtained in E. aerogenes for the first time and encoded by the nuo A-N cluster in this strain. The pYM-Red recombination system was employed to conduct gene deletion in wild-type E. aerogenes IAM1183 and two mutants IAM1183-A (ΔhycA) and IAM1183-O (ΔhybO). Three mutant strains, IAM1183-B (ΔnuoB), IAM1183-AB (ΔhycA/ΔnuoB) and IAM1183-BO (ΔhybO/ΔnuoB), were obtained through homologous recombination and the nuoB gene was successfully knocked out in these mutants. This work provides a new point of view to understand the hydrogen metabolism in E. aerogenes and to learn how the NADH/NAD+ pool is controlled by the NADH dehydrogenease in dark fermentation process. These understandings are useful for designing a systematic strategy of multiple gene knockouts to redirect the reducing power for hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. In batch culture, the single mutant IAM1183-B with NuoB deficiency showed 49.2% enhanced overall hydrogen production compared with the wild-type strain. An increased consumption of glucose in IAM1183-B, as shown in Table 3, partially accounted for the increase of hydrogen generation. The improved capability of glucose consumption in IAM1183-B was related to the retarded acidification process in the culture medium, due to the fact that the acids excreted by E. aerogenes generally inhibit cell growth and uptake of substrates during dark fermentation. Meanwhile, the cell growth in IAM1183-B exhibited a longer-lasting exponential phase than the wild-type strain, presumably because the impaired NADH dehydrogenase in IAM1183-B reduced energy generation in the exponential phase of cell growth. It is known that the ndh-encoded NDH-II is preferred during aerobic and nitrite respiration, while the nuo-encoded NDH-I is used during fumarate respiration [23]. Under anaerobic conditions, NDH-I catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q, however, oxygen does not serve as a final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. In the absence of oxygen, ATP is generally considered to be synthesized through substrate-level phosphorylation (Fig. 2). How the impaired NDH-I is associated with reduced ATP generation during dark fermentation in E. aerogenes is still worth further exploring. The increased yield of hydrogen from glucose by IAM1183-B indicated that, in addition to the enhanced consumption of glucose, the redistribution of metabolic fluxes was also an important reason for improved overall hydrogen production. As shown in Table 4, the single mutant strain IAM1183-B showed a hydrogen yield of 1.38 mol H2/mol glucose, which was higher than that of the wild-type strain (1.16 mol H2/mol) and other single mutant strains IAM1183-A (1.20 mol H2/mol) and IAM1183-O (1.27 mol H2/mol) under the same culture conditions [13]. As expected, the double mutant IAM1183-AB (1.48 mol H2/mol glucose) with a deficiency in both FHL repressor and NADH dehydrogenase, showed a successful application of the idea of multi-pathway disturbance to enhance hydrogen production. This strain could therefore be engineered in combination with other genetic modifications which demonstrated improved hydrogen production in E. aerogenes, including the deletion of the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) [37], heterogeneous expression of an NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh1) [38], and overexpression of the polyphosphate kinase [39]. The mechanism of enhanced hydrogen production by the mutants constructed in this work was investigated through metabolic flux analysis. It is noteworthy to recognize that the increased fluxes toward hydrogen production in all three NDHI-deficient mutants were mainly through the formate pathway rather than the NADH pathway. As a result, enhanced ethanol and acetate productions were observed in these mutants, as the sum of these two metabolites indicated the amount of acetyl-CoA, which was generated with formate in an equimolar manner (Fig. 2). By comparing the mutant IAM1183-B with the wild-type strain in the exponential phase of cell growth, the 9.0-fold increase in the MV+-based hydrogenase activity versus only 49.0% increase in the NADH-based hydrogenase activity also suggested that putative NADH-dependent hydrogenase was not the only hydrogenase which received upregulation due to the impairment of the NADH dehydrogenase. In fact, the formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) system does not split formate into hydrogen and carbonate dioxide in a single step in the formate hydrogen-producing pathway. The FHL system consists of a formate dehydrogenase and a hydrogenase in E. aerogenes [13,38]. The formate dehydrogenase firstly oxidizes formate into protons and carbonate dioxide and transfers the electrons to an electron mediator, then the hydrogenase reoxidizes the electron mediator and releases the electrons to protons to form hydrogen molecules. It is possible that the unidentified electron mediator in the FHL system in E. aerogenes is highly related to NADH and can convert into each other through an oxidoreductase, which is similar to the function of NADH-Fd oxidoreductase [40], and the impairment of NADH dehydrogenase enhanced the availability of NADH as well as this electron mediator in the formate pathway. From this point of view, the formate pathway and the NADH pathway are probably interconnected and both regulated by the NADH/NAD+ pools in E. aerogenes. Redistributions of metabolites were discovered through metabolic flux analysis and all three mutants showed similar trends in general. Higher fluxes toward the generation of hydrogen, ethanol, acetate, 2,3-butanediol and succinate were found in the mutant strains. Meanwhile, a significant decrease in lactate production was observed in all three mutants of E. aerogenes, which differed from the case of NDHI-deficient E. coli strain [25]. Our findings in the metabolite redistributions were consistent to the results of enzyme activities. Insignificant changes in LDH activities and drastic increases in ADH and BDDH activities were shown in the mutant IAM1183-B compared with the wild-type strain. Because all NADH-dependent oxidoreductases need the coenzyme NADH to catalyze the biochemical reactions, the increased availability of NADH due to the impairment of NDH-I may increase the enzyme activities through either upregulated expression or enhanced activation of the expressed protein, as seen in the case of putative NADH-based hydrogenase, ADH and BDDH. However, in the case of LDH, the enzyme activity is limited by product inhibition, since high concentration of lactate was found in batch culture of E. aerogenes compared with other metabolites. These mechanisms contributed to the observation of decreased lactate production in all three mutants. Despite the similarity of the metabolic distributions among these three mutants constructed in this work, there are some interesting facts by comparing the single mutants with the double mutants. A substantial increase in the hydrogen yield (from 1.20 to 1.48 H2/mol glucose) was observed under the same experimental condition by knocking out the nuoB gene in the single mutant IAM1183-A [13]. Likewise, the hydrogen yield increased from 1.27 H2/mol glucose in the single mutant IAM1183-O [13] to 1.39 H2/mol glucose in the double mutant IAM1183-BO. Meanwhile, the distributions in the metabolic fluxes in these two double mutants are quite different from their respective single mutant before deleting the nuoB gene. These results show the success of constructing these double mutants in E. aerogenes to further improve the hydrogen yield. The anaerobic metabolic fluxes, including the fluxes toward hydrogen production, in IAM1183-AB and IAM1183-BO are found to be more similar to those in IAM1183-B as discussed previously, compared with the results with the single mutants IAM1183-A and IAM1183-O [13]. These comparisons clearly indicate that the nuoB gene has a much stronger influence on the regulation of hydrogen metabolism than either the hycA gene or the hybO gene in E. aerogenes. The results presented in this paper have clearly demonstrated that the impairment of nuo A-N-coded NADH dehydrogenase in E. aeroegenes led to enhanced overall hydrogen production and improved yield of hydrogen from glucose. Metabolic flux analysis showed that both the formate pathway and the NADH pathway contributed to increased hydrogen production in the mutant strains. The significance of NADH dehydrogenase in regulating the NADH/NAD+ pools in E. aerogenes under anaerobic fermentation was revealed and the changes in metabolic fluxes and enzyme activities were characterized in this study. The genetically engineered mutant strains also exhibited high efficiency of substrate consumption, which is favorable for potential large-scale applications with inexpensive cost."
