0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an excellent clean fuel for the future because of its high conversion and nonpolluting nature, producing only water during its reaction with oxygen [1,2]. At present, hydrogen is still primarily produced from non-renewable sources such as natural gas or petroleum hydrocarbons through chemical processes [3]. And large amounts of carbon dioxide are discharged by the combustion of fossil fuels, causing global atmospheric pollution problems. Biological methods with fermentative hydrogen production using microorganisms are an exciting new area of technology development which offer the potential production of usable hydrogen from a variety of renewable resources [4–6]. Recently, hydrogen production through anaerobic fermentation using biomass containing crude cellulose has attracted attention and this leads to open avenues for the utilization of renewable energy sources, which are inexhaustible [7–11]. In developed countries, there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bio-energy conversion using a range of biomass, which are becoming cost-wise competitive with fossil fuels. So, it is necessary to further study the production of H2 from fermentation of biomass more reasonably and effectively. Experimental design is of great importance to a fermentative hydrogen production process, because the process is very complex and influenced by many factors such as substrate pretreatment, hydraulic retention time (HRT), substrate concentration, oxidation–reduction potential, pH, nutritional requirements, operational conditions of the bioreactors and so on [8–13]. Results so far indicated that the control of substrate concentration and pH is crucial to the hydrogen production in a fermentative system [2,11,14]. Thus an appropriate experimental design can be used to study the effects of various factors on the process to make it better understood and even optimized to improve its performance [15]. Orthogonal design is one of the important statistical methods that use the Taguchi parameter design methodology [1,16] and it allows the effects of many factors with two or more levels on a response, to be studied in a relatively small number of runs. The orthogonal array facilitates the analysis of the design. When used properly, orthogonal design may provide a powerful and efficient method to find an optimal combination of factor levels that may achieve optimum [17]. Thus, orthogonal arrays were used in this experimental design in order to explore an optimum hydrogen-producing condition from cornstalk, and series of experiments were conducted. The symbol L a (b c) is used to represent the orthogonal array, where ‘a’ is the number of experimental runs, ‘b’ is the number of levels for each factor or variable and ‘c’ is the number of factors investigated. One-factor-at-a-time design is a traditional design, which investigates one-factor-at-a-time, while keeping the levels of other factors constant. One-factor-at-a-time design and orthogonal design were used a lot for fermentative hydrogen production processes using various substrates [9–14]. This paper attempts to investigate the effects of various factors on fermentative hydrogen production processes from cornstalk wastes. The experimental design included one-factor-at-a-time design (substrate concentration and initial pH) and orthogonal design."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen-producing sludge,"2.1 Hydrogen-producing sludge The anaerobic sludge, originating from a local natural river in the suburb of Xi’an city, was used as the seed sludge. Before it was used to seed the reactors, the sludge was pre-heated at 100 °C for 15 min to inhibit the bioactivity of methanogens and other pathogenic microbes and also enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria of anaerobic spore-forming from seed sludge."
3,Pretreatment of the substrate,"2.2 Pretreatment of the substrate Cornstalk wastes, taken from the suburb of Xi’an city, were used as substrate. Raw cornstalks (CS) to be used in the batch experiments were ground by a vegetation disintegrator after drying and then sieved down to 80-mesh size. The components were analyzed and the results were indicated as follows: ash, 8.98%; cellulose, 34.45%; lignin, 21.81%; and hemicellulose, 27.55%. Besides crude fiber, there are some other components in cornstalk wastes, including pectin, crude protein and crude fat. The total solid (TS) content in cornstalks was 95.25% in this study. The grinding sample was employed as substrate for hydrogen production in all the batch experiments after the pretreatment of the substrate that was soaked with 0.6% HCl at 90 °C for 2 h and enzyme-hydrolyzed by using cellulose at pH 4.8 and 50 °C for 72 h (the mass ratio of cellulose to substrate was 0.01:1) [18]. The cellulase, a trichoderma viride used in the enzymolysis experiments of cornstalk, was purchased from Sanjie Biotechnology Company of Shanghai. The main components of cellulase (trichoderma viride) are 1,4-β-d-glucan cellobiohydrolase, 1,4-β-d-glucan glucanohydrolase and β-1,4-glucosidase [19]. The enzyme activity is greater than or equal to 15 μ/mg."
4,Batch experiments,"2.3 Batch experiments Three series of batch experiments were conducted in 150 mL glass bottles, which were denoted as series I, series II and series III. Each liter of the nutrient solution contained beef extract, 2.0 g; yeast extract, 1.0 g; peptone, 4.0 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 1.0 g; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g; NaCl, 3.0 g; KH2PO4, 1.0 g; K2HPO4, 1.0 g; l-cysteine, 0.5 g. Moreover, experiment was replicated at least three times for obtaining accurate result averagely. Experiments in series I examined the effect of substrate concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 g-cornstalk/L on bio-H2 production, respectively. Experiments in series II investigated the bio-H2 production from the fermentation substrate at different initial pHs (5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0). The optimization experiments in series III were conducted according to the orthogonal design method. An orthogonal design of L 9 (3 4) was used in the experiment, considering four important parameters (enzymatic temperature, enzymatic time, substrate concentration and fermentation initial pH). The evaluation criterion of hydrogen-producing effect is based on the maximum hydrogen yield from per gram cornstalks (CS). In all batches, 50 mL of the heat-pretreated sludge, the pretreated substrate and 10 mL of the nutrient solution were added to each glass bottle, respectively. The total mixed liquor of working volume was filled to 100 mL and sealed the reactor to ensure anaerobic conditions. Each bottle is incubated with continuous stirring at a constant temperature of 36 °C."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The volume of mixed biogas produced in each glass bottle was recorded by the water-displacement method. Biogas of 100 μL was periodically sampled and injected into a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 6890) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to analyze the contents of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Argon gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. The operational temperatures of the injector, detector and column were 130, 130 and 90 °C, respectively. The amount of hydrogen in mixed biogas could be calculated by a calibration parameter. Only carbon oxide and hydrogen were detected from the mixed biogas products. The orthogonal design software was used to analyze data with the orthogonal array (L 9 (3 4)). The percent contribution was calculated to determine the portion that each significant factor and interaction contributed to the total variation. The percent contribution is a function of the sums of squares for each significant item and indicates the relative power of a factor and/or interaction to reduce variation. If the factor and interaction levels are controlled then the total variation can be reduced by the amount indicated by the percent contribution [16,20,21]. All the pH values were recorded using on-line pH meter (DELTA 320)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production The effects of cumulative H2 yield (a) vs. time, H2 percentage of mixing gas (b) and the average H2 production rate (c) at various substrate concentrations were presented in Fig. 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 1 that a maximum cumulative H2 yield (CHYm) of 138.53 ml g−1 total solid (TS) with an average H2 production rate (AHPR) of 11.54 ml g−1-CS h−1 can be observed, and the cumulative H2 yield remarkably increased from 86.37 to 138.53 ml g−1-CS with the substrate concentration from 5 to 10 g/L. Thereafter, as the substrate concentration further increased to 30 g/L the cumulative H2 yield declined to 80.45 ml g−1-CS. Similar results also occurred in Fig. 1(c). In addition, as the substrate concentration raised from 5 to 30 g/L H2 percentage of mixing gas continuously increased from 36.80 to 63.20% and was 57.30% at the substrate concentration of 10 g/L, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The results showed substrate concentration is an important factor that is considered for bio-H2 production. Although an increase in the substrate concentration could enhance the hydrogen yield under the condition of the optimum hydrogen production, the excessive substrate concentration would result in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and a fall of pH value in the reactor, and even inhibited the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria. In addition, the partial pressure of hydrogen in the batch reactor rose with the increases in substrate concentration. While the partial pressure of hydrogen increased to a certain level in the headspace of reactor, the microorganisms would switch to alcohol production, thus inhibiting the hydrogen production [2,11,23]."
8,Effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production To investigate the effect of initial pH on start-up a hydrogen-producing reactor, the acid pretreated cornstalk wastes were then used for bio-H2 production at the different fermentation initial pH values from 5.0 to 8.0 and the substrate concentration of 10 g/L, the results are plotted in Fig. 2 (a). As can be seen from Fig. 2, the initial pH values significantly affect the hydrogen production yield of the substrate. As the initial pH level rose from 5.0 to 7.0 the hydrogen yields increased from 71.39 to 140.64 ml g−1-CS, and subsequently decreased to 113.57 ml g−1-CS when pH value is at pH = 8. A maximum CHY (140.64 ml g−1-CS), H2 percentage of mixing gas (57.84%) and average H2 production rate (11.72 ml g−1-CS h−1) occurred at pH = 7 with a minimal lag time (6.03 h), as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c) and (e). Moreover, the changes of pH vs. time recorded by on-line pH meter for the bio-H2 production process in Fig. 2(d) showed a similar changing trend, i.e., pH reached to a constant pH range of 5–5.5 from different initial pH due to the same fermentation type. The higher the initial pH value was, the higher the average H2 production rate and cumulative H2 yield were. This might result from the fact that a higher initial pH could be sufficient to rapidly buffer acid production accompanied with hydrogen production, thus the hydrogen producer may have not been inhibited. This is the reason why there is a higher hydrogen production rate at a relatively high initial pH [22]. The maximum H2 yield of 140.64 ml g−1-CS occurred at the initial pH 7.0. The results were consistent with those of Fan’s previous reports [12]. Usually the pH control could significantly affect the H2 production, and stimulate the microorganisms to produce hydrogen and would achieve the system having a maximum H2 yield, but the activity of hydrogenase would be inhibited at the low or high pH values in overall hydrogen fermentation [2,23–26]."
9,Optimization results by the orthogonal design method,"3.3 Optimization results by the orthogonal design method During the optimization experiments, the fermentation condition of temperature was fixed at 36 °C. According to Table 1 (level and factor of orthogonal design), 9 groups of experiments were carried out and the experimental results of the orthogonal design are shown in Tables 2–4 . It indicated that the cumulative hydrogen yield obtained from the Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array experiments ranged from 76.11 to 120.98 ml g−1-CS (Table 2). Based on the maximum hydrogen yield the optimum formulation was A1B2C2D2 (Run 2). And the optimal hydrogen-producing condition of fermentation substrate was at the enzymatic temperature of 45 °C, enzymatic time of 72 h, substrate concentration of 10 g/L and fermentation initial pH of 7.0. Under such condition, the maximum cumulative hydrogen yield was 120.98 ml g−1-CS. However, the optimum formulation from Fig. 3 was A2B2C2D2, not A1B2C2D2 obtained from Table 2. The optimal hydrogen-producing condition for fermentation substrate was at enzymatic temperature of 50 °C, enzymatic time of 72 h, substrate concentration of 10 g/L and fermentation initial pH of 7.0. A verification experiment was conducted to check the result of optimal formulation of A2B2C2D2. The experimental results are summarized in Table 5 . The optimal formulation resulted in a maximum cumulative hydrogen yield of 141.29 ml g−1-CS (or 164.48 ml g−1-TS), which was higher than that of formulation of A1B2C2D2 (120.98 ml g−1-CS). Moreover, a maximum H2 percentage of mixing gas (57.85%) and average H2 production rate (12.31 ml g−1-CS h−1) also occurred at the formulation of A2B2C2D2. The optimal formulation of A2B2C2D2 markedly enhanced the hydrogen production from the fermentation cornstalk. To obtain each factor, the intuitive analysis and variance analysis were performed as shown in Tables 3 and 4. Based on the analysis of the experimental results we determined that substrate concentration had the largest influence on the fermentative hydrogen production process from the pre-determined factor levels, and fermentation initial pH was more influential than enzymatic temperature and enzymatic time. They also show that the enzymatic temperature was the most neglected important factor for fermentative substrate hydrogen production. However, the true optimal factor levels may not be guaranteed using orthogonal design, because the true optimal factor levels may be different from the corresponding pre-determined factor levels [17]. The analysis of the important nutrient factors shows that substrate concentration, fermentation initial pH, enzymatic time and enzymatic temperature, the four factors we considered affected the hydrogen production in an interaction-dependent way with the first being the most important factor. Therefore, operating at a proper substrate concentration and proper control on the fermentation initial pH, are preferable to hydrogen production from cornstalk. In summary, the optimization result was as follows: enzymatic temperature of 50 °C, enzymatic time of 72 h, substrate concentration of 10 g/L and fermentation initial pH of 7.0."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, the anaerobic fermentative H2 production at different substrate concentrations and different initial pH values was investigated. A maximum CHY (140.64 ml g−1-CS), H2 percentage of mixing gas (57.84%) and average H2 production rate (11.72 ml g−1-CS h−1) occurred at pH = 7 with a minimal lag time (6.03 h) when the substrate concentration was 10 g/L. Moreover, four important parameters (enzymatic temperature, enzymatic time, substrate concentration and fermentation initial pH) were selected as factors of the orthogonal design method to design the L 9 (3 4) orthogonal experiment. The results show that both the substrate concentration and initial pH had obvious influence on bio-H2 production from the fermentation cornstalks, but the substrate concentration had more effects on the reaction process than initial pH. An appropriate formulation of A2B2C2D2 containing these four factors for the efficient fermentative hydrogen production has been proposed, which are at the enzymatic temperature of 50 °C, the enzymatic time of 72 h, the substrate concentration of 10 g/L and the fermentation initial pH of 7.0. Under the optimum orthogonal design condition, a maximum cumulative H2 yield of 141.29 ml g−1-CS (or 164.48 ml g−1-TS) and a maximum average rate of H2 production of 12.31 ml g−1-CS h−1 were obtained."
