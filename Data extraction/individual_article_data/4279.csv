0,Introduction,"The present world is faced with issues such as increasing population, high energy demand, and waste disposal challenges [1]. To address the rising energy demand, fossil fuel resources have been used predominantly in the energy sector. However, fossil fuels utilization are associated with environmental issues especially climate change and its adverse effects [2]. Moreover, a large amount of petroleum reserve is positioned in regions of economic and political instability. As a result, there is large volatility in petroleum prices. Fossil fuel consumption is also characterized by the production of significant amounts of greenhouse gases including CO2 [3]. Therefore, there has been renewed interest in the development of alternative energy sources that are environmentally friendly, sustainable, and produced in large quantities to meet the increasing global energy demand.Table 1 Biodiesel is widely perceived as a promising alternative to fossil fuels in the energy [4] and transportation sector [5]. It is one of the most preferred biofuels used in the transportation industry due to its non–toxicity and biodegradability [6]. The global production of biodiesel is expected to reach more than 23 billion liters by 2025 (OECD-FAO data from 2016 to 2025) [7]. Biodiesel can be used as fuels for diesel engines for vehicles, stationary equipment, and furnaces [8]. Also, it can be utilized for heating purposes or to run generators. Overall, it can be either used in the pure form or used when blended with petroleum diesel in different weight fractions [9]. Some studies have also explored the use of biodiesel as an environmentally benign aviation fuel [8,10,11]. McCarthy et al. [12] compared the fuel consumption for two different biodiesel blends with petroleum derived diesel. The biodiesel (B100) showed higher fuel consumption rate of 7.8 kg/h than the petroleum diesel (7.1 kg/h). Their results indicate that biodiesel have lower energy contents than petroleum diesel and the energy content vary according to the biodiesel feedstock. Biodiesel is produced from the transesterification reaction between vegetable oils and animal fats in the presence of short chain alcohols (usually methanol, ethanol, or butanol) and a catalyst (homogeneous or heterogeneous) [13]. Compared to fossil-based diesel fuel, biodiesel generates cleaner exhaust emissions [6]. Other methods of biodiesel production include direct use of raw vegetable oils or blending with petroleum diesel, microemulsions, and pyrolysis which occurs in the absence of oxygen [14]. Among all the production methods, transesterification is still the most popular and well research. Several biodiesel production processes from transesterification including supercritical alcohol transesterification, enzyme-catalyzed transesterification, homogeneous acid-catalyzed reactions, and heterogeneous acid/base-catalyzed reactions have been explored for low-cost biodiesel production [15]. Furthermore, non – edible and low-cost alternative feedstock including lignocellulosic materials, waste cooking oil, and animal fats for biodiesel production has been the subject of research by several scholars [16]. However, the cost of biodiesel is relatively high when compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel [17]. The high biodiesel cost is linked to the use of edible oil which creates the food versus fuel debate and the development of cost-effective downstream product separation [6]. In the field of catalytic biodiesel production, homogeneous catalyzed reactions are preferable due to their simplicity and reduced energy consumption. However, the inability to recover and reuse the homogeneous catalysts is an issue that requires further attention [18]. On the other hand, the heterogeneous catalyst could be recovered and reused easily hence reducing the catalyst consumption and the cost involved [19]. Several studies have also evaluated the production of heterogeneous catalysts from biomass-derived materials including activated carbon, biochar, biomass ash, and waste shell [20]. An excellent review of different biomass-derived heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production was provided by Abdullah et al. [20]. Compared to non – renewable derived heterogeneous catalysts, the biomass-derived catalysts offer several benefits including low cost, non – toxicity, enhanced stability in the acidic and basic medium, and improved catalytic activity. Further studies are required to improve the catalytic performance of biomass mass derives catalysts for biodiesel production. The challenges of elevating biodiesel cost have stimulated interest in several research areas including the development of cost-effective catalysts [19], reactor design optimization [21], and the use of non – edible feedstock.[22]. Several promising review articles have also been reported on various non-edible oils from waste cooking oil [22], Jatropha oil, oil palm fatty acid distillate [23], animal fats, etc. Another drawback of biodiesel production is the poor mass transfer rate due to the immiscible characteristics of the reactant [13]. This issue causes a low reaction rate and long residence time leading to an energy-intensive process [14]. The process intensification through the use of specialized reactor design (microfluidics and cavitation reactors), increased stirring rate or even supercritical technology has been comprehensively studied by several researchers [24–27]. Chuah et al. [26] provided an overview of different intensification technologies including the microwave, ultrasonic, and hydrodynamic cavitation reactors for biodiesel production as well as the merits and limitations of each technologies. In another study, a comprehensive review of recent advances in hydrodynamics-based cavitation technologies for continuous biodiesel production was carried out [25]. The authors suggested that hydrodynamic cavitation technology could be implemented alone or coupled with other process intensification steps for enhanced biodiesel production. Recently, Patil et al. [24] provided an overview of the fundamental operations of the hydrodynamics cavitation technology for biodiesel production. Although, there is ample amount of review and research studies related to biodiesel production, to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no comprehensive review articles that combine advances on catalysis, microfluidics, and cavitation reactor for continuous biodiesel production. Therefore, this review attempts to fill the knowledge gaps by compiling available studies in the field. The present article is organized as follows: first, a description of different homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production is provided with previous studies in this area. The heterogeneous catalyst reviewed in this study includes alkali and alkaline earth metals, metal oxides, ionic liquids, and carbon and biomass-derived catalysts. Then, advances in microfluidics and cavitation reactors together with their advantages and limitations are presented. The article ends with conclusions and future perspectives of biodiesel production from microfluidics and cavitation reactors. In summary, the present study is valuable towards contributing to the literature regarding the ongoing research on biodiesel production. Moreover, the information provided here could be useful to policymakers, industrialists, and researchers in the field."
1,Methodology,"An overview of the conducted reviews on biodiesel synthesis using catalytic methods is presented in this study. The literature search was conducted using Scopus, Google scholar and Science direct database. The search was limited to papers published between 2015 and 2021. It should be noted that some studies were not included due to word limitations. Fig. 1 a summarizes the number of review articles related to biodiesel production in the last 6 years (2015 – 2021). The data were extracted from Scopus (Elsevier’s abstract and citation database) with the filter set to extract review articles and exclude irrelevant subject lines such as few articles in physics, mathematics, astronomy, etc. Fig. 1b outlines the percentage of published articles classified based on different subject areas. As shown in Fig. 1b, the dominant subject area with superior percentage of published review articles on catalytic biodiesel synthesis is energy (26%), chemical engineering (24%), chemistry (17%), and environmental sciences (16%). Moreover, with the interest in biodiesel synthesis increasing over the past few years and the advancement in new ideas related to the design of reactors, multi-objective optimization of reaction variables, and biomass based catalytic reactions, there is a tendency for the percentage of the superior subject areas to increase continuously. The noncatalytic supercritical methanolysis of triglyceride to biodiesel is a noteworthy endeavor because the energy required for catalyst preparation and its associated separate cost are mitigated. Also, oil with high fatty acid content could easily be transformed into biodiesel without limitations. However, this method is still developing and its use for continuous biodiesel synthesis is marred by high cost of materials and energy. The summary of reported reviews on biodiesel synthesis over the past six years shows that most studies focused on catalysis especially heterogeneous catalysts derived from natural wastes or industrial slags [28,29], mixed oxides of mainly calcium-based materials, and sulphonated solid acid catalysts. Also, some studies have reviewed the use of lipase and its immobilization methods to increase stability and performance [30,31]. Very few studies have dwelt on reactor strategies such as microwave and continuous reactors packed bed, bubble reactors, reactive distillation, etc. [28,32]. Here, in-depth insights on advances in preparation, challenges, and limitations of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis for biodiesel synthesis were investigated. The continuous biodiesel synthesis was discussed with emphasis and scope in microfluidic technology integrated into microreactors and cavitation reactors. The detailed explanation of several reactor types, their advantages, and their limitations are beyond the scope of this study. Authors are referred to excellent review articles by [6,33]. It is hoped that this study would provide a framework for intensified research on energy-efficient ways to produce heterogeneous catalysts, engineering cavitation and microreactors for improved biodiesel synthesis."
2,Catalytic biodiesel synthesis,
3,Catalyst for biodiesel,"3.1 Catalyst for biodiesel The use of a catalyst to promote the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils and alcohol to biodiesel has been a subject of interest among several researchers. Heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts as well as biological enzymes have been reported to promote the reaction pathway of biodiesel synthesis [30,40]. Although, most commercial biodiesel production processes employ homogeneous catalysts to promote the reaction pathway and achieve high biodiesel yield, this method usually leads to soap formation. The formation of soap energy-intensive separation steps, while the recovery of homogeneous catalyst is problematic [41]. Enzymes of lipase and immobilized lipase have received great attention for biodiesel synthesis. The use of enzymes to enhance the production of biodiesel offers several environmental advantages, and milder reaction conditions are achievable [42]. A recent review outlined the enzymatic transesterification of triglycerides to biodiesel using non-edible oils [43]. The review also elucidated the enzyme catalytic mechanism, immobilization, affinity, and covalent bonding, etc. [43]. In another study, Sharma and colleagues introduced an interesting approach to increase the robustness of lipase for biodiesel production [44]. Candida rugosa lipase nanoparticles (cNP) were produced and cross – linked. They were also conjugated to magnetic particles. The cNP conjugated with magnetic particles was reported to produce the highest biodiesel yield among the three formulation. Enzymatic catalyzed biodiesel synthesis is promising but the reaction takes a longer time, they are energy-intensive and some enzymes are easily deactivated in the oil impurities or methanol [45]. Heterogeneous catalysts are preferrable when compared to homogeneous catalysts and enzymes due to the facile separation and reusability, soap formation mitigation, shorter reaction time, and appreciably high yield [46]. In addition, the heterogeneous catalysts could be derived from natural biomass sources as well as industrial or municipal sludge [47–49]. Fig. 2 shows the catalyst classifications for biodiesel synthesis. Apart from the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel, a non-catalytic technique such as supercritical fluid technology (SCF) has received increasing attention [50,51]. Compared to the conventional catalytic processes, the SCF offers easier separation, enhanced reaction rate and improved product yield. Furthermore, SCF is not influenced by the fatty acid content of the oil source [50]. In this study, heterogeneous catalysis is the prime focus with emphasis on the trends, and challenges in the application of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, hydrotalcite, carbon-based catalyst, and ionic liquids. Also, the microfluidic and cavitation reactors were highlighted and meticulously discussed in subsequent sections."
4,Homogeneous catalysts,"3.2 Homogeneous catalysts The homogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of oil and alcohols to produce biodiesel can be grouped into alkaline and acid-based catalysts (Fig. 2). The alkaline-based catalysts are more effective (nearly 4000 times faster) in promoting faster reactions when compared to the acid catalysts [52]. However, all the reacting species and the catalyst must be in an anhydrous form to avoid saponification reaction and subsequent hydrolysis of the esters to form free fatty acids (FFA). The in situ formed FFA from the hydrolysis of esters could irreversibly deactivate the catalyst by neutralization reaction forming alkaline salts. Moreover, alkaline catalysts are only effective when the FFA value of the feedstocks is less than 4%. Otherwise, there is a likelihood for soap formation to occur with feedstock containing high FFA content above 4% [53]. The mechanism of transesterification reaction of oil and alcohol proceeds via an attack on the alkoxide group on the alcohol (if methanol is used as alcohol, this attack happens on the methoxide group) to the carbonyl carbon of the triglyceride molecule to form a reactive tetrahedral intermediate [54]. This intermediate reacts with the alcohol to generate an alkoxide ion and further rearrangement of the tetrahedral intermediate generates alkyl esters and glycerol as a byproduct. Depending on the reaction conditions, a small amount of water could be generated in this process, which usually leads to soap formation and ultimately low yield. The primary, or secondary (monohydric aliphatic) alcohols with 1–8 carbon atoms can also undergo transesterification reaction. Alcohols of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-heptyl, with relative reactivity in the order of 1, 0.81, 0.79, 0.80, 0.90, respectively have been used to tailor the transesterification reaction [55]. Methanol is widely used for biodiesel production when compared with other alcohols because of its low cost and enhanced reactivity [56]. However, the main challenge with using methanol is that the triglycerides have low solubility in it and often form biphasic layers that limit contact and mass transfer [57]. To improve this condition, some researchers have used cosolvents of ethers such as methyl tertiary-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) [57]. Oil has a high solubility in ethanol, hence, its mixture with methanol could facilitate a faster reaction. However, in this scenario, both methyl and ethyl esters are produced. The commonly used homogeneous catalysts to promote the transesterification reaction are NaOH, KOH, NaOCH3, and KOCH3. The alkali-metal alkoxides have shown much better catalytic performance compared to alkali hydroxides because they help to avoid the pathway that could lead to water production. Increased water production could elevate the FFA value and decrease the biodiesel yield [52]. The use of cheaper sodium or potassium hydroxides as catalysts results in the formation of methanolate and water, which can increase saponification reactions. Moreover, sodium-based catalysts are reported to produced improved biodiesel yield at a relatively short reaction time (usually 30 min-60 min) when compared with potassium derivatives that revealed appreciably high yield at longer reaction time (120 min). Rocha et al. [58] investigated the dispersion of methanol in oil for biodiesel synthesis over different alkaline several catalysts (NaOH, KOH, NaOCH3, and KOCH3). They reported that the dispersion time takes about 44.6–73.3% of the total time for biodiesel synthesis. Although the catalysts could decrease the dispersion time, most of them increased the methanol-oil interfacial tension. The K-containing catalysts were more active than the Na analogues and realized higher biodiesel yield. In a similar study, Koohikamali et al. [59] optimized the transesterification reaction conditions to produce biodiesel from sunflower oil using NaOCH3 as a catalyst. They reported high fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of up to 100 wt% at 60 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of 3.75, and 60 min reaction time. Although the methoxide catalysts show improved performance in tailoring the transesterification reaction to produce high biodiesel yield, they are very toxic, more expensive, and pose disposal challenges. Therefore, they are not recommended as catalysts for large-scale biodiesel production. The acid catalysts are best suited for the transesterification of high FFA oil; however, they require higher reaction temperature. Notably, acid catalyzed transesterification reactions are characterized by the formation of undesired side products such as dialkyl and glycerol ethers, longer reaction time, and the need for a higher amount of alcohol [60,61]. These limitations rendered acid catalysis unfavorable. Thus, when the FFA is higher than 4%, pretreatments are performed before transesterification reaction is carried out [53]. Chuah et al. [62] studied the pretreatment of FFA rubber seed oils obtained from two different countries (Malaysia and Vietnam) via esterification reaction. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the influence of key esterification reaction parameters such as reaction time, temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalysts loading on the FFA reduction. Catalyst loading was observed to have the greatest influence on FFA reduction. About 99.3% FFA reduction was attained at 50 °C, 1.38 wt%, 15.98:1 molar ratio and 2 h with the Malaysia seed oils as feedstock. On the contrary, the Vietnam seed oils produced a 98.6% FFA reduction at 65 °C, 10.74 wt%, 10:1 molar ratio and 1 h. The esterification before transesterification reaction allows the conversion of most FFA into FAME, which ultimately results in improved biodiesel yield [63]. The cheapest and common acid catalyst to achieve the pre-esterification reaction is sulphuric acid (H2SO4) [64]. However, the use of H2SO4 leads to dark color formation and sometimes undesired side products such as glycerol or soap. Also, p-toluene sulphonic acid, which is an organic acid could be employed to avoid the limitations of H2SO4, however, it is very cost-intensive and hence, unfavorable for industrial application. Table 2 shows some recent studies on the use of homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis."
5,Heterogeneous catalysts,"3.3 Heterogeneous catalysts Although the homogeneous catalysts used for biodiesel production offer several advantages, they are limited by their corrosiveness. Furthermore, it is challenging and almost impossible to recover and reuse homogeneous catalysts [52]. Moreover, the separation of homogeneous catalysts from the reaction products follows energy-intensive steps that could potentially increase production costs. Therefore, several research efforts have focused on the development of cost effective and environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. These catalysts should be easily recovered by simple filtration and reused. Several heterogeneous catalysts have been utilized to tailor the transesterification of triglyceride and methanol to FAME. Heterogeneous catalyst could be either acid or basic catalysts as shown in Fig. 3 . Some heterogeneous basic catalysts used for biodiesel synthesis includes K/γ-Al2O3, Al2O3 supported CaO and MgO catalysts and HTiO2 hydrotalcite catalyst [18,68]. The overall schematics showing the mechanism of a basic heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis is shown in Scheme 1 a [18]. Established plausible alkaline heterogeneous catalyzed BD synthesis posits that the active sites first react with the alcohol to form an alkoxide. The alkoxide is then subjected to nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group of the oil to form reactive intermediate, followed by formation of alkyl ester and diglyceride anion at the active site of the catalyst. The deprotonation of the catalyst occurs in the last step to generate active species that chemically react with second molecule of the alcohol to start another catalytic cycle [69]. The acid heterogeneous catalysts includes the ZrO2, sulphonated zirconia (SZ), sulphonated saccharides and tungsten oxides [70]. It should be emphasized that the heterogeneous acid catalyst exhibit greater tolerance to FFA and water when compared to the homogeneous catalysts [18]. In addition, acid heterogeneous catalysts could catalyze the esterification and transesterification reactions simultaneously. Solid acid catalysts are easy to prepare, recycle, and regenerate [70]. Although promising, few studies have reported the use of heterogeneous acid-based catalysts compared to heterogeneous basic catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. Scheme 1b shows the generalized mechanism of heterogeneous acid-based catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. The commonly used catalysts are basic (alkaline) heterogeneous catalysts that consist of the alkali metal and alkaline earth metals. These alkaline catalysts are usually used as bulk or mixed oxides and they include alkali metals carbonates, alkali metals oxides, alkali metals carboxylic acids, alkaline earth metals carbonates, alkaline earth metals alcoholates, alkaline earth metals oxides, alkaline earth metals hydroxides, and alkaline earth metals carboxylic acids. Additionally, the transition metals salts, silicates, layered clays, and functionalized carbon materials have been used as a catalyst for biodiesel production. The fundamental idea is to convert the FFA in the triglyceride while achieving high stability and favorable biodiesel yield. The next sections would discuss several heterogeneous catalysts used for biodiesel production. 3.3.1 Alkali metals Alkali metals and their analogues are generally inexpensive for the industrial production of biodiesel. Several studies shows that carbonates of potassium (K2CO3) and sodium (Na2CO3) have been widely reported as promising catalysts for biodiesel production [71]. Also, the performance of alkaline salts of K3PO4, and Na3PO4 have been evaluated and have shown to exhibit high catalytic activity towards biodiesel synthesis [72]. All the alkali salts present high solubility in water, but the potassium analogues have significantly higher basic strength compared to the sodium salts in an aqueous medium. However, they deactivate at few reusability cycles because of the formation of weak alkali sites of potassium hydrogen phosphates (KH2PO4, K2HPO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate NaH2PO4. Malins [72] investigated the potential of reusable K2CO3, Na2CO3, K3PO4, and Na3PO4 as a catalyst for biodiesel synthesis from rapeseed oil. They revealed that the potassium salts show higher catalytic performance than the sodium catalysts. However, the latter has low recovery (6.7–23.8% of initial catalyst amount) from the reaction media when compared to sodium catalysts with about 88.2% for Na3PO4 and 87.3% for Na2CO3. They attributed the low recovery of potassium salts to its high dissolution in glycerol (byproduct). The Na2CO3 catalyst could be reused five times without significant deactivation, whereas, the reusability of Na3PO4 revealed a steady decline in catalytic activity [72]. The low stability of these bulk alkali metals in glycerol and methanol has propagated the development of supported alkali metal catalysts. Studies have shown that the hydroxides of Na, K, and Li could be attached to oxides of Ca, Mg, Al, Zr, Si, etc. For example, MacLeod et al. [73] evaluated four alkali-doped metal oxides catalysts, LiNO3/CaO, NaNO3/CaO, KNO3/CaO, and LiNO3/MgO, for biodiesel production from rapeseed oil. They revealed that there is a correlation between the basic strength and the catalyst performance. They concluded that the alkali-doped metal oxides catalysts are promising catalysts to substitute conventional homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production due to the shorter reaction time. The catalysts are easy to prepare, and the preparation methods are cost effective. However, some challenges were encountered during the catalyst reusability. A progressive leaching of the active sites into the reaction mixture was observed resulting in homogeneous activity. The authors noted that the leaching issues must be addressed to boost the viability of the catalysts for large scale biodiesel production. Dai et al. [74] explored the use of supported Li, Na, and K on ZrO2. The solid-state reaction was employed to prepare the composite catalysts by simple mixing, grinding, and calcination at 800 °C for 4 h. Among the synthesized catalysts, Li2ZrO2 showed higher reactivity, basicity, surface area, and stability. The optimum process conditions for the Li2ZrO2 catalyzed reaction were at 65 °C, 6 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol/oil ratio of 8, for 2 h reaction time. In addition, about 99% FAME yield was realized at the optimum conditions. The reusability studies show that Li2ZrO2 catalyst could be reused seven times while maintaining 90% of its original FAME yield. Hindryawati et al. [75] studied the use of three alkali metals (Li, K, and Na) supported on silica obtained from rice husks for biodiesel production from cooking oil. They reported that the calcination temperature tailored the catalyst properties to realize 96.5 to 98.2% biodiesel yield under conditions of 500 °C calcination temperature, 3 h calcination time, 3 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol/oil ratio of 9, 1 h reaction time, and 65 °C reaction temperature. The catalyst could tolerate moisture and FFA up to 1.75% and 1.25%, respectively and they can be reused for six times with minor leaching of alkali metals. Table 3 shows previous studies on alkaline heterogeneous catalysts used for biodiesel production. 3.3.2 Alkaline earth metal oxides and mixed oxides catalysts Alkaline earth metals have been widely applied to synthesize biodiesel from triglycerides. Primarily, Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr oxides have been used in bulk form or supported on Lewis acids or as mixed oxides to achieve high stability in glycerol and methanol, better performance in high FFA and moisture, and appreciably high yield [77]. The typical surface structure of a metal oxide catalysts ( M δ + - O δ - - M δ + - O δ - - M δ + ) including the acidic and basic sites and the plausible reaction mechanism catalyzed by heterogeneous catalyst has been well discussed in the literature [78]. Mohadesi et al. [79] elucidated the process behavior and catalysts performance from biodiesel production over alkaline earth metals catalysts (CaO, MgO, and BaO) doped SiO2. The catalysts were synthesized with the sol–gel method while the transesterification reaction was studied after 8 h of mixing the reactants (corn oil, catalyst, and methanol) at 60 °C and 600 rpm. Among the catalysts studied, CaO/SiO2 catalysts produced the highest yield (97.3%) and purity (82.1%) of biodiesel at 60% catalysts loading. Moreover, the basic strength of the studied alkaline earth metals decreased in the following order: MgO < CaO < BaO. The authors also observed that the type of catalysts as well as the nature of precursors has an effect on the catalyst activity. CaO and its mixed oxides have been widely studied for biodiesel synthesis because it is inexpensive, fairly stable in glycerol and methanol, and could be derived from natural sources. Degfie et al. [80] prepared nano-CaO via thermal decomposition and used it as a catalyst to valorize waste cooking oil to biodiesel. They revealed that the highest conversion of 96% was obtained at optimized reaction conditions of 50 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 8, and catalyst dosage of 1 wt% under 90 min reaction time. In another study, two different nanopowder CaO were studied as catalysts for the transesterification of canola oil to produce biodiesel [81]. The two nanopowder CaO includes the high surface area nano-CaO and moderate surface area nano-CaO. The results revealed that about 99.85% BD could be realized at 65 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 9 and 2 h reaction time. The high surface area nano-CaO required 10 times less catalyst dosage compared to the moderate surface area CaO. Interestingly, the nano-CaO powders could be reused for 10 times without significant deactivation [81]. Colombo et al. [82] utilized commercial CaO to produce biodiesel in a recycling reactor that allows the recovery of excess solvents used in the transesterification reaction. They also performed optimization of reaction variables using statistical response surface methodology, RSM. Under optimized conditions of 3 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol: oil ratio of 6, and 75 min reaction time, 100% conversion was achieved. Similarly, Verziu et al. [83] used commercial CaO and monocrystalline CaO to tailor biodiesel synthesis from different oils under thermal and ultrasonic activation. They revealed that ultrasonic activation promoted a faster reaction rate to achieve 97% conversion at 75 °C, and methanol/oil ratio of 4 under 45 min reaction time compared to a conventional process that takes 2 h reaction time. Although calcined CaO could propagate the transesterification reaction to produce high biodiesel yield, however, the formation of a complex with glycerol and its poisoning on exposure to the atmosphere is problematic and could limit its commercialization. To address the challenges of CaO poisoning as well as the effect of CaO-glycerol complexes on the performance of a catalyst, Reyero et al. [84] studied the heterogenization of biodiesel synthesis over CaO catalyst. They focused on the poisoning of CaO, and two CaO-glycerol complexes (Ca-glyceroxide and Ca-glycerolate) were synthesized to elucidate their stability. These Ca-glycerol complexes were compared with the commercial CaO. Their study revealed that Ca-glyceroxide possesses appreciable basicity and could improve the biodiesel yield to about 83.4% at 2 h reaction time. The Ca-glycerolate had inferior activity reaching only about 29.9% BD yield at the same reaction time. However, these complexes were greatly affected by exposure to the atmosphere compared to commercial CaO Since the activity of CaO-based catalyst is widely studied and applied for biodiesel synthesis, the replacement of the commercial chemicals with natural CaO sources such as limestone, dolomite, and waste carbide has been a subject of research interest among several researchers. Kouzu et al. [85] investigated the industrial feasibility of using CaO from limestone for biodiesel synthesis. The limestone was mechanically milled with immersion in biodiesel to protect it from atmospheric CO2 and moisture poisoning before calcination. The micronization was observed to increase the surface areas well as the FAME yield. About 95% FAME yield was reported at 2 h reaction, 63 °C, and methanol/oil ratio of 4. Moreover, the spent CaO catalyst could be recycled as an industrial material and the glycerol produced could be used for energy production via combustion. Li et al. [86] reported the use of waste carbide slag as CaO-based material to improve biodiesel yield from soybean oil. The calcination at 650 °C, improved the topographical and basic properties of the carbide by transforming the predominant carbide’s Ca(OH)2 to mainly CaO. The produced catalyst led to an increase in FAME yield to about 91.3% at 65 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 9, and 1 wt% catalyst dosage. In addition, catalysts reusability studies shows that the catalyst could be reused three times with a slight decrease in the activity (above 80% FAME yield) due to glycerol poisoning resulting from the formation of calcium-diglyceroxide phases [86]. In another study, carbide waste slag was prepared by a slightly different way from the ones reported by Li et al. [86]. The waste carbide slag was prepared by calcination and solvothermal treatment [87]. A lower FAME yield of 75.3% was reported by using the carbide waste slag calcined at 800 °C with optimal reaction conditions of 9 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol/oil ratio of 10, and 2 h reaction time [87]. Another notable source of CaO for biodiesel synthesis could be derived from waste shells. Eggshells and aquatic shells have been widely reported as renewable and inexpensive CaO sources to replace the fast-depleting chemicals. Santos et al. [56] developed micro-structured CaO from chicken eggshell by calcination at 850 °C for 3 h and then used it for biodiesel synthesis from soybean oil. They reported a yield of 84.53% at a catalyst loading of 5 wt%, which is lower than some other studies that used shells from chicken, oyster, duck, or ostrich. For instance, Wei et al. [88] reported about 95% biodiesel yield using chicken eggshell as catalyst at 3 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol/oil ratio of 9, and 65 °C. The eggs shell catalysts were calcined at 1000 °C for 2 h. In addition, catalysts reusability studies reveals that the catalyst could be reused up to 13 times without significant loss in catalytic activity. However, when the catalysts were used for more than 13 cycles Ca(OH)2 could be produced resulting in catalysts deactivation. Ajala et al. [89] conducted thermal modification of eggshells to obtain CaO that was used for the synthesis of biodiesel from palm kernel oil. They reported about 97.1% yield under optimum conditions of methanol/oil ratio of 10, 4 wt% catalyst dosage, and 50 °C using eggshell calcined at 900 °C. The catalyst could be reused for 5 times with about 6% loss in catalytic activity. Helwani et al. [90] impregnated magnetite (Fe2O3) on a calcined chicken eggshell. They used the calcination-hydration-dehydration treatment method to prepare the catalyst. About 90% biodiesel yield observed with at optimal conditions of methanol/oil ratio of 10, 70 °C, 1 wt% catalyst dosage, for 2 h reaction time. Fayyazi et al. [91] studied the use of calcined chicken eggshell as catalyst for biodiesel synthesis in a continuous centrifugal contactor separator using sunflower oil and tetrahydrofuran as cosolvent. They revealed that the catalyst and reaction products can be continuously separated in this reactor with an appreciable FAME yield of 83.2% with a productivity of 638 kgFAME/(m3reactor·h) under conditions of 60 °C, oil flowrate of 9 mL/min, methanol/oil ratio of 11 and weight hour space-time of 0.05 h. The catalyst was reused for 6 times with a slight decrease in catalytic activity due to the formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. Additional studies on the transesterification reaction of triglyceride and methanol to produce biodiesel using CaO from various sources can be found in the literature [92–94]. Binary and ternary mixed oxides catalysts can be prepared using alkali and alkaline earth metal sources as well as metals such as Zr, Sn, Ti, Al, Si, SBA-15, MoO3, etc. The mixed oxide catalysts are often used to improve process stability and enhanced surface properties. Furthermore, they can promote biodiesel synthesis even with high FFA. Witoon et al. [95] used supported CaO on bimodal meso-macroporous silica as catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. The bimodal silica support was prepared by the sol-gel method using sodium silicate as a silica precursor and chitosan as a template. They reported that the amount of CaO loading on the silica and the pellet size could influence the stability. CaO with smaller pellet sizes showed the least stability when compared with large pellet sizes. Moreover, the catalyst could be reused for 5 times with slight dissolution of the CaO in the macropores of the silica. Syamsuddin et al. [96] prepared Ca-La mixed oxide catalysts via co-precipitation. The mixed oxide catalyst was tested for biodiesel synthesis from Jatropha oil. The authors reported a relatively high FAME yield (100%) at optimal conditions of 150 °C, 2 h reaction time, methanol/oil ratio of 4, and 500 rpm agitation speed. Moreover, contacting organic matter in the transesterification reaction could mask the catalyst surface resulting in deactivation. Therefore, the authors performed regeneration process by thermally treating the catalyst at 500 °C for 3 h to achieve an unchanged FAME yield of 100% which was reused five times. Marinković et al. [97] investigated the effects of different amounts of CaO from different precursors (nitrates and acetates) loaded on γ - Al2O3 for biodiesel synthesis. They reported that an increase in calcination temperature promoted basicity up to 475 °C for Ca-nitrate precursors, whereas the basicity of the catalyst obtained with the Ca-acetate precursor was unchanged. Recently, Zhang et al. [98] investigated a trimetallic oxide catalyst of SrO-CaO-Al2O3 for the synthesis of biodiesel from palm oil. The catalyst was prepared via the hydrothermal method, followed by thermal activation at 850 °C for 4 h. The results revealed that about 98.16% FAME yield was produced with the catalysts under conditions of 65 °C, 3 h reaction time, methanol/oil ratio of 18, and catalyst loading of 7.5 wt/%. Also, the leaching of active sites was greatly reduced with the trimetallic oxide catalyst when compared to the conventional CaO catalyst. Moreover, catalysts reusability studies reveals that the reused catalysts were able to sustain about 92.61% FAME at the end of fifth cycle. Similarly, Xie et al. [99] prepared CaO–MoO3–SBA-15 catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil. They reported that calcination temperature and loading of CaO and MoO3 promoted the basicity and catalytic activity. Also, about 83.2% oil conversion was obtained at 6 wt% catalyst dosage, 50 h reaction time, 65 °C, oil/methanol ratio of 50 at methanol reflux. The catalyst could maintain its activity after five cycles without an appreciable decrease in catalytic activity. Two separate studies conducted by Syamsuddin and co-workers on glycerol-free biodiesel synthesis from Karanja oil, crude palm oil, and Jatropha oil and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over Ca-La-Al trimetallic catalyst revealed that above 95% FAME can be realized with this catalyst [100,101]. Besides, the catalyst is stable for high and low FFA content and can be reused for up to five times with a very slight decrease in catalytic activity. Furthermore, Maleki [102] reported the biodiesel synthesis from Canola oil with methanol using 1%Li/Ca-La mixed oxides catalyst. They revealed that calcination temperature at 700 °C for 2 h promoted the generation of basic sites to propagate high FAME yield of above 96% at 65 °C, 2.5 h reaction time, methanol/oil ratio of 15, and catalyst dosage of 5 wt%. Table 4 presents an overview of past research studies related to the use of alkaline earth metal oxides and mixed oxides as catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. 3.3.3 Hydrotalcites Layered double hydroxides LDH also known as hydrotalcite-like materials have ion exchange capacity and they are generally represented as M 1 - y 2 + M 3 + OH 2 y + β n - y / n m H 2 O , where M2+ and M3+are divalent and trivalent cations, respectively. The charge balance cation is represented as β . Studies have shown that this type of material has memory, such that when rehydrated after thermal decomposition above 400 °C to their respective mixed oxides, they regain their structure and properties [112]. The decomposed LDH (mixed oxides) are characterized by strong Lewis basicity, appreciable surface area, and thermally stability. However, hydrotalcite Mg/Al mixed oxides, which are usually used as the support is characterized by low FAME conversion. To increase its catalytic activity, several base metals of groups I and II, have been used. Lima – Correa et al. [110] studied the addition of several base metals (Sr, K, Ba, La) on sol-gel synthesized Mg-Al hydrotalcite for ethylic transesterification of soybean oil. Compared to other base metals, they reported that Ba-Mg/Al and Sr-Mg/Al have stronger alkaline sites. The alkaline site is due to the isolated O2– anions with low coordination number, located on their crystal corners and edges. Therefore, they promoted biodiesel synthesis to over 85% yield. The catalyst could be reused for three times without a decline in activity. However, above the third cycle, severe leaching of the impregnated metals was observed. Similarly, Zanjani et al. [111] synthesized LDH via co-precipitation method followed by impregnation with Ba and Li to form mixed oxides. The synthesized catalyst was tested for biodiesel synthesis from sunflower oil. They reported about 91% biodiesel yield under optimized conditions of 55 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 12, catalyst dosage of 7 wt%, and 12 h reaction time when 40 wt% of Li was impregnated in the LDH. Dahdah et al. [113] produced biodiesel from sunflower over Ca-impregnated Mg/Al hydrotalcite. They revealed that the ratio of the Mg: Al influences the catalytic activity and the impregnation with 40 wt% CaO and subsequent calcination at 600 °C for 4 h promoted the catalyst basicity, resulting in a high FAME yield of over 95% under 60 °C, catalyst dosage of 2.5 wt%, 6 h reaction time, and methanol/oil ratio of 15. First-row transition metals have been exploited for the design of hydrotalcite-like compounds or impregnated on Mg/Al for BD synthesis. Chen et al. [114] prepared magnetic catalyst by growing ZnMgAl‐LDHs on co-precipitated Fe2O3 and subsequently calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. The catalyst was used to produce biodiesel from microalgae oil. The results shows that the catalyst could promote biodiesel yield up to 94% under conditions of 65 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 12, 3 h reaction time, and catalyst concentration of 3 wt%. Also, the catalyst can easily be recovered using a simple magnet and reused seven times with a slight loss in catalytic activity. Salinas Hernández et al. [115] synthesized biodiesel from Simarouba Glauca DC oil by using ZnCuAl LDH catalyst prepared from urea hydrolysis. Urea was used as a precipitating agent and it resulted in a uniform size particle with a high degree of crystallinity. The authors stated that the catalysts calcination promoted the surface properties of the catalysts as well as the decomposition of the OH–, CO3 2– and NO3 – t o form metal mixed oxides. At 300 °C, the highest concentration of medium basic sites was formed on the ZnCuAl catalyst. This resulted in about 94% yield at 160 °C, 5 h reaction time, methanol/oil ratio of 12, and catalyst dosage of 1.25 wt%. The catalyst can be reused for three times with slight leaching of Cu particles. In another study, Prabu et al. [116] synthesized biodiesel by using a nanocomposite catalyst of Mg/Al/Zn Hydrotalcite/SBA-15. They reported that increasing the ratio of Zn from 0.5 to 1 increases the moderate basic sites and suppressed the strong basic site. However, elevating the Mg and decreasing Zn resulted in the decline in the catalytic activity. Moreover, about 90% FAME yield was realized at 225 °C, Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 12 h−1, and methanol/oil ratio of 20. Zhang et al. [117] compared two-reactor strategies (conventional and ultrasonic-assisted synthesis) for biodiesel production using potassium modified hydrotalcite (K/MgAl-LDH). They revealed that incorporation of K+ (6.25 wt% loading) species on the MgAl-LDH generated strong basic sites to improve the biodiesel synthesis. Also, the ultrasonic-assisted reaction technology accelerated the reaction kinetics by exploiting the bubble growth-cavitation effect to realize 99.9% biodiesel yield at 2 wt% catalyst loading, 60 °C, methanol/rapeseed oil ratio of 12, and 5 min reaction time. Although this method reduces operating time, the lack of large-scale ultrasonic reactors and few available information about their features and performance restricts their application to laboratory scale. Besides, their study did not include the reusability of their catalyst. Hydrotalcite and its derivatives have shown promising results towards improving biodiesel yield. In addition, they are stable in glycerol and methanol and have produced appreciable biodiesel yield. However, they require longer reaction time and/or higher temperature to effectively surmount the biphasic methanol-oil reaction regime and promote biodiesel yield. To address their limitations, the catalyst could be used with cavitation reactors or even microwave irradiation reactors. These reactors could significantly propagate their activity towards high biodiesel yield in a very short reaction time. Table 5 shows some selected previous studies that used hydrotalcites as catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. 3.3.4 Carbon-based and biomass-derived catalysts Carbon derived from natural sources has been used with modification with either acid or alkaline to enhance their properties for biodiesel synthesis. The acid modification is conducted when the FFA content of the oil precursor is relatively higher than 1%. Increased acid content could cause soap formation, thereby increasing the difficulties of product separation. Carbon catalysts prepared by in situ sulphonation and carbonization shows stable catalytic performance due to their rigid polycyclic aromatic structure. Fu et al. [124] extracted oil from microalgae and used the microalgae residue to prepare sulphuric acid functionalized carbon as a catalyst for esterification oleic acid and transesterification of triolein. They reported that in addition to the -SO3H groups on the catalyst, the hydrophilic –COOH and –OH contributed to the high catalytic activity of the catalyst, reaching about 98% conversion and 24% methyl ester yield in 12 h reaction time, 80 °C, and 5 wt% catalyst dosage. The catalyst was truly heterogeneous and can be reused for three times without loss in catalytic activity. Calophyllum inophyllum with about 15% FFA was employed as an oil precursor to synthesize biodiesel over sulphonated carbon prepared from Calophyllum inophyllum seed cake [125]. The carbon catalyst enhanced the BD synthesis to about 99% at 180 °C, 4 h reaction time, and 7.5 wt% catalyst dosage. The catalyst was reused for five times with a decline in catalytic activity from 99% to 38% because of the leaching of -SO3H groups. This group is weakly attached to the small carbon sheet surface. In another study, Abu-Jrai et al. [126] prepared carbon catalyst from waste Date pits with 6 wt% KOH modification for biodiesel synthesis from extracted Date pits oil. The KOH modification provided sufficient basicity to improve the biodiesel production to about 91% FAME yield at optimized conditions of 65 °C, 1 h reaction time, and oil/methanol ratio of 9. The catalyst could sustain four times reuse with a slight decrease in catalytic performance due to leaching of K+ and formation of CH3O–. Chuah et al. [27] used empty fruit bunch doped with KOH as heterogeneous catalysts to improve the transesterification reaction of rubber seed oil with methanol. The reaction was performed in an ultrasonic batch system at 2.5 wt% sulphuric acid and 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio at 65 °C for 50 min. An optimal FFA reduction of 97.6% was obtained with the catalyst at the same conditions. The use of the major biodiesel byproduct (glycerol) as a catalyst precursor to promote biodiesel synthesis has been a subject of interest. For every 100 g of biodiesel produced between 10−11 wt% glycerol is produced, which represents an oversupplied commodity [127]. In addition, further purification and refining of glycerol is also expensive due to the high energy cost incurred. It should be emphasized that glycerol has a very low commercial value due to the presence of impurities. Therefore, catalyst production from crude glycerol will boost the viability of biodiesel production via heterogeneous catalysis. Prabhavathi et al. [128] produced a green recyclable catalyst from glycerol by partial dehydration-carbonization reaction for biodiesel synthesis from Karanja (Pongamia glabra) oil. A yield of >99% was achieved at harsh reaction conditions of 160 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 45, 20 wt% catalyst dosage and 4 h reaction time. The catalyst could be reused for up to five times, sustaining about 98% of its original activity. Leaves from the plant residues have shown promising potential when used as catalyst precursors for biodiesel production. This is because these leaves when calcined exhibits various inorganic mineral elements with sufficient basicity to improve the transesterification reaction. In this regard, Aleman-Ramirez et al. [129] prepared heterogeneous catalysts from moringa leaves via calcination at 500 °C for 2 h for biodiesel synthesis. The studies revealed that the calcined moringa leaves contain calcite, dolomite, and K2Ca(CO3)2 compounds, which led to an appreciable yield of 87% biodiesel under conditions of 6 wt% catalyst dosage, methanol/oil ratio of 6, 65 °C, and 2 h reaction time. About three times reusability was achieved with a gradual decline in catalytic activity over subsequent reuse cycles. In two separate studies conducted by Nath et al. [130,131], Brassica nigra and Sesamum indicum plants were used to prepare heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production from various oils. The plants were burned in the open air to obtain ash, followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. Elemental analysis shows that the calcined plants have appreciably high K, Ca, Si, and Mg inorganic elements. These alkaline elements promoted a high biodiesel yield above 98.9. The catalyst reusability studies show that leaching of K+ into the reaction media occurs after reuse resulting in the reduction of catalytic activity. Kamel et al. [132], utilized Ficus carica leaves as a heterogeneous catalyst precursor to synthesize biodiesel from spent cooking oil. The catalyst was prepared by calcination of the leaves at 800 °C for 2 h, followed by activation with 1 M of KOH, K2CO3, and CaCO3, respectively. The results revealed that the leaves activated with KOH presented the best biodiesel yield of 92.73% under the conditions of methanol/oil ratio of 6, 1 wt% catalyst loading, 2 h reaction time, and 60 °C. The calcined leaves present strong alkaline properties and consequently high biodiesel yield. However, they are characterized by ash formation as well as stability problems in glycerol and methanol. Therefore, rapid leaching of the catalyst is usually encountered. Table 6 outlines previous studies that used carbon-based materials as catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. 3.3.5 Ionic liquids (ILs) Ionic liquids (ILS) are typically organic salts that mostly consist of anions and cations and are liquids at ambient temperature. They are known as environmentally friendly catalyst with unique properties such as good thermal stability, easily separable from the reaction mixture, and non-volatile. Several ILs have been employed to produce methyl esters from waste oils and long chain fatty acids. Moreover, the tunable characteristics of ILs catalysts make it very attractive for large-scale biodiesel synthesis. Rajabi and Luque. [141] prepared a tunable aryl imidazolium ILs for the esterification of fatty acids to biodiesel. The ILs were tested with several acids such as triflic acid, methane sulfonic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid. The ILs is miscible with water and soluble in acetone, methanol, and ethanol. Therefore, it could surmount the biphasic problems encountered in methanol-oil reactions. The catalyst promoted the biodiesel synthesis to about 98% yield under 80 °C, 4 h reaction time, and methanol: oil ratio of 7. The ILs could be separated by liquid/liquid extraction using ether and water and were reused for ten time without losing its activity. To reduce the mass transfer resistance encountered in conventional methanol-oil biodiesel synthesis, Cai et al. [142] designed an amphipathic ILs for the synthesis of biodiesel from soapberry oil. The side chain carbon length from C3 to C12 increased the amphipathic capability of the ILs. Thereby promoting the oil-methanol miscibility, resulting in a high biodiesel yield. Moreover, about 98.02% biodiesel yield was realized under conditions of methanol/oil ratio of 25.5:1, catalyst concentration of 0.38 mmol/g, 112 °C, 6 h reaction time, and 1 MPa over 1-dodecyl-(4-dimethylammonium)-pyridinium bisulfate ([C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2) ILs catalyst. It should be emphasized that the separation of the ILs after each reaction from glycerol was achieved via a chemical reaction. The catalyst was reused for five times with a slight decline in biodiesel yield observed after each run. The decrease in yield was attributed to catalyst loss during the recycling process. Phosphonium cation and fluorous anions have been used as a precursor for the preparation of hydrophobic Tetrabutylphosphonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide [143]. The waste cooking oil was first esterified with sulphuric acid, followed by transesterification with methanol. The ILs promoted the biodiesel yield to 81% at 60 °C reaction temperature, 4.5 wt%, methanol/oil ratio of 18 and 10 h reaction time. The catalyst was recovered by centrifuge followed by separation from glycerol by washing with water. The catalysts were reused for four different cycles with a slight loss in catalytic activity observed after each cycle. The recovery and recycling of ILs is problematic because of its miscibility with glycerol. Most times the ILs are recovered by chemical reaction or extraction with chemicals. Chemical recovery of ILs is complex process that requires the use of hazardous chemicals. However, ILs could be used for in situ esterification and transesterification. This option offers an attractive option for biodiesel synthesis from feedstocks with high FFA content. In addition, in situ esterification and transesterification also restricts the two-step method needed to convert the FFA. Some solutions have been suggested to address the limitations of ILs. For examples, a phosphomolybdenum-based sulfonated ionic liquid (ILs) functionalized MIL-100(Fe) metal-organic framework (AIL/HPMo/MIL-100(Fe)) was prepared to promote biodiesel from acidic oil [144]. The developed catalyst has enhanced surface acidity with Bronsted-Lewis acids anchored on a heterogeneous metal-organic framework (MOF). The conversion of acidic oil reached 92.3% under conditions of methanol/oil 30:1, 8 h reaction time, 120 °C reaction temperature, and 9 wt% catalyst dosage. The catalyst can easily be recovered by filtration, washed with hexane and methanol, and then reused in subsequent reactions. After five times of reuse, the conversion slightly decreased sustaining about 90.3%. The decrease was attributed to the surface masking of the catalyst by the organic matter. Rajabi and Luque [141] prepared a hybrid acid organosilica anchored on pyridinium protic ionic liquid. The synthesized catalysts were used to propagate the synthesis of methyl esters from esterification of stearic acid and alcohol (methanol or ethanol). A high yield of methyl esters above 90% could be achieved with either methanol or ethanol under reflux, with methanol presenting the best yield. The catalyst was truly heterogeneous and reused for ten cycles without loss in catalytic activity. The high reusability of ILs without catalysts deactivation demonstrates the potential of this nano catalyst ILs framework for industrial-scale biodiesel synthesis from acidic oils. To increase the recyclability of ionic liquids, Xie and Wang [145], synthesized polyoxometalate-based ILs with tunable Bronsted-Lewis acid sites. The catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture using a simple permanent magnet. Their results shows that the catalyst was efficient even at 20% FFA oil content, sustaining about 75% conversion. Increasing the reaction time from 1 to 5 h resulted in increased FFA conversion reaching 95.45% conversion under 5 h. The catalyst could be reused for five times with a very slight decrease in catalytic activity. The appreciably high stability of the catalyst was attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between the acid groups of the ILs and the amino groups on the magnetic support. This strong interaction ensured no loss of active sites or leaching into glycerol. Some of the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and ILs employed to synthesize biodiesel from different oils and the reactor strategy is presented in Table 7 . From the studies, it is evident that ILs are promising catalyst for biodiesel synthesis from low-quality oil due to their structure and tunable characteristics as well as their ability to accommodate acid-base sites. However, the complex steps required to synthesis ionic liquids and modify them are challenging. Also, a very high methanol/oil ratio, and most times higher temperature about 80 °C, and longer reaction time are required to promote appreciably high biodiesel yield or FFA conversion. Also, the separation from the reaction mixture is problematic and should be improved for ILs that are liquid at room temperature. 3.3.6 Supported catalysts for biodiesel production Heterogeneous catalyst often suffers from mass transfer limitations in the liquid phase reactions during biodiesel synthesis [155]. Therefore, catalyst supports are used to minimize the mass transfer limitations. Supports have the ability to provide improved surface area through the availability of pores where the active metal particles can be attached. Several catalysts support for biodiesel production includes the zinc oxide, alumina, silica, carbon based support and zirconium oxide. The use of carbon-based materials for catalysts and supports have been discussed in previous sections. Therefore, this section would focus on varieties of catalysts support excluding carbon-based materials. Aluminum oxide (alumina) including γ-alumina and ή-alumina has been widely reported as active metal catalysts supports for different chemical processes including hydrothermal gasification [156] steam reforming and hydrogenation reactions [157]. The use of aluminum oxide for catalyst support is due to high specific surface area, superior thermal and mechanical stability as well as large pore volume and pore size [155]. Several studies have evaluated the use of aluminum oxide as biodiesel production catalysts support. Delfort et al. [158] performed a comparative studies of two different catalyst supported by alumina (titanium oxide–zinc oxide and titanium oxide–bismuth oxide). Both catalysts were synthesized by co – mixing, after which they are calcined for 3 h at 600 °C. The authors observed a relatively high surface area for both catalysts. However, longer reaction time of about 8 h was needed to attain biodiesel yield of 94%. In another study, Xie and Li [159] showed that potassium iodide supported by alumina is an effective catalysts for the production of biodiesel. Zinc oxide is another important catalyst support material that is gaining increasing interest for biodiesel synthesis [155]. Yang and Xie [160] showed that zinc oxide is a promising catalyst for alkali earth metal during biodiesel synthesis. Specifically, the ZnO/Sr (NO3)2 catalysts led to an elevation in biodiesel yield to about 93.7%. In another work, a novel zinc oxide supported silver nanoparticles was synthesized and used to enhance the transesterification of palm oil to biodiesel [161]. The catalyst produced an appreciable increase in biodiesel yield. Furthermore, catalysts reusability studies shows that the catalysts could be reused for up to five times without significant loss in activity [161]. Analogous to zinc oxide, zirconium oxide have displayed promising results as catalysts support for biodiesel synthesis [155,162]. Zirconia-supported heteropoly and isopoly tungsten acids minimized the reaction time needed for the conversion of sunflower oil to biodiesel to 5 h. Furthermore, an improved oil conversion of about 97% was obtained [162]."
6,Effect of catalysts preparation methods,"3.4 Effect of catalysts preparation methods The synthesis method of heterogenous catalyst can also affect the yield and end product from biodiesel synthesis reaction. These preparation methods include co-precipitation, impregnation, solid-state, hydrothermal method, microwave-assisted and ultrasonic-assisted synthesis. Depending on the chosen method, the distribution of the active sites (dispersion), structure, crystallinity, and the stability of the catalyst is greatly impacted. For instance, Coral et al. [121] compared microwave-assisted hydrothermal and conventional hydrothermal synthesis for hydrotalcite production. The catalyst was used to promote biodiesel synthesis. They revealed that treatment with microwave promoted higher crystallinity in a very short time of 10 min or 300 min instead of 18 h in conventional method. Also, the irradiative heating of microwave achieved higher temperature of 110 °C, which enhanced the surface basicity (7.31 μmolm−2) four times more than the conventional treatment. Aderibigbe and colleagues [163] concluded that the tri-metallic (Fe-Co-Ni) catalyst synthesized through green synthesis led to higher yields compared to wet impregnation technique. In another study, Hoor and Anbia [118] synthesized a magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxide via co–precipitation method with Zn salt impregnation. The catalysts were tested for biodiesel synthesis from waste cooking oil. They reported that Zn impregnation on the Mg/Al LDH promoted the basicity of LDH to attain about 78.45% FAME yield compared to co-precipitated ZnMgAl that showed only 57.31% FAME yield. They attributed this observation to the participation of both layered and nanoparticle structures of the catalyst in the transesterification reaction when both co-precipitation and impregnation method was used to prepare the catalyst. Only the layered platelet structure of the ZnMgAl sites was available to propagate the reaction when only co-precipitation was used. The catalyst obtained via co-precipitation-impregnation method revealed better stability compared to the catalyst prepared by only co-precipitation. Teo et al. [164] showed that the heterogeneous calcium methoxide catalysts synthesized through hydrothermal methods is cost effective with irregular round shaped particles. Moreover, the hydrothermal synthesis procedure is environmentally friendly process when compared with other catalysts preparation methods. The catalysts showed improved performance for biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas oil. The catalysts can be separated easily from the reaction mixture and reused without noticeable loss in catalytic activity."
7,Biodiesel production reactor types,"A decent biodiesel production reactor should be able to accommodate sufficient heat and mass transfer together with the desired residence time. The type of reactors available for biodiesel production is distinguished based on the production size or process parameters [6]. On the other hand, the main categories of biodiesel production reactors include cavitation reactors, plug flow reactors, microreactors, and microwave reactors. A detailed explanation of the following reactor type, their advantages and limitations are beyond the scope of this review. The authors are referred to excellent review articles by Mohiddin et al. [6] and Tabatabaei et al. [33]. The present study focused on the advances in catalytic technology together with microfluidic technology integrated into microreactors (microfluidics reactors) and cavitation reactors for continuous BD production."
8,Microfluidic reactors,"4.1 Microfluidic reactors Microfluidics technology is generally known as lab-on-a-chip technology because it depends on the micron-ranged interconnected channels. It provides a basis for studying the reaction characteristics of smaller reactor volumes such as a microreactor. Therefore, enabling flexible operations, minimal waste production, less feed consumption, and easier integration with other functional units [165]. The microfluidic reactors are promising alternatives to batch reactors for continuous large-scale biodiesel production. Batch reactors have been used for biodiesel production by several studies [165,166]. On the other hand, batch reactors have also been tested for commercial biodiesel production [167]. However, they are characterized by challenges such as undesirable process economics, long residence time, low production efficiency, and high energy consumption [165]. These limitations have prompted the use of continuous micro-reactors for high-efficiency biodiesel production. It should be noted that biodiesel production in a microreactor is about 10 to 100 times faster when compared with conventional reactors. This is because of the drastic reduction in the time it takes for the diffusion of the reactant molecules through the interface and to react with intermediate species. Furthermore, the use of microreactors eliminates the need for high-energy mixing of reactants and standing time for reactants separation [167]. Micro–reactors can enhance the mixing between reactants and phases involved and enhance the mass transfer rates thereby elevating the biodiesel yield. Micro-reactors can be grouped into microfluidic mixing and ordinary reactors based on the reaction modes in the microfluid chip [165]. The microfluidic mixing reactors are specialized types of reactors that employs a micromixer device for easy mixing. The micromixer can be an active or passive mixer as shown in Fig. 3. The active mixer is controlled by an external power while the passive micromixers could be enabled through molecular diffusion [168]. Microfluidic reactors comprise of microchannel networks that enable efficient storing of small aliquots of liquids and droplets while proving a basis for analyzing and studying smaller liquid volumes during biodiesel production [169]. For transesterification reactions, a droplet-based microfluidic system is more efficient because of its improved surface–to–volume ratio thereby increasing the material interface among the reactants. The microfluidic reactor systems have gained attention for the separation and purification of reaction mixtures during transesterification reactions. The simultaneous phase separation of FAME and glycerol during biodiesel production is slow with low separation efficiency [170]. Moreover, the traditional washing method contributes to increased wastewater generation and energy costs due to drying. Therefore, microfluidic systems are perceived as a promising method for mixture separation and purification during biodiesel production. Although, they are more expensive when compared to ordinary batch reactors [170]. The use of a microfluidics system for continuous biodiesel production has been reported by several researchers [165,169,171,172]. Martínez Arias et al. [171] used an in situ monitoring microfluidic device to study the performance of different microreactor geometry towards improving biodiesel yield from castor oil and ethanol. The microchannel geometry studied includes Tesla-, omega-, and T-shaped geometries. The Tesla- and omega-shaped microchannel were observed to be superior in performance when compared to the T-shaped geometry under similar conditions. Chuah et al. [173] developed a microdroplet microfluidic platform for the transesterification of soybean oil and methanol. The platform is characterized by a large surface-to-volume ratio. This feature helps in the elevation of the material interface thereby increasing the rate of reaction. Yen et al. [174] suggested the use of green solvents for transesterification reactions. They stated that the solvents could be efficiently harnessed at a lower cost with microfluidic devices. Costa Junior et al. [172] proposed a novel metallic microfluidic reactor for the continuous production of biodiesel. The setup consists of multiple microreactors coupled with a series of micro heat exchangers (Fig. 4 ). The feed through the reactor includes soybean oil and ethanol with NaOH catalyst. Moreover, the heat produced from an external source was used to improve the reaction temperature. The reactor revealed an efficiency of 99.6% at residence time below 35 s. The microfluidic system for biodiesel production comprises a reaction channel and an integrated mixer for improved dispersion and effective mixing. The microfluidic mixer device also enables fast and uniform reactant mixing in the reaction channel. The technology appears to reform the field of liquid-based reactions and separation during biodiesel production. However, more research and development are required in this field. For instance, microfluidic devices should be redesigned to accommodate the continuous removal of soap produced from the transesterification reactions. Especially for processes with feedstock containing high FFA content. Moreover, the surface design, the inlet, and outlet techniques together with the channel features need to be revolutionized to reduce the production cost."
9,Cavitation reactors,"4.2 Cavitation reactors Cavitation reactors are promising forms of multiphase reactors that use the energy produced as a result of the chemical reaction created during the formation and collapse of cavities over a small area [33]. The cavities create acoustic streaming, micro–turbulent eddies, and shock waves which facilitate the mixing and mass transfer of the reactants [175]. Moreover, the optimum cavity size is determined by the amount of pressure pulse during collapse while the main volume of the cavitation reactor is based on the life of the cavity [176]. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize various parameters for efficient cavitation intensification. Cavitation could be categorized into four main types based on the methods used to produce the cavities. The acoustic, hydrodynamics, optics, and particle cavitation are the four cavitation types. The acoustic cavitation uses ultrasound in the range of 16 kHz–100 MHz to produce cavities. On the other hand, hydrodynamics and optics cavitation employ pressure variation due to the system geometry and high-intensity photons to produce cavities. Cavities from particle cavitation are produced by the beam of elementary particles [177]. It is noteworthy to mention that among the four types of cavitation, only the acoustic and hydrodynamics produce sufficient intensity needed for chemical processing (such as biodiesel production) [177]. Therefore, both types of cavitation have been comprehensively studied for improving product yield during biodiesel production. 4.2.1 Ultrasonic/sonochemical reactors The ultrasonic reactors use the sound wave generated from acoustic cavitation to improve chemical reactions. The ultrasound which is perceived as the most common sound wave has a frequency range between 16 kHz and 100 MHz [177]. It should be emphasized that higher biodiesel yield and shorter residence time are attained with lower ultrasonic frequency [177]. Moreover, the ultrasonic frequency is inversely affected by the size of the cavitation bubble and the energy released due to the implosion of the bubble. Therefore, to optimize the cavitation effects and ultrasonic energy and to obtain an effective ultrasonic intensified reaction, it is important to control the cavitational efficiency and ensure an even distribution of the ultrasonic cavitation throughout the reactor [33]. Generally, all ultrasonic facilitated reactions are guided by three main energy conversion steps. The first step involves the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy through a transducer (piezoelectric or piezomagnetic transducer). The generated mechanical energy is transformed into acoustical energy in the second step. The frequency of the produced acoustic energy is within the ultrasonic frequency range [6]. The last step involves the conversion of the acoustic energy into cavitation energy through the generation and collapse of cavitation bubbles. A study by Veljković et al. [175] shows that ultrasonic reactors are superior in terms of transesterification efficiency when compared with conventional reactors. Furthermore, an existing conventional biodiesel reactor could be converted into an ultrasonic reactor by simply adding an ultrasonic probe [33]. Another benefit of an ultrasonic reactor is the short residence time (30–180 s) required for a complete transesterification reaction to occur as well as its ability to operate at ambient temperature [15]. For instance, reaction rate performance and time efficiency of ultrasonic cavitation reactor were compared with mechanical agitator for production of methyl esters from non-edible oils of Salvadora alii and Thespesia populneoides [178]. The conducted parametric optimization to determine the optimal reaction conditions reveals that the ultrasonic cavitation produced 3 folds higher reaction constants and time efficiency when compared to mechanical agitation reactor. More than 85% conversion was achieved for both oils under 30 min reaction time, showing the potential of ultrasonic reactors to propagate faster reaction. Similarly, a significant energy consumption savings and extraction time of about 52.3% and 80.9%, was reported using ultrasonic cavitation when compared to traditional Soxhlet extraction [179]. The applied ultrasonic cavitation resulted in significantly improved fatty acid oil extraction from Canarium odontophyllum kernel. It should be mentioned that the reaction products from ultrasonic reactors require additional pretreatment, purification, and separation steps to obtain a pure biodiesel [33]. This additional step could increase the overall process economics. Ultrasonic reactors have several design configurations including ultrasonic horns, ultrasonic baths, sonitube reactors, and hexagonal reactors. The ultrasonic horns which are regarded as one of the most popular sonochemical reactor designs use an immersion type of transducers to generate an increased pressure intensity close to the horn [33]. Depending on the power input and the frequency of operation, the intensity can be decreased exponentially by elevating the distance from the horn [180]. The limitations of the ultrasonic horns include erosion and particle shedding on the emission tip surface, cavitational blockage, and the complexity involved in scale-up [33]. The ultrasonic bath configurations require that the reactor base is irradiated with single or multiple transducers. As a result, maximum intensity is obtained at the center of the transducer while the active zone is limited to a vertical plane located above the transducer. Therefore, the maximum area of irradiating surface should be provided to optimize energy distribution in the reactor. The ultrasonic bath has the advantage of lower ultrasonic intensity [33,177,181]. The difficulties in the large-scale operation of a single transducer with high frequency and power as well as the challenges of finding the appropriate construction material have encouraged the use of multiple transducers. Systems with multiple transducers units can be constructed in different patterns including placing transducers on each side of a hexagon (hexagonal reactors) [21]. Another configuration is a sonitube reactor where a tubular reactor has two ends irradiated with transducers or one ends irradiated with a transducer and the other with a reflector [182]. The use of an ultrasonic-assisted cavitation reactor for continuous biodiesel has been reported by several authors [183–186]. However, several factors should be considered during an ultrasonic reactor design. The reactor size and working capacity, the transducers output density together with the quantity, depth, angle, and probe position with respect to the geometry as well as the probe shape [186]. Sáez-Bastante et al. [187] showed that it is important to have the appropriate FFA composition during batch ultrasonic-assisted biodiesel production. Higher FAME and decreased glyceride concentration were obtained by using feedstock with a shorter hydrocarbon chain and higher saturation. In contrast, unsaturated FFA and longer hydrocarbon chains produced lower FAME [187]. Manickam et al. [185] studied the performance of a triple ultrasonic frequency for BD production from palm oil. The results were compared with that of a single and dual sonochemical frequency. The authors observed an increase in product yield from 75% (with the conventional stirring process) to 93% (with the triple frequency). In contrast, a decrease in residence time from 3 h to 15 min was also achieved. However, the elevation in yield does not make the process economically feasible as a result of the need for downstream processing [185]. Bhangu et al. [184] showed that the use of an ultrasonic reactor could speed up the transesterification reaction of canola oil in the presence of Candida rugosa-derived lipase. The 3.5 cm ultrasonic horn was reported to decrease the residence time of 22–24 h to 90 min. Moreover, the studies show that low-intensity ultrasound is a promising route for enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production. Baêsso et al. [183] reported that an ultrasound-assisted reactor could facilitate the continuous monitoring of the reaction kinetics and intermediate reactions for biodiesel production. In their study, four different reactions from soybean oil were analyzed using KOH catalysts and methanol alcohol. Their results show that the ultrasound helped in differentiating the four reactions without any sample pretreatment [183]. Aghbashlo et al. [188] developed a high–frequency piezoelectric ultrasonic reactor shown in Fig. 5 . The performance of the reactor was evaluated and optimized using the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental approach together with advanced soft computing methods. 4.2.2 Hydrodynamic reactors Hydrodynamic cavitation reactor is employed in biodiesel production to eliminate the challenges of conventional reactor including high residence time, easy scale-up ability, increased product separation and purification cost, higher catalysts absorption, and reduced production efficiency [189]. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor requires less energy when compared with the conventional reactor [190]. Hydrodynamic cavitation reactor is widely regarded as one of the most efficient biodiesel production reactor [173,189]. The technology facilitates improved reactant mixing as well as enhanced mass and heat transfer between the two fluid phases thereby minimizing reaction time [191]. Hydrodynamic cavitation is a phenomenon whereby large number of cavities are formed due to pressure drop from fluids moving through a constriction. When fluid flows through a constriction such as an orifice plate, a drop in the dynamic pressure is observed. A reduction in pressure is often accompanied by the formation of a large number of cavities [189]. Moreover, the fluid velocity increases according to Bernoulli’s principle at the expense of dynamic pressure. Ultimately, the pressure declines below the critical pressure of the moving liquid (biodiesel and methanol mixture) thereby creating vapor clouds. When the system attempts to recover the pressure, expansion of the liquid jet occurs leading to the collapsing of the cavities. The process of cavity formation, growth, and collapsing are accompanying by the release of a large amount of energy, thereby elevating the local temperature and pressure to promote the forward reaction (biodiesel production). A schematic representation of the biodiesel production hydrodynamic cavitation reactor is shown in Fig. 6 . The reactor consists of an orifice plate, a pump, flanges, a collecting tank, and control valves. The centrifugal pump is used to pump the liquid mixtures including alcohol, catalysts, and biodiesel through the orifice plate under high pressure. The control valves are used to monitor and control the system pressure. In contrast, there is a cooling jacket surrounding the collecting tank which is used to control the system temperature. Moreover, the collecting tank allows the re-circulation of the reacting materials and products through the orifice plate and a bypass line. It should be noted that the basic principle of the hydrodynamics cavitation reactor remains the same regardless of the design. The performance of the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor and the rate of reaction could be improved by optimizing the orifice plate geometry. Moreover, it is important to understand the relationship between the operating parameters and cavity formation. Such a relationship would provide the basis for studying the cavitation behavior across the orifice plate [181]. Ghayal et al. [189] used the hydrodynamics cavitation reactor to study the influence of reactor geometry and upstream pressure residence time on biodiesel production from the transesterification of frying oil with methanol in the presence of KOH catalyst. They observed that the mass transfer limitations created as a result of the triphasic transesterification reaction were suppressed by the hydrodynamics cavitation. Moreover, an elevation in the upstream pressure led to an increase in the transesterification reaction and pressure drop across the orifice plate. Another study by Pal et al. [190] showed that biodiesel production from Thumba oil and its blend using hydrothermal cavitation reactor could be used as a low-cost and environmentally friendly fuel when compared to diesel fuel. Moreover, 30% biodiesel blends of Thumba oil have superior brake power and thermal efficiency together with decreased smoke opacity compared to diesel fuel [190]. Chuah et al. [176] evaluated the possibility of using the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor for biodiesel synthesis from waste cooking oil. The authors studied the effect of four different orifice plate geometry with respect to the inlet pressure. The authors observed that the mass transfer resistance from immiscible reactants were restricted with the help of increased turbulence produced by the cavitating bubbles. Furthermore, the hydrodynamics cavitation technology produced superior efficiency (8 times) at a lower reaction time when compared with the conventional mechanical stirring method [176]. In another study by the same authors [193] the hydrodynamics reactor was used to study the performance and emission properties of different blends of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil. The hydrothermal cavitation reactor produced high quality biodiesel with decreased brake power (1.6–6.7%), brake specific fuel consumption (2.1–9.0%) and exhaust gas temperature (1.0–6.8%) as well as lower brake thermal efficiency (1.9–8.4%) when compared with diesel fuel. Their study showed that the hydrodynamics cavitation reactor could be a promising reactor for large scale biodiesel production [193]. Bokhari et al. [194] showed that the use of hydrodynamics reactor provided improved energy efficiency, requires less reaction time and improved rate constant when compared with mechanical stirring. The authors used a 50 L volume pilot-scale hydrodynamic cavitation reactor to synthesize FAME with 96.5% yield from rubber seed (Hevea brasiliensis) oil [194]. In a recent study, Samani et al. [191] used a built-in hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (Fig. 7 ) for biodiesel production from Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.). The influence of residence time (30, 60, and 90 s), alcohol to oil ratio (6, 8, and 10), concentration of KOH catalysts (0.75%, 1%, and 1.25%), and rotor-stator distance (1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm) on the product yield was evaluated using the RSM. An optimum yield of 89.11 % was obtained at 0.94% catalyst concentration, 1: 8.36 alcohol to oil molar ratio, for 63.88 s and 1.53 cm rotor-stator distance. Innocenzi et al. [195] compared two different feed materials (virgin oil and waste cooking oil) and two different reactor configurations (conventional reactor and the hydrodynamics cavitation reactor) for biodiesel production using the life cycle costing approach. The cavitation reactor was reported to reduce the energy consumption by 40% when compared with the conventional reactor. Also, the total treatment cost of waste cooking oil is 60% lower than that of virgin oil. Table 8 compares the pros and cons of the two types of cavitation reactors (ultrasonic and hydrodynamics reactors). The hydrodynamics reactor has the advantages of lower erosion challenges and lowers energy input per unit of reactants when compared with the ultrasonic reactor [33]. Also, their energy source is different since ultrasonic derives its energy from the acoustic field and hydrodynamics is due to pressure variation propagated by the orifice geometry. Hence, hydrodynamic reactors appear more feasible for industrial scale-up with minimal cost compared to ultrasonic reactors."
10,Remarks and future directions,"The diversity in biodiesel production processes allows us to explore different routes to obtain the best results. However, every process has disadvantages and therefore there is no perfect process. Catalysts are used to improve the performance of the transesterification reaction, which propelled research works to focus on decreasing the challenges of catalysts utilization such as deactivation, separation from the reaction mixture, and leaching to improve its reusability. In general, heterogenous catalysts present fewer issues compared to homogenous catalysts but there are still some barriers to their use such as the efficiency loss for a large amount of reusing cycles and high cost. Most of the processes that show a low-efficiency loss for catalyst reusing cycles are complex and expensive resulting in difficulties during scale-up. The reactor type and optimization for biodiesel production is also an important consideration for future studies. The batch reactors usually present the longest residence time and high energy consumption. The alternative reactors present some limitations as well, for instance, microfluidic reactors are still in the development stage. In addition, future studies are required to reduce the reactor cost. This could be achieved through efficient optimization of the process and the design of low-cost equipment components. On the contrary, ultrasonic cavitation reactors often encounters challenges such as erosion and higher energy consumption compared to hydrodynamic reactors. The batch and continuous flow reactors (especially continuously stirred tank reactors), which have been used commercially to synthesize biodiesel offers consistent product quality, high conversion, low capital, and operational cost, and longer reaction time. In contrast, the use of acoustic reactors provides a promising alternative that can speed up the reaction rates for biodiesel synthesis and drastically reduce energy requirements. However, soap separation lines should be incorporated, and future studies should focus on designing and optimization of different reactor strategies for maximizing soap separation. Machine learning technology (ML) have also become an important part of biodiesel research. Machine learning models could be used to design, monitor, control and optimize biodiesel production processes. Machine learning technologies can be used to predict biodiesel product yield, model biodiesel properties and the biodiesel – fueled engines. The complexity of biodiesel production systems as well as the dynamic properties originating from the use of different feedstock makes ML appropriate to model the system when compared with conventional optimization strategies [196]. Aghbashlo and colleagues have comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning in biodiesel production research [197]. Recently there have been a growing interest in the use of ML to model high quality biodiesel production because of the need for automating biodiesel plants, reducing the biodiesel production cost and improving biodiesel quality. Although there is ample amount of studies related to the use of ML for biodiesel production, very few studies have explored machine learning models for the control and real time monitoring of real – world biodiesel systems. Therefore, future research direction should focus on the application of ML for controlling, monitoring and optimization of large-scale biodiesel production facilities. Sustainability features of biodiesel production using advanced sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessment, exergy [198] and their combinations is also necessary as part of future studies. A detail sustainability assessment studies showing the most cost effective and environmentally friendly biodiesel production route should be identified. In addition, the economic viability of different biodiesel production pathways should also be evaluated. Therefore, it is recommended that techno-economic studies and exergy-based analysis should be conducted on different catalysts, reactor types, feedstock consumption patterns and production pathways to provide insights on the cost, energy, and process operation feasibility. Also, the process integration and intensification should be explored to remedy the limitations of biodiesel production reactors for enhanced commercialization and overall cost reduction. In particular, the integration of supercritical reactors with cavitation configuration could produce interesting research novelty, which can be used for high FFA oils, while achieving high yield in milliseconds."
11,Conclusions,"Biodiesel is widely known as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation industry. In addition, biodiesel is one of the most preferred biofuels used in the transportation industry due to its non – toxicity and biodegradability.
