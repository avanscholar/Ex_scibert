0,Introduction,"To relieve the stress of fossil energy shortage, biomass is regarded as a substitutable resource which has enormous potential [1–5]. It is currently explored for the production of added-value chemicals and alternative fuels through bio-refinery [6–8]. Platform molecules, prepared through biomass raw materials, are particularly valuable [9]. Levulinic acid (LA), which can be produced economically and easily from the carbohydrates in lignocellulosic biomass, is one of these promising platform molecules [10]. It can be converted into value-added products including γ-valerolactone (GVL), 1,4-pentanediol (PD) and methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) as shown in Fig. 1 [11,12]. Among these products, GVL is highly applicable and could be utilized widely because it is an intermediate for production of chemicals, fuel additives and renewable solvents [13]. Owing to the wide application, the targeted GVL production, which is achieved by hydrogenation of LA, has drawn much attention in recent studies [13,14]. Numerous metal-based catalysts including homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts, have developed for the hydrogenation of LA [12,15,16]. In these two kinds of catalysts, homogeneous catalysts are not suitable for GVL production, because the uneconomical distillation is necessary for the separation of GVL and catalysts [17]. Realistically, in order to separate catalysts more easily from non-volatile GVL in large-scale manufacture, solid catalysts are more appropriate. In the numerous systems for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL, using H2 as a hydrogen source with transition metal heterogeneous catalysts is universal. This system has been used for a long time; Schuette and Thomas used PtO2 as catalyst for GVL synthesis in different solvents (GVL yield of 94%) in 1930 [18]. In 1940s, Raney Ni catalyst was used at 200 °C and 5–6 MPa of hydrogen pressure, and GVL yield reached 94% [19]. In recent years, a lot of noble and transition metal catalysts have developed for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL [15,20–22]. Among these catalysts, Ru/C catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance including high LA conversion and high selectivity of GVL. Manzer compared the catalytic performance of different metal catalysts supported on activated carbon including Ir, Rh, Pd, Ru, Pt, Re and Ni at 150 °C, 5.5 MPa of hydrogen pressure and the solvent of 1,4-dioxane [22]. The results showed that Ru/C exhibited the best catalytic activity and with the further optimization, complete conversion and 95% selectivity were obtained. Besides, Tukacs et al. compared three different catalysts (10%Pd/C, 5%Ru/C and Raney-Ni) and found that Ru/C exhibited the highest catalytic activity (with 82.9% conversion) at 100 °C and 10 MPa of hydrogen pressure [23]. Upare et al. found that with the 5% Ru/C catalyst, high conversion (100%) and high selectivity (99%) were obtained at 265 °C [15]. The high cost of noble metal catalysts significantly limits the practical application in large-scale production. Therefore, the non-noble metal catalysts, such as supported Cu and Ni, have drawn much attention [20,25–28]. The CuZrO2 catalyst prepared by co-precipitation exhibited a relatively high surface area and 80% yield of GVL with an effective reaction rate [26]. NiMoO x /C for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL showed 300 times higher turnover number than previously reported noble metal-free catalysts [28]. Supported Ni catalyst, which is cheap and easy to separate owing to the magnetism, has been studied in recent years and some of the Ni catalysts exhibit high catalytic performance. For instance, Hengst et al. found that 92% LA conversion and 100% GVL selectivity was achieved using the15 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 at 200 °C, 5 MPa of hydrogen pressure after 4 h in a solvent free reaction [27]. For practicable application, the cycle performance of catalyst is indispensable to research. The change of chemical states, agglomeration of metal particles and metal leaching will cause the catalyst deactivation. Among these factors, metal leaching is a major issue in efficient production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) from levulinic acid (LA), which deactivates the supported metal catalysts and contaminates the product [29]. For example, Gundekar and Srinivasan found that the decrease of LA conversion was due to the Ni leaching in the reaction solution [30]. Metal leaching also occurs with other metal catalysts such as Ru-based and Cu-based catalysts [31–33]. Therefore, some researchers take measures to prevent metal leaching. For example, Zhang et al. added Ag to Cu-supported γ-Al2O3 to prevent Cu leaching and the catalyst exhibited excellent recycle performance [29]. Currently the supports of Ni catalysts for GVL synthesis are mainly metallic oxides such as MgO, Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and ZrO2 [25,27,34]. Carbon has demonstrated good performance as a catalyst support for its robust intrinsic properties such as excellent chemical, thermal, unique electronic property and mechanical stability. However, few of literatures relating to hydrogenation of LA to GVL over carbon-based Ni catalyst were reported [35]. Even though it was mentioned in some literatures, Ni/C catalyst was just aimed at comparing with other catalysts and there was no further study on it [28]. Therefore, applying the carbon-based Ni catalysts to GVL synthesis has huge space to investigate. Recently, converting biomass waste into functional carbon materials which can effectively utilize biomass waste has drawn much attention [36–39]. One of the applications for these carbon materials is to implement them as catalyst supports [37]. However, synthesis of most carbon-based catalysts from biomass waste typically undergoes complex and expensive procedures including carbonization, activation, impregnation and reduction. The first two steps are to prepare carbon material and the last two steps are to load active metal [37]. In most cases, these two parts are independent, which would consume much energy. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design a simple and cheap strategy to produce Ni/C catalyst through biomass waste. Herein, we reported in situ fabrication of pomelo peel-derived Ni/C catalyst by self-reduction, which was simple, cheap and hydrogen free. Compared with the conventional method, the whole procedure was simplified to two steps includes impregnation and carbonization. By changing carbonization temperature, the size and dispersion of Ni particles can be controlled. For this synthesis method, additional chemical was not necessary except nickel nitrate which was essential, and additional reduction was also not necessary. Besides, the synthesis mechanism of Ni/C catalyst with self-reduction was investigated, which was mainly attributed to the carbon and reducing gas such as CO produced during the carbonization process. For the catalytic performance of GVL synthesis, a high yield (94.5%) can be obtained and it exhibited good stability up to 5 cycles without obvious loss of catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The pomelo peel was collected from our daily life. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98.0%) was purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory. Raw wooden activated carbon (AC) (200 mesh, ∼1400 m2 g-1) was purchased from Sunson Activated Carbon Technology Co., Ltd. Levulinic acid (LA, 99.0%) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. γ-Valerolactone (GVL, 98.0%) was purchased from Macklin Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts Ni/C catalyst was prepared as follows: the yellow skin of pomelo peel was removed and the white part was cut into pieces. Then it was dried in the vacuum freeze dryer for two days to remove the water. Next, pomelo peel was grinded up by disintegrator and impregnated with aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate under stirring at 50 °C until dryness. In this step, 2 g pomelo peel was impregnated with 15 mL aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate and the concentration of solution was 4 × 10−3 g mL−1, 8 × 10−3 g mL−1, 12 × 10−3 g mL−1, 16 × 10−3 g mL−1, 24 × 10−3 g mL−1 or 32 × 10−3 g mL−1. It should be stated that the concentration of solution was calculated based on the mass of Ni. After that, the sample was dried in the drying oven for 12 h. Finally, the dried sample was carbonized for 3 h in N2 flow and rate of flow was 30 mL/min. The as-prepared sample was designated as “x-Ni/C-y”, with “x” and “y” representing the concentration of solution and carbonization temperature, respectively. With the concentration of 4 × 10−3 g mL−1, 8 × 10−3 g mL−1, 12 × 10−3 g mL−1, 16 × 10−3 g mL−1, 24 × 10−3 g mL−1 and 32 × 10−3 g mL−1, the corresponding “x” is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8, respectively. For comparison, pomelo peel was directly carbonized in N2 flow at 400 °C, which was referred to as DC. Besides, 2-Ni/AC-400, in which AC was as support and 2-Ni/DC-400, in which DC was as support were also prepared and the mass of nickel nitrate was calculated based on the Ni loading of 2-Ni/C-400. 2-Ni/AC-400 was prepared by impregnation and further reduced by the carbothermal reduction [40]. The preparation process was as follow: AC was added to aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate and stirred to dryness at 50 °C; then it was dried in the drying oven for 12 h. After that, the dried sample was calcinated for 3 h at 400 °C in N2 flow and rate of flow was 30 mL/min. The preparation method of 2-Ni/DC-400 was the same as 2-Ni/AC-400 and replaced AC with DC."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The LA hydrogenation was performed in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a heating system and a mechanical stirrer. Firstly, 0.3 g LA and 30 mL water were loaded in the autoclave reactor. Next, after the catalyst was prepared and cooled down to room temperature, it was immediately thrown into the autoclave reactor for avoiding oxidation. Subsequently, the autoclave reactor was completely sealed and removed air for 5 times with pure H2. After the H2 was injected, the reactor was heated at presupposed reaction temperature. Finally, when the reaction was over, the reactor was cooled down to the room temperature. The product was determined by the high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC Waters e2695) with the Shodex SH1011 sugar column. The reactant and product were detected by the Waters 410 refractive index detector. The mobile phase was 5 mM sulfuric acid aqueous solution with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. The conversion of LA, products selectivity and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) were calculated using the formulas as follows: Conversion ( % ) = mole of LA consumed / mole of LA fed Yield ( % ) = mole of product produced / mole of LA fed Selectivity ( % ) = mole of product produced / mole of LA consumed TOC (%) = mole of carbon in the product/mole of carbon in the LA fed"
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The crystalline structure of the catalyst was examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is performed on an X'pert Pro Philips diffractometer, using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541841 nm). The measurement condition is in the range of 2θ = 5°–80°, step counting time 10 s, and step size 0.0167° at 298 K. The morphology of catalysts was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU-70), which is operated at 5.0 kV. The dispersion of nanometal particles was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), which was determined by a JEOLJEM-2010 microscope at 200 kV. The sample was suspended in ethanol and dispersed ultrasonically for 30 min. Then, a small drop of the dispersion was placed on a carbon film coated copper grid and dried in air before testing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp. Altrincham, UK) with an Al Kα source (1486.6 eV), and all the binding energies of Sn were revised according to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Thermogravimetriy-Mass Spectrometry (TG-MS) is carried out from 323 K to 1073 K at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under flowing N2 gas using linsais STA PT1600. The Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectrum was taken on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance attachment and MCT detector using 32 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution. The Ni loading was established using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometers (ICP-OES), which is conducted on Optima 8000. The contents of C, H, O and N were measured by elemental analysis (EA), which is conducted on Elementar Vario EL (Germany)."
6,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of the as-obtained samples are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of Ni/C with different Ni loadings and Table 1 shows the actual Ni loading, which was tested by ICP-OES. In the XRD patterns, a broad peak between 15° and 30° was observed in all samples, indicating that the amorphous carbon was formed after carbonization. Compared with DC, there were three additional peaks in diffraction patterns of Ni/C. They were Ni (111), Ni (200) and Ni (220) at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, respectively [41]. Meanwhile, we can find that with the increase of Ni loading (≤33.9%), there was not obvious change of the Ni peaks. But when the Ni loading increased to 42.6%, the peaks of Ni were obviously sharp, which means the growth of Ni particles. Fig. 2(b) shows the XRD patterns of Ni/C with different carbonization temperatures from 300 °C to 800 °C. It can be divided into three regions according to carbonization temperature: 300 °C, 400–600 °C and 700–800 °C. When the carbonization temperature was 300 °C, there was no peak of metal Ni because metal Ni has not formed. When the carbonization was 400–600 °C, metal Ni formed and the existence form of carbon was amorphous carbon. Until the carbonization temperature increased to 700 °C, the peak of graphite (002) which was at 26.6° can be observed. It is attributed to the higher carbonization temperature which can increase the degree of graphitization. Meanwhile, it was obvious that the peaks of Ni were sharper with the increase of carbonization temperature. Crystallite size of metal Ni was calculated by the Scherrer formula and the results are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). As we can see, in a large range (6.6%–33.9%) of Ni loading, the particle size was about 4 nm and had no obvious change. However, carbonization temperature influenced the particle size a lot. The particle size increased to 25.3 nm from 4.3 nm with the carbonization temperature increased from 400 °C to 800 °C. The higher carbonization temperature can promote the growth and agglomeration of Ni particle, thus causing the poor dispersity. Normally, nickel nitrate will decompose into nickel oxide when treated with high temperature. However, as mentioned above, metal Ni was obtained after carbonization in N2 without any additional reduction. So it is possible that some reducing substances produced during the carbonization of pomelo peel accomplish the reduction of nickel oxide in situ. According to the previous literatures, carbothermal reduction is one of the reduction methods. For instance, it was reported that metal Ni was obtained by calcination in N2 after impregnation with active carbon [42]. Meanwhile, it was reported that when biomass was carbonized in the inert gas, some gases would volatilize including CO2, CH4, CO and so on [43]. Besides, Li et al. reported that Cu/C was prepared with the precursor of corn stalk through calcination in N2, and reduction of Cu is attributed to the gas products such as CO during the carbonization process [44]. In view of the above-mentioned literatures, we suppose that it is possible that carbon and CO produced in the carbonization process play an important role in self-reduction. To verify our supposal, TG of pomelo peel was performed as shown in Fig. 3 (a). With the increase of temperature, the weight decreased with different rates. The weight had a slight loss below 150 °C, which is possibly owing to the remove of water. There existed a steep curve from 150 °C to 300 °C, which indicates that the weight loss was fast in this stage. It is reported that this weight loss is attributed to the pyrolysis of oxygen-containing groups in the pomelo peel [35]. When the temperature exceeded 500 °C, the TG curve tended to be stable, which means that the weight of pomelo peel rarely changes. Fig. 3(b) shows the TG-MS curves of CO, CO2, CH4 and H2O. The peaks of gas indicate that these three gases can be detected and we can find that the peak of CO appeared at around 330 °C. Therefore, when the catalyst calcination temperature is higher than 330 °C, the CO has released and can be utilized. As mentioned above, carbothermal reduction is one of the self-reduction methods. To realize complete reduction, high temperature is necessary when using carbothermal reduction because high temperature can promote the reduction. However, the high temperature will also promote the growth and aggregation of metal particle, which is harmful to catalytic performance. For comparison purpose, commercial active carbon and DC were chosen to be as supports to prepare Ni/AC and Ni/DC and the results are shown in Fig. 3(c). In the XRD patterns of Ni/AC and Ni/DC, there were a few NiO peaks which were positioned at 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.9°, 75.4° and 79.4°, respectively [42]. It indicates that NiO doesn't reduce to Ni completely in Ni/AC and Ni/DC. Comparing with Ni/C, it is obvious that it was more efficient to reduce NiO by in situ self-reduction method. Based on the results of XRD and TG-MS, we think that carbon and CO produced during carbonization process play a key role in self-reduction. Meanwhile, it is more efficient to reduce NiO than carbothermal reduction in lower calcination temperature, which can prevent the agglomeration of metal particles and consume less energy. The SEM images of 2-Ni/C-400 are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). It can be found that there was irregular fold with rough surface in Fig. 4(a). After further magnification of image, as shown in Fig. 4(b), it can be observed that some small and highly dispersed particulates on the surface. The TEM images of 2-Ni/AC-400, 2-Ni/DC-400 and 2-Ni/C-400 are shown in Fig. 4(c)–(e). The metal particles in the Ni/C and Ni/AC were both well-dispersed but with different particle sizes. To compare the particle size and dispersion of Ni/C with different Ni loadings, the TEM images of 2-Ni/C-400, 6-Ni/C-400 and 8-Ni/C-400 were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4(e)–(g). As we can see, the size of Ni particle was small and it dispersed on the carbon matrix uniformly in 2-Ni/C-400. For the 6-Ni/C-400, the distribution of Ni particles was also uniform but a little dense owing to the increase of amount of Ni particles. However, for the 8-Ni/C-400, it seemed that the amount of Ni particles was too many and the carbon matrix can't provide enough space to support it. The distribution of Ni particles was dense and some particles aggregated in 8-Ni-400. The TEM image of 2-Ni/C-800 is shown in Fig. 4(h) to observe the influence of carbonization temperature. We can find that the aggregation of Ni particle is very serious, because the high carbonization temperature can promote the growth of Ni particle, thus causing the poor dispersity. The high-magnification HR-TEM images of 2-Ni/C-400 and 2-Ni/AC-400 are shown in Fig. 4(i) and (j). Interplanar crystal spacing values of 0.203 nm and 0.209 nm are corresponding to Ni (111) and NiO (200), respectively. According to the value, we can find that Ni particle was found in Ni/C catalyst. While both Ni and NiO existed in Ni/AC, and NiO was located in the edge of Ni particle. The particle size of 2-Ni/C-400 and 2-Ni/AC-400 was counted as shown in Fig. 4(k) and (l). It was obvious that the particle size of Ni/C (4.2 ± 0.8 nm) was much smaller than Ni/AC (13.2 ± 1.7 nm). Based on the TEM results, we can conclude that by in situ self-reduction method, which is straightforward, cheap and hydrogen free, we can obtain Ni/C with small and well-dispersed Ni particles. As mentioned above, metal Ni was formed in Ni/C catalyst by self-reduction and the reason was investigated. Meanwhile, small Ni particles with high dispersion were observed. Thus, it was also necessary to investigate the formation mechanism of Ni particle with small size and high dispersion. The FTIR spectrums of pomelo peel and 2-Ni/C-400 are shown in the Fig. 5 . In the FTIR spectrum of pomelo peel, the broad adsorption peak at 3420 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group, while the band at 2927 and 1748 cm−1 can be assigned to symmetric stretching vibrations of CH in alkane groups [45]. The peaks at 1440, 1383 and 1332 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO in carboxyl [46]. Meanwhile, the peak at 1259 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO in ester and the peaks at 1105, 1055, and 1030 cm−1 are assigned to CO vibrations in alcohol (ROH) groups. For the sake of comparison, the FTIR spectrum of 2-Ni/C-400 is also performed. The intensity of peaks had an obvious decrease and the peaks of CO in alcohol (ROH) which are at 1105–1030 cm−1 almost disappeared. From the FTIR spectrum, we found that there exist abundant oxygen-containing groups in the pomelo peel and these groups were removed a lot after carbonization. These oxygen-containing groups can promote the pomelo peel to absorb water, thus enhancing its hydrophilic. Besides, these oxygen-containing groups can bind to metal ions through both coordinate and electrostatic approaches. It means that the Ni2+ can be absorbed by the oxygen-containing groups on the surface of pomelo peel. Meanwhile, the element analysis of pomelo peel and 2-Ni/C-400 is performed in the Fig. 5(b). We found that C content increased from 42.01% to 56.64%, while O content decreased from 50.03% to 18.36%. The huge decrease of O content was owing to the remove of oxygen-containing group and the result was corresponding to the result of FTIR. Based on the results of FTIR spectrum and element analysis, a plausible mechanism for the formation of Ni/C with high dispersion was proposed as shown in Fig. 6 . When the pomelo peel is immersed in nickel nitrate solution, the Ni2+ is bonded to the abundant oxygen-containing groups. The oxygen-containing groups is dispersed everywhere on the surface of pomelo peel, so the Ni2+ bonded on them is also uniform rather than gathering together. This natural property lays the foundation for the high dispersion of Ni/C. Carbon and reducing gas such as CO produced during the process of carbonization play the role in self-reduction. Finally, the well-dispersed metal Ni particle on the carbon is formed. The catalytic performance of Ni/C was tested in the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. Several parameters that might affect LA hydrogenation were tested to optimize the reaction condition. It is proven that the catalyst dosage, Ni loading, reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst calcination temperature will affect the GVL yield. After the reaction, the liquid products were analyzed by HPLC and it was found that only GVL and 1,4-Pentanediol (PD) were detected. The PD is not discussed here as its yield was too little. The data variation was listed in the results. Meanwhile, the results of TOC were also exhibited to judge the carbon balance in the products. It should be noted that we use the mole of carbon in GVL as mole of carbon in the products because PD yield was little which can be neglected and no other products were detected. More details are discussed as below. In general, reaction temperature and reaction time usually play key roles in chemical reaction. To determine the optimum reaction conditions, these two factors were chosen to investigate firstly. The effect of reaction temperature (120–220 °C) was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 7 (a). When the reaction temperature was 120–160 °C, both the conversion and yield increased with the increase of temperature and LA was completely converted at 160 °C. It means that the higher temperature can promote the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. With the reaction temperature gradually increased, the GVL yield reduced to 90.8% at 220 °C, which is mainly attributed to some parallel reactions at high reaction temperature. Taking into consideration the GVL yield, the optimal reaction temperature was suggested to be 160 °C. Compared with other supported Ni-based catalysts, the reaction condition in our work is mild. For example, the optimized conditions requires a high temperature (200 °C) for GVL synthesis with Ni/γ-Al2O3 [27]. Besides, to achieve high GVL yield with Ni/Al2O3, NiCu/Al2O3, NiMoO x /C catalysts, the reaction temperature of 250 °C is necessary [20,28]. The effect of reaction time was also investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 7(b). The promoting effect of reaction time on LA conversion and GVL yield was obvious. An increasing trend in GVL yield (50.6% to 94.2%) was attained and a full conversion of LA was obtained when the reaction time reached 3 h. Meanwhile, it was found that the GVL selectivity almost kept constant (about 94%) with the increase of reaction time. The high GVL selectivity was mainly attributed to the water which was used as solvent rather than alcohol, because esterification of LA to the corresponding levulinic acid esters will happen with the presence of alcohol [47]. The results are much better than some supported Ni catalysts. For example, there is almost no conversion for GVL synthesis with Ni/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/MgO catalysts with the solvent of water [27,34]. Besides, it is more suitable for large scale application with water as solvent. As mentioned above, the carbonization temperature can affact the particle size and dispersity of Ni/C catalyst, so the catalytic performance of Ni/C catalyst with different carbonization temperatures was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . As we can see, the 2-Ni/C-400 exhibited the best catalytic performance with 100% LA conversion and 94.2% GVL yield. When carbonization temperature was 300 °C, GVL couldn't be detected by HPLC because metal Ni has not formed. However, the increasing temperature will promote the growth and aggregation of Ni particles. The large size and poor dispersion of particle means that the catalyst cannot provide enough contact area with LA, thus causing the less reaction activity sites. And this will cause poor catalytic performance. Therefore, 400 °C is the optimum carbonization temperature for the LA hydrogenation to GVL. As shown in Table 2 , catalyst dosage and Ni loading were investigated. 1-Ni/C-400 catalyst was chosen to investigate the influence of catalyst dosage. With the increase of catalyst dosage (Entries 1-4), the LA conversion also increased and the GVL yield reached the maximum (94.5%) when catalyst dosage was 0.1 g. It means that dosage of 0.1 g was properin this reaction. Next, 0.1 g was chosen as the catalyst dosage to investigate the effect of Ni loading (Entries 4-7). It can be found that LA was converted completely with different Ni loadings. Meanwhile, the GVL yield also didn't change. The results suggested that different Ni loadings had no impact on the LA conversion and GVL selectivity in such a reaction condition (reaction temperature: 160 °C; reaction time: 3 h; H2 pressure: 4 MPa). Meanwhile, Ni/AC and Ni/DC were also tested to compare with Ni/C (Entries 8–9). The GVL yield was 55.0% and 9.4%, respectively. In consideration of the results of XRD and TEM, the poor catalytic performance was mainly owing to the incomplete reduction of NiO and terrible particle distribution. Finally, the stability of catalyst was tested. The method of catalyst recycling was as follows: the catalyst was washed with deionized water after reaction and then dried in the vacuum freeze dryer for 12 h. After that, the catalyst was thrown into reactor for the next reaction. Herein, it should be emphasized that we didn't make any extra reduction of the catalyst. The results of the LA conversion and FA selectivity in recycle are shown in the Fig. 9 . Ni/C catalyst showed its stability up to 5 cycles without obvious loss of catalytic activity. 94.6% of LA conversion and 95.9% of GVL selectivity were obtained at 5th run. Compared with other catalysts such as Ru/C, Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni-Mo/C, the recycle performance of Ni/C prepared in our work is better [24,27,48]. For example, it was reported that LA conversion decreased to 4% at the second run with Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [22]. Since the 6th cycle, the drop of LA conversion was obvious, but the selectivity of GVL remained stable during the recycle process. In other words, the decrease of GVL yield was owing to the decrease of LA conversion rather than GVL selectivity. To find the catalyst deactivation reason, the used 1-Ni/C-400 catalyst was characterized by XRD, TEM and XPS. The XRD patterns of fresh and used Ni/C are shown in Fig. 10 (a). There was no difference between the fresh catalyst and used catalyst. TEM images of used Ni/C are shown in Fig. 10(b) and (c). The distribution of Ni particle was still uniform, indicating that there was no growth or aggregation of Ni particle. The results of TEM could also reflect the excellent thermostability of Ni/C catalyst. XPS was presented for the valence state analysis of nickel in catalyst. Fig. 10(d) and (e) displays the Ni 2p spectrums of fresh Ni/C and used Ni/C. NiO was found in both two catalysts. The two peaks are identified at 855.3 and 873.2 eV, corresponding to Ni2+ (2p 3/2) and Ni2+ (2p 1/2), respectively. However, metal Ni was only present in fresh Ni/C. The peaks of metal Ni are located at 852.2 and 869.6 eV, corresponding to Ni (2p 3/2) and Ni (2p 1/2), respectively [49]. In addition, two satellite peaks of Ni which are located at 879.7 and 861.3 eV can be observed. It should be noted that the presence of NiO in fresh Ni/C is presumably attributed to a partial oxidation of surface metal Ni species. It usually happens when the sample is exposed to air before XPS measurement, which is previously reported [34]. The disappearance of metal Ni peaks in used Ni/C demonstrated that the surface of metal Ni was completely oxidized to NiO. It was also necessary to note that the content of NiO was still little in used Ni/C as NiO only existed on the surface. This is why there was not diffraction peak of NiO in XRD pattern. Besides, Ni leaching loss could also affect the cycle performance of catalyst. Therefore, ICP-OES was used to determine the Ni content in the solution after 6th cycle because of the obvious drop of LA conversion after 6th cycle. The result shows that the total Ni content in solution was 0.37 mg. Taking into account the Ni leaching loss in the first five times and the initial Ni content (6.6 mg), we think that the Ni leaching loss was also a reason which caused the decrease of catalytic activity. Based on the results of XRD, TEM, XPS and ICP-OES, we conclude that the decrease of catalytic activity of Ni/C was mainly due to the oxidation and leaching loss of metal Ni."
7,Conclusions,"A green, simple and inexpensive strategy for in situ synthesis of biomass-derived Ni/C catalyst by self-reduction with pomelo peel was developed in this paper. The entire preparation process was straightforward including impregnation and carbonization. Ni/C was prepared without any additional chemical and the self-reduction process was realized in N2, which can avoid using H2 thus averting some problems such as storage, transportation and safety of H2. Meanwhile, the size and dispersion of Ni particles can be controlled by changing carbonization temperature. The synthesis mechanism of Ni/C catalyst with self-reduction was investigated roughly, which was mainly attributed to the carbon and reducing gas produced during the carbonization process. For the catalytic performance of GVL synthesis, a high yield (94.5%) can be obtained and it exhibited good stability up to 5 cycles without obvious loss of catalytic activity."
