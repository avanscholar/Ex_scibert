0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant raw material in nature [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass residues such as agricultural crops, pulp and paper industry wastewaters, food processing wastewaters and algae [2] are produced widely. Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass leads to the production of hexoses (glucose, mannose, galactose) and pentoses (xylose, arabinose) [3]. These compounds can be utilized for biological hydrogen production through dark fermentation. Dark fermentative hydrogen production has been widely studied from glucose (e.g., [4–7],), whereas less from xylose. Xylose is a degradation product of hemicellulose present in all lignocellulosic materials [8]. Hydrogen production results in a theoretical H2 yield of 3.33 mol H2/mol xylose or 4.0 mol H2/mol glucose or 1.67 mol H2/mol xylose or 2.0 mol H2/mol glucose when the soluble metabolites of fermentation are acetate (Eqs. (1) or (2)) or butyrate (Eq. (3) or(4)), respectively [9].

Furthermore, hydrogen production was studied from xylose in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The effects of temperature (37 and 45 °C) on hydrogen production potential and the microbial community in a CSTR were determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen production from different substrates,"2.1 Hydrogen production from different substrates The ability of hot spring culture to produce hydrogen from different sugars was examined using batch assays. Hexoses, i.e. glucose, galactose, mannose and fructose, pentoses, i.e. xylose, arabinose and ribose, and a disaccharide, sucrose, were used as substrates. Anaerobic 120 mL serum bottles with 50 mL working volume were used. A medium used contained substrate investigated (50 mM) and 1 L of medium contained 10.7 g NaH2PO4, 3.2 g Na2HPO4, 0.6 g NH4Cl, 0.125 g KH2PO4, 0.11 g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.1 g MgCl2·6H2O, 4 g NaHCO3, 0.18 g FeCl2·4H2O, 50 μg H3BO3, 50 μg ZnCl2, 38 μg CuCl2·2H2O, 41 μg MnCl2·2H2O, 50 μg (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 50 μg AlCl3, 50 μg CoCl2·6H2O, 50 μg NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5 mg EDTA, 2 g yeast extract, 26.3 μg Na2SeO3·5H2O, 32.9 μg NaWO4·2H2O, 0.013 g Na2S2O4, 0.5 mg Resazurin, 0.24 g Na2S·9H2O and vitamin solution (DSMZ medium No141, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). Initial pH of the medium was 6.8. Each substrate was examined in duplicate. First batch assay bottles were inoculated (2% v/v) with a hot spring culture originally enriched from 45 °C Hisarkoy hot spring samples on glucose for hydrogen production [7] and subsequent bottles with enrichment from previous batch assay with same substrate giving the highest hydrogen yields. Three sequential batch incubations were done with each substrate examined. The bottles were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Gas production was measured by using a syringe method."
3,Hydrogen production in a CSTR,"2.2 Hydrogen production in a CSTR Hydrogen was produced continuously at 37 or 45 °C in a CSTR with a working volume of 0.9 L. The pH was maintained at 5.1 by continuous on-line titration (Metrohm, 719S) and the reactor was mixed mechanically (40 rpm). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was varied between 12.5 and 10 h and the CSTR was inoculated (17% v/v) with the hot spring culture. A synthetic feed described above was used with modifications by omitting resazurin and Na2S·9H2O and 50 mM xylose was used as substrate. Synthetic feed was prepared to tap water daily and stored at 4 °C. Gas production was measured with wet gas meter (Ritter Apparatebau, Bochum, Germany), gas samples were analyzed daily and liquid samples were taken three times a week."
4,Chemical analyses,"2.3 Chemical analyses Gas composition in batch bottles and CSTR was analyzed with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-2014 equipped with Porapak N column (80/100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperatures of injector, oven, and detector were 110, 80, and 110 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Substrate removal, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were analyzed with Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a refraction index detector (Shimadzu). HPLC was equipped with a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column (Showa Denko K.K., Japan) for substrate batch assay samples and 0.01 N H2SO4 was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. For CSTR samples, HPLC was equipped with Rezex RHM-Monosaccharide column (Phenomenex). Column was kept at 40 °C and 0.01 N H2SO4 was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. All samples were filtrated (0.45 μm) before analysis."
5,Microbial community analysis with PCR-DGGE,"2.4 Microbial community analysis with PCR-DGGE Bacterial communities were characterized using DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction – denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. Microbial community samples were taken as duplicate from the reactor three times a week and stored at −20 °C. DNA was extracted from the pellets (sample centrifuged at 10’000 × g for 5 min) with a PowerSoil™ DNA isolation kit (MoBio laboratories, Inc.). Partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by using a primer pair GC-BacV3f and 907r as previously described by Koskinen et al. [5] by using T3000 Thermocycler (Biometra). DGGE was performed with INGENY phorU2 x 2 –system (Ingeny International BV, GP Goes, The Netherlands) as described by Nissilä et al. [10]. The bands were re-amplified for sequencing as described by Koskinen et al. [5] and sequence data was analyzed with Bioedit-software (version 7.0.5) and compared with sequences in GenBank (http://www.ncb.nlm.nih.gov/blast/)."
6,Results,
7,Hydrogen production from various substrates,"3.1 Hydrogen production from various substrates In batch assays the highest hydrogen yields (0.71 mol H2/mol substrate) were obtained with xylose (Fig. 1 ). During the third enrichment step with arabinose, ribose and glucose H2 yields of 0.50, 0.26 and 0.06 mol H2/mol substrate were obtained, respectively. Highest H2 yields from arabinose and glucose were 0.61 and 0.54 mol H2/mol substrate, respectively, and were obtained during second enrichment step. Highest hydrogen yields were obtained from xylose, arabinose and were accompanied by production of acetate, butyrate and formate (Table 1 ). With mannose, galactose, fructose and sucrose only little or no H2 was produced and the main soluble end product was lactate. Production of lactate lowered pH to below 5.0 and decreased substrate conversion. Also, some ethanol and propionate was produced from all sugars."
8,Continuous hydrogen production in a CSTR,"3.2 Continuous hydrogen production in a CSTR Hydrogen production from xylose was studied first at 37 °C and then the CSTR temperature was increased to 45 °C. Considerably higher maximum and mean H2 yields were obtained at 45 °C (1.97 and 1.46 mol H2/mol xylose), than at 37 °C (1.18 and 0.34 mol H2/mol xylose), respectively. Similarly, the hydrogen production rate and content increased with increasing temperature, i.e., from 1.71 to 7.28 mmol H2/h/L and from 23.7 to 48.4 %, respectively (Fig. 2 ). The results were also affected by short-term operational interferences and addition of inoculum on day 8 (Table 2 ). Three process upsets occurred during continuous operation at 45 °C; oxygen leaked to the reactor on day 38, temperature decreased to 20 °C on day 45, and pH decreased to below 5.0 on day 55. Regardless of process upsets, hydrogen production recovered and stabilized shortly after each upset. The main soluble metabolites were acetate and butyrate with low amounts of ethanol at 37 °C (Fig. 2D). The acetate/butyrate ratio increased from 0.74 to 0.88 when the temperature increased from 37 to 45 °C, respectively."
9,Microbial community analysis,"3.3 Microbial community analysis Microbial communities at different time points during CSTR operation were characterized with PCR-DGGE-sequencing (Fig. 3 , Table 3 ). At 37 °C the microbial communities consisted mainly of Clostridial species (6 species). Citrobacter freundii, was present at 45 °C. Clostridium acetobutylicum was a dominant species at both temperatures and was the only bacterium at 45 °C in addition to C. freundii. Clostridium butyricum was present only in the beginning of operation, while Clostridium tyrobutyricum was present over the whole continuous operation at 37 °C."
10,Discussion,
11,Hydrogen production from pentoses and hexoses,"4.1 Hydrogen production from pentoses and hexoses In batch assays the highest hydrogen yield of 0.71 mol/mol xylose corresponded with 21% of the theoretical yield with acetate as the only soluble metabolite. Also from arabinose and ribose 15 and 8% of theoretical H2 yield was obtained, whilst on glucose the yield was only 2%. This indicates that microbial community favored pentoses over hexoses in H2 fermentation. On glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose and sucrose lactate was the main soluble end product. This indicates that hexoses and sucrose favored lactic acid bacteria over H2 producing bacteria leading to lactic acid production instead of H2 fermentation. Furthermore, decrease in pH likely inhibited hydrogen producing bacteria. Unlike batch assays (37 °C) the hydrogen production rate and yield from xylose in the CSTR at 37 °C remained at 1.7 mmol H2/h/L and 0.34 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively. Increasing the temperature from 37 to 45 °C, however, increased the average hydrogen production rates and yields to 9.9 mmol H2/h/L and 1.97 mol H2/mol xylose (59% of theoretical yield), respectively. Hydrogen production from glucose with the same hot spring culture resulted in hydrogen yields of 0.9 and 1.71 mol H2/mol glucose at 37 and 45 °C, respectively, corresponding to 23 and 43% of the theoretical yield [11]. In the CSTR the H2 yields from xylose were in the range of the results reported earlier (Table 4 ). Hexoses and pentoses have different fermentation pathways [12]. In the batch assays of this study, pentose fermentation led to H2, butyrate, formate and acetate production whereas more lactate was produce from hexoses. This further suggests that pentose sugars are preferred substrates for this culture. In the continuous cultures, acetate and butyrate were produced at same amounts from xylose, while butyrate was the main fermentation product from glucose followed by acetate production [11]. Prakasham et al. [13] reported higher H2 production with xylose compared to glucose. However, these results are contrary to those obtained by Kim and Kim [14] who studied H2 production from different carbohydrates using a thermophilic mixed culture enriched from anaerobic digester sludge. They concluded that H2 production capability decreased in the following order sucrose > galactose > glucose > cellobiose > starch > xylose. Also Jianzheng et al. [15] obtained higher H2 production rates and yields from hexoses (glucose, fructose and galactose) than from pentose (arabinose) using a mesophilic mixed culture enriched from digested sludge."
12,Microbial communities responsible for continuous H2 production,"4.2 Microbial communities responsible for continuous H2 production At 37 °C six species from the genus Clostridia was detected in the CSTR. C . acetobutylicum and C . tyrobutyricum, known H2 producers, were present over the whole experiment period at both 37 and 45 °C. Hydrogen production with C. acetobutylicum from glucose [16] and cassava wastewater [17] has been reported with hydrogen yields of 1.79 and 2.41 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. Optimum growth temperature of C. acetobutylicum is 37 °C [18] and it grows on xylose, although glucose and arabinose are more preferred substrates [19]. C. tyrobutyricum produces acetate, butyrate, H2 and CO2 as fermentation products from glucose with hydrogen yield of 1.35 mol H2/mol glucose [20]. In a continuous bioreactor C. tyrobutyricum produced hydrogen with a rate and yield of 7.2 L H2/L/d and 1.65 mol H2/mol hexose, respectively [21]. The metabolism of C. tyrobutyricum on xylose and glucose depends strongly on pH, temperature and substrate concentration [22,23]. Increasing the temperature from 37 to 45 °C further enriched the community and retained C. acetobutylicum and C . freundii, that has an optimum growth temperature of 37 °C [24]. These results indicate that the use of 45 °C, a suboptimal temperature for both mesophiles and thermophiles, selectively enriched efficient hydrogen producing bacteria. Anaerobic microbial cultures enriched from one hot spring (Hisarkoy) have been studied under a variety of environmental conditions i.e. at different pH [7], temperature ([11], this study), and using different substrates (this study) (Fig. 4 ). Different main metabolic products of fermentation including H2, ethanol or lactic acid were produced at different conditions. The community analyses revealed prompt community responses to changes in environmental conditions. These studies also revealed that the hot spring environment harbored a very diverse microbial community. Especially in continuous CSTR's with completely mixed biomass the washout of cells is compensated by fast enrichment of new desired microorganisms under given conditions. This emphasizes that changes in fermentation patterns in CSTR's are due to changes in community structures rather than metabolic changes within the bacteria."
13,Conclusions,"The Hisarkoy hot spring enrichment culture produced hydrogen from many sugars and favored pentoses over hexoses. Batch assays yielded 0.71 mol H2/mol xylose (21% from the maximum yield). Hydrogen was produced continuously from xylose in a CSTR both at 37 and 45 °C. The highest average hydrogen production rate and yield, 170 mmol H2/d/L and 1.46 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively, were obtained at suboptimal temperature of 45 °C for mesophiles and thermophiles. C . acetobutylicum (Topt 37 °C) and C . freundii (Topt 37 °C) were the only bacterial species remaining at 45 °C and thus, responsible for xylose fermentation to hydrogen."
