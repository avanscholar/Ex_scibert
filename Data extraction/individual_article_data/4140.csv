0,Introduction,"Out of the total municipal solid waste (MSW) generated across the world, approximately 50–70% contains biodegradable organic materials, generally defined as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), in which food waste (FW) is the major component [1]. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a green technology for converting organic wastes into biogas; the process can be used to generate electricity using combined heat and power generation systems [2,3]. Moreover, it can significantly reduce the organic loads on landfills and reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transportation of wastes to landfills, thus making it a sustainable waste management option [4]. Nevertheless, despite several benefits, the anaerobic digestion process of FW generally faces the problem of low methane yield during its operation due to process instability [5]. System instability due to the accumulation of toxic substances during the process is the major concern, often resulting in the need to lower the organic loading in full-scale plants [6], thus decreasing the process performance. The future increase in the number of commercial anaerobic digestion plants is strictly related to process performance improvement and economic viability [7]. The AD of complex organics starts with hydrolysis, where particulate matter is first solubilized and soluble substrates such as polysaccharides, proteins and lipids are consequently depolymerized into smaller units by hydrolytic organisms. Hydrolysates are subsequently utilized by acidifying microorganisms to produce alcohols, hydrogen (H2) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetic acid and propionic acid. Together with hydrolytic populations, acidifiers make up for the majority of the microbial community diversity present in anaerobic ecosystems [8]. Organic acids and H2 are precursors for methanogenesis and have to be present at balanced levels. Excessive acid production from bacteria can adversely affect reactor performance, as high concentrations may inhibit populations of slow-growing acetogens and methanogens, resulting in an imbalance between the populations [9–11]. Long-term operation highlighted severe limitations of methanogenesis activity with progressive acidification due to propionate accumulation, commonly reported in the literature in continuous or single batch reactors during FW AD [11–13]. The population of methanogenic Archaea, which metabolizes primarily acetate (acetoclastic pathway) and H2 (hydrogenotrophic pathway), is therefore dependent on mutualistic needs to efficiently perform [14]. The acidification phenomenon of FW AD is typically ascribed to the substrate characteristics: low buffering capacity, scarce nutrients, high biodegradability and C/N ratio, not to mention trace metal deficiency [10,12]. Currently, several studies have investigated the composition and role of the microbiome in the FW AD process. High-throughput sequencing analysis of 16S RNA highlighted a high level of microbial diversity in these systems. Bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria have generally been found as abundant groups in reactors [9,11,15–17]. The methanogenic core and dynamics were also investigated in the monodigestion of FW. Zhang et al. [18] showed that VFA accumulation resulted in blocked acetoclastic methanogenesis and a shift to the CO2 reduction pathway mirrored in an enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the system. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens were also correlated with the accumulation of VFAs in an overloaded reactor by Lerm et al. [19]. The most important strategy to enhance methane yield and reduce VFA accumulation and process instability is the codigestion of two or more substrates [4,20–23]. Codigestion of sewage sludge and food waste is beneficial for methane generation, and a life cycle assessment (LCA) study confirms that it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions [24]. Bjorn et al. [25] reported a fourfold increase in biogas yield from codigestion of OFMSW and waste activated sewage sludge; indeed, a suitable codigestion substrate such as sewage sludge can stabilize the process by reducing the reactor start-up time, enhancing the digestion rate [26] and eventually increasing the biogas yield. The mechanism of the main sludge stabilizing effect is still contradictory; the literature principally reports nutrient supply, buffering capacity, and trace metal addition as the most important causes [27,28]. A recent study by Montecchio et al. [20] highlighted that the sludge stabilizing effect, rather than its buffering capacity, is related to its ability to prevent VFA accumulation (and therefore a pH drop) by overcoming methanogenic activity decline, thus enhancing H2 uptake and preventing thermodynamic bottlenecks. The continuous supply of trace metals, along with the seeding of microbial functional groups, could be the main drivers that positively affected process stability [17]. However, only limited studies exist on the implementation (start-up, load increase, etc.) impact on the process stability of anaerobic codigestion (AcoD) of FW and sludge [29,30], as most lab-scale experiments have been performed using small samples and batch tests, which are not readily transferrable to full-scale operations [31]. Another strategy to recover the reactor from VFA accumulation is to stop the feeding operation, thus inducing recovery from methanogenic inhibition [11]. Nevertheless, in some cases, stop feeding did not assure the removal of the remaining acetate and propionate, while methane production remained very low, indicating that methanogenesis was still hampered [32,33]. Monitoring of microbial communities after man-induced process recovery could be very important to evaluate if the newly established microbial populations are stable over time and if they are better adapted to high VFA concentrations [34]. Despite the great deal of research on the influence of VFA composition on microbiological population dynamics, the scientific community's understanding of bacterial and archaeal community dynamics is still limited and often contradictory [35]. Based on a microbiological perspective, many studies have reported that process instability is the result of imbalanced microbial metabolism, but the behaviour of these communities to prevent or minimize this imbalance is still unclear [6,20]. The identification of microbes that are resistant to stress or emerge after stressful conditions can provide a basis for biotechnological improvement [11,36], while understanding microbial community dynamics is crucial to optimize the AD process and maximize the organic load (OLR). In fact, some of the responsive groups of microorganisms may serve as indicators for process monitoring, while others may be used in bioaugmentation to restore optimal process conditions and sort out the instabilities of AD bioreactors [37]. Although several studies have reported that feedstock composition and OLR can affect both bacterial and archaeal communities [38–40], there is still little consensus on the types of effects, such as shifts in the community structure, increases in bacterial densities, and microbial diversity [40,41]. Bacterial community adaptation to changes in OLR and feedstock during codigestion has been shown to improve process stability, either due to changes in community structure (i.e., higher numbers of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing and fatty acid-beta-oxidizing bacteria) or changes in physiology [42,43]. The identification of current challenges and potential solutions for effective FW AD processes at the semipilot scale is indispensable for full-scale plant implementation. In this context, this interdisciplinary study aims to shed light on the effect of changing OLR (from 0.8 to 3.5 gVS L−1d−1) and feedstock composition (FW alone or FW mixed with WAS) on long-term semicontinuous digester operation by monitoring microbial population dynamics to provide valuable insight into the complex processes occurring within anaerobic digestion. VFA concentrations and profiles together with the linked bacterial and methanogenic community structures are discussed in terms of stability and process yield. Thermodynamic evaluations allow us to gain insight into the main peculiarities of the acidification phase and hydrogen role."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstocks,"2.1 Feedstocks FW was collected from the cafeteria of the research campus “Roma 1” of the National Research Council of Italy. The cafeteria produces approximately 300 kg of FW per week, which consisted of mixed raw and cooked food such as cheese (15%), bread and pasta (15%), fruit and vegetable peelings (70%). FW was collected in multiple acquisitions and was manually screened in order to maintain the fixed composition typical of household food waste [10]. Successively, sorted scraps were manually chopped and shredded (particle size below 1 cm) by a lab-scale knife mill, prior to being stored at −20 °C. Before chemical analyses, FW was thawed and diluted with deionized water to a ratio 1:5. Waste activated sludge (WAS) was sampled once a week from the WAS recirculation line of Roma Nord wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), serving 780,000 population equivalents. Main characteristics of FW and WAS are reported in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental setup and operation of the reactors,"2.2 Experimental setup and operation of the reactors The experiments were conducted in three semi-continuous anaerobic digesters (Digester A, B and C), with the working volume of 10 L (CSTR-10S, Bioprocess Control, Sweden), by manually feeding the substrates five times a week, from Monday to Friday. The digesters were automatically stirred at ∼13 rad/s, and temperature was maintained at 37 °C with thermostatically controlled water jackets. For each digester, the produced biogas was continuously collected and sent through CO2 traps (NaOH 3M solutions) to the methane detection units (μFlow, Bioprocess Control, Sweden) equipped with gas flow rate normalization and automatic gas volume measurement at T = 0 °C and p = 1 atm. The startup phases of the digesters, and the long-term mono and codigestion experiments were conducted as following: - Digester A was initially filled with 10 L of anaerobic inoculum sampled at Roma Nord WWTP (TS = 13.9 g/L; VS = 8.5 g/L; CODtot = 9.6 g/L; Ntot = 1.5 g/L; NH4-N = 0.87 g/L) and flushed with N2 to remove oxygen. The startup stage (Stage A1) was conducted by feeding FW at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20d, while in the Stage A2 the HRT was doubled (HRT = 40d). The Stage A4 was conducted at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 40d by pulse-feeding the digester three times a day. To maintain a suitable pH, Na2CO3 was added into the digester when the pH dropped to values lower than 6.5. During Stage A3 e A5, feeding was stopped to promote the inhibition recovery of the digester. - Digester B was initially filled with 10 L of inoculum originated from a lab-scale fermenter acclimated to FW (TS = 8.4 g/L; VS = 5.7 g/L; CODtot = 6.6 g/L; Ntot = 1.2 g/L; NH4-N = 0.77 g/L) and flushed with N2 to remove oxygen. The startup stage (Stage B1) was conducted by feeding FW at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20d, while in the Stage B3 the OLR was halved (OLR = 0.8 gVS L−1d−1). In Stage B2 and Stage B4, feeding was stopped to promote the inhibition recovery of the digester. Finally, in Stage B5 the digester was switched in codigestion with WAS (30% FW + 70% WAS, on a VS basis) at the same operative conditions (OLR = 0.8 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20d). - the Digester C was inoculated with a biomass acclimated to FW monodigestion, after a recovery step (TS = 10.4 g/L; VS = 7.2 g/L; CODtot = 8.3 g/L; Ntot = 0.9 g/L; NH4-N = 0.53 g/L) and flushed with N2 to remove oxygen. The Stage C1 was conducted in codigestion, feeding a FW + WAS mixture (70% FW + 30% WAS, on a VS basis) at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20 d. The codigestion Stage C2 was conducted by feeding a FW + WAS mixture (90% FW + 10% WAS, on a VS basis) at OLR = 2.2 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20 d. The codigestion Stage C3 was conducted by feeding a FW + WAS mixture (95% FW + 5% WAS, on a VS basis) at OLR = 3.5 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20 d. Finally, in the last Stage C4 the digester was switched in monodigestion by feeding only FW at OLR = 0.8 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20 d. The experimental design is resumed in Table 2 ."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Total (TS) and volatile solids (VS), total (CODtot) and soluble COD (CODsol), total (Ntot) and ammonia (NH4-N) nitrogen, soluble proteins, and soluble carbohydrates were determined according to the methods described in Tonanzi et al. [17]. Total phosphorus (Ptot) was determined in triplicates by photometric quantification using the phosphate and the acid capacity cell tests by Spectroquant (Merck). The pH and ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) were detected daily by Mettler InPro combined electrode. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were analysed on filtered (0.2 μm) and acidified liquid samples using a PerkinElmer Auto System Gas-Chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (2 mm stainless steel column packed with 60/80 mesh Carbopak B-DA 80–120 4% CW 20 M Supelco; oven temperature: 175 °C; injector temperature: 200 °C; detector temperature: 250 °C; N2 carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1). Biogas composition was measured using a PerkinElmer Auto System Gas-Chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (stainless steel column Supelco, 15’ x 1/8”, 2.1 mm ID, packed with 60/80 mesh Carboxen 1000; injector temperature: 200 °C, column temperature: 150 °C, detector temperature: 200 °C; N2 carrier gas at a flow rate of 17 mL min−1). Biomethane Potential (BMP) of WAS and FW was determined by using the Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS-II, Bioprocess Control, Sweden). The biogas composition measurement and the complete chemical characterization of digestates were performed from 1 to 3 times a week during all tests."
5,In situ detection methods,"2.4 In situ detection methods Biomass was sampled from the reactors, immediately fixed in formaldehyde and ethanol (2% and 48% vol/vol final concentration respectively) and stored at −20 °C [11]. FISH and CARD-FISH analysis were performed according to the procedure previously described in Nielsen et al. [44] and Matturro et al. [45] respectively. The analysis was performed using the oligonucleotide probes EUBmix (equimolar concentrations of EUB338, EUB338-II, and EUB338-III) and ARC915 for bacteria and archaea domains respectively (http://www.microbial-ecology.net/probebase/). Total cells were stained with Vectashield Mounting Medium® with DAPI (Vector Labs, Italy). Epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51) was used to count the cells. FISH/CARD-FISH ratio was calculated for each sample by dividing the average value of bacterial or archaeal relative abundance estimated by FISH to the one obtained after CARD-FISH analysis. This parameter allows estimating the fraction of active targeted microorganisms out of total members belonging to same taxonomic group (values close to 1 are usually measured under steady state operation and in the absence of inhibitory conditions). FISH detectability is indeed typically associated with physiologically active cells while CARD-FISH analysis is able to detect also the cells characterized by lower activity state (total cells) [17]."
6,DNA extraction,"2.5 DNA extraction Samples were taken at the end of operation (∼one HRT for unstable monodigestion process) or under stable-steady operation (codigestion systems) and centrifuged at 15,000g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was immediately stored at −20 °C. DNA extraction was performed by using PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio - Carlsbad, CA). Purified DNA was eluted in 50 μL sterile Milli-Q water and the concentration and quality of extracted DNA was analysed with a Nanodrop 3300 (Thermo Scientific, Italy). DNA was stored at −20 °C for few days and used for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis."
7,Bacteria and archaea high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing,"2.6 Bacteria and archaea high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing targets the V1-3 and V3-5 variable regions, respectively. 12.5 ng of extracted DNA was used as template and the PCR reaction (25 μL) contained each dNTPs (400 μM), MgSO4 (1.5 mM), Phusion DNA Polymerase High-Fidelity (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and barcoded library adaptors containing V1-3 specific primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 534R (ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) for bacteria, and 340F (CCCTAHGGGGYGCASCA) and 915R (GWGCYCCCCCGYCAATTC) for the archaea [46]. The amplicon libraries were purified using the Agencourt® AMpure XP bead protocol (Beckmann Coulter, USA) and Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) was used to prepare the library. Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to evaluate the library concentration before being pooled in equimolar concentrations at 4 nM. The samples were paired end sequenced (2x301bp) on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) using a MiSeq Reagent kit v3, 600 cycles (Illumina, USA). 10% Phix control library was added to overcome the low complexity problem often observed with 16S amplicon samples. Bioinformatic analysis was performed after checking reads quality with FastQC software (v 0.11.7). Sequences were processed, quality filtered and analysed using QIIME2 version 2018.2. The reads were demultiplexed using demux plugin (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-demux) and the primer sequences were removed by using cutadapt plugin (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-cutadapt). DADA2 algorithm was used to denoise paired-end sequences, dereplicate them and filter chimeras with the “consensus” method [47] and to resolve amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) differing by as little as one nucleotide. Silva 132 database were used to assign the taxonomy (Kehrmann et al., 2017)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Diversity analyses and Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling ordination plot (NMDS) were carried out using the statistical software PAST 3, version 2.17 [48]. Shannon index, Equitability index and Simpson's diversity were calculated using the total reads generated from each sample. In particular, Shannon index (H) measures diversity considering the number of sequences and increases as diversity increases. Equitability index (J) was calculated as Shannon diversity divided by the logarithm of number of taxa, and it represented the evenness with which individuals are divided among the resulting taxa. Simpson's diversity index calculates a diversity score for a community, and it is based on both the number of different species in the community, and the number of individuals present for each of those species. NMDS based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was used to evaluate the dissimilarity between samples. Process parameters and microbial data were projected onto the NMDS ordination using a vector-fitting procedure. The length of the vectors is proportional to the correlation between NMDS-axes and each variable. This method allowed determining the variation pattern of each projected variable discriminating the samples [49]. Process parameters and values of microbial groups revealed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing (only clusters ≥ 5% for bacteria and ≥2% for archaea were considered) were normalized by log(X+1)."
9,Results,
10,"Digester A, inoculated with a biomass non-acclimated to FW","3.1 Digester A, inoculated with a biomass non-acclimated to FW In the first HRT of startup Stage A1, a stable performance was maintained for digester A, obtaining daily methane production of up to 6.5 L d−1 (Fig. 1 ). During the second HRT, the digester started to show a gradual decrease in pH and methane production. The alkalinity of the supplement Na2CO3 helped to maintain the pH within a suitable range but could not prevent digester failure. Therefore, the HRT was extended to 40 d to achieve a better stability while keeping a constant OLR of 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 (Stage A2). Nevertheless, the digester still experienced a progressive reduction of methane production (∼50%), most likely due to the inhibition of the methanogenic biomass, which did not succeed in degrading the VFAs, which accumulated throughout the operation, as shown in Fig. 1. Over Stage A2, acetic and propionic acids comprised almost the entire amount of the accumulated VFAs, leading to reactor acidification and soluble COD overload (up to 15 gCOD L−1). After failure, a recovery phase was imposed by stopping the feeding to evaluate the ability of the anaerobic biomass to reduce the total VFA concentration under a batch mode operation. This recovery period (Stage A3) was conducted for 31 days between days 150 and 181.During Stage A3, substantial amount of soluble COD removal (>60%) and methane production (approximately 40 L) were observed. VFAs, the main components of the soluble matter in the system, were consumed with different removal rates and following different pathways. The acetic acid concentration decreased from 8.4 to 1 gCOD L−1, butyric acid almost disappeared, while propionic acid remained at a high concentration in the digester medium (approximately 4 gCOD L−1), owing to some blockage in this metabolic uptake route. In fact, during Stage A4, despite the pulsed feeding regimen, propionate started accumulating again in the digester, followed by acetate and butyrate, causing the failure of the methanization process. Process instability was evident just after the first HRT; propionic and acetic acid concentrations progressively increased from the beginning (up to 11.8 and 7.5 gCOD L−1, respectively), whereas the butyric acid concentration started to rise significantly at day 210, reaching 4.2 gCOD L−1. During the last days of operation at pH < 6, the high propionic acid concentration (in the undissociated form) strongly inhibited propionate-producing bacteria [50]; therefore, propionate remained constant. On the other hand, metabolic pathways involving butyrate production were favoured, as reported in the literature for the pH range between 4.5 and 6.0 [51]. During the second recovery phase (Stage A5), an initial lag in methane production was observed until day 265, suggesting a biomass adaptation to the new experimental conditions. Propionate degradation started at a higher rate than that of the other VFAs. It could be speculated that propionate consumption, rather than being ascribable to propionate oxidation, was due to the high H2 pressure, which rendered propionate oxidation endoergonic and promoted chain elongation pathways towards odd chained MCFAs such as valerate and heptylate [52,53]. In fact, whereas in the first days of the recovery stage (until day 251), the whole soluble content of the digester was built up by short chain carboxylic acids, afterwards an increasing gap (up to 50%) between the soluble COD and the total VFAs was detected, confirming the possible formation of not analysed MCCAs (medium chain carboxylic acids). As the concentration of toxic propionate was lowered, methanogens began to consume soluble organics, halving the soluble COD at the end of the A5 phase and progressively restoring the pH to neutral values. The methane content in the biogas rapidly increased, showing a fluctuating trend, with the first production peak around day 275 and the second peak between days 300 and 310. These peaks corresponded to 17.8 and 16.6 L of methane, respectively, which are stoichiometrically consistent with the soluble organics removal in these time intervals. Remarkably, this methane evolution was mirrored by the activation of the methanogenic population, which showed a sharply growing trend between days 260–275, followed by a further increase in the last recovery days (up to 0.9). A 4.5-fold increase in the archaeal active fraction with a concomitant decrease in the active bacterial population (from ∼0.9 to ∼0.7) was measured at the end of this phase (Fig. 2 )."
11,"Digester B, inoculated with a biomass well acclimated to FW","3.2 Digester B, inoculated with a biomass well acclimated to FW During the first HRT of start-up Stage B1, carried out at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1, an initial accumulation of VFAs, especially propionate, was observed (Fig. 3 ). However, after 10 days, methane production started to increase, and the accumulated VFAs were gradually removed by the acclimated biomass present in the system. Nevertheless, during the second HRT, a rapid drop in methane production occurred, suggesting a significant inhibition of methanogenic biomass, which led to a progressive increase of soluble COD in the reactor. Among VFAs, acetic acid was the most abundant, followed by propionic and butyric acids (Fig. 3). Eventually, the FW monodigestion test failed at the end of the third HRT; recovery Stage B2 was therefore implemented to restore the ability of the system to consume the accumulated acids. After supplementation with a fresh inoculum of sludge, the propionate concentration gradually decreased to less than 1600 mg L−1, methanogenesis inhibition due to propionate was eased, and the concentration of acetate rapidly decreased from 3,300 mg L−1 to 600 mg L−1. The strategy adopted in the Digester B operation was hence to lower the OLR from 1.7 to 0.8 (Stage B3), but again, a gradual accumulation of VFAs was coupled with a methane drop, despite the low OLR applied, was observed. After 1 HRT, a steep increase of both acetic and propionic acids with the same production rate (45 mg L−1d−1) was observed, whereas butyrate started to increase 1 week later due to the favourable low pH. After recovery Stage B4, the system was fed in codigestion while maintaining the same OLR and HRT to evaluate the effect of a feedstock change on the entire process. Unlike the previous FW monodigestions, codigestion Stage B5 showed a stable methane production of 0.17 Nm3CH4 kg−1 VSfed, without any evidence of methanogenic biomass inhibition or VFA accumulation in the reactor."
12,"Digester C, co-digestion with waste activated sludge","3.3 Digester C, co-digestion with waste activated sludge Digester C, which was started with an inoculum acclimated to FW, was operated with a mixture of WAS and FW as feedstock. The first codigestion test (Stage C1) was performed at OLR = 1.7 gVS L−1d−1 and HRT = 20 d, with an FW contribution of 70% on a VS basis. Following a 3 HRTs operating period, the organic load progressively increased to 2.2 and 3.5 gVS L−1d−1, corresponding to increasing the FW contributions to 90% and 95% on the VS basis, respectively. Over the first HRT of Stage C1, the soluble COD concentration was still quite high (3.5–5 g/L) as a result of the previous operations conducted with FW alone; since the beginning of the second HRT, the soluble COD decreased to stable values of ∼0.3 ± 0.1 g/L, which were also maintained throughout Stage C2 (Fig. 4 ). VFAs followed the same COD trend, stabilizing at insignificant levels in the digester medium. Accordingly, methane production remained constant during both the C1 and C2 tests, providing higher yields with increasing OLR (0.27 and 0.29 Nm3CH4 kg−1 VSfed, respectively). As a result of an increase of the organic load up to 3.5 gVS L−1 (Stage C3), VFAs and soluble COD remained low (0.9 ± 0.3 gCOD L−1) during the first 2 HRTs, followed by a slight transient accumulation of acetic acid (accounting for up to 60% of the soluble content), mirrored by a methane decrease. Propionic acid remained at low levels. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 4, the robustness of the microbiome and the buffering capacities (NH4-N was 1.2 g/L) assured a rapid recovery, acetate was removed during the following HRT, and the specific methane production reached a stable value of 0.29 ± 0.01 Nm3CH4 kg−1VSfed. When switching to Stage C4, the digester was exposed to a drastic OLR decrease and feedstock variation (from WAS + FW to FW alone) and in the beginning was significantly influenced by the previous codigestion operation. In fact, the process was more stable and robust with respect to the same digestion process carried out in the parallel digester (B) acclimated only to FW. While Stage B3 experienced rapid VFA accumulation just after one HRT, Stage C4 remained stable during 3 HRTs, with low VFA and soluble COD contents in the reactor and an average methane production of 1.8 ± 0.2 L d−1. However, at the end of the third HRT, propionate started to increase very rapidly (rate 60 mg L−1d−1), followed by acetate (35 mg L−1d−1). Additionally, in this case, butyrate began to accumulate later on because of the pH drop."
13,Bacterial and archaeal microbiome structure,"3.4 Bacterial and archaeal microbiome structure 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on samples taken at the end of the operation (∼one HRT for the unstable monodigestion process) or under stable-steady operation (codigestion systems) to investigate the composition of the bacterial and archaeal communities in all reactors. Diversity estimators, including the Simpson index (1-D), Shannon index (H) and equitability index (J), highlighted an overall high bacterial diversity without marked differences among the samples except for the switch test to monodigestion (Stage C4), with lower community evenness (Table 3 ). Remarkably, the archaeal populations showed higher diversity indices in the codigestion systems (Stages B5, C1, C2 and C3) than that in the monodigestion reactors (Stages A1, A2, A4, B1 and B3 and C4), suggesting that archaeal biodiversity was affected by the reactor feeding conditions. The higher Shannon index and Simpson index jointly implied the higher diversity of bacterial communities than archaea, which was also consistent with previous studies [6]. The bacterial microbiome composition at the phylum level is presented in Figure S5. Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes were the most abundant phyla in all systems (between 54 and 87% of the total bacterial reads). As shown in Fig. 5 , a deeper analysis of bacterial microbiome composition revealed the occurrence of putative fermentative bacteria in all reactors with the peculiar establishment of hydrolytic bacteria, such as members of the Prolixibacteriaceae family, only in the codigestion systems (Stages B5, C1, C2 and C3), and in Stage C4 in a small percentage (about 4%). Euryarcheota hydrogenotrophic methanogens, mainly represented by members of the Methanomicrobiales family, prevailed in all systems except in the case of the start-up inoculum of Stage A1, which was obtained from a full-scale digester treating sewage sludge (Fig. 6 ).High percentage values (>80%) of ASVs related to hydrogenotrophic methanogens were found in Stage A4, Stage B3 and Stages C1 and C2. Most of the acetoclastic methanogens belonged to the Methanosarcinales order, mainly to the Methanosaeta genus, in all samples analysed. Moreover, only in codigestion systems (Stages B5, C1, C2 and C3) were a variety of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g., Candidatus methanofastidiosum) found. Interestingly, ASVs related to the latter group (overall accounting for approximately 7% of the total reads) were also retrieved in the monodigestion reactor started with an inoculum acclimated to FW and WAS (Stage C4)."
14,Discussion,"Digester A, starting with an inoculum derived from a WWTP digester acclimated to sewage sludge, showed high stability with low soluble COD concentration and concomitant high methane production since the beginning; however, after 1 HRT of FW feeding, a drastic methane drop occurred (mirrored by the rise of soluble COD - up to a 4-fold increase). Different behaviour was experienced by using an FW acclimated inoculum for the start up (Stage B1) of digester B, observing lower specific methane production and high soluble COD in the digester since the beginning of reactor operation, suggesting a specialized fermentative consortium for the bioconversion of FW into VFAs. At the phylum level, Stage A1 presented taxa of Proteobacteria typically associated with sludge, not observed in Stage B1. The origin of the inoculum in Stage A1 determined the presence of Candidatus Methanofastidiosum, a typical immigrating microorganism of waste activated sludge [17], together with an acetoclastic metabolism due to the Methanosaeta family (55% of total ASVs). Stage B1, on the contrary, showed a prevailing hydrogenotrophic metabolism related to FW feeding. The major bacterial phyla detected in the digester samples were Bacteroidetes (basically more abundant in monodigestion than in codigestion), followed by Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes. Together, these phyla accounted for approximately 80% of the microbial diversity, as experienced by da Silva Martins et al. [54]. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (in particular Clostridiales) have a function in the hydrolysis of several particulate compounds and fermentation of sugars to VFAs, alcohols, and hydrogen [34,55]. During monodigestion of FW, however, methanogenic conversion of fermentative end-products generated by acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria decreased progressively with a subsequent increase of VFAs. In particular, the observed propionate and butyrate accumulation seemed to derive from an imbalance between acidogenesis and acetogenesis due to increases in the H2 levels [56]. In fact, when VFA accumulated dramatically in the FW-fed reactors and methane production stopped, mass balance calculations based on COD (data not shown) revealed that a significant COD portion was even so converted into hydrogen, which was indicative of hydrogenotrophs with a lower H2 consumption rate [6]. Hydrogen accumulation after initiation of the perturbation was also observed by Xing et al. [57] in a mesophilic glucose-fed digester. Kinetic and thermodynamic evaluations allow us to gain insight into the main peculiarities of the acidification phases and hydrogen role. Montecchio et al. [20] demonstrated through ADM1 modelization that a decline in the Archaea FISH/CARD FISH ratios is correlated with a drastic decline in the maximum uptake rate coefficients for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (km_ac and km_h2, respectively, in the ADM1 nomenclature). The straight consequence of this phenomenon is, on the one hand, the accumulation of the reactants involved in the latter pathways, namely, acetate and hydrogen and the drop of their product, that is, methane. This was well observed during the acidification phases of monodigestion with FW. On the other hand, oxidation of acids with longer chain than acetate, such as propionate and butyrate, is performed by bacteria rather than archaea. The activity of the former microorganisms does not appear to be inhibited during the acidification phase, according to FISH/CARD FISH ratios [20]. The explanation for the accumulation of VFAs other than acetate can be ascribed to thermodynamic limitation and, again, can be related to the reduced activity of acetate- and hydrogen-consuming microorganisms. In fact, it was observed that at the end of the process, the thermodynamic gains for the butyrate and propionate oxidation catabolic reactions are very low (Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)) and could be further reduced by end-product accumulation [58]. (1) C4H7O2 − + 2 H2O → 2 C2H3O2 − + 2 H2 + H+ ΔG’ = 88 kj mol−1 (2) C3H5O2 − + 3 H2O → C2H3O2 − + 3 H2 + HCO3 − + H+ ΔG’ = 116.3 kj mol−1 In Fig. 7 , the Gibbs free energy vs acetate and hydrogen concentration is plotted for Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), assuming butyrate and propionate concentrations of 80 and 1,000 mg L−1, respectively (typical values detected over the acidification phases of Stage B3). For the ΔG calculations, the ammonia concentration was 300 mgN L−1, whereas the VFA uptake at microorganism concentrations were derived from Montecchio et al. [20]. The butyrate uptake process is exergonic as long as the H2 concentration in the liquid phase is below 5 × 10−7 - 10−6 M (corresponding to 8 × 10−4 – 1.7 × 10−3 bar), depending on the acetate concentration, whereas for propionate oxidation, a lower H2 concentration (<5 × 10−7 M) is required. Therefore, it is most likely that butyrate and propionate accumulation is an indirect outcome of methanogen activity reduction, as confirmed elsewhere [59,60]. By looking into the biomass production of these reactions, it is important to point out that the anaerobic environment is very challenging for microbial growth due to the lack of external electron acceptors. In fact, since the energetic gain obtained over most fermentative reactions is low, catabolic pathways are selected by maximizing the energy harvest rate rather than the total growth yield [61]. This explains the limited anaerobic biomass production compared with that observed in the aerobic environment. Indeed, microorganisms must survive on the limited energy that they can harvest from catabolic reactions; this energy is partly dissipated and partly used for maintenance [62,63], and the rest is available for cell growth. Anabolic and catabolic reactions are linked as per the number of times (λ) a catabolic process must run to produce a mole of C-biomass [58]. This coefficient is derived by means of thermodynamic calculations, as reported in Eq. (3): (3) λ = − ( Δ G a n a + Δ G d i s ) Δ G c a t where ΔGcat and ΔGana are the Gibbs free energies for catabolism and anabolism, respectively, whereas ΔGdis is the energy dissipated in anabolism. According to the Gibbs dissipation method [63,64], ΔGdis calculations take into account the carbon chain length and the oxidation state of the carbon source; ΔGdis is equal to 389.5 kJ molCx −1 for butyrate oxidation and 373.4 kJ molCx −1 for propionate oxidation. The biomass-producing anabolic reactions for butyrate and propionate oxidation are reported in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), respectively: (4) 1/4 C4H7O2 − + 0.2 NH4 + + 0.05 H+ → CH1.8O0.5N0.2 + 0.4 H2 (5) 1/3 C3H5O2 − + 0.2 NH4 + + 0.133 H+ → CH1.8O0.5N0.2 + 1/6 H2O + 0.233 H2 In Eqs. (4) and (5), the substrate is the electron donor for biomass formation, whereas hydrogen, as in the catabolic reaction, is the electron acceptor. Once the thermodynamic calculation is performed, it is possible to determine the maximum theoretical growth yield as per Eq. (6): (6) Y X S = 1 λ In Fig. 8 , the maximum theoretical growth yield over time in Stage B3 is plotted for butyrate and propionate uptake microorganisms (Ybu and Ypro, respectively); a similar pattern was obtained for the other tests in monodigestion (Stages A1, A2, A4, B1, and C4; data not shown). Calculations were performed adopting detected values for VFAs and inorganics, whereas for hydrogen and biomass concentrations, data were derived from the ADM1 simulations performed in Montecchio et al. [20]. As also observed by Paton and Rodriguez [65], both Ybu and Ypro are lower than the ADM1 default values; in this case, both yields were almost one order of magnitude lower than those used in ADM1. Moreover, it can be observed that both yields sharply decrease as the process enters the acidification phase. These outcomes suggest that once archaeal activity is inhibited, fermentative biomass production is also likely to be hampered due to the limited energetic gain related to end product accumulation. This could most likely result in biomass depletion, deeply affecting the whole digestion process, which in this case had to be interrupted to prevent operational failure. In these experiments, propionate was detected at concentrations up to ∼8,000 mg L−1, corresponding to ∼12,000 mgCOD L−1 (Fig. 1). The reason as to why propionate accumulated far more than butyrate, which is quite uncommon to observe in AD configurations, was most likely due to the combination of two factors. First, the low H2 partial pressure required for rendering propionate oxidation exergonic, as reported above, made propionate consumption very slow during many phases of the process. Second, the tendency of FW digestion to generate high production of lactate [66], which is quickly converted to propionate via the acrylate pathway [67], led to significant propionate accumulation. However, a long recovery phase assured large VFA consumption, leading to the well-established healthy status of the biomass. In fact, the removal yields for the individual carboxylic acids during Stage A5 attained values of 100%, 80% and 63% for butyric, propionic and acetic acids, respectively. The degradation of higher carbon chain lengths was most likely assured by the increase in active H2-consuming microbes, such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens (>85% of total ASVs affiliated with the Methanocullueus family, data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, inhibition of the methanogenic population was temporary, and methanogens recovered after a certain time with a subsequent decrease in VFA concentration [68,69]. The statistical correlation of key process parameters (e.g., OLR, HRT, pH, methane production, hydrogen, total and soluble COD, total and volatile solids, VFA content, NH4-N concentration) with microbiological data was performed to shed light on the process dissimilarity among mono- and codigestion systems. The NMDS analysis highlighted a clear differentiation between monodigestion (Stages A1, A2, A4, B1, B3, C4) and codigestion reactors (Stages B5, C1, C2, C3), as shown in Fig. 9 . In particular, monodigestion systems were characterized by a relatively higher concentration of VFAs and H2, and chemical variables significantly correlated with this cluster (Fig. 9). Following a vector-fitting procedure onto the NMDS ordination plot based on chemical dissimilarity, the link between the biological data generated from the analysis of the different reactors and the key-process parameters was evaluated. Microbial community analysis revealed differences between the two clusters. The Porphyromonadaceae family (vectors 4, Proteiniphilum genera, and 5) was significantly related to monodigestion systems. Saha et al. [68] reported the involvement of Proteiniphilum taxa in the accumulation of VFAs leading to process failure. Conversely, Prolixibacteraceae, Blvii28 wastewater sludge group, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Leptotrichiaceae, Petrotogaceae, Bathyarchaeia, Methanospirillum and Candidatus Methanofastidiosum taxa (vectors 6, 8, 16, 19, 25, 26, 31, and 36, respectively) were significantly correlated with codigestion systems (Fig. 9). The addition of WAS to the FW boosted the methane production rates (up to 0.29 ± 0.1 Nm3CH4 kg−1VSfed) and excellent process stability, at a higher OLR. The microbiome established in codigestion systems, in fact, promoted the extent to which VFAs and H2 were transformed, suggesting the healthy status of methanogens and an efficient syntrophic relationship for H2 as an electron shuttle. Methanospirillum and Candidatus Methanofastidiosum, strictly related to the codigestion systems, positively impacted process stability and have a high ability to consume H2 [70]. In particular, Candidatus Methanofastidiosum is able to maintain H2 levels lower than the other methanogens to support H2 producers (as the predominant fermentative bacteria), suggesting an essential and overlooked ecological role in methanogenic environments as codigestion. Moreover, the addition of sludge into the feedstock contributes nitrogen, trace elements and buffering components, creating more suitable conditions for the growth of methanogens [71]. This stable and robust biomass rich in hydrolytic bacteria and strong hydrogenotrophic methanogens selected by the codigestion, even after being exposed to a new OLR decrease and switching to FW, achieved good methane production and process stability during three HRTs. However, long-term operation was characterized by progressive instability, along with a significant decrease in bacterial and archaeal community diversity. The microbial community analysis revealed the peculiarity of this monodigestion system with the predominance of acetoclastic methanogens, which, on the other hand, was not experienced across the other monodigestion tests of this study."
15,Conclusions,"This interdisciplinary study compared different semicontinuous anaerobic digester performances using real urban biowaste as substrate (food waste alone or mixed with activated sludge) to provide insights into the anaerobic digestion process, elucidating key microbial communities and pathways. The results demonstrated extensively that the critical issue in food waste anaerobic digestion is the progressive drop in hydrogenotrophic microorganism activity resulting in dramatic propionic acid accumulation due to thermodynamic limitations. Minimal sludge addition enriched the microbial community with Methanospirillum and Candidatus Methanofastidiosum, having a large H2 consumption capacity and thus preventing thermodynamic bottlenecks and process failure. Stable methane production of the codigestion system at short HRT (20 d) and high OLR (3.5 kgVS m−3d−1values, with 95% FW and 5% sludge) assured the promising value of 55 NL CH4 per kg of FW treated, suggesting reliable operating indications for biogas plant decision makers to achieve process performance improvement and economic viability."
