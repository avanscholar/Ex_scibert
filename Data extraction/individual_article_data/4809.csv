0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is an interesting process in both theoretical and practical fields. Among carbonyl aromatic compounds, benzaldehyde (BzH) is always high in demand because it is an important chemical feedstock for the production of pharmaceutics, dyestuff, perfumery, and agro-chemistry [1,2]. In tradition, benzaldehyde can be usually produced through alkali hydrolysis of benzyl chloride, partial oxidation of alkyl benzene, benzyl alcohol (BzOH) using Cr-, Mn-, Co-, or Os-based reagents as homogeneous oxidants [1–4]. These oxidants usually yield a large amount of hazardous heavy metal waste causing serious environmental problems. Therefore, great efforts have recently been made to develop environmentally friendly catalytic oxidations and also to reduce the volume of byproducts and solvents used [5–12]. During the last decades, many studies have been reported on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using novel homogeneous, immobilized, and heterogeneous catalysts under different conditions [3,4,7–10]. Among reported catalyst systems, precious metals such as Ni–Cu [3], Pt [11,13,14], Au [15–18], Ag [6,9,19–21], Ru [8,22] have been intentionally applied for the selective oxidation reaction of primary alcohols. These solid catalysts normally showed good catalytic activity; but they often have some disadvantages such as the use of expensive noble metals and difficulty in preparation, performance fluctuation, and low recycling efficiency, sintering of metal oxides. Therefore, some cheaper metal-supported catalysts (Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, Co, V, Bi…) have been developed as alternate ways to prepare oxidation–reduction catalyst systems [7,8,23–27]. For common transition metals, chromium was well known as an active component in metal-catalyzed oxidations inorganic synthesis [3,4,8,28–32]. However, reported Cr-based catalysts mostly exhibited a considerable initial loss in catalytic activity and poor-recycling ability. Thus, preparation of Cr-containing catalysts with enhanced structural stability is highly desirable. For instance, chromium ions was exchanged with zeolite, Cr-ZSM-5, Cr-MCM-41 [8,28,29]; doped in perovskite, LaCrO3, [30] or molecular sieve materials, CrS-1, CrAPO-5, CrSAPO-37, Crβ [31]; inserted in spinel [8,32]. These catalysts showed somewhat the better resistance to deactivation during the oxidation reaction. However, Cr-containing molecular sieve catalysts are sometimes limited for the oxidation of bulkier substrates and usually worked in high polar organic solvent conditions [8,29,31]. Sepiolite is a fibrous clay mineral used as adsorbents and catalysts or metal support in many applications [33]. It is composed of blocks and tunnels that grow up in the fiber direction. Each block is constructed of an octahedral sheet of magnesium oxide/hydroxide inserting between two tetrahedral silica layers. The octahedral silica sheet discontinuity leads to the construction of structural channels and tunnels. As a result of the unique structure and composition, sepiolite fibers possess huge specific surface area, high porosity and plentiful surface hydroxyl groups. In the present work, we distributed chromium oxides on sepiolite as an efficient catalyst for the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Obviously, sepiolite supported chromium catalysts could exhibit obvious advantages: low-cost and porous material, active function groups, basic support. It is expected that as-synthesized Cr-containing catalysts are highly active for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization of the catalysts,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of the catalysts 4.0 g of sepiolite (Aldrich) were added into a 250 mL beaker containing 100 mL of aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)3·6H2O (99%) with a given amount of Cr3+(see Table 1S in Supplementary Materials). Then, a stoichiometric amount of NaOH solution was added dropwise to the beaker under vigorous stirring (see Table 1S in Supplementary Materials) to precipitate chromium (III) ions in the suspension. The suspension solution was further stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the resultant slurry was then filtered, washed with distilled water several times, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h in air before calcination at 410 °C for 2 h. All the prepared catalysts are summarized in Table 1 ."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 Advance-Bruker instrument using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1549 nm). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microphotographs were obtained with a JEOS JSM-5410 LV. The nitrogen physisorption was run on an Autochem II 2920 (USA). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data were obtained from Varian Vista Ax X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscope. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained in 4000–400/cm range on a FT/IR spectrometer (DX-Perkin Elmer, USA). The recorded spectral range was 100–2500/cm and scanned 4 times with the wavelength of laser beam of 632 nm. UV–vis spectra were collected with UV-visible spectrophotometer, JASCO V-670. The spectra were recorded at room temperature in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The XPS analysis was made on a photoelectron spectrometer (VG Scientific Fison ESCA 210) with Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) of hydrogen experiments were carried out using a flow system GOW-MAC 69-350 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a 100 mL three-neck glass flask fitted with a reflux condenser. For a typical run, 3 mL of benzyl alcohol and 0.20 g of catalyst were loaded into the flask. After the reaction mixture was magnetically stirred and heated to the desired temperature, then 6 mL of t‑butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP, 70%, Sigma Aldrich) or hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 30%) or flow of air (3 mL/min) was conducted into stirred reaction mixture and the reaction time starts recorded. After the reaction, the mixture was quenched to room temperature and then catalyst was filtered off. The filtrate was analyzed by a GC-MS (HP-6890 Plus)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characteristics,"3.1 Catalyst characteristics Fig. 1 displays X-ray diffraction diagrams for all as-prepared samples while the XRD patterns of raw sepiolite and calcined samples are presented in Fig. 1S for comparison (Supplementary Materials). For the parent sepiolite, XRD pattern appears the 2-theta values at 7.31, 20.6, 23.8, 26.7, 28.1, 35.0, 36.9, 40.1°, which are typically characteristics for the sepiolite (JCPDS no. 01-075-1597) (Fig. 1S) [33–35]. The intensity of these peaks slightly decreases after sepiolite loading Cr2O3. This observation is possibly explained by the dehydration and structural folding of the sepiolite (Figs. 1 and 2 ) [34,35]. In other context, no reflection of Cr2O3 are detected for the low-chromium content samples (1–5 wt% Cr2O3), indicating a finely dispersed Cr2O3 on the support. At a higher Cr2O3 loadings, additional peaks at 24.8, 32.8 and 54.6° are firmly attributed to the reflection lines of Cr2O3 crystals (JCPDS no. 00-038-1479) [31,36,37]. Catalyst morphology and texture are typically described in Figs. 2 and 3 . SEM images of both sepiolite and some representative Cr-containing catalysts are composed of bundles of curved fibers (Fig. 2). The raw sepiolite fibers have the length of 2–3 µm and the width of 20–40 nm, in accordance with TEM images (Fig. 2e). The sepiolite fibers tend to be parallel-lying, but some have a random orientation against each other, creating numerous slit-shaped spaces. The fibers are likely shorter and straighter for the Cr-richer samples (Fig. 2c) [32,38]. Furthermore, TEM images of the catalysts show evidence of tubular structure and regions of enhanced contrast which are attributable to chromium oxide nanoparticles. A high dispersion of Cr species on the catalyst surface was observed on the length scale assessed (50–70 nm) over low-chromium loading samples (Fig. 2e). The dark region sizes grow up with an increase in chromium loadings (Fig. 2f), and thus the overall surface area of the catalyst expectantly decreases (Table 1). In practice, Fig. 3 displays nitrogen adsorption–desorption isothermal profiles for all samples. The isothermal curves represent a plateau from 0 to 0.85 and a hysteresis loop in the range of 0.85–1.0. These isothermal curves are close to the typical type II adsorption–desorption isotherm according to the IUPAC classification, interpreting the presence of both micropores and some slit-like mesopores [38–40]. Apart from 10 wt% Cr/sepiolite, the other samples possess very small hysteresis corresponding to H3 type, which represents for the existence of tubular structured materials. The BET surface area was slightly decreased with increasing Cr loadings because the smaller chromia particles aggregated to larger ones over the support surface as elucidated by TEM images (Fig. 2f). Thus, a portion of porous systems are presumably blocked and then overall surface area of the catalyst decreased gradually (Table 1 and Fig. 2S) [32,38]. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) analysis provides local information of the concentration of different elements in the outermost layers of the catalyst platelets. EDS spectra of all catalysts in Fig. 4 show the signals of Cr, Si, Mg, O, Al and traces of K, Ca. Obviously, the distribution of Cr-moieties on sepiolite surface was slightly beyond from the theoretical expectation as estimated by EDS analysis because small amounts of Cr-moieties deposited in the channels and tunnels, in good consistent with BET measurements [31,32,35,41]. FT-IR spectra of support and the catalysts are presented in Fig. 5 . The broad band around 3690/cm is solely ascribed to the triple bridge group Mg–OH and absorbed water molecules. The stretches at 3410/cm and the OH bending mode at 1670/cm are solely associated with zeolitic water. The bands in the range of 1200–400/cm are characteristic of silicate: the bands centered at 1020 and 465/cm are ascribed as the Si–O–Si vibrations [41]. Furthermore, a band at 650/cm corresponds to the octahedral vibration of Cr–O connected with sepiolite surface while a shoulder at 540/cm is attributed the vibration of metal atom in tetrahedral oxygen environment [37,39,41]. In addition, Fig. 6 presents the UV–vis spectra of five Cr-containing catalysts. A weak absorption at 270 nm and a stronger band around 360 nm both are definitely ascribed as the O→Cr(VI) charge transfer of chromates, indicating that a part of Cr(III) species is oxidized to hexavalent chromium under preparation process [40,41]. A band at 450 nm is assigned to the 4A2g → 4T1g d–d transitions of Cr(III) in CrO6 octahedral symmetry, but it is characteristics for the chromate species. Another band at 590/cm is solely contributable to the d–d transition (4A2g → 4T2g) of Cr(III) in six-coordinate geometry [30,35,36,41]. The oxidation states and coordination environment of chromium ions/sepiolite are related to catalytic activity of Cr-containing catalysts in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In the present work, supported chromium catalysts were recorded the XPS spectra to investigate the oxidation states of chromium species on the catalyst surface. The major photoelectron lines of the elements in the catalyst are reported in Fig. 7 . Clearly, magnesium, silicon, oxygen, and chromium have photoelectron lines at 1s (1305.1 eV), 2p (103.3), 1s (532.7 eV), 2p (576.9 eV), respectively [42,43]. To examine the oxidation states of Cr-moieties in the near-surface region, the spectrum corresponding to the Cr 2p core level is represented in Fig. 7b. XPS spectrum of Cr 2p in 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite displays two broaden peaks at binding energy values of 576.6–577.9 (Cr 2p3/2) and 586.4–587.5 eV (Cr 2p1/2), reflecting chromium species having different environments. It is clearly observed that the first peak is visibly consisted of two overlapping peaks. The binding energy maximum at 576.8 eV is firmly ascribed to typical Cr(III) in Cr2O3 while the additional shoulder at 579.8 eV is assigned to Cr(VI) in chromates [30,36,42]. These Cr(III)-species may play as active sites for the decomposition of t-BuOOH into active radicals [8,30–32] . The reduction behavior of the Cr/sepiolite catalysts is investigated by temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR). It is clearly seen that H2-TPR results of all samples are similar shaped-profiles. A broaden reduction peak at 355 °C is dominant with a small signal at 260 °C. The low-temperature signal (260 °C) is attributable to the reduction of Cr6+ in chromate species to Cr3+ ions. The main reduction maximum is ascribed to the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+, but this peak is very broaden, implying Cr3+ may be present in different locations and coordination numbers. Moreover, the strong interaction between Cr ions and Mg–OH groups also decreases reducibility of Cr3+ ions in the catalyst [44–47]. As chromium content increases, the main peak systematically shifts to the higher reduction temperatures, suggesting that the Cr(III) species in the tunnels are less reducible than that on the catalyst surface. Fig. 8."
7,Oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol 3.2.1 Effect of Cr-loadings All synthesized Cr/sepiolite catalysts have been tested for the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol at atmospheric pressure. It is noted that the blank test (no catalyst) shows no conversion of substrate in presence of t-BuOOH oxidant. When a Cr2O3/sepiolite catalyst was added into the reaction mixture, benzyl alcohol was converted mainly into the benzaldehyde despite of a small amount of benzoic acid also formed in some cases. Fig. 9 displays an observable variation in catalytic activity of Cr/sepiolite catalysts with different Cr-loadings. As seen in Fig. 9, benzyl alcohol conversion is negligible over sepiolite, but significantly improves on sepiolite-loaded Cr catalysts. Screening catalytic activity of Cr/sepiolites indicates that the conversion of benzyl alcohol varies with the Cr-species loadings while the selectivity to benzaldehyde is likely unchanged. In detail, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increases with the chromium contents from 3.0 to 7.0 wt% and then gradually decreases at higher Cr loading samples. A decreased conversion on the Cr-richer catalysts (10–20 wt% Cr) is resulted from the aggregation of Cr2O3. Indeed, a reference sample prepared by physically mixing Al2O3 and Cr2O3 with the composition corresponding to 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite was tested for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol at the same conditions. The mixed oxides gave a very low conversion of substrate and more byproducts (Fig. 9). Thus, the catalytic activity may be associated with the oxidation states and the dispersion and location of active Cr-species, the nature of support, as indicated by XRD, UV–vis, and XPS results [11,23,30,46,48]. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction time Effect of reaction time on the catalytic activity over catalysts is presented in Fig. 10 . It is interesting to observe that all samples show similar trends in conversion versus reaction time, in line with what was observed in Fig. 9. In overall, the catalytic activity decreases in the order of 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite > 10.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite > 20.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite > 5.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite > 3.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite while the selectivity to benzaldehyde still remains at a high level. Thus, the selectivity to main product slightly decreases after 6 h because of the formation of benzoic acid and benzoate in the product mixture under reported conditions [13,14,23,39]. 3.2.3 Effect of temperature Effect of reaction temperature on the oxidation of benzyl alcohols has been investigated in the reaction temperature range of 50–90 °C in order to reach a better yield of desired product. Fig. 11 depicts an increased conversion of benzyl alcohol at elevated reaction temperatures. Simultaneously, a large amount of benzoic acid is produced at higher reaction temperatures (Fig. 11b). An increased selectivity to benzoic acid is attributed to the over-oxidation reaction of benzaldehyde at higher temperatures [28,49–52]. Indeed, it is well known that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol occurs in consecutive reactions to form benzaldehyde and then benzoic acid [9,10,46,50]. An elevated reaction temperature readily facilitates the formation of oxygen-richer products via side reactions [13,48,51,53,54]. Fig. 11 also suggests an appropriate temperature for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde around 60 °C. 3.2.4 Effect of BzOH/TBHB molar ratios The oxidation of benzyl alcohol is carried out in consecutive reactions to form benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and benzoate esters. In order to reach a better catalytic performance and to avoid the over-oxidation reactions, we have controlled the liquid oxidation at different TBHP/substrate molar ratios on 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite sample and the catalytic results are illustrated in Fig. 12 . It is interesting to note that no major changes in the catalytic activity within TBHP/BzOH of 0.5/1–1.5/1 (Fig. 12), but the conversion and product distribution change noticeably when adding an excessive amount of TBHB (molar ratios of 2/1–3/1). In the presence of chromium loading catalysts, Cr(III)-species act as active sites for the decomposition of t-BuOOH into t-BuOO• or t-BuO• radicals which proceed the oxidation of benzyl alcohol via H-abstraction from the CH2 group [20,35,48,53]. When excessive amount of TBHB presented in reaction mixture, the formed radicals attack the intermediate products to produce benzoic acid, and thus cause detrimental effects on the product distribution [54,55]. As a result, the appropriate catalytic performance was achieved with the TBHB/BzOH molar ratio of 1/1–1.5/1, whereas lower activity was as a result of either excessive or inadequate amount of TBHB [13,42,48,54]. 3.2.5 Effect of oxidant nature The behavior of oxidants is known to have strong effects on the benzyl alcohol conversion, product selectivity, and yield. In the present work, three oxidants including aqueous H2O2 solution (30%), tert‑butyl hydroperoxide (70% in water), and air were used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over 7.0 wt% Cr3+/sepiolite. The results collected in Table 2 indicate different activities of the catalysts with the nature of oxidants. As air was used as an oxidant, no oxidation reaction occurs at 90 °C, but 4% of the substrate was oxidized at 120 °C (Table 2) [11,31]. Meanwhile, t-BuOOH and H2O2 aqueous solution both can readily oxidize benzyl alcohol at lower reaction temperatures. In practice, TBHB shows a better conversion of benzyl alcohol while H2O2 aqueous solution oxidizes about 33% of the substrate under the same experimental conditions. The catalytic activity of Cr/sepiolite in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols in the presence of peroxides (H2O2 and t-BuOOH) are possibly related to the formation of radicals of HO• and BuOO•/BuO• over CrIII-sites [8,15,31,48,50,52,55–57]. 3.2.6 Effect of solvent nature A set of solvents with different polarities was used in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol on chromium oxide/sepiolite catalysts (Fig. 13). The overall catalytic activity of the catalysts depends on the nature of solvents. Since the selectivity to benzaldehyde is almost constant at very high value of 92–99%, the changes in conversion is related to the polarity of solvent. Both ethanol and acetronitrile exhibit better activity than DMF does; in the meantime toluene solvent shows the poorest activity due to low solubility of TBHP in a nonpolar solvent. On the contrary, the polar acetonitrile with high dielectric constant is readily dissolved in both TBHP and benzyl alcohol, thus giving a better catalytic performance [13,30,53,56–58]. A similar result was observed with the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 in above-mentioned solvent systems represented in Fig. 3S. Therefore, it can be suggested that the non-polar/low-polar solvents are inappropriate for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with TBHB over Cr/sepiolite catalysts [13,14,56]. 3.2.7 Catalyst reusability For a cycling study performed after experiments, the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture and then washed with ethanol, dried carefully prior to test the catalyst stability. Fig. 14 a exhibits the catalytic activity of 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite samples after five recycling reactions. It is observed that the benzyl alcohol conversion slightly decreased from 31 to 26% after two runs and then dramatically decreases with recycling times, suggesting that a part of chromium oxides may be leached out of the catalysts (Fig. 1S) [35,55]. Observations based on the catalyst reusability imply that chromium leaching occurs during each recycling test. In order to improve the reusability of catalysts, the 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite sample was calcined at a higher temperature prior to perform recycling ability. Fig. 14b shows better catalytic stability of the catalyst after five cycles under the same experimental reactions. As shown in Fig. 14, catalyst activity mostly remains unchanged after four recycling experiments. The results indicate that a part of Cr-species entrapped in the Mg–O–Si channels interacts with the OH groups of the layers would be stabilized in the oxidation process [25,31,43]. This suggestion was supported by the TGA analysis in Fig. 3S in Supplementary Materials. 3.2.8 Effect of calcination temperature Since the reusability of the Cr2O3/sepiolite catalysts is strongly dependent on the calcination temperature, an increased calcination temperature may improve the catalyst stability (Fig. 14b). Accordingly, the fresh sample of 7.0 wt% Cr/sepiolite was calcined at different temperatures prior to screen for the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol. Their XRD patterns for the calcined samples are presented in Fig. 4S (Supplementary Materials). Fig. 15 indicates no significant changes in benzyl alcohol conversion, but small amounts of benzoic acid are present in product mixture on the catalysts calcined at 300-500 °C. This may be related to the presence of Cr3+ ions on the catalyst surface [27]. Indeed, we have prepared a reference sample by impregnation of Cr(NO3)3 into sepiolite and then calcined at 410 °C prior to test for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Trivalent chromium in the latter catalyst is possibly active for the formation of carboxylic acid (Fig. 9) [8,28,30]. When the catalysts are calcined in the temperature range of 400–600 °C, chromium ions react coordinately with unsaturated Mg2+ in octahedral sheet of sepiolite (Fig. 3S) and thus change in environment coordination. However, the aggregation of chromia nanoparticles at elevated temperature may not exclude. As a result, conversion slightly decreases while selectivity to benzaldehyde was unchanged over sample calcined at 500 °C [13,30]. Another possibility is that nanofibers were damaged and hydroxyl group was dehydrated at high temperature, as indicated by TGA analysis (Fig. 3S), leading to a slight change in catalyst texture. At a higher calcination temperature (>600 °C), the sepiolite structure may be destructed, giving a mixture of oxides (Fig. 4S) and thus the overall catalytic activity is simply reduced [30,32]. Thus, the most suitable calcination temperature is in the range of 400–500 °C to make the Cr2O3/sepiolite catalysts become truly heterogeneous and stable under reported oxidation conditions."
8,Conclusions,"A series of 3–20 wt% Cr based sepiolite supported catalysts were prepared by precipitation method followed by calcination in air. The solids are composed mainly of Cr2O3 in addition a small amount of Cr(VI) ions. The catalyst showed a high dispersion of Cr2O3 on the sepiolite nanofibers, large surface area, strong interaction between Cr-species and the support. The prepared catalysts have been tested for the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol with TBHB and obtained benzaldehyde as a major product. Under reported conditions, Cr(III)/Cr(VI) species were active for the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde while Cr(III)–free ions gave a high selectivity to benzoic acid. The catalytic activity, product selectivity, and catalyst stability depend on the Cr2O3 content, nature of oxidant, solvent polarity, reaction time, temperature… The catalyst stability was enhanced by calcination temperature and interaction between Cr-species and the basic sepiolite. The highest conversion of benzaldehyde is about 60–70% and the selectivity to benzaldehyde remains at 99% in solvent-free conditions."
