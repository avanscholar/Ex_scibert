1,Synthesis of catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of catalyst Pluronic P123 (Mw=5800), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), HCl (37%), cyanamide (99%), triethanolamine (99%), H2PtCl6·6H2O (≥37.5% Pt basis), NH4HF2 (95%), α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (99%), benzyl alcohol (99.8%), benzaldehyde (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3-aminothiophene-2-carbonitrile (ATCN) was prepared according to previous report [19]. All chemicals were used as received, without further purification. Synthesis of SBA-15 silica: In a typical preparation, TEOS (5.58g) was mixed with P123 (3.46g) in 1.6M HCl solution (38mL) and stirred at 35°C for 24h. The mixture was heated at 150°C for 24h under static condition in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After the reaction, the resulting white precipitate was filtered, dried at 80°C overnight. It was further calcined at 550°C in air for 4h with heating rate of 1°C/min to get SBA-15 silica as templates. Synthesis of OMCN: First, the as-prepared SBA-15 silica was acidized by 1M HCl solution (1.0g silica/20.0mL HCl) at 80°C for 24h, followed by drying at 80°C for 12h. Then, 1.0g HCl-treated SBA-15 silica and 8g liquid cyanamide were kept sonication and vacuum at 55°C for 4h. Third, 15.0mL water was then added to the mixture, followed by centrifugation, drying and calcination at 550°C for 4h. The resulting powder was treated with 4M NH4HF2 solution (40mL) for 24h to remove the silica template, followed by filtration, washing with water and ethanol several times, and finally drying at 80°C to produce OMCN. Synthesis of OMCNA: First, 8g cyanamide was mixed with a certain amount of ATCN at 55°C for 24h under N2 protection. Then 1.0g HCl-treated SBA-15 silica was added to this liquid mixture, kept sonication and vacuum at 55°C for 4h. Third, 15.0mL water was added to the mixture, followed by centrifugation, drying and calcination at 550°C for 4h. The resulting powder was treated with 4M NH4HF2 solution (40mL) for 24h to remove the silica template, followed by filtration, washing with water and ethanol several times, and finally drying at 80°C. The resultant samples were further labeled as OMCNA-X, where X (1, 2, 3, 4) refers to the amount of ATCN as 15, 30, 90 and 150mg, respectively."
2,Characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Characterization of catalyst X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were measured in powder form using a Thermo ESCALAB250 instrument with a monochromatized Al K α line source (200W) at 3.0×10− 10 mbar. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) were performed on Varian Cary 500 Scan UV–visible system. Sample picture was taken by Nikon D 3100. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were recorded using a Bruker model A300 spectrometer with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (λ <800nm) and an UV-cutoff filter (λ >420nm) as visible light source. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) measurements were performed on Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu K α1 radiation (λ =1.5406Å). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on STA 449 F3 (NETZSCH Co.). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopies (TEM) were operated by Nova Nano 230 microscope and Zeis 912 microscope, respectively. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were carried out using a Nonius rotating anode (Cu K α radiation, λ =1.5406Å) with pinhole collimation and a MAR CCD area detector (sample-detector distance of 740mm). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected at 77K using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer."
3,Activity test,"2.3 Activity test Photocatalytic activity for water splitting: Reactions were carried in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a glass closed gas system. H2 production was performed by dispersing 20mg of catalyst in an aqueous solution (100mL), using triethanolamine (10vol%) and 3wt% Pt as electron donor and cocatalyst, respectively. The reaction solution was evacuated several times to remove air completely prior to irradiation under a 300W Xenon-lamp. The wavelength of the incident light for H2 evolution was controlled by applying appropriate long-pass cut-off filters. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 12°C by a flow of cooling water during the reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a 5Å molecular sieve column, using argon as the carrier gas. Photocatalytic activity for organic synthesis: The reaction was carried out at 1bar pressure of oxygen, in a 10mL Pyrex glass reactor fitted with a reflux condenser, oil bath, thermocouple, and magnetic stirrer. A typical reaction condition was 1.5mL of benzotrifluoride, 0.1mmol alcohol, 5mg of catalyst; reaction temperature is kept at 60°C and reaction time is 3h. To carry out the photochemical reaction, a 300W Xenon lamp together with a 420nm cut-off filter was used as a visible light source for the irradiation of reaction system. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000rmp for 10min to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was analyzed with an Agilent Gas Chromatograph (GC-7820). The assignment of products was confirmed by a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (HP-5973GC/MS)."
4,Results and discussion,"In Fig. 1 (a), the as-prepared OMCNA was first subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the successful incorporation of ATCN in the mesoporous polymeric matrix. According to previous reports, the S 2p spectrum of OMCNA can be deconvoluted into two distinct peaks, one of S 2p 1/2 and the other of S 2p 3/2 [19]. Their binding energies are determined as 165.1eV and 163.9eV with an intensity ratio of 1:2.2. These binding energies together with their intensity ratio are almost the same as the values reported for ATCN monomer and ATCN-modified bulk carbon nitride polymers [19]. This result indicates that ATCN groups have been entirely grafted on the surfaces of OMCNA, which is helpful to extend the π-delocalized system in polymeric matrix, due to its strong electron donor ability [19]. In Fig. 1(b), the presence of ATCN motifs in OMCNA is also confirmed by the improved optical absorption properties [14,19]. With increasing ATCN content in starting materials, the sample color changes from pale yellow for unmodified OMCN to orange, and even to brown for OMCNA. According to UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS), this enhanced visible light harvesting ability can be further demonstrated as a semiconductive behavior, namely, band gap narrowing [14]. Because the combination of π-electron-rich ATCN donors in the OMCN matrix can induce the reconstruction of π-conjugated system to up-shift and down-shift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), respectively, leading to the decrease of band gap energy [18,19]. Hence, all of the optical-absorption edges of OMCNA are observed obviously red-shift from 435nm toward longer wavelengths (470–650nm), counteracting overwhelmingly the blue-shift to harvest more visible photons to drive heterogeneous photocatalysis. Another significant semiconductive benefit originating from ATCN doping is the improved efficiency of exciton splitting. Grafting ATCN motifs on OMCN surfaces is regarded as a promising approach to create lots of surface dyadic heterostructures on carbon nitride solids [19]. These heterojunctions basing on donor-accepter relationship (ATCN gives π electrons to aromatic conjugated system), in principle, can efficiently promote exciton dissociation to produce free electrons and holes for relevant photoredox reactions [16]. Hence, more unpaired electrons are monitored on OMCNA over the unmodified counterpart in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, where an enhanced Lorentz line centered at g =2.0034 is observed in both dark and light states (Fig. 1c). Concluding from the above characterizations, the serious nanostructure-induced semiconductive defects have been well addressed with the incorporation of ATCN functional groups in OMCN matrix. Now, another concerning issue comes up. What about the influence of molecular engineering on nanoarchitecture? Does the well-orientated nanotexture still retain in OMCNA after the copolymerization? In the following study, several physical analyses were focused on the characterization of structure-dependent properties of OMCNA. Fig. 2 (a) displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of OMCNA. In comparison with OMCN, a considerably broader XRD reflection with reducing intensity is observed for all OMCNA samples, indicating that a decrease order of local stacking of tri-s-triazine subunits is present in the polymeric matrix [19]. To our knowledge, this molecular-induced matrix disturbance cannot be avoided, and is always harmful to ordered nanoarchitectures. Correspondingly, a slight decrease of thermal stability against air is observed for OMCNA nanoparticles with a low-shift of complete decomposition temperature from 710°C to 690°C (Fig. 2b). The final weight loss calculated for OMCNA is up to 99.2%, clearly suggesting that silica templates have been almost removed by the NH4HF2 etching process [11,12]. This important finding demonstrates that the nanotexture of OMCNA is free-standing, rather than supported by silica templates. The morphology of OMCNA was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In Fig. 3 (a), the rod-like morphologies templated from SBA-15 silica are clearly imaged for OMCNA in a large scale, indicating a perfectly inverse replication of template patterns in a well-controlled manner [12]. The corresponding inner textural structures of rod-like OMCNA particles are directly presented by TEM image. In Fig. 3(b), the linear arrays of mesochannels along [100] direction are discovered in a very good arrangement, intuitively reflecting the order textural structure inside OMCNA nanoparticles [8–10]. Note that, all of these observations in SEM and TEM are highly similar to those reported for OMCN in our previous study [12], indicating that the well-defined morphologies of SBA-15 silica templates are faithfully copied in OMCNA. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurement was carried out for the characterization of mesostructural order in OMCNA. In Fig. 4 , three typical peaks indexed as (100), (110), and (200) reflections of the ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure with a p6mm symmetry are obtained on OMCNA series [7–10]. These patterns indicate that the ordered texture of SBA-15 templates have been successfully copied in the framework of OMCNA via inverse replication. However, a gradual loss of mesostructural order of 2D hexagonal symmetry is revealed by the less intensity of SAXS diffractions with incorporating more and more ATCN motifs in polymeric matrix. This unavoidable structural disorder originating from matrix disturbance motivates us to find a balance point between optical properties and ordered nanoarchitectures when OMCN is molecularly engineered for a target specific application. The corresponding unit-cell constants obtained from OMCN and OMCNA are summarized in Table 1. The textural properties and surface area of OMCNA are characterized by nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms. In Fig. 5 , a typical IV isotherm with pronounced H-type hysteresis loop is observed for all OMCNA samples, suggesting the presence of well-developed mesopores in polymeric matrix [7,8]. Their corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size is determined as ca. 3.4nm with uniform distributions. Due to the gradual loss of mesostructural order of 2D hexagonal framework, their specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume continuously decrease from ∼500m2/g to ∼200m2/g and from 0.49cm3/g to 0.33cm3/g, respectively, as increasing ATCN from 15 to 150mg. This result is in good agreement with the characterization of SAXS. Their detailed textural parameters calculated from nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms are also listed in Table 1. As a conclusion of structural characterization, an inevitable loss of mesostructural order of 2D hexagonal framework, however, is indeed caused by the integration of ATCN motifs in carbon nitride conjugated system via altering the local packing of polymeric subunits to disturb the mesoscale organization of the polymer matrix. The unique nanostructural benefits of OMCN can be well preserved in the modified samples by optimizing the molar ratio of ATCN/cyanamide in starting materials. For example, the well-orientated nanoarchitectures with large specific surface area and uniform nanosized pore are still inherited in OMCNA-1, -2, when keeping ATCN no more than 30 mg. Hence, the amount of ATCN plays a critical role in controlling the nanoarchitecture and optical properties of OMCN. For heterogeneous photocatalysis, OMCNA was first evaluated in an assay of hydrogen production reaction with visible light (λ >420 nm) [20]. The hydrogen evolution rate (HER) was determined as 395, 295, 267 and 186µmol/h for OMCNA-1 to -4, respectively (Table 1). It means that different samples show different catalytic performances when they are tested for heterogeneous catalysts due to the different optical absorption ability. All of them, except for OMCNA-4, show a remarkable improved performance over the pristine OMCN (243µmol/h), outstanding the advantage of surface organic modification of 2D hexagonal framework. The evidently decreasing of HER on OMCNA-4 is presumably caused by the serious breach of mesostructural order of 2D hexagonal framework and by the excessive modifier acting as light shielding layers [12]. In Table 1, a similar catalytic behavior is also examined for the selective oxidation of alcohols over OMCNA under ambient O2 pressure and relative low reaction temperature (1 bar O2, 60°C) [21]. The conversion rate of oxidizing benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is calculated as 44.6%, 61.7% and 28.5% for OMCN, OMCNA-1 and OMCNA-4, respectively. Interestingly, the conversion rate (61.7%) obtained on OMCNA-1 is comparable to the value (57%) determined for mesoporous carbon nitride under high pressure and elevated temperature (8bar O2, 100°C) [22]. This finding is rather important. It suggests that simultaneous modification of textural structures and electronic features of carbon nitride semiconductor is a useful pathway to develop a green synthetic strategy for selective oxidation of alcohols or other organic compounds. Further work along this line is ongoing in our lab. To better demonstrate the improved optical properties, especially the red-shift of optical absorption, are beneficial for photocatalysis, wavelength-dependent H2 production was performed on OMCNA-1 using band-pass optical filters [18,19]. In Fig. 6 , the HERs agree approximately with the UV–Vis reflectance spectrum of OMCNA-1, strongly confirming that the extension of visible-light absorption in longer wavelength indeed supports the photocatalytic production of H2 fuels [19]. This wavelength-driven H2 evolution is also an indicator that H2 generation proceeds catalytically [20]. When comparing the wavelength-dependent HERs with OMCN, it clearly shows that the longer wavelength of incident light, the more significantly promotion of H2 production is (Table S1). This result fully embodies the photocatalytic advantages by chemical engineering of 2D hexagonal framework with aromatic hetero-molecules with dissimilar electronic and chemical structure. After irradiated with light for 16 h, no evident decrease in the activity could be observed (Fig. 6b), indicating the robust stability of the photocatalysts for heterogeneous applications."
5,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the remarkable hypsochromic shift of absorption threshold and the increased excition dissociation energy, can be well overcome by molecular engineering of OMCN matrix with ATCN aromatic molecules to extend the π-conjugated system, while still maintaining the mesozeolitic structure by adjusting the ATCN/cyanamide molar ratio in a controllable fashion to minimize the unavoidable matrix disturbance. When functionalizing as a sustainable solar energy transducer, the optimized OMCNA exhibits an obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity toward H2 evolution and selective oxidation of alcohols, underling the advantage of molecular engineering in supporting nanostructured photocatalysts. It is believed that the OMCNA host with improved materials properties can stimulate intensive investigations on host-guest chemistry/materials to create polymeric photosynthetic cascades for the sustainable utilization of sunlight."
