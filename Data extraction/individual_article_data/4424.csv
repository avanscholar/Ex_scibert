0,Introduction,"The technology of fuel cells and the use of H2 are proposed as one of the most promising environmental solution in relation to reducing the emission levels in a growing automotive and industrial park, in addition to being more energy efficient than diesel or internal combustion engines [1]. While oil, natural gas and liquefied gas are the main current sources of hydrogen, ethanol has attracted some attention in recent years [2–5]. Ethanol is a renewable resource, easy to store and manipulate, and can be transported safely due to its low toxicity and volatility compared with methanol, the first alcohol used to generate H2. Moreover, the chemical storage in liquid is considered a good option for hydrogen transport [6]. H2-production from bioethanol is attractive given the fact that bioethanol is the world most available biofuel, which therefore would allow a renewable production of hydrogen: ethanol can be produced from biomass (such as energy crops and forestry, agricultural or municipal waste), receiving also the name of bioethanol. The CO2 produced during the generation of bioethanol based H2 is partially reabsorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of biomass, completing a carbon balance near to closed, depending on the considered biomass and its processing [7]. Based on life cycle assessment, the current bioethanol technologies, especially from corn and sugar cane, have been proposed to produce greenhouse gases emissions of the same order of magnitude than those from gasoline technologies [7–9]. However, carbon emissions for bioethanol are lower than gasoline emissions, and bioethanol production also requires less petroleum. Bioethanol generation from cellulose or waste would decrease both parameters [7]. The main reasons for obtaining H2 from bioethanol, instead of using bioethanol as fuel directly, lie essentially on dealing with the dilution of ethanol during direct utilization [10] (13mol H2O/mol C2H5OH, approx.) [11]. Furthermore, the bioethanol production may generate other compounds difficult to separate, not desirable in a combustion process. All this implies that it is not advisable to use bioethanol directly in internal combustion engines [10]. H2 from ethanol has three main ways for being produced, all expressed as total conversion equations [12,13]: • Steam Reforming (SR): (1) C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) + 3 H 2 O ( l ) → 2 C O 2 ( g ) + 6 H 2 ( g ) , Δ H ° = 347.5 [ kJ/mol ] • Partial Oxidation (POX): (2) C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) + 1.5 O 2 ( g ) → 2 C O 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) , Δ H ° = − 510.0 [ kJ/mol ] • Oxidative steam reforming (OSR): (3) C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) + ( 3 − 2 x ) H 2 O ( l ) + x O 2 ( g ) → 2 C O 2 ( g ) + ( 6 − 2 x ) H 2 ( g ) , Δ H ° = 2 * ( − 393.5 ) − 1 * ( − 277.0 ) − ( 3 − 2 x ) * ( − 285.8 ) [ kJ/mol ] = 347.5 − 571.7 x [ kJ/mol ] where x is the molar O2/C2H5OH ratio, abbreviated as O/E ratio. H2O/C2H5OH ratio is abbreviated as S/E ratio (steam to ethanol). A particular case of reaction (3), commonly used, is [14]: (4) C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) + 2 H 2 O ( l ) + 0.5 O 2 ( g ) → 2 C O 2 ( g ) + 5 H 2 ( g ) , Δ H ° = 61.6 [ kJ/mol ] However, in the OSR system, endothermic or exothermic conditions could be tuned by adjusting the O/E ratio in Eq. (3). Thus, attending global thermodynamic, the system is energetically neutral if: (5) x = 0.61 ⇒ Δ H ° = 0 [ kJ/mol ] The operation at this point is called autothermal reforming (ATR) [15]. On the reaction mechanism, it is proposed that ethanol is initially converted to ethylene (C2H4) or acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), the first of which is identified as the main precursor for coke formation on the catalyst surface [10,16]. Several papers have been published on hydrogen production from ethanol [10,12,14,17–27], studying mainly metal catalysts. Good yields have been obtained, but the problem of catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposits formation remains open [20,28,16]. In relation to the equilibrium output composition, a thermodynamic analysis by Gibbs free energy minimization has been considered [29–33]. Previous contributions are concentrated in the thermodynamic of gaseous species, and those who consider solid deposits formation, represent carbon deposition as graphite formation. Nanotubes have been photographed in the carbonaceous deposits of catalytic reforming [20,27,34]. The structure of carbon deposits formed in a catalytic process vary with reaction properties, catalyst type and reaction conditions. According to these specifications, in a reaction system, various types of carbonaceous deposits should be formed, differing in morphology and reactivity [35,36]. An analysis conducted on a Ni catalyst showed 5 different types of carbon deposits, summarized in Table 1 [37]. This suggests that the use of graphite thermodynamic properties for carbonaceous deposits representation is incomplete. Thus this work aims to describe equilibrium composition for reforming systems, including carbon deposits properties besides graphite, improving the thermodynamic description of the carbonaceous species formation taking place at during ethanol reforming."
1,Methodology,"For predicting the equilibrium composition by Gibbs free energy minimization, the expression given by Eq. (6) has to be minimized [38], for a solid–gas system, under the assumption of ideal gases and excluding solids from the calculation of gas molar fraction. (6) G = ∑ i = 1 N C g n i g μ i g , 0 + R T ln n i g n gases γ i P + ∑ i = 1 N C s n i s μ i s , 0 In Eq. (6), NC g and NC s are the number of components in gas and solid phase, respectively; n i g , the number of moles of component i in gas phase; n i s , the number of moles of component i in solid phase; R, the gas constant in [J/molK]; T, the temperature in [K]; n gases, the total number of moles in gas phase; P, adimensional pressure (P eval/P std); γ i is the activity coefficient of component i; and μ i 0 = μ i 0 ( T ) is the chemical potential of species i at standard pressure, focusing on enthalpy information [39]. The chemical potential can be calculated from Eqs. (7)–(9) where G _ i is the partial molar Gibbs free energy; H _ i , the partial molar enthalpy; and c p i , the heat capacity at constant pressure of component i [30,33,40]. (7) ∂ H _ i ∂ T P = c p i (8) ∂ ∂ T G _ i R T P = − H _ i R T 2 (9) G _ i = μ i The considered component set are detailed in Table 2 . Eqs. (7)–(9) are solved directly for gases at standard pressure, obtaining: (10) μ i 0 ( T ) [ J/mol ] = T T 0 Δ G f i 0 + 1 − T T 0 Δ H f i 0 − C 1 i T ln T T 0 − T + T 0 − C 2 i 2 ( T 2 − 2 T 0 T + T 0 2 ) − C 3 i 6 ( T 3 − 3 T 0 2 T + 2 T 0 3 ) − C 4 i 12 ( T 4 − 4 T 0 3 T + 3 T 0 4 ) − C 5 i 20 ( T 5 − 5 T 0 4 T + 4 T 0 5 ) Δ G f i 0 , Δ H f i 0 and C1 i to C5 i (constants for polynomial expression of c p i ) were taken from international databases [41,42]. For graphite, Eqs. (7)–(9) were solved by numerical integration, taking c p graphite from Eq. (11) [42]. (11) c p graphite = 4.184 2.673 + 0.002617 T − 116 , 900 T 2 [ J/mol K ] Since the data for MWCNT is not found in available databases, the chemical potential for this carbon species was calculated from Eq. (9), computing G _ MWCNT as a function of G _ graphite with the thermodynamic data for the reaction C graphite → C MWCNT [43]: (12) G _ MWCNT [ J/mol ] = G _ graphite + Δ G graphite → MWCNT 0 = G _ graphite + 8250 − 11.72 T For amorphous carbon deposits, G _ Amorphous carbon was computed by polynomial adjustment to thermodynamic data of pure carbon amorphous species [44,45]: (13) G _ Amorphous carbon [ J/mol ] = − 5.8239 E − 12 T 4 + 1.9769 E − 8 T 3 − 2.7622 E − 5 T 2 + 9.8415 E − 3 T + 1.4895 E + 1 R 2 = 9.9944 E − 1 Eq. (6) was solved by an Ant algorithm [46,47] over a discrete type space. All composition vectors n (with 24 components max.) have constrains for their components, attending: (14) Atom conservation : ∑ i a i j n i = ∑ i N C a i j n i initial ; ∀ j ∈ { 1,2,... , N A } (15) Non − negative molarity : n i ≥ 0 ; ∀ i ∈ 1,2,3,... , N C n initial is the initial composition vector; NA, the number of atoms in total composition; and a ij , the number of j atoms in molecule i. The constrains exhibited in Eqs. (14) and (15) were incorporated on dimensional space by the construction method for composition vectors n. A simplified flow diagram of this construction routine is shown in Fig. 1 . As mentioned before, the search of the minimum of the G function (see Eq. (6)) was programmed emulating an Ant algorithm [46,47]. A flow diagram for minimization of function G is shown in Fig. 2 . All routines were implemented in GNU Octave numerical language [48]. Gibbs free energy minimization routine exhibited in Fig. 2 was used for predicting equilibrium composition of reforming systems."
2,Evaluation of the algorithm,"The Gibbs free energy minimization routine allowed to estimate equilibrium composition of various systems. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of our results, considering partial set of components including ethanol, water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetaldehyde and acetone, with those from the work of Rossi et al. [33]. The results obtained by our methodology are in good agreement with the theoretical data obtained by these authors, within the following proportional errors: 0.8% for H2 yield; 1.2% for CO2 yield; 2.2% for CO yield; and 5.3% for CH4 yield. This confirms the algorithm used in this work was properly developed. Experimental validation of a thermodynamic model is not always possible since the experimental data reported in literature is not necessarily at equilibrium conditions. Nonetheless it is still quite useful to compare experimental results with thermodynamics data to observe the trends and confirm how far apart is the system from equilibrium conditions. Fig. 4 shows a comparison between experimental work on OSR [49] and current thermodynamic calculations, revealing a close agreement and therefore indicating the proximity of Srisiriwat et al. experimental system to thermodynamic equilibrium. As mentioned above, previous efforts related to the estimation of equilibrium output composition based on a thermodynamic analysis by Gibbs free energy minimization are concentrated in the gaseous species, and those who consider solid deposits formation, represent carbonaceous deposits simply as graphite [29–33]. Applying our routine to the component set specified in Table 2, but removing MWCNT and amorphous carbon, the calculation yields similar results as those of a previous work [30] (5). The results obtained by our routine are in good agreement with the theoretical data obtained by Rabenstein et al., within the following proportional errors: 1.7% for H2 yield and 2.6% for coke yield. The product yield (Y) is calculated as mol product /mol EtOH input . These results indicate important formation of carbon deposits for low S/E ratios (below S/E=3) at temperatures between 200°C and 700°C. This region corresponds also to the area of lowest hydrogen yield (Fig. 5 )."
3,Results and discussion,"To extend these results the present study considered all components described in Table 2 and different O/E ratios. In such a way it is possible to analyze the formation of different carbonaceous species under OSR conditions. These results are shown in Figs. 6–8 . No major changes are observed for the gaseous species at equilibrium after considering different types of carbon deposits. This result is showed for O/E=0, 0.5 and S/E=2, 4 in Fig. 9 . Hydrogen yield slightly declines as O/E ratio increases, as shown in Fig. 6, due to the increase in the production of CO and H2O under oxygen enriched conditions. Higher H2 production is achieved at high temperatures (above 700°C), high S/E ratio (>4) and low O/E ratio, as it has been showed for SR system versus POX or OSR systems [30]. The results shown in Figs. 7 and 8 confirm that the formation of carbonaceous species is favored at S/E ratios below 4.0 for all temperatures and O/E ratios. Nonetheless, our results indicate that the carbon species formed strongly depends on the temperature, showing a drastic change on the predominant carbon-containing species present at equilibrium. Comparing equilibrium results for different carbon species, in Figs. 7 and 8, is possible to note that below 400°C there is mainly formation of graphite carbon, and for higher temperatures and below a S/E ratio of 3, the graphite carbon species completely disappears to give rise to MWCNT structures that remains present even at temperatures as high as 1000°C for S/E and O/E equal to 0. This behavior, strongly related to temperature changes, is consistent with reports indicating that higher temperature promotes carbon nanotubes formation [37]. The change of the predominant carbonaceous species is also clear in Fig. 10 . This figure compares the total amount of carbon deposits when only the graphite species is considered (solid line) and the case when amorphous carbon, graphite, and MWCNT species are considered (broken line). It is clear that the total carbon amount is higher when a multiple representation is used, mainly due to the inclusion of MWCNT in the component set. Again, MWCNT formation is higher than graphite species at temperatures above 400°C, that coincides with the temperature range where the larger differences in the amount of carbon species is observed. As the O/E ratio grows, less MWCNT is formed, but the difference in the total amount of carbon formed still remains. Another important observation is that the disappearance of MWCNT species is faster at higher temperatures, especially above 700°C, which agrees with real systems observations, were O2 presence promotes combustion of coke [34]. In contrast, this behavior is not observed in graphite equilibrium calculations (Fig. 7). It must be noted that the disappearance of the carbon-containing species with O/E ratio increment have been reported in previous equilibrium calculations [30], but considering all solid carbonaceous species as graphite. Our results indicate that the change in deposits formation with O/E ratio is mainly due to carbon nanotubes disappearance (Fig. 8) instead of graphite (Fig. 7), which yield remains almost constant even under variations of the O/E ratio to oxygen-rich conditions. High S/E ratio also prevents carbonaceous species formation, which effect is evidenced in Fig. 10. Equilibrium results indicate that, at S/E ratio of 4 or higher, both graphite and MWCNT formation is inhibited as seen in Figs. 7 and 8. According to these results, there is no presence of amorphous carbon at equilibrium conditions. However, there are several reports in real systems showing amorphous carbon deposits, whose crystal structure is less orderly than that of graphite or MWCNT [50–52]. The absence of amorphous carbon at equilibrium conditions may indicate a faster formation kinetics for amorphous carbon than for graphite or MWCNT, justifying the existence of amorphous carbon in real experimental systems controlled by kinetic aspect. Another possible explanation is that its formation is not properly described by just considering pure C species. Further work is underway to incorporate additional information on the carbon nanotubes formation, considering different diameters and lengths, as well as to improve the Gibbs free energy calculation for amorphous carbon."
4,Conclusions,"This work presents the study of thermodynamical equilibrium composition for different reforming systems, including the description of carbon deposits other than graphite carbon. The inclusion of MWCNT and amorphous carbon reveals the existence of well defined regions with clear temperature and S/E ratio limits. In equilibrium, carbon deposits are formed when S/E ratio is below 4. In this zone, temperature defines which carbon type is formed: below 400°C the presence of graphite domines, while above 400°C prevails MWCNT. According to our results, the disappearance of carbon deposits as the O/E ratio increasesis mainly due to the removal of MWCNT species rather than the graphitic species. No amorphous carbon is obtained in equilibrium, so better thermodynamic representation is being developed to represent its presence in real systems."
