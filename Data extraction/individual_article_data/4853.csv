0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde as one of the most important value-added products is widely applied in dyeing, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries [1–4]. Selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to get their corresponding aldehydes has been carried out via catalytic route. However, due to the traditional synthesis methods have obvious disadvantages, such as harsh reaction conditions and expensive oxidant. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a highly effective and environmental-friendly catalytic route for the production of benzaldehyde. Considering the sunlight as a source of clean and renewable energy, photocatalysis can be as an alternative pathway to match the needs of green engineering, which employs a solid phase photoactive semiconductor as a photocatalyst to converse benzyl alcohol into high value-added chemicals [5]. Even if issues remain with lack of selectivity, heterogeneous photocatalytic systems have attracted much interest and been well developed [2,6–9]. Conventional photocatalysts such as TiO2 [10,11], Nb2O5 [12], TiO2–WO3 [13], ZnO [14], BiWO6 [15] or Bi2MoO6 [16] for the selective oxidation of alcohols with O2 need the irradiation of UV light to overcome the large bandgaps of these semiconducting materials, leading to charge separation and the subsequent oxidation reactions [17]. Among many developed photocatalysts, TiO2 is considered to be the most suitable candidate due to its low toxicity, excellent chemical stability, low cost, and photoinduced strong oxidation activity properties [18–20]. However, to achieve a high product selectivity is still difficult and the mechanistic study has not yet been sufficient. It is known that noble nanoparticles can strongly absorb visible light [21]. Hence, the photocatalytic process with supported noble nanoparticles has the potential to harvest sunlight and green energy source. Noble metal Pt nanoparticles have been considered as the effective co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 [22,23]. In addition, its photocatalytic performance is greatly depended on its crystal phase and structure [24]. To improve the photocatalytic performance, many strategies have been proposed, especially for the structures of TiO2, including nanowires [25], nanotubes [26], nanofibers [27], nanosheets [28], and hollow nanospheres [29]. Compared with other morphologies and shapes, TiO2 hollow nanospheres present a number of advantages including high-energy conversion efficiency, large surface areas, and low particle density. Generally, hard or soft templates have been employed to fabricate hollow nanostructured TiO2. However, using templates usually suffer from multi-step processes as the template needs to be removed by calcination or by dissolution [30,31]. In comparison, template-free method is a more promising way to synthesizing hollow TiO2 nanoparticles via a hydrothermal reaction and calcination treatment. Hence, we reported a facile template-free hydrothermal method for the preparation of hollow TiO2 nanospheres. After that, Pt nanoparticles were supported on the TiO2 to form the photocatalyst. Which was used for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with toluene as a solvent under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that both the hollow structure and Pt nanoparticles enhanced the photocatalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Potassium nitrate, titanium (IV) isopropoxide, hydrogen peroxide solution (30 wt%), sodium hydroxide, ethanol, hydrochloride acid (37.5 wt%), and commercial Degussa P25 powders (P25) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. All the mentioned chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of precursor,"2.2 Synthesis of precursor Anhydrous ethanol (200 mL) and potassium nitrate solution (0.1 M, 0.8 mL) were placed into a 500 mL beaker. Afterwards, tetraisopropyl titanate (4.4 mL) was added and stirred thoroughly until a white precipitate was formed. The turbid liquid was still and aged for 24 h, and then centrifuged. The supernatant liquid was decanted to get white precipitate, which was washed with water and ethanol for thrice, respectively, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain white powder precursor."
4,Synthesis of hollow TiO2 nanospheres,"2.3 Synthesis of hollow TiO2 nanospheres Above as-prepared precursor (200 mg) and H2O2 solution (0.05 wt%, 40 mL) were added into a 100 mL beaker. After stirring for 20 min, sodium hydroxide (160 mg) were added and stirred for another 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL and maintained at 180 °C for different hydrothermal reaction time, namely, 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 5 h, respectively. Subsequently, TiO2 nanospheres were obtained by centrifugation and washed thrice alternately with deionized water and ethanol. After soaking for 10 min with hydrochloric acid (0.1 M), the supernatant liquid was decanted to obtain white precipitate, washed with water to neutrality. The product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h, heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to 450 °C, and calcined at that temperature for 1 h in a muffle furnace to obtain the hollow TiO2 nanospheres."
5,Preparation of catalysts,"2.4 Preparation of catalysts Platinum was loaded on hollow TiO2 nanospheres by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Briefly, the prepared hollow TiO2 nanospheres were placed in a round-bottomed flask and sonicated for 10 min. Then, an aqueous solution containing chloroplatinic acid (1 wt% of Pt) was added into the flask and stirred for 5 h with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. After that, moderate NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) was added and stirred for another 2 h. Then, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized water. And the above process was repeated 3 times. The obtained sample was dried at 60 °C for 24 h. To further explore the effect of titanium dioxide carrier in different hydrothermal reaction time and the effect of different Pt loadings on the catalytic performance, the titanium dioxide carrier with hydrothermal reaction time of 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 5 h, and the Pt loading of 0.5%, 1% and 2% were used in this experiment. The prepared samples were denoted as xPt–TiO2–y, where x was the mass percentage of Pt, y was the hydrothermal reaction time."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on DMAX Advance using Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å) at an operating voltage of 45 kV. Specific surface areas were measured in accordance with the standard Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method from the nitrogen adsorption data by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The samples were degassed at 180 °C for 5 h before adsorption measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were carried out using the JEM-1200EX (JEOL) operated at 200 kV. The samples were dispersed into ethanol under sonication for 3 min and deposition on a carbon-coated copper grid before the measurement. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on an ESCALAB 250 XI electron spectrometer from Thermo Scientific using a mono Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.71 eV, 5 mA, 15 kV), and the calibration was performed by setting the C1s peak at 284.5 eV."
7,Evaluation of photocatalytic properties,"2.6 Evaluation of photocatalytic properties In a typical experiment, the 2 mL toluene and 20 μL benzyl alcohol were added to the sample bottle of 10 mL, then the 10 mg catalyst was added, and the ultrasonic was dispersed. After dispersing, the magnet was added to the magnetic stirrer in the light reactor and connected to the oxygen cylinder for oxygen. The xenon arc lamp with a UV cutoff filter (Xe lamp, 500 W, λ > 420 nm) was used as the visible-light source to induce the photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic reaction device is shown in Fig. 1 . After 4 h of light irradiation, the mixture was centrifuged to completely remove the catalyst particles. Residual solution was analyzed by GC with FID. On the other side, the Agilent (7000C) gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC–MS) was applied to analyze the component of the product. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzaldehyde were calculated as follows: Conversion ( % ) = [ ( C 0 − C BA ) / C 0 ] × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = [ C B / ( C 0 − C BA ) ] × 100 where C 0 is the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol, C BA and C B are the concentrations of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde after reaction, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,"The prepared TiO2 nanospheres via different hydrothermal reaction time (0.5, 1.5, 3, 5 h) were denoted as TiO2–0.5, TiO2–1.5, TiO2–3, and TiO2–5, respectively, and were characterized by a number of analytical techniques. XRD patterns of hollow TiO2 nanospheres with different hydrothermal reaction time compiled in Fig. 2 a pointed to the clear presence of a distinctive anatase phase in the materials. Characteristic peaks of anatase were 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 47.8°, 54.9°, 62.9°, 70° and 75°, which were in accord well with the report [27,32]. It was noted that the significant increase of the peak intensity at 25.3° corresponding to (101) plane, probably evidencing a higher crystallinity degree with the longer reaction time. It indicated that the interplanar distance in the samples was not affected by hydrothermal reaction time. Another could find the peaks at 27° assigned to (103) and (112) plane, demonstrating that was appeared with longer reaction time. When Pt was supported on the hollow TiO2 nanospheres, the peaks of anatase was not changed, but with the increase of Pt content, the peak at 2θ = 31° was ascribed to the Pt plane (Fig. 2b). As catalytic performance strongly depends on the number of exposed light absorption and active sites on the catalyst surface, the study of surface structures are required. Fig. 3 presents the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the prepared TiO2 with different hydrothermal reaction time, together with the pore size distribution curves of the samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, the sample of TiO2–0.5 could be classified to be H3 type hysteresis loop, the other three presented different hysteresis loops and belonged to H1 type according to the classifications IUPAC [33]. Besides, the H3 hysteresis loop corresponded to a material with flake-like particles loosely packed to form a wedge-shaped hole. As for the H1 hysteresis loop, it showed that the pore structure of the material was of the same height and the pore connectivity was good. The results indicated that TiO2 possessed stable and similar porous structures after hydrothermal reaction for 1.5 h, the pore sizes of the later three samples were almost the same (see Table 1 ). However, it was observed that hydrothermal reaction time caused the BET surface area to be changed due to the thermal-induced aggregation, along with the raise of the crystallinity of the anatase TiO2 (Fig. 2). The highest BET surface area of the TiO2 sample obtained by 0.5 h of hydrothermal reaction time was about 157 m2 g−1, whereas the relatively low BET surface area of the TiO2 sample obtained by 3 h of hydrothermal reaction time was about 78 m2 g−1 (see Table 1). The explanation of this unusual behavior might be that the particles of TiO2 were transformed from loosely packed state to connectivity with the extending of hydrothermal reaction time. During the transformation process, H2O2 was responsible for the formation of hollow TiO2. The formation of solid spheres can be transformed into hollow or core–shell spheres based on the Ostwald ripening mechanism (Fig. 4 ) [34], which was carefully monitored by changing the hydrothermal reaction time at 180 °C. And these structures were characterized by TEM. It was clear from the diagram that the titanium dioxide had a spherical structure with hollow nanotubes on the surface. The hydrothermal reaction time of 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5 h lead to different internal structures. Figs. 5a1 and a2 were TEM diagrams of titanium dioxide nanospheres with hydrothermal reaction of 0.5 h. During the process, the obtained sample of TiO2–0.5 was a solid structure and the surface nanotube was just beginning to grow, the nanotube was short. Figs. 5b1 and b2 were TEM diagrams of the titanium dioxide nanospheres with hydrothermal reaction of 1.5 h. The obtained sample of TiO2–1.5 was not completely solid structure and had a certain hollow structure. And there was a hollow structure in the periphery, and it was a semi empty and semi solid intermediate state. Figs. 5c1 and c2 were TEM diagrams of the titanium dioxide nanospheres with a hydrothermal reaction of 3 h. The obtained sample of TiO2–3 was a half empty and semi solid intermediate state. The solid part of the solid color was black and denser, while the solid part of the c1, c2 was lighter and had a semitransparent state, indicating that the sample of TiO2–3 with the hollow structure was more obvious than that of TiO2–1.5. The nanotube surface of TiO2–1.5 and TiO2–3 microspheres was also obviously thicker than the TiO2–0.5, and the nanotube surface of the TiO2 microspheres grew with the increase of the hydrothermal reaction time. Figs. 5d1 and d2 were TEM images of the titanium dioxide nanospheres with a hydrothermal reaction of 5 h, and the obtained sample of TiO2–5 was completely empty at this time. The state of the center was found to be very different from the surface nanotube of TiO2–3, but there were many falling nanotube fragments in the field of vision when measuring TEM. As shown in Figs. 5e1 and e2, it indicated that the nanotube on the surface of TiO2–5 was more vigorous than 3 h, but because the nanotube was too long and fragile, it broke in the ultrasonic process and scatters in the solution. It can be concluded that the hydrothermal reaction time has an important influence on the structure of titanium dioxide. Under certain conditions, with the increase of hydrothermal time, titanium dioxide was gradually transiting from solid ball to hollow sphere. During the transformation process, the shell thickness of the hollow spheres of titanium dioxide grew gradually thin. As shown in Fig. 6 , although the nanotube on the surface titanium dioxide was disappeared, the shell structure was remained and Pt particles were evenly distributed on it. To understand the Pt nanoparticles enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2, the chemical states of Pt species on 0.5%Pt–TiO2–5, 1%Pt–TiO2–5 and 2%Pt–TiO2–5 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Since the three samples containing the same elements, lower content was corresponding to worse signal. Hence, the sample of 2%Pt–TiO2–5 was chosen as a typical case. As shown in Fig. 7 a, O 1s, Ti 2p and Pt 4f were found in XPS survey spectra of 2%Pt–TiO2–5. In Fig. 7b, XPS spectra of O 1s was observed two peaks at 529.7 eV and 531.8 eV, which were attributed to Ti–O–Ti and Ti–OH, respectively. In Fig. 7c, XPS spectra collected from TiO2 and their Ti 2p XPS spectra were identical with Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks centered at binding energies of 458.5 and 464.2 eV are typical for the Ti4+–O bonds in TiO2, which were consistent with the typical values for TiO2 [26,35,36]. Otherwise, as shown in Fig. 7d, two typical peaks appear at 70.5 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 73.9 eV (Pt 4f5/2), which were attributed to the spin–orbit splitting state of Pt 4f, which was prone to originate from the predominant existence of the metallic Pt0 state [37,38]. Besides, another two overlapped peaks at 71.3 eV and 74.7 eV was attributed to Pt2+ [39]. In the process of photocatalytic experiments, benzyl alcohol was only conversed to benzaldehyde, benzoic acid was not found. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and its selectivity to benzaldehyde after 4 h of reaction in the presence of hollow TiO2 nanospheres materials were presented in Table 2 . For comparison, the blank experiment and commercial P25 were carried out under the same conditions. As can be seen from the Table 2, no conversion of benzaldehyde took place in the absence of catalyst (entry 1), which indicated that molecular O2 without activation couldn't directly participate in the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction in the toluene medium. Commercial P25 and synthesized hollow TiO2 without Pt gave the 6.42% and 8.09% conversion under visible-light irradiation (entries 2 and 3), respectively. Compared with 2%Pt–P25, 2%Pt–TiO2–5 supplied higher conversion. Whereas, 0.5%Pt–TiO2–5 (entry 16), 1%Pt–TiO2–5 (entry 15), 2%Pt–TiO2–5 (entry 6) samples gave rise to a modest conversion after 4 h reaction under visible light irradiation equal to 10.76, 13.35 and 20.13%, respectively. It was clear that the catalysts can effectively catalyze photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde was observed to be the major product in all cases. With the increase of Pt content of photocatalysts, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was increased, indicating that the Pt nanoparticles supported on hollow TiO2 promoted the photocatalytic efficiency [22,23]. From the XPS Pt 4f spectrum for the 2%Pt–TiO2–5, Pt nanoparticles with metallic Pt0 and oxidized Pt2+ species were dispersed on hollow TiO2, which enhanced the process for highly efficient photocatalytic O2 production [40,41]. Besides, it was interesting to note that the hollow structure could also enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. As seen in Table 2 (entry 6, and entries from 12 to 14), when the hydrothermal reaction time was increased from 0.5 to 5 h, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was increased from 9.74% to 20.13% under same reaction conditions. That was because the structure of TiO2 had undergone the process from the solid to the hollow with the extending hydrothermal reaction time. As expected, 2%Pt–TiO2–5 had performed higher conversion than the other three samples (2%Pt–TiO2–0.5, 2%Pt–TiO2–1.5 and 2%Pt–TiO2–3). The conversion was the highest for the catalyst with the most significant hollow structure. That may be the hollow interior generally offers extra free space for alleviating the structural strain related to the diffusion/infiltration of reactant molecules, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity [30,42]. Image 2 In the recycling test, the 2%Pt–TiO2–5 photocatalyst was recycled via centrifugation and then dried for 2 h at 60 °C to remove the residual solvent before each cycle of catalytic reactions. The reaction was carried out under the conditions of entry 6 in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 8 , when the 2%Pt–TiO2–5 photocatalyst was recycled up to five times, it well maintained its activity and selectivity."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, platinum supported on hollow TiO2 nanosphere as an efficient photocatalyst were fabricated successfully. In the present work, hydrothermal reaction time had a significant influence on the hollow structure, which could be formed in 5 h. The prepared photocatalysts were employed to catalyze selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde at room temperature with visible light in solvent of toluene. Among them, 2%Pt–TiO2–5 exhibited the highest conversion under same conditions, indicating that both Pt and hollow structure of TiO2 enhanced the efficiency of visible light conversion. This work may have implications for designing more efficient systems of solar energy conversion and directing the development by exploring the hollow structure, revealing sustainable and green energy production idea."
