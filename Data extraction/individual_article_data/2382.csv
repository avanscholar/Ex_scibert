0,Introduction,"In recent years, lignocellulosic biomass has attracted extensive interest as a renewable source for the production of bio-based fuels and chemicals in response to dwindling fossil energy reserves [1–3]. Cellulose, which constitutes 40–60 wt% of lignocellulose, is the most abundant resource that can be deconstructed into carbohydrate-based monomers [4,5]. Recent interest in valorization of cellulose via catalytic process suggests that levoglucosenone (LGO), an important intermediate, shows great promise as a precursor for the production of lactones, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, poly-alcohols, etc. [6–10]. Numerous works have demonstrated great improvement in the production of LGO with respect to the yield and selectivity. Pyrolysis is the most simple and feasible route, through which the cellulose was decomposed into primary volatiles, i.e. levoglucosan and poly-anhydrosugars, and then upgraded into LGO with a catalyst [11]. Previous studies applied an equivalent mass of high stability and strong acidity ionic liquids to pyrolysis of cellulose and yield 38% of LGO [12,13]. In addition, Cao et al. [14] showed that LGO was dehydrated from cellulose in yield of 51% by using sulfuric acid as a catalyst in tetrahydrofuran solvent. Casoni’s group [15] obtained LGO as high as 53% from catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose over Al-MCM-41. The development of cellulose-to-LGO strategies offers a likelihood of using LGO as a promising biorenewable platform for fine and commodity chemical industries, on the other hand, effective utilization of cellulose/biomass. Owing to the α, β-unsaturated ketone and protected aldehyde functionality of LGO, it shows a high reactivity [16]. In the presence of water, the C=C and C=O bonds of LGO reacted with one water molecule to form a hydroxyl group and a germinal diol, respectively [8]. Kudo et al. [17] reported that LGO could be sequentially hydrogenated to dihydrolevoglucosenone (Cyrene or DLGO) in gas phase during cellulose pyrolysis over Pd/Al2O3. Cyrene is a new and very promising substitute for dipolar aprotic solvents, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone [18], and was produced in almost 100% selectivity over Pd/C at low temperatures, nevertheless, needed a relatively long reaction time and a high hydrogen pressure [19]. Besides, Cyrene can be further hydrogenated to levoglucosanol (Lgol), and then to tetrahydrofurandimethanol (THFDM) in 58% selectivity over a bifunctional Pd/Si–Al catalyst [19]. THFDM can be efficiently converted to 1,6-hexanediol with >80% yield in the application of polymers [20–23]. Recently, Mazarío et al. [24] reported one-step hydrogenation of LGO to Cyrene and Lgol with individual yields higher than 90% over Pd/ZrO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. However, all these experiments were conducted using pressurized hydrogen, which implies higher capital and operating costs. Nowadays, formic acid, a sustainable platform molecule derived from lignocellulosic biomass, has gained a great interest of research in hydrogen storage owing to its non-toxicity property, high energy density and easy storage [25–27]. Usually, two main reaction pathways have been proposed in formic acid decomposition: the dehydrogenation into carbon dioxide and hydrogen ( HCOOH → CO 2 + H 2 ) and the dehydration into carbon monoxide and water ( HCOOH → CO + H 2 O ) . Heterogeneous catalysts, in particular, palladium-based catalysts, favor dehydrogenation of formic acid in terms of kinetics at low temperatures and ambient conditions [28–31]. Previous studies reported that Pd/C catalysts exhibited a high activity toward formic acid decomposition into carbon dioxide and hydrogen [32–34]. In addition, Pd/C catalysts also showed a good reactivity in hydrogenation of biomass-derived chemicals in combination with formic acid [35–37]. For example, Mitra et al. [37] showed that 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was hydrogenolyzed to 2, 5-dimethylfuran with 95% selectivity over a Pd/C catalyst in the presence of formic acid. In the present study, we investigated the potential of formic acid as a substitution for hydrogen source and compared the efficiency of decomposing formic acid to hydrogen over different commercial catalysts through hydrogenating the C=C bond of LGO. Then we elucidated the reaction network and demonstrated the most suitable pathway to produce Cyrene and Lgol depending on the desired product, as illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
1,Experimental,"LGO and Cyrene (purities ≥ 99%) were purchased from the CIRCA Group (Knoxfield Victoria, Australia). Commercial metal catalysts, including Raney Ni, Pd/C (5 and 10%), Ru/C (5%), Rh/C (5%), and Pt/C (3%), were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Formic acid (purity ≥ 98%), cyclohexane, dimethylacetamide (DMA), 1,4-dioxane, 2-propanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF) used in this study were analytical grade and purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The hydrogenation experiments of LGO or Cyrene were performed in a 30 mL autoclave fitted with a magnetic stir cane. Typically, 5 mL of THF, 230 mg of formic acid, 50 mg of the reagent and 50 mg of catalyst were charged into the reactor that was then heated in an isothermal oil bath with continuous stirring at 600 rpm. After a specific reaction time, the reaction was quenched by immersing the autoclave in an ice-water bath and the suspension was filtrated through a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter. The liquid product was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Shimadzu, LC-20 prominence) equipped with a photodiode array and a refractive index detector. A BioRad Aminex 87H column was used for the separation of LGO, Cyrene and Lgol under the following conditions: column temperature 35 °C, mobile phase 5 mM of sulfuric acid and flow rate 0.6 mL/min. Lgol was qualified using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS, PerkinElmer, Clarus SQ 8) that was equipped with a capillary column, TC-1701 (GL Sciences, 60 m length, 0.25 μm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness). Due to unavailable pure standards, Lgol was quantified using the calibration curves of Cyrene by assuming the equivalent sensitivity towards a refractive index detector. Conversion of LGO and yields of Cyrene and Lgol were calculated on a molar basis. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Rigaku TTR-III and a JEOL JEM-2100F mode, respectively. Brunaue-Emmet-Teller surface area (S BET) and total pore volume (V total) were calculated from nitrogen isotherm at −196 °C, which were measured on a Quantachrome, NOVA 3200e."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations Fig. 1 depicts N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for the catalysts used in this study and Table 1 summarized their texture characteristics in detail. All the carbon-supported catalysts exhibit a typical combination of type I and IV isotherm curves according to the IUPAC classification, a proof for microporous and mesoporous structures. The N2 adsorptions increased at P/P0 lower than 0.5, illustrating the presence of micropores. These isotherms have different hysteresis loops between 0.5 and 1.0, mainly caused by mesopores. The hysteresis loop of Pt/C is larger than the others, demonstrating that Pt/C contains more mesopores, which is consistent with the observation of pore size distribution. As seen in Fig. 2, Pt/C contains more mesopores in the range of 2–5 nm compared to the others. Metallic particle properties of the catalysts were analyzed by TEM analysis. Fig. 3 illustrates that the metals are highly dispersed. Based on the TEM images, the particle size distributions were obtained. In comparison to 5% Pd/C, 10% Pd/C showed a larger Pd size distribution in the range of 2.6–3.6 nm, suggesting that a higher metal dosage would lead to particle aggregation. After the hydrogenation of Cyrene, the reused 10% Pd/C presented larger particle size distribution in the range of 3.0–5.5 nm. Results from XRD analysis are depicted in Fig. 4 . The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 40, 47 and 67° for Pt/C and Pd/C are assigned to the (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (3 0 0) planes, respectively [38]. The peak of Rh/C and Ru/C at 2θ of 26° is associated with the activated carbon, while the Rh or Ru peak at 2θ around 40° is rather weak, indicating that the Rh or Ru metal is highly dispersed on the support [39]. As to the Raney Ni catalyst, the peaks at 2θ of 17, 26, 31, 45, 48 and 66° are ascribed to the Ni2Al3 phase, while the other relatively small peaks at 2θ in the range of 20–30° and 40–50° are due to the presence of NiAl3 phase [40,41]."
4,Solvent screening,"3.2 Solvent screening Six different solvents were screened for the hydrogenation of LGO at 60 °C by using 5% Pd/C and the results were listed in Table 2 . The reaction rate in a unit of mmol⋅g−1⋅h−1, indicating the average Cyrene formation rate, was calculated by the amount of product per that of the loaded catalyst per hour. The solvent polarity, or more exactly the dipole moment, may account for the apparent difference in the hydrogenation of LGO. The use of cyclohexane led to 7.7% yield of Cyrene while LGO conversion was as high as 92.4% (Entry 1), suggesting LGO is converted to other compounds that cannot be detected. A possible reason is the low solubility of LGO in the non-polar solvent (i.e., cyclohexane), resulting in serious polymerization. The use of DMA as a high-polarity solvent resulted in 25.8% LGO conversion while 25.3% Cyrene yield (Entry 9), and the selectivity to Cyrene was >99%, however the reaction rate is very slow, mainly due to its strong electron-donation property. The use of solvents with moderate polarity including 1,2-dioxane, THF, 2-propanol and water could greatly promote Cyrene formation. Both THF and 2-propanol promoted the formation of Cyrene at very short reaction times, attaining to 91.6% and 89.8% yield in merely 20 min, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report so far using formic acid as a hydrogen source for effective hydrogenation of LGO with substantial Cyrene yield. Cyrene yield could be further achieved in almost 100% with prolonged times (Entries 4 and 6). Nonetheless, decreasing the reaction temperature to 40 °C would significantly suppress LGO conversion (Entry 7), possibly because of the low hydrogen production. Considering the fact that the Cyrene yield over THF was slightly higher than that over 2-propanol, THF was chosen as the most suitable solvent for the following experiments."
5,Catalyst screening,"3.3 Catalyst screening Secondly, five different types of catalysts, including Raney Ni, Pd/C, Ru/C, Pt/C and Rh/C, were screened for the hydrogenation of LGO. Reactivities were tested at a temperature of 60 °C for 20 min using formic acid as the hydrogen source, and the results are displayed in Fig. 5 . The Pd/C catalyst led to a higher yield of Cyrene compared to Ru/C, Rh/C, and Raney Ni catalysts, which generally resulted in Cyrene yield in the range of 4.9–8.4%. It is worthwhile to mention that 5% Pd/C was sufficient for the conversion of LGO to Cyrene with 91.6% yield, further increasing the dosage of palladium to 10% led to complete hydrogenation of LGO into Cyrene. This result suggested that only Pd/C catalyst was effective to decompose formic acid into hydrogen, and eventually induced the selective hydrogenation of C=C bond of LGO. The reaction rates for LGO hydrogenation over 5% and 10% Pt/C are 429.4 and 234.3 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Taking the above observation into account, it was concluded that the 5% Pt/C catalyst was most suitable to hydrogenation of LGO to Cyrene."
6,Hydrogenation of LGO to Cyrene,"3.4 Hydrogenation of LGO to Cyrene Next, the LGO hydrogenation over 5% Pd/C was carried out with different reaction times at 60 °C. Fig. 6 describes the Cyrene yield as a function of reaction time. It can be seen that the reaction rate was fast at the beginning while decreased sharply with temporal evolution. Within the first hour, the LGO selectivity was in the range of 92–96%, suggesting that some intermediates, which are undetectable by GC/MS or HPLC, are formed during the hydrogenation. When the reaction was conducted at 40 °C, only 13.6% of Cyrene was observed after 4 h (Table 2, Entry 7). In contrast, Cyrene yield reached 91.6% at 60 °C in merely 20 min, further prolonging the reaction time to 2 h led to 100% yield of Cyrene. This suggests that the reaction temperature has a significant influence on the LGO hydrogenation rate, well in consistent with the following findings. Mazarío et al. [24] reported >90% of Cyrene was yielded from LGO at 80 °C within 30 min. On the other hand, Krishna et al. [19] described that around 80% conversion of LGO was hydrogenated to Cyrene in 100% selectivity at 40 °C after 8 h, and Clark et al. [18] obtained quantitative amount of Cyrene from hydrogenation of LGO at room temperature after 96 h. In addition, Hu et al. [32] investigated the behavior of formic acid decomposition into hydrogen over a Pd/C catalyst at temperatures between 21 and 60 °C. From their results, it can be safely concluded that the initial reaction rate of hydrogen production at 60 °C was much faster than that at 40 °C. After 4 h, the volume of hydrogen at 60 °C was around 1.5 times higher than that at 40 °C. On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that a higher temperature contributes to a higher reactivity of C=C bond of LGO."
7,Hydrogenation of Cyrene to lgol,"3.5 Hydrogenation of Cyrene to lgol Table 3 presents the reaction conditions and results of catalytic hydrogenation of Cyrene to Lgol. In general, a higher Lgol yield was obtained with longer reaction times and higher temperatures, indicating that selective hydrogenation of C=O bond is more difficult than that of C=C bond. This result was well in accord with a previous study [42], which reported that the C=O functional group was more difficult to be reduced than the C=C bond when hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexnone, in analogy with the functional group of LGO. The activation energy for hydrogenation of C=O bond in 2-cyclohexnone was 46 kJ/mol, compared to the activation energy of 21 kJ/mol for the ethylenic bond as a result of carbonyl group electron pairs [42]. Increasing the catalyst dosage significantly enhanced the conversion of Cyrene to Lgol (Entries 15–17). Lgol yield attained 94.8% when the reaction was conducted at 180 °C for 10 h. Nonetheless, increasing the reaction time could accelerate the loss of catalytic activity, which could be attributed to the catalyst degradation by in situ generated CO from formic acid. Catalyst reutilization (Entries 18 and 19) also revealed that the 10% Pd/C catalyst was deactivated. It was reported that formation of CO was favored in the aqueous solution of formic acid over a Ag–Pd core-shell nanocatalyst when the temperature was higher than 70 °C [29]. In this experiment, the reaction was conducted at 180 °C due to the lower efficiency on Cyrene hydrogenation at lower temperatures, and therefore, there must be the CO formation during formic acid decomposition. In fact, we analyzed the gas composition in the headspace of the autoclave by GC, and found the presence of CO which in turn proved the degradation of the Pd/C catalyst, as evidenced by the aggregated Pd particles after reutilization by TEM analysis (Fig. 3). In order to provent the catalyst deactivation with CO, a reflux reactor was used to remove CO during LGO hydrogenation. In an open flask, Mitra et al. [37] illustrated that the decarbonylation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to furfuryl alcohol with a Pd/C catalyst using 1,4-dioxane as the solvent was more efficient compared to a closed reactor. Contrariwise, in contrast to the experiments conducted in the sealed reactor, almost no Lgol was formed in an open flask (Entries 20 and 21), indicating that the hydrogen produced from formic acid was evaporated to ambient atmosphere without sufficiently contacting catalyst and reagents, thus resulting in almost no hydrogenation of Cyrene. It is also believed that the Pd/C catalyst underwent deactivation by adsorption of other formic acid decomposition products. Hu et al. [32] claimed that the deactivation of the Pd/C catalyst could be attributed to the occupation of active sites by protons, CO2, CO, and HCOO− intermediate. They assumed formic acid de-protonation into HCOO− as the key deactivation step owing to its low energy barrier."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated a novel pathway for the hydrogenation of LGO by using formic acid as the hydrogen source. Among the tested solvents and catalysts, THF had the highest reaction rate of 429.4 mmol g−1 h−1 and only Pd/C effectively hydrogenated LGO to Cyrene with >99% yield even at a low reaction temperature (60 °C) with a short reaction time (20 min). Nonetheless, owing to the inherent property of C=O of Cyrene, hydrogenation of that to corresponding −OH group requires a harsh condition. Ramping the reaction temperature to 180 °C and increasing double Pd dosage were effective to hydrogenate the C=O of Cyrene, resulting in the formation of Lgol with 94.8% yield in the presence of formic acid. Our results provide a potential application of LGO for the production of value-added chemicals, such as Cyrene and Lgol, which may contribute to the grand challenges for sustainability in bio-based chemistry, fuel and chemical engineering."
