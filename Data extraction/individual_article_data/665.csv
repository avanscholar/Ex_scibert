0,Introduction,"Solar water splitting can be considered as one of the most favorable approaches for sustainable energy development as it solves the environmental concerns and provides a renewable and clean energy source for hydrogen production [1–3]. In the last decades, tremendous investigations had been devoted to enhancing the efficiency of various photocatalysts such as TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, etc. [1–5]. Among them, TiO2 nanoparticles have become a commonly tracked research hotspot for the photochemical and the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction as well as solar cells due to their excellent photocorrosion resistance, abundance, low cost, non-toxicity, chemical stability, reasonable diffusion length, and rapid charge transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers [6–10]. However, anatase TiO2 has two major drawbacks; its wide bandgap energy (3.2 eV) that limits its photocatalytic applications only to the UV irradiation and its rapid e-h recombination rate that hinders its photocatalytic activity [11,12]. To this end, the exposed facets on the TiO2 surface affect the photocatalytic behavior of the material. Usually, the {101} facet is the exposed one for anatase crystals due to its lower average surface energy (0.4 J/m2) than the {001} facet (0.9 J/m2) [13]. However, {001} facet is the most catalytically active facet; thus, many efforts were devoted towards the fabrication of TiO2 nanocrystals with predominant {001} surface facet via the utilization of capping agents and modifying the surface chemical characteristics [14]. According to the findings of density functional theory (DFT), Zheng et al. concluded that the coexistence of the {001} and{101} facets could achieve a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 by facilitating charge separation among the various facets [15]. In general, the improved performance of single-component photocatalysts could be accomplished by the control of the morphology and the facet-engineering strategies. In this regard, mesocrystals are an innovative class of superstructures composed of highly ordered nanoparticles that can act as intermediates in the process of particle aggregation [16–21]. Their unique superstructure, high crystallinity, and high internal porosity could enhance the charge separation and enlarge the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers [19]. This may be attributed to a large number of interfacial defects at the inter-grains as well as the high available surface area that afford more active sites and allow high exposure of the active facets that enhance the reaction kinetics. Consequently, several mesocrystals have been synthesized, such as TiO2, ZnO, WO3, CuO, SrTiO3, Ta2O5, BaZrO3, and In2O3-x(OH)y, which revealed interesting performance [22–28], making them promising candidates for many applications such as photocatalysis [29–36], electrocatalysis [30], optoelectronics [37], Li-ion batteries [38], and biomedical applications TiO2 mesocrystals show higher photocatalytic performance during organic degradation and hydrogen production. NH4TiOF3 is typically used as a precursor to synthesize TiO2 mesocrystals through topotactic transformation, which release N, F, and H as possible dopants during the transformation process [39]. To date, several groups have used various surfactants, organic additives, or hydrofluoric acid as structure-directing agents under different conditions to control the morphology of TiO2 mesocrystals [40]. It is proposed that doping TiO2 with F atoms creats Ti3+ via charge compensation, which diminishes the e−/h+ recombination rate and improves the photocatalytic activity [41]. Yu et al. successfully synthesized superstructure Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals via facile vapor hydrolysis, which exhibited high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production [42]. The fabrication of carbon self-doped TiO2 is rearly reported. Park, Luna, and Gorska synthesized C self-doped TiO2 via hydrolysis of titanium butoxide and titanium (IV) isopropoxide, respectively [43–45]. However, there are no reports on the use of C self-doped TiO2 for solar-assisted water splitting. Moreover, multi-metal/non-metal doping of TiO2 with N, C, and Fe or Co, Cu, Ni, and Ti3+ showed synergy in enhancing the optical activity [46–52] and photocatalytic performance [53,54] by balancing the deficiencies of individual dopants. To this end, it is extremely essential that the doping occurs in-situ during synthesis to avoid any structural flaws. For water splitting application, CoOx and NiOx were shown to be very efficient cocatalysts that assist the photoconversion of H2O molecules into O2 and H2 by minimizing the reaction overpotential, enhancing charge separation, narrowing the bandgap, providing more active catalytic sites, and increasing of the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers [46,47]. Therefore, the photocatalytic efficiency of the multi-doped TiO2 nanoparticles outperforms that of singly and doubly doped counterparts [48–50]. However, the basis of the observed improved photocatalytic performance is not thoroughly explained in the literature. Moreover, the multi-step synthesis processes used have many disadvantages such as the usage of organic solvents, high cost, low yield, etc., that limit the practical applications of TiO2. In this regard, finding a facile method to synthesize multi-doped TiO2 mesocrystals remains a challenge despite the urgent necessity for it. Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the prospect to synthesize multi-dopant (Co, Ti3+, and C) TiO2 mesocrystals via a facile combined in-situ sol-gel method and topotactic transformation. The morphology, composition, structure, and optical characteristics of the as-synthesized mesocrystals were investigated and discussed. Moreover, thin-films of the as-synthesized TiO2 mesocrystals were drop-casted on FTO to study their photocatalytic performance as visible-light-driven photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells. Besides, the photocatalytic efficiency of the as-fabricated mesocrystals in the photochemical production of hydrogen was estimated under AM1.5 conditions without using any hole scavengers. Finally, the mechanism of the unprecedented superior enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized multi-doped TiO2 mesocrsytals was suggested."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Titanium n-propoxide (Ti(O-n-Pr)4, 98%), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2.6H2O), formamide (FA: H2N–CHO), hydrofluoric acid (HF 40%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glass slides coated by fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) (thickness = 0.22 cm and sheet resistance = 7 Ω/cm2) were purchased from Solaronix. All the other chemicals employed in the experimental work were of pure grade and used as received without extra purification. The solutions were prepared using distilled water (DW)."
3,Synthesis of TiO2 mesocrystals,"2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 mesocrystals The proposed TiO2 mesocrystals were obtained via a facile one-pot synthesis route, inspired by the work reported by Hegazy and Prouzet [56]. Typically, 3 mL of HF was added dropwise to 4.84 mL of Ti(O-n-Pr)4 with vigorous stirring in an ice-bath. Then, 5.2 mL of a solution of FA in DW (86%, v/v) were added dropwise to the previous solution, which was left for 2 h at room-temperature (~25 °C). The resulting gel was dried at 100 °C for 4 h then calcined in air at 400 °C for 4 h. This powder sample is denoted as “C/Ti 3+ -TiO 2 mesocrystals”. The Co-doped TiO2 mesocrystals were fabricated according to the same procedure by dissolving 0.5 g (Co(NO3)2) in the FA/DW mixture. This powder sample was denoted as “Co-doped C/Ti 3+ -TiO 2 mesocrystals”. These powders were used for the physicochemical characterization and photochemical (PC) hydrogen production tests. However, thin-films of the as-synthesized mesocrystals were fabricated to assess the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. These thin-films were fabricated via the drop-casting technique. Typically, a homogenous suspension of the TiO2 mesocrystals’ powder was mixed with 1% Nafion/isopropanol solution. Then, this suspension was drop-casted on FTO glass slides (1 cm × 1 cm × 0.22 cm, 7Ω) and dried at 60 °C."
4,Physicochemical characterization,"2.3 Physicochemical characterization The nanostructure of the mesocrystals was investigated via JOEL JEM-2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The crystalline characteristics of the synthesized mesocrystals were investigated via PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα source (λ = 0.15418 nm, 2θ range = 5°-80°, step size = 0.04°, and time of scan step = 0.5s). The Raman spectra were measured using a ProRaman-L Analyzer Raman microscope with λexcitation= 532 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured in the range of 400–4000 cm-1 by Thermo-Scientific Nicolet 380 spectrophotometer. The surface elemental composition and the chemical states were elucidated using Thermo-Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the samples were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer. Besides, the emission behavior of the mesocrystals was investigated by the photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded using Thermo-Scientific LUMINA fluorescence spectrometer. Finally, the electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed via Bruker BioSpinGmbH EMX 300 EPR spectrometer."
5,Photoelectrochemical setup,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical setup The photoelectrochemical behavior of the as-synthesized TiO2 mesocrystals’ thin-films was assessed by a three-electrode setup in an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH where the thin film of TiO2 mesocrystals drop-casted on FTO act as the working electrode, the Ag/AgCl was the reference electrode, and a platinum sheet was the counter electrode. Bio-Logic SP 200 potentiostat was employed to record the current in the dark and photocurrents where the scan rate was adjusted at 0.05 V/s and the applied bias supplied to the anode was in the range from −1 to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A 300 W Ozone-free Xenon lamp equipped by AM 1.5 G filter with an intensity of 100 mW/cm2 was employed as a simulator of the sunlight."
6,Photochemical hydrogen production setup,"2.5 Photochemical hydrogen production setup The photocatalytic efficiency of the fabricated mesocrystals in the powder form toward photochemical hydrogen production was investigated. Typically, an inner-irradiation system was employed as the photochemical reactor; the system was composed of a light source (CEL HUL300 Xenon lamp, 300 W), a recirculation pump, a water-cooled condenser, a gas collector, and a vacuum pump. It is important to mention that a tubular jacket made of Pyrex was employed to circulate the cooling water around the Xenon lamp to retain the reaction temperature during the irradiation. A proper amount of the as-fabricated mesocrystals (100 mg) was suspended in DW via ultra-sonication. In the course of the irradiation, the system was retained sealed, and the evolution of H2 and O2 gases were measured via an online GC 7900 gas chromatograph, which is equipped by high-purity nitrogen gas as the mobile phase, Porapak-Q column as the stationary phase, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) [57]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical characterizations,"3.1 Physicochemical characterizations The structures and morphologies of the as-synthesized mesocrystals were examined by the HR-TEM images. Fig. 1 a–d depicts the typical HR-TEM images of as-synthesized undoped and Co-doped TiO2 mesocrystals, confirming that the square surfaces are the {001} facets of the single-crystalline anatase TiO2, and after doping with cobalt, the same morphology is retained. As demonstrated in the upper inset of Fig. 1a, C/Ti3+-TiO2 shows that the lattice fringes exhibited a spacing of 0.16 nm corresponding to the characteristic d-spacing of the (101) plane of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 phase [58]. The related selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern captured at a single square demonstrates the single diffraction spots, which are characteristics of the single-crystal structure and indexed to the [010] zone axis of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 phase (inset of Fig. 1b). The observed carbon residue is believed to be formed inside the TiO2 lattice while the calcination temperature up to 400 °C is only outlying surface carbon [59]. In addition, the observed carbon residue exists as a carbon shell as proved via the HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d, where TiO2 and carbon were recognized from the electron diffraction and the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Fig. S1). The carbon was found to be remarkably uniform, continuous, and transparent. Besides, it is significant to state that the layer of the carbon surrounds the TiO2 crystals with no large carbon aggregates, which is advantageous for the high ionic and electronic conductivity [60,61]. Moreover, the chemical state of observed carbon is elucidated by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of the carbon layer (insets of Fig. 1c and d) showed characteristic peaks at 1400 cm−1 and 1290 cm−1, which are related to CH species in aliphatic hydrocarbon chains [62]. Thus, these findings proposed the success of the facile template-free sol-gel method to fabricate stable {001} facets of anatase TiO2 mesocrystals. Fig. 2 a displays the powder XRD patterns of both C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2, where the intense sharp XRD peaks reflect the good crystallinity of the as-synthesized mesocrystals. Note that both samples consist only of a well-crystallized tetragonal TiO2 anatase phase with a space group I41/amd (PDF: 04-014-5762). It is essential to mention that the peaks recorded at 37.89o reveal the formation of {001} facet, which is the most catalytically active facet of TiO2. The {001} facet may be formed due to the HF, which can act as a structure-directing agent. Unlikely, no secondary phases corresponding to cobalt were recorded with no observable phases of cobalt oxide in Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2, which may be ascribed to the used small percentage of cobalt that is below the detection limit [63]. Meanwhile, the predominant diffraction peak of (1 0 1) is shifted to the lower angle side for the Co-doped sample, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2a, suggesting a change in the local structure around Ti4+ after Co doping [64]. The crystallite size (D) of C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 was found to be 69 and 55 nm, respectively, as estimated from the Scherrer formula (Eq. (1)). (1) D = kλ β cosθ where k is the particle shape factor (k= 0.9), λ is the wavelength of the x-ray (λ= 0.11540598 nm), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (101) peak, and θ is Bragg angle (in radians). Moreover, the incorporation of Co as a dopant may promote the generation of vacant oxygen sites, Ti interstitials, and Ti vacancies to retain the charge neutrality [64,65]. As vacancies at the surface may disturb the lattice structure and affect the crystallinity, we calculated the lattice constants (a and c) for both samples using Eq. (2). (2) 1 d 2 = h 2 + k 2 a 2 + l 2 c 2 It was found that the lattice constant “a” increased from 3.78 to 3.79 Å, and consequently, the cell volume has been increased from 135.66 to 136.62 Å 3 for the C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2, respectively. Raman spectroscopy is an effective technique to assess the significant structural modifications in TiO2 mesocrystals and induced disorders due to the incorporation of dopant. The Raman spectra displayed in Fig. 2b show six (3 Eg + 2B1g + A1g) Raman-active fundamental vibrational modes, characteristic of the TiO2 anatase phase [66]. Although the peaks centered around 144 cm-1 (Eg1), 196 cm-1 (Eg2), and 632 cm-1 (Eg3) are related to the O–Ti–O symmetric stretching vibration, the two B1g modes (B1g1 at 392 and B1g2 at 511 cm-1) are related to the O–Ti–O symmetric bending vibration, and the A1g mode at 512 cm-1 corresponds to the O–Ti–O anti-symmetric bending vibration [64,67]. For the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 sample, no bands corresponding to cobalt oxide were detected, possibly due to the small Co loadings in TiO2 lattice [68]. However, as the ionic size of Co2+ (0.70 Å) is greater than the ionic size of Ti4+ (0.64 Å), the incorporation of Co as a dopant should cause distortion in the lattice structure and establishment of oxygen vacancies [69]. To this end, the main peaks at 144 cm-1 (Eg1) and 196 cm-1 (Eg2) are blue-shifted to 146 and 200 cm-1, while the peak at 632 cm-1 (Eg3) is red-shifted to 629 cm-1 compared with the spectra of the C/Ti3+-TiO2. Note also that the B1g and A1g peaks are blue-shifted to 390 and 508 cm-1, respectively. The observed blue and red shifts may reveal the construction of new bonds such as Co–O–Ti or Co–O–Co [70] and/or the existence of oxygen-deficient TiO2 lattice [71]. Moreover, the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in metal oxides has been the subject of greater interest, as it is one of the most crucial physical parameters for understanding the charge transfer properties, phonon dynamics, and the presence of structural defects in the crystal lattice [72]. Lazzeri et al. reported the relation between electron-phonon coupling and the phonon linewidth (FWHM of peak), where the resulted strain in doped semiconductors changes the shape and linewidth of the Raman peaks [73]. The phonon lifetime (τ) is calculated from the Lorentzian-fitted phonon modes and estimated from the Raman spectra through the relation of energy-time uncertainty (Eq. (3)) [74]: (3) 1/ τ = ΔE/h = 2πcr Where ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the phonon mode, h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10-34 J s), c is the light speed (3 × 108 m/s), and r is the FWHM of the Raman peak in cm-1. It was found that the phonon lifetime decreased from 2.49 to 1.97 ps upon cobalt doping. The decrease in phonon lifetime is related to the high electron-phonon coupling, which makes these mesocrystals as potential candidates for various optoelectronic applications. Fig. 3 depicts the FTIR spectra of the synthesized C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals. The peaks positioned at 3847, 3837, and 3800 cm−1 are ascribed to either surface or bulk Ti3+ [75], which are formed during the synthesis stage, while the peak positioned at 3673 cm−1 (enlarged FTIR) is corresponding to the bulk Ti4+. This observation basically explains the crucial role of F− ions in the establishment of Ti3+ defects due to the incorporation of substitutional or interstitial fluorine in the as-synthesized mesocrystals; this re-confirmed the vital role of HF as a structural directing reagent. Note that the establishment of suitable Ti3+ centers will affect the optoelectronic properties as well as the photocatalytic performance of the prepared materials. Additionally, the peaks at 3435 and 3750 cm-1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of O–H in the chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, while the peak at 2082 cm-1 arises due to the Ti–O–C vibration, which confirms the efficient interaction between C and Ti. Moreover, the peak at 1643 cm-1 is a typical band for the bending mode of water [70]. Furthermore, the peak located around 1427 cm-1 is to be expected because of the vibrations of the Ti–O on the {001} facets [76], in a good accordance with the obtained XRD findings displayed in Fig. 2a. Also, the peak at 1024 cm-1 could be ascribed to the Ti–F vibrations in both samples. Moreover, the formation of TiO2 mesocrystals is confirmed via the Ti–O–Ti bridging and the Ti–O stretching between 460 and 521 cm−1. Thus, the FTIR technique could be utilized as a powerful means to elucidate the existence of Ti3+ ions in the as-synthesized TiO2 mesocrystals, but could not specify whether it is surface or bulk Ti3+ ion. To investigate the composition and the chemical states of the elements at the mesocrystals surface of C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2, XPS characterization was conducted as displayed in Fig. 4 . The XPS survey scan (Fig. 4a) clearly shows emission lines for Ti, C, O, and F elements in both samples, in addition to a Co emission line for the Co-doped sample. The high-resolution XPS spectra (HR-XPS) of Ti 2p were measured to assess the chemical states of Ti and to get more perceptions into the formation of Ti3+ in both samples. As demonstrated in Fig. 4b for both samples, the Ti 2p3/2 spectrum is located at 459.1 eV for C/Ti3+ TiO2 and 458.4 eV for Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2, which corresponds to Ti4+, whereas the binding energies at 464.7 and 464.14 eV and the ΔE value between Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 was 5.6 and 5.74 eV for the C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2, respectively, indicating that Ti4+ is present in the prepared mesocrystals [77,78]. Note that no detectable Ti3+ was observed for both samples, as proved by the lack of the characteristic shoulder peaks of Ti3+ at 462.5 eV and 456.8 eV [79]. This may be ascribed to the fact that Ti3+ is simply oxidized via the air or the dissolved oxygen in water, and therefore, the surface Ti3+ may rapidly disappear [80]. Fig. 4c depicts the O1s HR-XPS, which are consisted of two-component peaks at 530.26 and 532.17 eV for the C/Ti3+-TiO2 sample, and at 529.78 and 531.4 eV for the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 sample. The main peaks at 530.26 and 529.78 eV are ascribed to the structural positions of oxygen in the TiO2 lattice [81]; the other peaks at 532.17 and 530.26 eV are corresponding to the hydroxyl OH-groups sited on the mesocrystals surface. In addition to this, the other additional oxygen peak in the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 (530.3 eV) is characteristic of Co−O bond [82]. Fig. 4d demonstrates the F 1s HR-XPS spectra, where the peaks at 685.34 eV and 684.81 for the C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals are characteristic of Ti–F species constructed by the ligand exchange between the surface OH groups and F [14,83], suggesting that the fluorine adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (i.e., surface fluorination; terminal T–F bond) [84]. The existence of carbon could be ascribed to the incomplete combustion of the organic species in the titanium precursor. The C 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks for the C/Ti3+ TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals, as demonstrated in Fig. 4e [85]. Accordingly, the peaks positioned at 284.65 and 284.56 eV are close to the C–C bond, while the peaks located at 285.91 and 286.39 eV can be related to C–O bond, and the peaks positioned at 288.67 and 288.42 eV could be the characteristic ones of the CO bond [86]. The existence of the carbonate-like species, CO and C–O bonds, were originated from substitutional and/or interstitial C doping in TiO2 lattice [87,88]. The appearance of these peaks indicates that C was self-doped into TiO2 lattice at substitutional and/or interstitial sites [89]. Finally, the Co 2p spectra were recorded as displayed in Fig. 4f. The peaks positioned at 781.8 and 796.42 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, with a spin-orbit splitting of 14.62 eV, revealing the existence of Co2+ species. It is essential to mention that all the positions of the binding energies of all elements Ti, C, F, and O in the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 sample show a slight red shift to lower values compared to those for the C/Ti3+-TiO2 sample as displayed in the XPS spectra (Fig. 4a–e), which can be ascribed to the higher electronegativity of Co than that of Ti [6]. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a potent and sensitive tool to investigate the existence of Ti3+ defects and the oxygen vacancies that significantly affected the photocatalytic behavior of the TiO2 [90]. In our investigations, the recorded ESR spectra were depicted in Fig. 5 under darkness at room temperature; both samples displayed signals at g= 1.95, indicating the existence of Ti3+ species [91]. Also, the ESR results demonstrated that oxygen vacancies (oxygen radical species) such as OH . , O .- or O2.–, coexist with Ti3+ species and their signals appeared at g = 2.157, g = 2.05, and g= 2.12 [90,92]. Besides, Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2 sample has a higher content of paramagnetic centers of 5.11682 × 1019 spin/g compared to the sample without cobalt doping (Ti3+ TiO2) sample, which has 4.09473 × 1018 spin/g. Such growth in the concentration of the paramagnetic centers with cobalt doping can be attributed to the increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancy species in the distorted TiO6 octahedron [65,93], which suggests that incorporation of Co into TiO2 lattice would boost the creation of oxygen vacancies [94] which proved previously by XRD and PL techniques. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were assessed to elucidate the characteristic optical absorption of the as-fabricated TiO2 mesocrystals. Both C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 exhibit visible absorption in the wavelength range of 400-600 nm, Fig. S2. The yellow color of C/Ti3+-TiO2 and the noticeable absorption tail in the visible region are usually good indicators for the formation of Ti3+, in a good agreement with the FTIR findings [95]. Note that the C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals displayed an absorption edge at 418 nm that exhibited a red shift from when compared to that of the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles [96]. The Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals displayed an absorption edge at 436 nm, which exhibited a red-shift when compared to that of the C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals (418 nm). Tauc plots established on the Kubelka-Munk function vs. the incident light energy for the as-synthesized TiO2 mesocrystals are illustrated in Fig. 6 a. The estimated values of the bandgap energy of the C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO samples are 2.75 and 2.6 eV, respectively. The red-shifted absorption edge and the bandgap narrowing could be accredited to the Co2+ → Ti4+ charge-transfer interaction [55]. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy is an effective and potent technique employed in the disclose of the activity of photoinduced charge carriers, oxygen vacancies, lattice defects, diffusion, recombination, and charge trapping [97]. Lattice and surface defects, such as the oxygen vacancies and the surface states, could show essential roles in modifying the electronic band structure, and consequently would significantly affect the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated mesocrystals [98]. Fig. 6b illustrates the PL spectra of the fabricated C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals at room-temperature, revealing various emission peaks. The weak UV shoulder at 396 nm (peak I) and the small violet peak at 423 nm (peak II) are characteristic of the bandgap transition in anatase TiO2, which arises from recombination at dopant levels or sub-band gaps induced by self-doped C and oxygen vacancies [89,98]. The other three peaks at 441, 453, and 469 nm (peak III to V) are ascribed to the self-trapped excitons localized on TiO6 octahedron, band-edge free excitons, and to oxygen vacancy or Ti3+ defects, respectively. Moreover, the VI and VII peaks located at 481 and 491 nm originate from bound excitons [99]. The peak around 530 nm (peak VIII) may result from F+ centers and structural defects such as the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 mesocrystals. Some other small PL peaks that appeared in the green region (530–680 nm) may mainly originate from electron transfer from the F+ centers to energy levels that is above the valence band level of TiO2 mesocrystals [90]. Also, the peak at 680 nm (peak IX) indicates a defect-related oxygen vacancy in TiO2. In addition, the peak near-infrared at 825 nm (peak X) is assumed to result from the recombination from Ti3+ defect state to the VB [100], which is in accordance with the FTIR and DRS results. Furthermore, the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals exhibited a remarkable drop in the intensity of the PL peaks, when compared to those of the C/Ti3+-TiO2 counterpart, which indicates a reduced rate of recombination of charge carriers. These findings suggest that the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals will exhibit higher photocatalytic performance than the C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals."
9,Photoelectrochemical characterization,"3.2 Photoelectrochemical characterization To investigate the photoelectrochemical performance of the as-fabricated TiO2 mesocrystals under AM1.5 sun-simulated illuminations, the J–V plots were recorded in 1 M KOH, Fig. 7 a. The Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 electrode showed superior photocurrent density (25 mA cm-2 at 1 VAgAgCl) that is 6 times higher than that recorded for the undoped electrode (4.4 mA cm-2), in turn much greater than the reported findings for the pristine TiO2 photoanodes [6]. The very high photocurrent density of the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 electrodes indicates the positive effect of Co doping that might induce shallow impurity states, which reduce the recombination of the photoinduced charge carriers [101] as suggested by the PL findings. To confirm this, Mott-Schottky analysis of the recorded electrochemical impedance spectra was performed to estimate the density of charge carriers (ND) as well as the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the as-constructed photoanodes, according to Eq. (4). (4) 1 C S C 2 = 2 e N D ε ε │ V A p p l i e d − V f b │ − k T e where C sc is the capacitance of the space charge (C), and VApplied is the applied potential bias (V). Fig. 7b illustrates the Mott-Schottky plots obtained at 30 kHz for the undoped and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 samples; both samples displayed a positive slope, which is characteristic of n-type semiconductors [102]. The Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 electrode shows a more negative flat band potential (Vfb) compared to the C/Ti3+-TiO2 counterpart electrode. This can be ascribed to reduction of the Fermi level pinning allowing it to move closer to the CBM, revealing sufficient depletion region that ensures good charge separation [102,103]. Besides, the donor density (ND) of the Co-doped electrode is almost twice that of the undoped electrode, in good agreement with the obtained photocurrent and the PL measurements, see Table 1 ."
10,Photochemical hydrogen production,"3.3 Photochemical hydrogen production The photocatalytic efficiency of the fabricated mesocrystals was investigated toward the water splitting under UV, AM 1.5, and visible irradiation conditions as demonstrated in Fig. 8 a. The rates of hydrogen production and oxygen evolution were observed in the following order: UV > AM 1.5 > Visible, which is logical due to the highly energetic UV photons when compared to the visible light [57]. Fig. 8b illustrates the quantity of the produced hydrogen in μmol per gram using as-synthesized Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals. After 6 h of illumination, ca. 22.27 mL of H2 were collected without using any sacrificial agents or hole scavengers. Note that the as-synthesized Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals retain their photocatalytic performance over three consecutive cycles, signifying their perfect stability, good durability, and long-term photocatalytic action. The long-term stability revelaed the absence of any poisoning species that could affect the catalyst active sites. The rate of the photocatalytic H2 production of the fabricated Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals was found to be 1653 μmol/h/g as calculated from the slope of the curve displayed in Fig. 8 according to Eq. (5) [57]: (5) H 2 production rate mol/h/g = + d amount of H 2 produced μmol / g dt h Table 2 compares the rates of the photocatalytic hydrogen production of various mesocrystal photocatalysts. Obviously, our as-synthesized Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals showed unprecedented photocatalytic hydrogen production rate under AM1.5 conditions without the utilization of any sacrificial agents or hole scavengers."
11,Mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance,"3.4 Mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance Based on all the above results, we demonstrate a possible mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the as-fabricated C/Ti3+-TiO2 and Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 photoanodes towards the photoelectrochemical and photochemical water splitting, as displayed in Fig. 9 . As observed, Ti3+ and C co-doping contributed to the enhancement of absorption in the visible region and a reduction in the bandgap, as suggested by the DRS findings and the Tauc plot results. Note that Ti3+ doping provides extra energy level (0.31 eV) that enhances the separation of charge carriers [107]. Besides, non-metal doping such as C doping could provide an alternative energy level above the valence band maximum (VBM) of TiO2 by hybridizing C 1s with the O 2p orbilas (VBM) of TiO2, resulting in a narrowing of the bandgap of the C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals (2.75 eV) when compared to that of pure anatase TiO2 (3.20 eV). In addition, carbon doping could enhance the conductivity of the as-synthesized mesocrystals. Meanwhile, in the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals, Co doping levels were introduced as CoO with a bandgap energy of 2.60 eV, which composes a type II heterojunction with TiO2 [108]. Typically, the electrons could spontaneously transfer from the CBM of CoO (−1.00 eV) to the CBM of TiO2 (−0.29 eV), leading to an enhancement of the charge separation and consequently the reduction of e-h recombination as confirmed by the PL findings. Additionally, the charge separation was further enhanced through the further transfer electrons to the Ti3+ energy level and the movement of the h+ from the VBM to the C energy level. Thus, the outstanding photochemical and photoelectrochemical performance of the as-synthesized Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals could be attributed in the synergetic enhancement in the charge separation based on the introduction of multi-doping energy levels. These mixed valence/conduction bands with Co doping levels facilitated the mobility of charge carriers. After light irradiation, the holes (h+) are produced at the VB and could quickly oxidize water. At the same time, the photoexcited electrons (e−) transferred to the cathode (Pt) and could effectively of reduction of H+ to H2, consequently enhancing the photocurrent and reducing the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs as suggested from the PL findings. This proposed mechanism interprets the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the fabricated Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2 mesocrystals toward both photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting based on the synergetic action of the multi-dopants of Co, Ti3+, and C on the TiO2 characteristics and photochemical performance which promote their promising performance in other photocatalytic applications."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, novel multi-doped TiO2 mesocrystals have been successfully fabricated by the sol-gel method, followed by topotactic transformations. Raman and XRD analyses suggested the presence of single-phase anatase TiO2 in a strained lattice structure upon doping with cobalt. The Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2 mesocrystals had a square shape, similar to C/Ti3+ TiO2. Through the addition of cobalt, the bandgap change was related to the Co2+ → Ti4+ charge-transfer interaction and the disordered TiO2 lattice as the trapping sites, which are capable of reducing the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Consequently, Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals provide excellent performance for solar fuel production. The optimized photocurrent density of the Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 under simulated solar irradiation are estimated to be 25 mA/cm2, which are the highest values ever reported for doped TiO2 photoelectrodes. Meanwhile, cobalt doping into the crystal lattice of TiO2 possibly exhibiting excellent electron transport, thus enhancing the photoinduced charge transport from the bulk to the surface of TiO2 with a high electron carrier density of 32.05 × 1024 cm-3 as evidenced via the negative flat band potential. The fabricated Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals showed unprecedented photochemical hydrogen production rate under AM 1.5 without any hole scavengers or sacrificial agents when compared to the other similar titanium-based mesocrystals. In addition, the mechanism of the enhanced synergetic photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized Co-doped C/Ti3+-TiO2 toward both photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting was proposed and attributed to the synergetic action of the multi-dopants of Co, Ti3+, and C."
