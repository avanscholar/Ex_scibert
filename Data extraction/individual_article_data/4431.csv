0,Introduction,"Diesel engine is a popular prime mover in transportation and agricultural sectors due to its high torque capacity, better fuel economy and low maintenance cost, compared to gasoline engine [1]. The rapid depletion of petroleum reserves, fluctuating price of crude oil, environmental concerns and target-based emission reduction to reach stringent EURO emission norms desired by various countries, all these factors demand an alternative, affordable and easily available source of fuel to replace diesel in a CI engine [2]. Among the various alternative fuels proposed for a diesel engine, biomass derived fuels (straight vegetable oil) have gained much attention particularly because they can be utilized directly without modifying the existing engine structure [3]. These fuels can address the energy crisis and also reduce the harmful effects to the environment. Additionally, they reduce the dependency on petroleum-based fuel. However, a single type of fuel cannot fully match the performance of a diesel engine and hence a number of new varieties of blended fuels were explored and their feasibility in the diesel engine was studied in a few review articles [4,5]. Straight vegetable oil possesses high viscosity and poor volatility which affect the fuel atomization process and subsequent fuel-air mixing. Therefore, direct use of vegetable oil in a CI engine leads to poor combustion along with long-term problems like piston ring sticking and injector clogging [6]. This study uses Simarouba glauca (paradise oil) seed oil as the straight vegetable oil. The plant grows widely across South America, Central America and India. Its seed contain 55–65% oil content. The oil has many industrial uses and it can also be turned into fat or margarine [7]. About 200 trees can be grown in one hectare of land which gives 6000 kg of seeds that provides around a ton of oil. It was introduced to India in 1961, from El Salvador. It can adapt to diverse soil and climate conditions and it is also drought tolerant [8]. Its major fatty acid composition is 52–54% oleic acid, 27–33% stearic acid and 11–12% palmitic acid [9]. A few studies exist on the use of transesterified paradise oil as a fuel for diesel engines. Devan et al. [10] tested the biodiesel blends with diesel in a single cylinder CI engine. They pointed out that while the brake thermal efficiency of biodiesel and its blends with diesel is lower compared to diesel. They also observed that biodiesel reduced HC, CO and smoke emissions significantly with a penalty of higher NOx emission. To improve the performance of paradise oil, Devan et al. [11] blended eucalyptus oil in various proportions and tested it in a CI engine. They observed that low viscosity and better volatility of eucalyptus oil improved the performance of paradise oil biodiesel in the CI engine. This also reduced HC, CO and smoke emissions further. On the contrary, NOx emissions increased further due to improved combustion. Bedar et al. [12] tested Simarouba glauca biodiesel blends with diesel, with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to reduce NOx emissions. They observed that EGR did not affect the performance much and this combination aided in reduced particulate and NOx emissions."
1,Research justification,"1.1 Research justification Numerous methods were proposed by Martin et al. [13] to improve the performance of a diesel engine using straight vegetable oil. Among them, blending with diesel and oxygenate, namely alcohol addition to form a ternary blend is selected and explored in this study. Among the various alcohols, higher order alcohols (based on carbon content) are gaining much attention due to their higher cetane number and calorific value compared to lower order alcohols like methanol and ethanol for CI engines. Another major classification of alcohol is based on the position of the OH (hydroxyl) group in their molecular structure, namely aliphatic and aromatic. In aliphatic alcohol, OH group is bonded to saturated carbon atom and generally, its structure is a straight chain. Aromatic alcohol, on the other hand, has the OH group bonded to aromatic benzene ring (aromatic carbon atom). Aliphatic alcohol, namely 1-pentanol is taken for this study; 1-pentanol has five carbon atoms and is classified as a higher order alcohol. 1-Pentanol requires less energy input for production compared to other higher alcohols [14]. The improved blend stability with higher calorific value and cetane number of 1-pentanol extends its application as fuel [15]. While the current method of production is from fossil fuel, researchers are working on the production of 1-pentanol from fermentation process to achieve yet another renewable fuel [16]. Investigation/Analysis of 1-pentanol as fuel with diesel, biodiesel and its blends in CI engine has been undertaken by various researchers [17–23]. Yilmaz and Atmanli [17] blended 1-pentanol with diesel at various blend ratios to determine the engine characteristics at different load conditions. 1-Pentanol was added 5, 10, 20, 25 and 35% by volume with diesel and all the blends were tested in the CI engine. They noted that low calorific value and cetane number of 1-pentanol reduced the brake thermal efficiency with higher fuel consumption. However, due to the high latent heat of vaporization, NOx emissions were reduced. They also observed that CO emissions were reduced with slightly higher HC emissions. It is noteworthy that the effect on performance and emission improved/reduced with an increase in 1-pentanol blends. Sivalakshmi and Balusamy [18] blended various alcohols including 1-pentanol with neem oil (straight vegetable oil) in a single cylinder CI engine at different load conditions. The alcohol proportions were 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% by volume for all the alcohol blends with neem oil. The blend ratio was limited to 20% to avoid knocking. They observed that brake thermal efficiency improved with increase in blend ratio of alcohols. With respect to emissions, NOx and smoke emissions were found to have reduced with neem oil and n-pentanol combination with marginal improvement in HC and CO emissions. Li et al. [19] compared the effect of n-pentanol addition with diesel and diesel-biodiesel combination on performance, emission and combustion characteristics in a single cylinder CI engine at different load conditions. They observed that addition of n-pentanol showed shorter combustion duration and higher heat release rate during the main combustion phase. Also, higher thermal efficiency with improved fuel economy was observed with n-pentanol addition in the blend. They observed that while HC and CO emissions were reduced at higher engine loads it was bound to be higher at lower engine loads. They noted that NOx emissions increased at higher loads and was lower compared to base fuels at lower load conditions. The authors stated that, with reference to NOx emissions, positive effects like high latent heat of vaporization and negative effects like low cetane number and presence of oxygen in n-pentanol counteracted each other and may be reason for variable NOx emissions at low and high load conditions. In another research work, Atmanli [20] blended diesel and 1-pentanol with hazelnut oil and tested it in a CI engine at different load conditions. The blend ratio of 1-pentanol was limited to 10% by volume; they observed reduced cetane number for the blend. To improve the cetane number, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) was added at 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm concentration with the blends which improved the cetane number by 4.65%, 12.69% and 21.09% respectively. The results showed that the blend of diesel-hazelnut oil-1-pentanol with EHN resulted in a significant reduction in fuel consumption and NOx emissions. Higher alcohol addition also improved the brake thermal efficiency, as reported in a few studies [21–23]. With reference to NOx emissions, few studies showed higher NOx emissions [19–21] while other studies showed reduced NOx emissions [17,18,22,23] with n-pentanol addition compared to base fuels. These studies showed that n-pentanol blend concentration and cetane number of the blend play a major role in NOx formation and hence the results are not consistent in all the studies. This is also evident from an earlier review article based on use of higher alcohol fuels [24]. Aromatic alcohol, namely benzyl alcohol is taken for the purpose of this study. Benzyl alcohol has seven carbon atoms and is hence classified as a higher order alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can be produced naturally from Lignin by hydrolysis method and is found in a variety of essential oils including jasmine and hyacinth [16]. It has higher calorific value and cetane number compared to 1-pentanol. The effect of benzyl alcohol in diesel engines has been studied by a few researchers [25,26]. Zhou et al. [25] investigated NOx-soot tradeoff and fuel efficiency of various aromatic oxygenates, namely anisole, benzyl alcohol and 2-phenyl ethanol blended with diesel in a heavy-duty engine. The blended oxygen concentration for all the three diesel blends was 2.59% by wt. They observed that all the three aromatic oxygenates had similar calorific value and cetane number, but differed in the position of the hydroxyl group with the aromatic ring. All the three oxygenates were derived from low-cost biomass, namely Lignin. They observed that all oxygenates improved NOx-soot tradeoff and maximum improvement was observed with benzyl alcohol as the OH group was further away from the ring. Extending this study, Zhou et al. [26] added EGR with all the three oxygenate blends to improve the NOx-soot tradeoff further. The combustion behavior was also investigated in this research. They observed that EGR played a key role in improving the NOx-soot tradeoff further. They concluded that benzyl alcohol blend was the best, considering performance parameters with and without EGR."
2,Objective of the study,"1.2 Objective of the study The literature review shows that Simarouba glauca is a promising energy crop that can produce viable biodiesel feedstock, it is widely available and an excellent choice to replace diesel in a CI engine. All the available research works focused on converting vegetable oil to biodiesel through transesterification. The effect of neat Simarouba glauca oil or its blends with diesel has not been studied in literature thus far. Poor combustion characteristics caused by neat vegetable oil might be the reason for the lack of earlier studies. In the current research study the authors have limited the biofuel blend with diesel to B20 and B40 to avoid the operational problems. However, to improve the performance, the authors have added two oxygenates, namely 1-pentanol (aliphatic) and benzyl alcohol (aromatic). Earlier studies show that 1-pentanol aids in simultaneously reducing NOx and smoke emissions. Benzyl alcohol also has similar characteristics as 1-pentanol. While few studies have been reported in ternary blending of 1-pentanol, no research work has so far been carried out utilizing benzyl alcohol in the ternary blend. Hence, in the current research study 5% and 10% of both 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol are added with B20 and B40 blend. The effect of oxygenate addition on performance, emission and combustion characteristics is studied at different load conditions. The novelty of this work is to identify a novel oxygenate additive to improve the performance of biofuel-diesel blend to reduce the high cost associated with necessary transesterification of biofuels."
3,Test fuels,"Simarouba glauca biofuel was procured from a local oil vendor in Chennai, India. 1-Pentanol and benzyl alcohol were procured from M/s. Sigma-Aldrich. The properties of the biofuel were tested based on ASTM standards and the results are shown in Table 1 . It was observed that Simarouba oil has higher viscosity and density with lower calorific value and hence operation in diesel engine as sole fuel poses combustion, operational and long-term/continuous operation problems. However, cetane number of Simarouba oil is comparable with diesel and hence blending low cetane fuels like alcohol will not affect its cold starting and combustion. Biofuel was blended with diesel in the proportion of 20% and 40% by volume, called as B20 and B40 respectively. The blend was limited to B40 to avoid injector choking. The properties of B20 and B40 are shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. The properties of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol can be seen from Table 1. It is observed that both 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol have low viscosity and cetane number. The molecular structure of both 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol shows the position of hydroxyl group. 1-Pentanol is a straight chain and classified as aliphatic alcohol; benzyl alcohol has OH group bonded with the aromatic benzene ring and is hence classified as aromatic alcohol. B20 and B40 were blended with 5% and 10% of both 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol to form the blends B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5, B20 + Bn10, B40 + P5, B40 + P10, B40 + Bn5 and B40 + Bn10. The blend ratio of both the alcohols was limited to 5 and 10% considering the overall cost of the fuel blends. The blends were prepared by splash blending technique and it is found that all the fuel blends were fully miscible and stable during testing. The prepared samples show no phase separation even after 48 h."
4,Test engine,"All the experiments were done in a Kirloskar make, single cylinder, naturally aspirated, water-cooled type, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm and at rated power output of 5.2 kW. The technical specifications are shown in Table 4 and the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The engine was coupled with eddy-current dynamometer with an electronic exciter for measuring and varying the load. Fuel consumption is measured on volumetric basis using a burette and stop watch. The exhaust gas temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple connected to the digital display unit. The gaseous emissions, namely HC, NOx, CO2 and CO emissions were measured using AVL Digas 444 model analyzer which works on the principle of non-dispersive infrared (NDIR). Smoke opacity was measured using AVL 437C model Opacimeter working based on light extinction method. The gas analyzers were calibrated before starting the experimental work. The in-cylinder pressure was measured using Kistler make pressure transducer connected to a computer based data acquisition system. The crank angle is measured using an encoder placed in the flywheel. The combustion analysis was done using ‘Engine Soft’ software to obtain various combustion parameters like in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, ignition delay and combustion duration. All the measurements were done for 100 cycles and the average is taken for analysis to reduce cycle-to-cycle variations. The accuracy of the equipment used for this research work is shown in Table 5 . In the current study, all the tests were performed at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm from lower to higher loads, corresponding to the brake power (BP) of 1.3 kW, 2.6 kW, 3.9 kW and 5.2 kW. The fuel injection timing was kept at 23°bTDC and a constant injection pressure of 200 bar is maintained throughout the experiment. All the tests were conducted at steady state condition without modifying the test engine. All measurements were repeated for five times and the average value was used for determining the derived parameters. Initially, the engine was run with diesel for 15 min to attain warm-up condition. The emission parameters like HC, NOx were measured in terms of ppm and CO were measured in terms of % volume which was converted to g/kWh based on number of moles. The uncertainty analysis of all the performance and emission parameters are done based on the square root method and displayed in Table 6 ."
5,Results and discussions,"Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the engine are analyzed at various load conditions, from 0 to 100% of full rated capacity. Diesel, B20, B40 and its blends with 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol are tested in the CI engine, and the results are compared with the base fuel."
6,Combustion parameters,"4.1 Combustion parameters Engine combustion parameters like in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, ignition delay and combustion duration for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blends with B20 and B40 at 100% load are discussed in this section. 4.1.1 In-cylinder pressure In-cylinder pressure inside the combustion chamber is controlled by the amount of fuel prepared and burnt in instantaneous combustion. Fig. 2 shows the variation of in-cylinder pressure with crank angle for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blends with B20 and B40 at 100% load. Peak pressure for B20 and B40 is less compared to diesel; this may be due to inferior mixture formation during the delay period causing a reduced instantaneous combustion and subsequent lower peak pressure. The reduction in in-cylinder pressure depends on increase in biofuel proportion. Peak pressure for diesel, B20, and B40 are 68.5 bar, 65.7 bar and 61.8 bar; it is also observed that peak pressure occurrence is delayed with an increase in biofuel quantity [11]. Peak pressure for B20 and B40 shifted 2°CA and 5°CA respectively from peak pressure of diesel fuel. Addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol, improved combustion compared to B20 and B40. Peak pressure for B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5 and B20 + Bn10 are 69.4 bar, 71.9 bar, 72 bar and 76.9 bar respectively and for B40 + P5, B40 + P10, B40 + Bn5 and B40 + Bn10 are 66.2 bar, 68.6 bar, 67.8 bar and 69.9 bar respectively. It is seen that addition of 1-pentanol, improved combustion due to improved atomization rate and faster combustion process. However, increase in 1-pentanol blend delayed the occurrence of peak pressure due to lower cetane number of 1-pentanol [14]. Benzyl alcohol addition showed superior combustion compared to 1-pentanol addition with both B20 and B40. This is due to the position of hydroxyl group leading to improved free radical propagation. It is also noted that increase in benzyl alcohol increased peak pressure with both B20 and B40. The tests also show that, due to higher cetane number of benzyl alcohol, peak pressure occurred early compared to 1-pentanol. 4.1.2 Heat release rate Heat release rate is obtained from in-cylinder pressure data based on the first law of thermodynamics. Fig. 3 shows the variation of heat release rate corresponding to crank angle for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blends with B20 and B40. It is observed that compared to diesel, peak heat release rate for B20 and B40 is less. The possible reason is due to less fuel prepared for instantaneous combustion despite more extended delay period as a result of poor physical properties of biofuel, viz. density, viscosity, and calorific value [20]. It is also observed that the combustion is slower with B20 and B40 which extends the combustion, resulting in more wastage of power. This is evident from the lower BTE and higher EGT, as discussed previously. With the addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol, peak heat release is improved due to improved combustion as a result of improved fuel properties with alcohol addition. Also, the longer ignition delay period causes more fuel accumulation, and faster combustion rate of both alcohols is also worth noting [14,17]. Compared to 1-pentanol, peak heat release rate for benzyl alcohol is higher and also occurs slightly early. Aromatic alcohol has higher evaporation rate and combined with the position of the OH group in benzyl alcohol aids in faster combustion rate leading to higher peak heat release rate. This shows that combustion efficiency is improved with benzyl alcohol addition compared to 1-pentanol and this phenomenon is increased with increase in the proportion of benzyl alcohol. This improvement shows that more energy produced is transformed into work with less energy loss compared to B20 and B40. 4.1.3 Ignition delay and combustion duration Ignition delay is the time lag between the start of injection to start of combustion. Ignition delay occurs in two phases: 1. Physical delay 2. Chemical delay. The fuel injected atomizes into finer particles, vaporizes and mixes with air in the combustion chamber to attain the chemical reaction condition which comes under physical delay. Chemical delay mainly depends on the cetane number of the fuel responsible for auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture. Fig. 4 shows the ignition delay period for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blend with B20 and B40. It is observed that the ignition delay increases with biofuel addition and increases further with higher concentration. Ignition delay for diesel, B20, and B40 is 10°CA, 11°CA and 14°CA respectively at 100% load. Longer ignition delay with biofuel blends is due to poor physical properties which hinder the atomization process leading to increase in physical delay. Addition of alcohol increases the delay period further due to low cetane number for both 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol. Low cetane number delays the auto-ignition characteristics of the fuel thereby increasing the delay period [21]. This phenomenon is in line with both B20 and B40 blends. Compared to 1-pentanol, benzyl alcohol has slightly higher cetane number and hence less delay period. Ignition delay for B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5 and B20 + Bn10 is 13°CA, 14°CA, 12°CA and 13°CA respectively and for B40 + P5, B40 + P10, B40 + Bn5 and B40 + Bn10 it is 16°CA, 17°CA, 15°CA and 16°CA respectively, at 100% load. Combustion duration is calculated based on heat release rate from the start of combustion to 90% mass fraction burnt. Fig. 4 shows the variation of combustion duration for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blend with B20 and B40 at 100% load. Combustion duration for diesel, B20 and B40 is 50°CA, 56°CA and 59°CA respectively. Longer combustion duration for B20 and B40 is due to slower combustion rate especially in the diffusion phase as a result of poor spray characteristics owing to the high viscosity of B20 and B40. This slows down the combustion process extending the combustion phasing leading to higher EGT and lower BTE. Addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol reduces combustion duration due to improved combustion as a result of better physical properties. Combustion duration for B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5 and B20 + Bn10 is 55oCA, 54°CA, 52°CA and 51°CA respectively and for B40 + P5, B40 + P10, B40 + Bn5 and B40 + Bn10 it is 57oCA, 56°CA, 54°CA and 53°CA respectively. It is to be noted that compared to 1-pentanol, benzyl alcohol addition reduced combustion duration due to quicker combustion as a result of free radical propagation."
7,Performance parameters,"4.2 Performance parameters In the following section, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) for all the test fuels with variable engine load at constant speed are discussed. 4.2.1 Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) Fig. 5 shows the variation of BTE with a load for the test fuel. BTE increases with load due to a reduction in losses and friction at higher loads. BTE for diesel, B20 and B40 is 33.6%, 29.5% and 27.2% at maximum load condition. It is also noted that the highly viscous nature of B20 and B40 blends leads to atomization problems hindering the combustion process leading to lower BTE [27]. Higher viscosity of the B20 and B40 increases the viscous force over the inertia force of the air/fuel motion, leading to higher oil deposition on the cylinder wall, poor atomization and vaporization of charge leading to incomplete combustion and reduced heat release rate, as evident from Fig. 2. Addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol improves the BTE at all the load conditions. It is observed that BTE for B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5 and B20 + Bn10 is 32.8%, 33.1%, 33% and 34% respectively compared to 29.5% for B20 at maximum load. Increase in 1-pentanol concentration increases BTE owing to improved properties of the blend. This leads to improved atomization, vaporization and mixing process improving the combustion. Also, the oxygen content present in 1-pentanol aids in enhancing the combustion process resulting in improved BTE. BTE for B20 + P10 is on par with diesel at all the loading conditions. Subramanian et al. [22] also observed enhanced combustion with 1-pentanol addition to biofuel blends. The results show that compared to 1-pentanol blending, benzyl alcohol blending exhibits superior performance characteristics. Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol, and OH is bonded indirectly with the aromatic ring. This phenomenon increases the hydrogen abstraction rate, rates of isomerization and free radical propagation [28]. It is also to be noted that both benzyl alcohol and n-pentanol have similar calorific value. However, the position of oxygen plays the major role in preparing for the combustion. Addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol with B40 blend also shows an improvement in BTE for all the load conditions. At 100% load, BTE is increased to 29.7%, 30.8%, 31% and 31.8% for addition of P5, P10, Bn5 and Bn10 respectively with B40 blend (27.2%). 4.2.2 Brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) BSEC for 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol blend with B20 and B40 at various load conditions is shown in Fig. 6 . It is to be noted that BSEC reduces with increase in load due to improved fuel conversion efficiency leading to fewer energy losses. BSEC for diesel, B20, and B40 blend is 10.7 MJ/kWh, 12.2 MJ/kWh and 13.2 MJ/kWh respectively at maximum load condition. It is observed from Figs. 1 and 2, that the peak pressure and maximum heat release occurred late for B20 and B40 compared to diesel and therefore has taken part in expansion stroke cycle, and hence less heat energy is converted to useful work. To compensate for the loss in work, more fuel is burnt. The energy consumption is slightly reduced with the addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol. BSEC for B20 + P5, B20 + P10, B20 + Bn5 and B20 + Bn10 is 11 MJ/kWh, 10.9 MJ/kWh, 10.8 MJ/kWh and 10.6 MJ/kWh respectively at 100% load. As seen in Fig. 4, in spite of the fact that ignition delay is longer with n-pentanol and benzyl alcohol addition, the combustion phasing is reduced leading to more heat energy converted to useful work, thus reducing BSEC. It is important to note that reduction in BSEC increases with increase in alcohol concentration. BSEC is reduced with benzyl alcohol compared to 1-pentanol due to oxygen position in the functional group increasing free radical propagation. The addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol also reduced BSEC fuelled with B40 proportional to increase in alcohol concentration. 4.2.3 Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) Fig. 7 shows the variation of EGT as a function of load for 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol blend with B20 and B40. EGT shows the amount of heat wasted and carried away by exhaust gas. At 100% load, EGT for diesel, B20 and B40 is 330 °C, 352 °C and 371 °C respectively. It is perceived that increase in biofuel concentration increases EGT irrespective of load. The evidence of using heavier fuel is reflected in the exhaust gas temperature, denser fuel requires more heat to begin the combustion. These heavier droplets will remain unbiased during the uncontrolled combustion, then begin to burn in the period of after burning. Poor physical properties of biofuel leads to extended combustion phasing; this results in more heat being wasted rather than converted to useful work which increases the fuel consumption, as shown in Fig. 6. EGT is reduced with 1-pentanol, and benzyl alcohol addition and this improvement is directly proportional to the concentration of alcohol. In spite of the fact that alcohol fuels have a longer ignition delay, the improved physical properties aid in faster combustion leading to reduced combustion phasing, leading to less amount of heat wasted. This is also confirmed with an increase in BTE for 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol showing an improved combustion process. It is observed that EGT is reduced by 2–3% with n-pentanol addition and 4–6% with benzyl alcohol addition, with both B20 and B40 blend at maximum load condition."
8,Emission parameters,"4.3 Emission parameters Emission parameters like nitric oxide (NOx), smoke, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) are analyzed and discussed for all the test fuels in this section. 4.3.1 NOx emissions NOx emissions are formed during fuel combustion by thermal, prompt and fuel mechanisms. High combustion temperature breaks the strong triple bond of nitrogen molecules and generates NOx in the presence of excess oxygen [29]. The resident time for the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen in the combustion chamber is also another vital factor in formation of NOx emissions. Fig. 8 illustrates the variation of NOx emissions for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blends with B20 and B40 at different load conditions. It is observed that NOx emissions for diesel, B20, and B40 are 5.6 g/kWh, 5.2 g/kWh, and 5 g/kWh respectively at maximum loading condition. NOx emissions are higher for diesel compared to B20 and B40 at all the load conditions. Despite the fact that B20 and B40 have additional oxygen content, NOx emissions remains on the lower side. This is mainly due to poor combustion of B20 and B40 owing to the highly viscous nature leading to reduced in-cylinder temperature masking the formation of NOx emissions. Addition of alcohol fuel reduces NOx emissions owing to its high latent heat of vaporization. Fuel with the high latent heat of vaporization requires high heat energy for the phase change from liquid to vapor. This limits the in-cylinder temperature in the combustion chamber favoring the reduction of NOx emissions. NOx emissions for B20 with P5, P10, Bn5 and Bn10 are 4.9 g/kWh, 4.5 g/kWh, 5.2 g/kWh and 5.5 g/kWh. It is observed that NOx emission is reduced with 1-pentanol blend with B20 and the reduction is higher with an increase in 1-pentanol concentration. Numerous studies showed that addition of 1-pentanol reduced NOx emissions [17–21]. However, this phenomenon is changed with benzyl alcohol. Higher NOx emissions are observed with benzyl alcohol addition. Latent heat of vaporization reduces with increase in the order of alcohol, a noteworthy feature in this context [15]. Hence, benzyl alcohol has lower latent heat of vaporization compared to 1-pentanol and improved free radical propagation will make the combustion temperature higher leading to increase in NOx emissions. It is also observed that 1-pentanol addition reduced NOx emissions with B40 blend as well and increased with benzyl alcohol addition. 4.3.2 Smoke emission Smoke emissions are formed in a CI engine owing to combustion of a heterogeneous mixture of fuel and air. While premixed combustion is responsible for NOx emissions, combustion during the diffusion phase is responsible for smoke emissions. It is a well-known fact that only part of the fuel injected is burnt during the diffusion phase due to various factors like air-fuel mixing, oxygen availability and fuel atomization [30]. Fig. 9 shows the variation of smoke emissions for diesel, B20, B40 and alcohol blends with B20 and B40 at different loading conditions. Smoke emissions for diesel, B20, and B40 are 53%, 57% and 67% respectively at maximum load. Higher smoke emissions for B20 and B40 blend compared to diesel is owing to the higher viscosity leading to atomization problems causing incomplete combustion during the diffusion phase. It is notable that viscosity plays a major role in smoke formation [31]; B40 emits more smoke than B20. Addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol reduces smoke emissions for both B20 and B40 blends. Smoke emissions of B20 blend with 5% and 10% of 1-pentanol are 54% and 50%, for 5% and 10% of benzyl alcohol they are 51% and 46% respectively at 100% load. Smoke emissions are reduced from 67% for B40 blend to 61% and 53% for P5 and P10, 56% and 51% for Bn5 and Bn10 respectively. The reduction in smoke emissions with alcohol blending is due to improved combustion, availability of oxygen and lower carbon content. It is notable that combustion improvement is dominant in the formation of smoke [15,21]. Compared to 1-pentanol, benzyl alcohol has similar oxygen content and higher carbon content which should technically increase smoke emissions. However, improved combustion increases the combustion temperature thereby favoring the reduction of smoke emissions in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon is consistent with all the load conditions for the alcohol blends compared to base fuel. 4.3.3 HC emissions Fig. 10 shows the variation of HC emissions for test fuels at different load conditions. At 100% load, HC emissions for diesel, B20 and B40 are 0.46 g/kWh, 0.54 g/kWh and 0.56 g/kWh respectively. Higher HC emissions for B20 and B40 blend are due to high viscosity affecting the atomization causing improper fuel-air mixing. It is important to note that addition of alcohol to B20 and B40 blend, reduced HC emissions at higher loads and increased HC emissions at lower loads. At lower loads, due to the high latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuel, the combustion temperature is reduced. This masks the oxidation of HC emissions; similar results were observed in literature [15,17–21]. This phenomenon is changed at higher loads, due to improved combustion leading to higher combustion temperature, oxidizing the formed unburnt HC emissions [19–21]. The trend is similar with B40 and alcohol blends as well. HC emissions for 1-pentanol are slightly higher compared to benzyl alcohol at all the load conditions. This is due to improved combustion of benzyl alcohol and slightly lower latent heat of vaporization compared to 1-pentanol. 4.3.4 CO emission The cause of CO emission is insufficient oxygen for carbon oxidation due to improper mixing in atomization, leading to oxygen deficiency when the air-fuel ratio is high. Fig. 11 displays the variation of CO emission for test fuels at different load conditions. At 100% load, CO emission for diesel, B20, and B40 are 2.2 g/kWh, 2.5 g/kWh and 2.8 g/kWh respectively. Higher CO emission for B20 and B40 blend are due to poor combustion as a result of poor physical properties. This forms higher intermediate CO emission during the diffusion phase due to atomization problems and slower combustion process. This phenomenon is increased with alcohol addition especially in maximum load conditions. At higher loads, minimum CO emission is observed with benzyl alcohol blend; they further reduced at higher concentrations. At lower loads, due to the high latent heat of vaporization, CO emissions are higher for all the alcohol blends as compared to base fuel. The high latent heat of vaporization reduces the combustion temperature masking the oxidation process and leaving more intermediate unburnt species [15,21]. However, at higher loads, due to excess oxygen, combustion is improved thereby favoring the oxidation process."
9,Conclusions,"In the present work, the effect of minor addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol (classified as aliphatic and aromatic type) with Simarouba Glauca-diesel blend on performance, emission and combustion characteristics has been investigated and compared with base fuel. 1-Pentanol and benzyl alcohol were added 5 and 10% by volume with B20 and B40 blend. Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. B20 and B40 reduced brake thermal efficiency compared to diesel but improved it with alcohol addition. Maximum brake thermal efficiency was observed with 10% addition of benzyl alcohol with both B20 and B40. 2. Faster and improved combustion with alcohol addition led to reduced BSEC and EGT compared to B20 and B40 blends. 3. B20 and B40 blends emitted less NOx emissions but higher smoke opacity. Both the alcohols aided in simultaneous reduction of NO and smoke emissions. Compared to 1-pentanol, benzyl alcohol exhibited improved combustion leading to higher NOx emissions with reduced smoke. 4. HC and CO emissions were higher with B20 and B40 and reduced with the addition of alcohol at higher loads. However, at low loads, HC and CO emissions were higher for alcohol due to high latent heat of vaporization. 5. Ignition delay for B20 and B40 was longer compared to diesel and extended further with alcohol addition. This was due to reduced cetane number for alcohol. Longer ignition delay was observed with higher concentration of 1-pentanol blend. 6. Significant improvement in peak pressure and heat release rate was noted with alcohol addition, it improved with increase in proportion of alcohol. Hence, it is concluded that blending vegetable oil with diesel is a simple and cost-effective method compared to transesterification. The performance of the biofuel blend can be improved with the addition of alcohol fuels. Both, 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol additives shows a lot of promise in improving the performance without compromising on emission parameters. It is also observed that the position of the hydroxyl group plays a significant role in combustion. Overall, 5% addition of benzyl alcohol is found to be optimum in improving the performance without affecting the emission. The minor addition of alcohol with biofuel blends also reduces the overall cost of the fuel."
