0,Introduction,"The challenge of biohydrogen process is the feasibility to produce at a commercial scale with a low cost to meet the need of sufficient and cost-effective energy supply. Consequently, the substrate used for fermentative hydrogen production must be abundant, easily available, and inexpensive. From these aspects, lignocellulosic materials obtained from crop or food industrial wastes could be a commercially viable biohydrogen feedstock [1]. Crop wastes such as straw, bagasse, oil palm trunks felled for replanting and palm empty fruit brunch are promising substrates for cost-effective bioenergy production [2,3]. Basically, lignocellulose contains a large amount of cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (25–30%), and lignin (10–20%) [4]. Pre-treatment of lignocellulosic materials generates hemicellulose hydrolysate containing two main sugars (xylose and glucose). Pentose sugar (xylose) accounts for up to 35–45% of the total sugars in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate derived from wood, agricultural by-products or crops [5]. Microbial fermentation of xylose derived from such wastes is quite promising for combining energy extraction and waste reduction. However, bioconversion of pentoses to bioethanol is not very effective in terms of ethanol yield and production rate [2]. Due to this limitation, an alternative utilization of xylose needs to be investigated to increase the economical feasibility of the biofuels production from lignocellulosic material. Therefore, utilization of the hydrolysate as a substrate for biohydrogen production is attractive. It has been shown that xylose could be successfully converted to hydrogen by extreme thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus achieving a relatively high yield of 333 mL H2/g xylose [6]. A thermophilic strain of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain PSU-2, W16 and extreme thermopiles C. saccharolyticus have been reported to utilize mixed sugars (glucose and xylose) simultaneously and generate hydrogen with a hydrogen yield 315, 305–323 and 295 mL H2/g sugar, respectively [7–9]. Natural dark fermentative inoculum using mixed consortia edges over pure inoculum in allowing process at non-sterile environment and capable of dealing with mixture of substrate due to a high microbial diversity [10,11], which significantly reduce the process operation cost with low biomass yield. Thermophilic mixed cultures have been reported to utilize mixed sugars (glucose and xylose) simultaneously and generate hydrogen with a hydrogen yield 218 mL H2/g sugar [12]. Thermophilic mixed cultures that were enriched from sediment-rich samples of geothermal spring in Southern Thailand with mixed sugars under acidic conditions produced a significant amount of hydrogen gas [13]. High yield of hydrogen was observed in mixed sugars medium (375 mL H2/g-sugar consumed) and oil palm trunk hysrolysate (301 mL H2/g-sugar consumed) [13]. However, the problem of lignocellulosic material-based substrate fermentation process is the inability of microorganisms to metabolize efficiently hemicellulose hydrolysate which contains mixed hexose, pentose and toxic compounds such as phenolics, furfurals and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) into hydrogen with satisfied yield and productivity. Although product formation by thermophilic mixed cultures is strongly affected by the specific characteristics of the feed substances and operational conditions such as pH, temperature, redox potential and available trace minerals [14]. Furthermore, it is also not clear whether a change in product formation by anaerobic microflora is caused by a metabolic change within a particular microbial population, by a change in the microflora population itself or a change in both. Knowledge of the microbial composition of the major hydrogen-producing microorganisms would result in efficient and optimal operation of fermentative hydrogen-producing systems (effective control of the start-up and operation) [15]. The comparative microbial community analysis will provides an accelerated approach to understanding community structure and function. The identification of unique or numerically dominant strains or groups under defined or controlled conditions is also possible. Therefore, tools for identification of the microbes present in the hydrogen production process are necessary. It was recommended that the step to overcome such instability and to provide high hydrogen-production efficiency, the insight into the hydrogen fermentation microbiology and factors involved in the stabilization/destabilization of the process should be further investigated [16,17]. Hot springs are a potential source for thermophilic hydrogen-producing microorganisms. In this study, changes in fermentation pattern of glucose and xylose mixed substrate as the model hemicellulose hydrolysate by thermophilic mixed cultures were investigated with respect to product formation and bacterial community structure during hydrogen production. Parallel to observations of fermentation behaviour, microbial community structure in mixed cultures was investigated using PCR-DGGE analysis targeted on bacterial 16S rDNA. The PCR-DGGE data were subjected to statistic analysis in order to evaluate hydrogen production performance relative to microbial community structure."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hot spring sampling,2.1 Hot spring sampling Sediment-rich water samples were collected from eight hot springs located in Southern Thailand (Table 1 ). Temperature and pH of samples were measured in the fields using thermometer and pH paper. The samples were kept in serum bottles for return to the laboratory.
3,Enrichment culture,"2.2 Enrichment culture Enriched hydrogen-producing cultures were developed as previously reported by O-Thong et al. [18]. At each site of hot spring, 3 mL of sediment-rich water was transferred by sterile syringe into 27 mL basic anaerobic medium (BA medium, pH 5.5) supplemented with 5 g/L each of xylose, glucose and the mixture of these sugars in the ratio 1:1 [19] as a carbon source and incubated at 60 °C for 2 day at strict anaerobic condition. During the enrichment, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane gas and soluble metabolites were monitored. The cultures resulting from these initial cultivations were used in five successive batch cycles (10% inoculum in the medium, 2 days per cycle). The final cultures (5th batch cycle) were used for analysis hydrogen production, soluble metabolite production and responsible microbial community."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis The evolved biogas was collected in a headspace of serum bottle. The total volumes at each time interval were measured at room temperature by syringe. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane in the biogas were measured. The biogas composition was confirmed by gas chromatography (GC-8A Shimadzu) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2.0-m packed column (ShinCarbon ST 100/120, Restek) and argon at a flow rate of 15 mL/min as the carrier gas. The culture broth was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min. Fermentation end products (volatile fatty acids and ethanol) in the supernatant were determined by GC (HP6850, Hewlett Packard) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Stabilwax-DA column (dimensions 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The temperature of the injection port was 230 °C. The chromatography was performed using the following program: 70 °C for 1 min, 70–180 °C with a ramping of 20 °C/min, 180 °C for 6 min. The detector temperature was 250 °C. Lactic acid, xylose and glucose were analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Agilent 1200 series), equipped with Aminex® HPX-87H ion exclusion column."
5,DNA extraction,"2.4 DNA extraction Total genomic DNA was extracted from enrichment culture samples by using a slightly modified standard bacterial genomic DNA isolation method [20]. Pellet cells in enrichment culture were harvested in micro-centrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min. The pellet cells were suspended in 500 μl of TENS buffer pH 8.0 (containing; 100 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM Na3PO4). After that, 40 μl of lysozyme (final conc. 3.7 mg/mL) was added and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with gentle manual mixing every 10 min. The mixtures were subjected to four cycles of freezing and thawing at 0 °C (ice bath) and 65 °C respectively, each step for 3 min. A 200 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50 μl of proteinase K (final conc. 1.2 mg/mL) were added and mixed by inverting the tubes by hand following incubation for 1.5 h at 60 °C with gentle manual mixing every 10 min. Then, the DNA was recovered from the tube by phenol–chloroform extraction. The mixtures were added equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and mix gently. The aqueous layer was selected by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 10 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to new sterile tube and repeated extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). After centrifugation, the crude DNA extract was precipitated with absolute ethanol for 2 h or overnight at −20 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 10 min. The genomic DNA pellet was re-suspended in 30–50 μl of TE buffer and stored at −20 °C until needed. The genomic DNA was visualized by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide."
6,PCR-DGGE analysis,"2.5 PCR-DGGE analysis The microbial community structure of the enriched culture was studied using PCR-DGGE as described by Prasertsan et al. [21] with primers sequence as shown in Table 2 . Briefly, the bacterial 16S rDNA (∼1400 base pair) was amplified by the first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal primer 1492r and 27f. Amplification mixtures were used TopTaq™ Master Mix Kit (Qiagen) with a final volume of 25 μl and contained 25 pmol of each primers, under conditions of an initial denaturation at 95.5 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 54 °C for 40 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The reactions were subsequently cooled to 4 °C. The PCR product was analyzed on 1.0% agarose gels electrophoresis. In the second PCR, primer K517r and L340f with CG clamp were used to amplify the fragment of V3 region of 16S rDNA product from the first PCR [22] with the program corresponded to an initial denaturation 95 °C for 3 min follow by 30 cycles of three steps: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were stored at 4 °C and analyzed on 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis before DGGE. Amplification of Archaea 16S rDNA sequences was carried out using archaea-specific primers (Table 2). The majority of the archaea 16S rDNA fragment was amplified using Arch958r and Arch21f primers. The amplification mixture was carried out using the same mixture for bacteria. PCR began with a 94 °C denaturation for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 51 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The 16S rDNA PCR product was used as template for next PCR. The V3 region fragment was amplified with the PARCH519r and PARCH340f-GC primers and carried out with the same mixture as above. The amplification condition started with an initial denaturation 94 °C for 3 min follow by 34 cycles of three steps: 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were stored at 4 °C and analyzed on 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis before DGGE. The DGGE analysis of PCR products obtained from the second PCR were performed using the DGGE unit, V20-HCDC (Scie-Plas limited, UK) with 8% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels and a denaturant gradient of 30–60% and 40–80% for bacteria and archaea respectively. DGGE gels were stained with Sybr-Gold for 60 min and photographed on Gel DocXR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the bands in the gel were excised. The DNA in the excised gel slices were incubated in 20 μl of distilled water at 4 °C for 24 h and re-amplified by PCR with the second PCR primers. The PCR products were separated again by DGGE, and then the bands were excised again. Most of the bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified with primer 357f (without a GC clamp) and the reverse primer. After re-amplification, PCR products were purified and sequenced using primer 518r (bacteria) and PARCH519r (archaea) by the Macrogen sequencing facility (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea). Raw data of DNA sequenced were analyzed with program Chromas and BioEdit before affiliated strains performed. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by ribosomal database project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) with SeqMatch program and basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) with nucleotide database in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Enrichment of thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria from hot spring samples,"3.1 Enrichment of thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria from hot spring samples Different types of microbial communities were obtained from different hot spring sediment-rich samples taken from 5 Provinces in Southern Thailand. During incubation in BA medium (pH 5.5) at 60 °C, all samples produced gas consisting of H2 (34–61%) and CO2 (38–60%), with traces of N2. In some experiments, methane formation was also detected during the initial stages of consortium development but not found in the second generation. Gas production started after 1 day and stopped after 2–4 days incubation time in all samples. Four sediment sources encoded with RNW, SRW1, SRW2 and SRR1 gave significantly low hydrogen production yield (<69.6 mL H2/L-medium). In all carbon sources tested, except the source encoded with RNW enriched with xylose produced 566 mL H2/L-medium indicated that it was xylose–utilizing thermophilic bacteria. Interestingly, the other group showed high cumulative hydrogen production. Among these, the two sediment sources encoded as PGR and YLT showed higher cumulative hydrogen production (1506.5 and 1487.3 mL H2/L-medium, respectively) than the other sources encoded as SRR2 and PGK (326.1–967.6 mL H2/L-medium, Table 3 ). The maximum hydrogen evolution (1506.5 mL H2/L-medium) was achieved from consortium PGR enriched with xylose–glucose mixed sugars while the values from enrichment with xylose and glucose were 1319.8 and 1190.1 mL H2/L-medium, respectively. The maximum hydrogen yields from the consortium PGR with mixed sugars, glucose and xylose were 301.3, 263.9 and 238.1 mL H2/g sugarconsumed, respectively, whereas the values from the consortium YLT were 264.9, 156.5, and 297.4 mL H2/g sugarconsumed, respectively. These results indicated the potential role of microbial consortia in utilization of xylose and glucose without much variation in overall metabolism. This data is in agreement with the report that biohydrogen production from xylose and glucose using pure culture of T. themosaccharolyticum PSU-2, T. themosaccharolyticum W16 and mixed culture of compost microfora [7–9]. However, hydrogen production values differed with type of carbon source. For the consortium PGR and YLT, xylose was a better carbon source than glucose as it exhibited higher cumulative hydrogen production (1319.8 and 1487.3 mL H2/L-medium, respectively) than glucose (1190.1 and 782.9 mL H2/L-medium, respectively). Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen yields of the thermophilic consortium PGR and YLT (301.3 and 297.4 mL H2/g sugarconsumed, respectively) were comparable with other studies such as 274 mL H2/g sugar at 60 °C using sludge inoculum taken from a municipal sewage treatment plant [23] and 2-fold higher than the earlier report (138 mL H2/g sugar at 55 °C) using inoculum from a continuous reactor [24]. So far, the highest hydrogen production yields by thermophilic mixed cultures are 322 mL H2/g sugar at 60 °C with anaerobic digested sludge [25] and 307 mL H2/g sugar at 70 °C with inoculum from a bench-scale methanogenic manure-treating reactor [26]. Therefore, the hydrogen production of the enriched consortium PGR and YLT are comparable with the previous reports."
9,Soluble metabolites of enrichment cultures,"3.2 Soluble metabolites of enrichment cultures The hydrogen was produced along with the production of volatile fatty acids and alcohols (Table 4 ). Main volatile fatty acids of the enriched cultures were acetic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid and butanol. Small amount of ethanol and propionic acid were observed throughout the enrichment culture fermentation. Among the metabolites, acetic acid and lactic acid accumulated were dominated which caused the acidic condition (low pH). The dominated metabolites correlated closely with high hydrogen producer encoded as SRR2, PGK, PR and YLT. The pH lower than 5.5 (initial pH) were observed in high hydrogen-producing group and the lowest pH (pH 3.8) was obtained from the highest hydrogen producer PGR in the xylose–glucose mixed. Most COD balances of soluble metabolites were under 10% error, indicating the measurement were accurate. Only COD balances of the enriched cultures with glucose were over 10%, it may cause from high cell mass conversion from this sugar. The soluble metabolites from high hydrogen producer were composed mostly butyric acid, butanol, lactic acid and acetic acid with a COD distribution of 18–23, 9–22, 15–16 and 4–8% on COD basis (Table 4). The enriched cultures (SRR2, PGK, PGR and YLT) had different metabolic patterns for hydrogen production mostly acetate and butyrate metabolic pathways. Some enriched cultures produced small amount of hydrogen but produced butanol and lactic acid as the main soluble metabolites (RNW, SRW1 and SRR1) or produced butanol and butyric acid as main soluble metabolites (SRW2). Lactic acid was found in all enriched cultures, while it is not common as end product but intermediate product during fermentation. The reason for lactic acid accumulation was not clear but likely related to environmental change during repeated cycle or substrate overloading [27]. It was suggested when environmental change, bacteria would try to optimize the carbon flow rate through the cell by using lactic acid as electron sink and lower down the acetic acid production or change in the microflora population itself, which gave high energy yield. As a result, high lactic acid was found in some enriched cultures. In the present study, fermentation patterns involving hydrogen fermentation of glucose–xylose mixed substrate was characterized relative to the soluble metabolites and microbial characteristics of the system. The distribution of fermentation products were dependent upon microorganisms that were dominant in the microflora under various inoculum sources."
10,Microbial community analysis of enrichment cultures,"3.3 Microbial community analysis of enrichment cultures Bacterial community samples were taken from the last repeated batch cultures (5th cycle). The results demonstrated that numerous hydrogen-producing thermophilic bacteria could be obtained from liquid and sediment samples collected from hot springs in Southern Thailand. The community structures of the enriched cultures from hot spring were analyzed with PCR-DGGE, using the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that sample sources and enrichment carbon sources were affected to diversity of bacteria community (Fig. 1 ). The enriched culture consortium SRW1 (B), SRR1 (D) and PGR (G) showed 60–100% DGGE profiles similarity in all enrichment cultures with glucose, xylose–glucose mixed and xylose alone as carbon source. Microorganisms presented in PGR consortium have 100% similarity between xylose–glucose mixed, and xylose alone as carbon source, while the enriched cultures possessed more diverse microorganisms in the presence of glucose. The bacterial community profiles of the other consortium; RNW (A), SRW2 (C), SRR2 (E) and YLT (F), also were different depending on the carbon sources (Fig. 2 ). Bacterial dominant species in the enrichment culture were grouped by phylogenetic tree. The dominant species were divided into three groups (Fig. 3 , Table 5 ) including bacterial strains belong to Group A were related to Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Anoxybacillus sp. and uncultured Firmicutes bacterium. Bacterial species in this group were related to low hydrogen-producing species as the results showed low hydrogen production in enriched cultures (RNW, SRW1, SRW2 and SRR1) and presence of these bacteria. Staphylococcus sp. was dominated in the enriched cultures with glucose and xylose–glucose mixed substrate while xylose alone was not found. It may be growth only on glucose as carbon source. Bands 3 and 4 were affiliated to different Bacillus sp. because dominant band 3 seems to be preferred only glucose but band 4 can used both of glucose and xylose as substrate. Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus sp. were found only in the enriched culture SRW1 (B). Bacillus coagulans was found a sporogenic lactic acid bacterium and produces lactic acid as the primary fermentation product from both hexose and pentose sugars [28]. This result was corresponded to the presence lactic acid as main fermentation product in the enriched cultures (SRW1) with glucose and xylose–glucose mixed substrate (Table 3). For Anoxybacillus sp. was found dominant in enriched cultures SRW2 (C). This strain was utilized both of glucose and xylose substrate. Enriched cultures with xylose–glucose mixed were not clearly dominant by this species because it seems can not competed with strongly dominated band affiliated to uncultured Firmicutes bacterium. Genus Anoxybacillus were reported as both glucose and xylose-utilizing and endospore-forming bacterium [29]. Bacterial dominant species belong to group B were Caloramator sp. and Clostridium sp. with found mainly in the enriched cultures with glucose and xylose–glucose mixed of sample code RNW and all carbon sources of samples coded SRR1 and SRR2, respectively. Caloramator sp. presented in the enriched cultures RNW seems to prefer both glucose and xylose but can not competed with other strains presented in the enriched culture with xylose alone as substrate. Caloramator sp. was also presented in the enriched culture YLT with xylose as a carbon source. Caloramator sp. was found in enrichment culture for hydrogen-producing extreme thermophilic anaerobic microflora from cow manure enriched with glucose and xylose by repeated batch cultures at 75 °C [30] and in biohydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent with ASBR reactor tank system [21]. The bacterial strain related to Caloramator indicus were proposed as a new hydrogen-producing strain with optimum temperature 60–62 °C [31,32]. For Clostridium sp. were presented dominant in xylose–glucose mixed and xylose enrichment cultures. However, these two genus were efficient utilized xylose–glucose mixed substrate and appeared moderate hydrogen-producing bacteria when compared with the group C. The last group, group C was related to Thermoanaerobacterium sp. and Caldicellulosiruptor sp. Genus Thermoanaerobacterium were presented dominantly in the enriched cultures of samples code PGK, PGR and YLT. It showed efficient utilize xylose–glucose mixed substrate and gave the highest accumulation hydrogen production compared with other two groups. T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2, T. thermosacchrolytium W16, T. saccharolyticum and T. aotearoense were reported effectively hydrogen-producing species at thermophilic condition and utilized both hexose and pentose sugars [7,8,33]. One of the evidence clearly was the presence Thermoanaerobacterium sp. in the enriched culture with xylose of RNW gave hydrogen production higher significant than other two enrichment substrate. Genus Thermoanaerobacterium and Caloramator were frequency found to be dominant species in thermophilic hydrogen enriched cultures [30,34]. Caldicellulosiruptor sp. was also found in the enriched culture with xylose of YLT. The Density of band was not strong may be cause by unoptimum cultured temperature. Finally this study, microbial consortia developed from Thailand hot springs were Caloramator sp., Clostridium sp., Thermoanaerobacterium sp., and Caldicellulosiruptor sp. as major groups of hydrogen-producing bacteria in glucose, xylose–glucose mixed and xylose substrate. Enrichment cultures show promising to apply for biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic hydrolysate with mostly contained xylose–glucose mixed. Archaeal community of enrichment cultured found that no amplification products of archaeal 16S rRNA genes were obtained from the DNA extracts of all enriched cultures samples with a nested PCR procedure. This result indicated the absence of archaea in the enriched cultures."
11,Conclusion,"Thermophilic microorganisms for hydrogen production were enriched from Southern Thailand hot springs over a wide temperature range (53–80 °C). The batch enrichments had different metabolic patterns, including high hydrogen or high butanol yields from glucose and xylose. Two enrichment cultures produced a high hydrogen yield from glucose, xylose and mixture of both sugars at 60 °C. The PGR and YLT enrichment had maximum hydrogen yields of 301 and 297 mL of H2/g sugarsconsumed. The consortium PGR and YLT, dominated by bacteria closely affiliated with T. thermosaccharolyticum. In summary, promising bacterial enrichments were obtained from Southern Thailand hot spring samples with a high potential for hydrogen production under thermophilic condition from lignocellulose hydrolysate. The community structures of enrichment with the xylose, glucose and the mixture composed of high hydrogen-producing bacterial strains affiliated with low-G+C-content Gram-positive bacteria, Thermoanaerobacterium sp. and Caldicellulosiruptor sp. based on the 16S rRNA gene. The moderate and low hydrogen-producing strains were comprised of genera Caloramator and Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Anoxybacillus, respectively."
