0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is the most attractive alternative fuel, due to its high energy content and clean combustion properties (Policastro et al., 2020). In the past decade, biological hydrogen production processes have attracted increasing attention as a tool to reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Among biological processes, photo fermentation (PF) has been acknowledged as an effective and environmentally-friendly process for biohydrogen production (Policastro et al., 2021; Touloupakis et al., 2021). Photo fermentative microorganisms, known as purple non sulfur bacteria (PNSB), are able to utilize various organic compounds as feedstock, including dark fermentation effluents (DFEs) (Seifert et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). The photo conversion of DFEs is particularly interesting, as it allows combining two different anaerobic biological processes (Dark fermentation and Photo fermentation). Consequently, it is possible to enhance hydrogen yields via the photo conversion of the organic matter contained in DFEs. (Luongo et al., 2017). Moreover, additional valuable by-products are produced as consequence of PNSB metabolic activity, so increasing the overall convenience of the transformation. Indeed, PNSB are able to accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a precursor of totally biodegradable plastic materials. This allows energy to be obtained from organic waste together with valuable chemicals for bio-plastic production. DFEs contain various types of organic compounds, mainly belonging to the class of organic acids (e.g. acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, lactic acid) and alcohols (e.g. ethanol, butanol) (Dauptain et al., 2020; Ghimire et al., 2015). Therefore, when DFEs are used as substrates for the PF process, photo fermentative bacteria access to multiple carbon sources. Such an event may compromise the efficiency of biohydrogen production. In fact.in a multi-substrate environment, the presence of a preferred carbon source often prevents the use of other available sources for the same metabolic conversion (Görke and Stü). Specifically, it has been observed that, during fermentation processes, a preferred substrate is used for hydrogen production, while the others are used for biomass production. This phenomenon, named Carbon Catabolite Repression (CCR), is regulated at genetic level (Ghosh et al., 2017). Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies related to the development of CCR phenomenon during PF of DFEs. Although some authors have reported that glucose may act as a catabolite repressor (Pattanamanee et al., 2012), no other information is available related to other carbon sources, to date. Therefore, the question is worth of additional research efforts, especially referring to the photo fermentative conversion of ethanol-rich effluents, which are poorly investigated, despite their importance for practical applications. Ethanol-rich effluents, in fact, are always obtained as a result of the alcoholic fermentation of sugar-rich substrates (Wang et al., 2019). This process generates ethanol as main compound and glycerol as secondary one. Almost 4–5% of the initial amount of substrate can go toward glycerol synthesis (Jagtap et al., 2019). Therefore, glycerol is the major by-products of ethanol production. The aim of the present study was to verify the occurrence of CCR phenomenon during PF of DFEs, testing the effect of glycerol presence in ethanol-rich effluents, on the overall production of biohydrogen. The study was conducted using mixed phototrophic cultures on a synthetic substrate simulating the effluent resulting from bagasse alcoholic fermentation (Wang et al., 2019). PHB accumulation, as alternative result of the conversion process, was also explored, to better elucidate the effect of CCR phenomenon."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and experimental set up,"2.1 Materials and experimental set up The inoculum was sampled from a mixed culture PF reactor operating at laboratory scale, used for previous experiments (Policastro et al., 2020). Before use, microorganisms were enriched using ethanol (2 mL/L) as substrate, a nutrient rich-medium and a trace elements solution. The nutrient-rich medium was prepared as follows: NaC5NO4H8 (sodium glutamate), 400 mg/L; MgSO4.7H2O (magnesium sulphate heptahydrate), 200 mg/L; yeast extract, 300 mg/L; C6H5FeO7 (ferric citrate), 24.5 mg/L; NaCl (sodium chloride), 400 mg/L; K2HPO4 (potassium hydrogen phosphate), 600 mg/L; KH2PO4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), 300 mg/L; NaHCO3 (sodium hydrogen carbonate), 700 mg/L; CaCl2.2H2O (calcium chloride dihydrate), 75 mg/L. Micronutrients were provided by adding 10 mL/L of the following trace element solution: ZnCl2 (zinc chloride), 70 mg/L; MnCl2 4H2O (magnesium chloride tetrahydrate), 100 mg/L; H3BO3 (boric acid), 60 mg/L; CoCl2.6H2O (cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate), 200 mg/L; CuCl2.2H2O (copper(II) chloride dihydrate), 20 mg/L; NiCl2.6H2O (nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate), 20 mg/L; NaMoO4.2H2O (sodium molybdate dihydrate), 40 mg/L; HCl 25 % (hydrogen chloride), 1 mL/L. The synthetic substrate was prepared reproducing the composition of one of the fermentation effluents reported in the study by Wang et al. (2019). The mentioned effluent was obtained from the fermentation process of sugars released from pre-treated sugar cane bagasse, using a co-culture of Escherichia coli LW419 and turbo yeast. The synthetic effluent was diluted to contain the feeding Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) under inhibiting threshold values. COD values above 1.5 gCOD L−1 have been reported to reduce the hydrogen productivity (Policastro et al., 2020). The dilution was performed using the same nutrient-rich medium and the trace elements solution, adopted for the re-activation phase. The chemicals used for all analytical determinations were high purity degree. Only bi-distilled water was adopted as reagent water. Before each use, glassware was soaked overnight in a concentrated nitric acid bath (2 % v/v) and rinsed carefully. Two experimental sets, each composed by three different experiments, were carried out. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Regarding the first set, the first experiment was prepared using ethanol and glycerol as substrate. Such experiment will be called Etoh-gly 1. The ethanol to glycerol ratio of 12.5 was set in accordance to the fermentative effluent of the sugar cane bagasse reported by Wang et al. (2019). The other two experiments were carried out with ethanol and glycerol as sole substrates. Such experiment will be called Etoh 1 and Gly 1, respectively. Ethanol and glycerol concentrations in the second and the third experiment, were equal to those used in the first experiment. Etoh 1 and Gly 1 experiments were conducted in order to compare the hydrogen production of the set Etoh-gly 1 with the sum of productions obtained from reactors prepared using ethanol and glycerol alone (overlapping effects). The second set was prepared using the same designing criteria adopted for the first one and changing the ethanol to glycerol ratio. Such set was conducted to investigate the effect of the ethanol to glycerol ratio on the overlapping effects. The characteristics of experiments are summarized in Table 1 . Photo bioreactors were built using transparent borosilicate glass bottles with a total volume of 500 mL and a working volume of 400 mL. The working volume was filled with 395 mL of culture medium and 5 mL of inoculum. Reactors were hermetically sealed with plastic caps, equipped with two sampling tubes. Oxygen and nitrogen gas absence was ensured by initial flushing with argon gas. Each reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer, adjusting the rotation speed to 250 rpm. Temperature was kept to 25 ± 2 °C using a climatic chamber and the initial pH value was fixed to 7, using a KOH solution. The light energy was provided by flexible light emitting diode (LED) strips, positioned between reactors. The light intensity was kept at about 4000 lux for the entire duration of the tests."
3,Analytical methods and equipment,"2.2 Analytical methods and equipment Gas production was quantified trough water displacement. Successively, gas samples were analyzed via gas chromatography to determine hydrogen and carbon dioxide content. Gas chromatography was performed using a Varian Star 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with Shin Carbon ST 80/100 column. Argon was utilized as carrier gas with 20 psi front and rear end pressure. Organic acids (OAs), Volatile Fatty Acids (VFAs), glycerol and ethanol concentrations were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) LC 25 Chromatography Oven equipped with a Metrohom (Herisau, Switzerland) Organic Acids column (Metrosep Organic Acids - 250/7.8), a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) GD 500 Gradient Pump and two different detectors. The first one was a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) UVD 340U detector and was used for Oas and VFAs determination. The second one, a Jasco (Cremella, Italy) RI-2031, was used for ethanol and glycerol detection. The eluent was a 5 mM H2SO4 solution, pumped at a rate of 0.7 mL/min. The temperature was 50 °C. PHB concentration was determined by chloroform extraction and successive gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were conducted using a GC-MS with a ZB Semi Volatiles Zebron column (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). Helium was used as carrier gas. For the PHB extraction, samples were preliminarily lyophilized, using a Martin Christ ALPHA 2–4 LSC plus freeze dryer (Osterode am Harz, Germany). Biomass growth was quantified measuring the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration via the optical density (OD) at 660 nm. The optical density was measured via a Photolab Spektral, WTW (Wheilheim, Germany) spectrophotometer (6600 UV vis). Light intensity was checked using a Lutron-LX-107 light meter (Coopersburg, USA)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Photo fermentation experiments,"3.1 Photo fermentation experiments Figs. 1–3 illustrate the time-course profiles of the parameters monitored during the first set of experiments. During the initial two fermentation days, the ethanol consumption rate of the set Etoh-gly1 was lower than those observed in Etoh1, while the glycerol was completely degraded. After the glycerol depletion, the ethanol consumption rate in the set Etoh-gly1 increased, while the rate of the Etoh1 set kept almost constant. As reported by other authors (Eroğlu et al., 2008), the consumption rate of the main substrate increases significantly when the minor substrates are depleted when multiple substrates are present in the culture medium. Notably, in Etoh-gly1 the final cumulative volumetric hydrogen yield reached 424 N mL·H2·L−1, while in Etoh1 it reached 458 N mL·H2·L−1, despite the lower initial COD (Fig. 1). In both experiments, acetate, butyrate, and formate were produced during the first two days of fermentation. On day 4, only acetate and formate were completely consumed in Etoh-gly1, while all the previously produced acids were consumed in Etoh1. The consumption of OAs determined a low hydrogen increase. On the other hand, acids consumption was associated to a significant increase of the biomass growth. Afterwards, there was a gradual consumption of ethanol in both sets. Hydrogen was the main fermentation by-product. In Etoh-gly1, acetate was consumed faster than butyrate, because it represented a more favorable substrate for PNSB (Niño-Navarro et al., 2020; Uyar et al., 2009; Zong et al., 2009). From day 7, formic and acetic acid were produced and successively consumed on day 9 and day 14, while in Etoh1 from the same day, acetic, formic, and butyric acid were produced. The first one was consumed on day 11 and the others two on day 14. Formate production was found in several photofermentative studies conducted using complex substrates such as molasses DFE (Androga et al., 2011; Avcioglu et al., 2011) and thick juice DFE (Özkan et al., 2012), as well as on lactate containing media using Rhodobacter capsulatus (Sevinç et al., 2012). In addition, Eroğlu et al. (2008) observed a relationship between formate accumulation and dark or low light intensity conditions in a study conducted using Rhodobacter sphaeroides with a malate containing substrate. Accumulation of formate causes the incomplete oxidation of the substrate with consequent low hydrogen production (Özgür et al., 2010). In the present study, the low accumulated amounts of formic acid (35.8 mg L−1) avoided the above consequences. Figs. 4–6 illustrate the time-course profiles of the parameters monitored during the second set of experiments. Concerning the second set of experiments, glycerol was almost completely consumed in the first two days. The initial concentration of glycerol (105 mg L−1) in Etoh-gly2 was higher than that observed in Etoh-gly1 (37 mg L−1). The degradation rate of ethanol observed in the first two days was lower compared to the one achieved in the following days. Etoh-gly2 and Etoh2 presented an overall hydrogen production of 328 mL·H2·L−1 and 395 mL·H2·L−1, respectively. As observed for the first set, biomass content was higher in Etoh-gly2 (1,95 g·TSS·L−1) than in Etoh2 reactors (1,70 g·TSS·L−1). Furthermore, Etoh-gly2 showed a higher biomass content than Etoh-gly1 in the first two days of observation, when ethanol and glycerol coexisted. No significant hydrogen production was detected beyond the 7th day. Ethanol was completely degraded at day 9. OAs concentration were similar to those detected in the first set of reactors. Days 7–9 were characterized by the increase in butyrate production and biomass growth in terms of TSS. The time-course profile of the parameters evaluated in Gly1 and Gly2 (Figs. 3 and 6) showed that glycerol degradation by microorganisms was quite fast and the presence of the single pure substrate favoured hydrogen production. Hydrogen production from glycerol has been studied in previous works demonstrating the effectiveness of the photo fermentation process devoted to hydrogen production starting from pure or raw glycerol (Pott et al., 2013; Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009). In both sets acetate and butyrate were produced during the first two days of fermentation and successively depleted. In all reactors a considerable hydrogen percentage was detected. Indeed, about 90 % of the biogas was represented by hydrogen, with peaks of 92 % in Etoh-gly2. According to previous studies on mixed PNSB cultures, a partial dissolution of the carbon dioxide occurred during fermentation, which was successively used as carbon source by PNSB (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014). In all reactors, the COD removal efficiency ranged between 97 % and 100 %. However, these values represent a theoretical outcome, since they were computed on the final volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration in the effluents without considering the biomass and the presence of undetected compounds. Likewise, Ghimire et al. (2016) reported such high removal efficiency, while Luongo et al. (2017) obtained a COD removal efficiency of about 90 % using a VFAs-based substrate and mixed PNSB cultures. Moreover, such results are generally higher than those obtained from configurations involving pure microbial culture (Montiel-Corona et al., 2015). Several other interesting considerations could be deduced from the obtained trend of the PHB concentration. It is widely known that PHB production is influenced by operational parameters such as C and N source, C/N ratio, pH and substrate concentration (Dinesh et al., 2020). Notably, the accumulation of such a compound strongly depends on the characteristics of adopted PNSB species and substrates. A low PHB production is generally due to the presence of a mixed consortia devoid of accumulating PHB species (Luongo et al., 2017; Montiel Corona et al., 2017). Indeed, the values obtained in the present study were similar to those reported by other authors, who used mixed PNSB cultures (Ghimire et al., 2016; Policastro et al., 2020). Higher maximum PHB concentration were reached in Etoh-gly sets. Such a result agrees with recent findings (Luongo et al., 2017; Policastro et al., 2020) showing the concomitant PHB accumulation and hydrogen production with the use of multiple substrates. Finally, the biomass concentration reached a higher final value in Etoh-gly than in Etoh reactors."
6,Discussion,"3.2 Discussion Bioprocesses aimed at producing hydrogen and PHB are crucial to replace fossil fuels and traditional plastics. PF is one of the most attractive bioprocesses, due to its environmental-friendly characteristics and the possibility of using waste materials as substrates. However, the behavior of phototrophic microorganisms in the presence of multiple carbon sources has not been completely elucidated. In this study, PF tests were carried out using a mixed phototrophic consortium and a synthetic substrate, simulating the real effluent deriving from the bagasse alcoholic fermentation process. To analyze the glycerol availability effect, further tests were carried out varying the ethanol to glycerol ratio and using ethanol and glycerol alone. Hydrogen cumulative production and PHB accumulation for all tested reactors are summarized in Table 2 . Despite the lower initial COD, reactors containing ethanol as sole carbon source presented a higher hydrogen production compared to those conducted using both ethanol and glycerol. By contrast, in the latter sets higher PHB concentrations were detected. The principle of overlapping effects was not respected in both sets. The sum of the hydrogen production of the Etoh and Gly reactors was higher compared to the hydrogen production of reactors Etoh-gly. Nevertheless, the PHB production of reactors Etoh-gly was higher compared to the sum of the Etoh and Gly PHB productions. The obtained results suggest that the presence of glycerol in alcoholic effluents negatively affects hydrogen production. Indeed, part of the substrates are involved in reactions leading to biomass generation and PHB accumulation. In other words, results indicate the occurrence of the CCR phenomenon and glycerol as carbon repressor in PF of mixed substrates containing ethanol. As reported by Ghosh et al. (2017), in multi substrate environments it often occurs that one particular carbon source is used for the hydrogen production, while another one is used for the biomass generation and PHB accumulation, although both substrates could be utilized for hydrogen production. As a result of a CCR mechanism, the presence of a preferred carbon source in the culture medium (Görke and Stü) prevents the expression of some genes, which are necessary for the consumption of one or more carbon sources (Pattanamanee et al., 2012). Currently, the CCR phenomenon in photo fermentation processes has been observed in mixtures of substrates containing glucose. Pattanamanee et al. (2012) observed that during PF of oil palm empty fruit bunch containing glucose, xylose and acetic acid, glucose was consumed first, together with acetic acid. Xylose was consumed only after glucose depletion, once more together with acetic acid. Nonetheless acetic acid did not contribute to hydrogen production of hydrogen. Similarly, Policastro et al. (2020), studying PF of winery wastewater, observed that in presence of both glucose and ethanol, PNSB showed a higher assimilation rate with glucose than with ethanol. In other studies, performed using a mixture of organic acids (e.g. acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid), the CCR phenomenon was not observed. Uyar et al. (2009) highlighted that an organic acids mixture led to higher hydrogen conversion efficiency compared to the single acids alone. Two different mixed substrates were involved using diverse amounts of butyric, acetic, and propionic acid and none of these was chosen by microorganisms as a preferential source. In the present study, Etoh1 and Etoh2 sets reached a similar conversion efficiency in terms of specific hydrogen production per gram of initial COD, which equalled, respectively, 479.6 mLH2 gCOD −1 and 475.9 mLH2 gCOD −1. However, in the presence of glycerol, the two productions dropped to 424 mLH2 gCOD −1 for Etogly 1 and to 328 mLH2 gCOD −1 for Etoh-gly 2, as the glycerol contained in the synthetic effluent of the bagasse fermentation acted as a carbon repressor. The ethanol to glycerol ratio also had a considerable effect on the CCR phenomenon. In particular, the higher ethanol to glycerol ratio (12.5) determined a decrease of hydrogen production ranging around 12 %, while the lower ethanol to glycerol ratio (4) led to a production drop around 32 %. Despite the lower hydrogen yield in Etoh-gly reactors, the obtained productions were comparable with values reported by Liu et al. (2015), who performed the ethanol conversion to hydrogen using Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009. The results reported in the present study and the information available from the literature lead to some paramount considerations related to the use of mixed substrates for PF processes development. When the substrate is composed by organic acid such as acetic, butyric, and propionic acids, none of them is chosen by microorganisms as a preferential substrate. However, the presence of butyric acid as the main source is less advisable than the presence of acetic acid for hydrogen production maximization (Uyar et al., 2009). Substrates containing glucose activate the CCR phenomenon, preventing the utilisation of other carbon sources (e.g., organic acids and ethanol) for hydrogen generation. Despite the effectiveness of glycerol as sole substrate for PNSB (Pott et al., 2013; Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009), the availability of glycerol as secondary substrate in ethanol-rich effluents generate the CCR phenomenon. Ethanol is partially utilized as source of biomass and PHB. At high ethanol to glycerol ratios such effect is negligible. Nevertheless, an ethanol to glycerol ratio of 4 lead to a considerable reduction of the hydrogen yield. Therefore, during the ethanol production stage it is advisable to apply strategies to produce low glycerol concentrations. The most widely used approach to reduce glycerol formation is to operate the fermentation process in fed-batch mode. Such feeding mode ensure lower substrate concentrations resulting in lower osmotic stress, which limits glycerol yields (Bideaux et al., 2006). The strategy is currently applied at industrial scale for the ethanol production process from sugars (Jagtap et al., 2019). To further reduce the glycerol yield during the biological ethanol production process, it is possible to apply genetic engineering techniques. For instance, Jagtap et al. (2019) deleted genes in the High-Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway. These genes regulated glycerol synthesis in S. cerevisiae. The knock-out strains showed a 35 % decrease in glycerol yields."
7,Conclusions,"This experimental study faces the lack of knowledge on the behavior of phototrophic bacteria in the presence of multiple carbon sources. Results demonstrated that the ethanol to glycerol ratio of 12.5 determined a decrease of the hydrogen production of 12 %, compared to the production obtained from the fermentation of ethanol alone. Moreover, the lower ethanol to glycerol ratio of 4 led to a higher production drop (32 %). As a result of the CCR phenomenon, the presence of glycerol in ethanol-rich substrates determines a drop of the hydrogen production. Therefore, when alcoholic fermentation effluents are used as substrate in the PF process, the hydrogen yield can be maximized by limiting the concentration of glycerol, to prevent the occurrence of the CCR phenomenon. The use of mixed culture is beneficial to enhance the hydrogen yield, while mixed substrates enhance the biomass formation and the PHB accumulation."
