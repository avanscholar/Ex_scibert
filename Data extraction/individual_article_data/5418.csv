0,Introduction,"Turfgrass is the major vegetative ground cover in many landscapes. Light is one of the most essential environmental factors affecting turfgrass plant growth as well as development (Smith, 2000). Unfortunately, low light (i.e., shade) is one of the most common environmental factors resulting in the deterioration of turf (Chhetri et al., 2019). Low-light (LL) stress leads to numerous morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in turfgrass plants (Li et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2020). Under LL conditions, turfgrasses appear to be weakened, etiolated, sparse, and more susceptible to disease (Jiang et al., 2004). In addition, LL stress also decreases the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigment and inhibits photosynthesis, thus restricting the growth of turfgrass plants (Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2017). Compared to LL-intolerant plants, LL-tolerant plants tend to allocate more resources to chlorophylls (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) for light-harvesting rather than to Rubisco for biological carbon and nitrogen fixation (Mathur et al., 2018). These pigments are responsible for light absorption, electron transfer, and quenching excess light energy in the photosynthesis process (Fan et al., 2019). In our previous study, when supplied with exogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S), tall fescue seedlings under LL stress showed increased Chl and Car contents, which may have enhanced light harvesting capacity, leading to increased photosynthesis (Liu et al., 2019). However, the mechanism by which H2S regulates photosynthesis is still unclear, particularly the variation of intermediates and components in Chl and Car metabolism after H2S application under LL stress is not fully researched. H2S was first reported as an endogenous neuromodulator which regulated physiological and biochemical processing (Abe and Kimura, 1996). Recently, it was found to act as a gaseous signaling molecule and involve in numerous biological processes in plants. For example, H2S can promote seed germination, regulate root development, and affect stomatal movements (Baudouin et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017; Mei et al., 2017). In non-model plant species, much research has been aimed at the agricultural impact of sulfur effecting nutritional quality traits of crops (Kopriva et al., 2019). In addition, it could also promote environmental stresses tolerance and alleviate detrimental effects for plants (Gotor et al., 2019). Some studies have reported that exogenous H2S can alleviate the negative influence of abiotic stresses (drought, heat, and salt) and biotic stresses (pathogens) on plants (Shi et al., 2013; Hancock, 2019). Meanwhile, it was found that cysteine (Cys) metabolism was related to the generation of H2S (Chen et al., 2020), which was mediated by enzymes such as L-cysteine desulfhydrase 1 (DES1, EC 4.4.1.1) and D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD, EC 4.4.1.15). For example, AtDES1 mutant displayed decreased endogenous H2S content and production rate in Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Jin et al., 2018). In our previous research, LL stress increased H2S production in tall fescue (Liu et al., 2019). However, the relationship between H2S and LL stress is not well understood. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), an important perennial cool-season forage and turfgrass, is widely used in temperate regions throughout the world because of its good adaptability to drought, high temperature, heavy metals, and a range of LL intensities (Hu et al., 2020). Our previous study revealed that the application of abscisic acid (ABA) and H2S can ultimately alleviate the damage induced by LL stress to tall fescue by improving the activities of enzymes and electron transfer efficiency in photosynthesis (Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). However, we only observed the application of exogenous H2S could increase Chl and Car contents under LL stress. Therefore, the process of H2S generation and its involvement in photosynthetic pigment metabolism under LL stress is not fully understood. In this study, we verified the hypothesis that H2S mediates the enhancement of LL tolerance through up-regulating H2S synthetase genes, thereby increasing endogenous H2S content and promoting the contents of Chl and Car by regulating relevant genes. Thus, we conducted this study to elucidate the specific ways through which H2S (by adding exogenous H2S or inhibiting endogenous H2S) maintains high photosynthetic rates under LL stress."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant materials and growth conditions,"2.1 Plant materials and growth conditions Seeds of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cv. Arid 3) were obtained from Beijing Clover Seed & Turf Co., Beijing, China. The seeds were disinfected with 0.1% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite and then washed three times with distilled water. Sterilized seeds were sowed on the surface of quartz sand (sterilized at 180 °C for 2 h) in black lightproof pots (9 cm diameter, 15 cm deep). After 7 d of germination, three uniformly growing and vigorous seedlings in each pot were selected for the following experiments. All plants were grown in an artificial incubator at 25/20 °C (day/night) and 60/50% relative humidity (day/night). The light:dark cycle was 16:8 h, and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) above the plants was 200 μmol m−2 s−1. The seedlings were irrigated with distilled water every day and Hoagland's nutrient solution twice a week, in which 1 mM NH4H2PO4, 6 mM KNO3, 4 mM Ca(NO3)2, 2 mM MgSO4, 46.25 μM H3BO3, 9.15 μM MnCl4‧4H2O, 0.77 μM ZnSO4‧7H2O, 0.32 μM CuSO4‧5H2O, 0.45 μM H2MoO4‧H2O, and 50 μM EDTANa-Fe were contained (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). The nutrient solution was adjusted to approximately pH 6.5 by adding 0.1 M H2SO4 or KOH as necessary."
3,Treatments and experimental design,"2.2 Treatments and experimental design After 28 d of preculture, tall fescue seedlings with uniform growing situation were divided into four different treatment groups. Control plants were still grown under a PPFD of 200 μmol m−2 s−1, whereas, for LL stress, PPFD was maintained at 40 μmol m−2 s−1 in the incubator (Zhang et al., 2018). Exogenous H2S was provided by the application of NaHS (Christou et al., 2013; Scuffi et al., 2018), and the optimal concentration was 500 μM according to our previous research (Liu et al., 2019). The following four treatments were applied: (1) distilled water (Control, CK), (2) distilled water under low-light stress (LL), (3) 500 μM NaHS (H2S donor) under LL stress (LL + H2S, LS), (4) 300 μM hypotaurine (H2S scavenger) under LL stress (LL + HT, LT). Tall fescue was treated as described above and the chemicals were irrigated to drench the quartz sand for twice during 7 d. Subsequently, plant samples were randomly harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C for following measurements."
4,Physiological and photosynthetic parameters measurement,"2.3 Physiological and photosynthetic parameters measurement Five plants from each treatment were randomly selected, and the quartz sand was rinsed away with tap water. Afterwards, the whole plants were put into a drying oven at 80 °C for 72 h to determine total biomass. The portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400XT, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to measure net photosynthetic rate (P n) of the third fully expanded leaf from the top between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. During the determination of P n, the PPFD, CO2 concentration, and relative humidity in the leaf chamber were set at 800 μmol m−2 s−1, 450 μmol mol−1, and 65%, respectively (Chen et al., 2018). After the measurement of P n, the same leaves were chosen and dark-adapted for 30 min. The values of minimal fluorescence (F 0) and maximal fluorescence (F m) were measured with a portable pulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer (PAM2500, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) using the software PamWin 3. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (F v/F m) was calculated as F v/F m = (F m – F 0)/F m (Kitajima and Butler, 1975)."
5,Measurement of chlorophyll and carotenoid contents,"2.4 Measurement of chlorophyll and carotenoid contents Photosynthetic pigments contents were determined using fresh leaves according to the method described by Lichtenthaler (1987). Tall fescue leaves were accurately weighed to an accuracy of 0.1 g, and soaked in extraction solution for 24 h in the dark. The extraction solution was composed of 10 mL of 80% acetone and 5 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol. The absorbance of the extract was recorded at 440 nm, 663 nm, and 645 nm, and the contents of Chl a, Chl b, total Chl, and Car were obtained using the equations described by Arnon (1949)."
6,Determination of chlorophyll synthetic precursors,"2.5 Determination of chlorophyll synthetic precursors The content of 5-aminolevulinic acid was measured based on the method described by Lew and Tsuji (1982) with some modifications. Tall fescue leaf samples (1.0 g) were randomly collected and afterwards homogenized with a mortar and pestle in 3.0 mL of sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.6). Then, the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 30 min. Next, 2.0 mL of supernatant was put into a 10-mL centrifuge tube and subsequently 0.6 mL of ethyl acetoacetate was added, followed by immediate incubation in boiling water for 15 min. After adding 2.6 mL of Ehrlich's reagent and a 15 min incubation, the absorbance of the reaction solution at 553 nm was recorded to calculate 5-aminolevulinic acid content. The measurement of porphobilinogen content was performed according to the method described by Bogorad (1962). Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were grinded in a mortar with 5.0 mL of extraction buffer [0.6 M Tris and 0.1 M ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.2]. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15 min, after which the supernatant was collected for porphobilinogen content measurement. Then, 1.2 mL of sample extract was mixed with an equal volume of Ehrlich's reagent, followed by a 15 min incubation. Using a spectrophotometer, the absorbency at 553 nm was recorded for computing porphobilinogen content. When determining uroporphyrinogen Ⅲ and coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ contents, tall fescue leaf samples (0.5 g) from different treatments were harvested at random. Plant samples were grinded into powder in mortars filled with liquid nitrogen, and afterwards transferred into 7.0 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000×g. The whole supernatant was collected for use as both uroporphyrinogen Ⅲ and coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ extracts. The reaction mixture was composed of 5.0 mL of sample extract and 150 μL of 1% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate and then oscillated to mix the solution well. After allowing the mixture to react at room temperature for 20 min, the solution was adjusted to pH 3.5 by addition of acetic acid and extracted using diethyl ether. The absorbances of the aqueous phase at 405.5 nm and the organic phase at 399.5 nm were observed to calculate the contents of uroporphyrinogen Ⅲ and coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ, respectively (Bogorad, 1962). The determination of Mg-protoporphyrin IX and protochlorophyllide were conducted together, using a slight modification of the method described by Hodgins and Van Huystee (1986). Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were ground in 5.0 mL of 80% (v/v) alkaline acetone until homogenized. Then, the sample extract was centrifuged at 12,000×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and the total volume was made up to 25 mL by the addition of alkaline acetone in a volumetric flask. Using a spectrophotometer, the absorption of extract was recorded at 575 nm, 590 nm, and 628 nm to count Mg-protoporphyrin IX and protochlorophyllide contents, respectively, according to the formulas noted previously (Hodgins and Van Huystee, 1986; Peng et al., 2012; Jiao et al., 2015)."
7,Carotenoid constituent contents measurement,"2.6 Carotenoid constituent contents measurement The contents of six Car components were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The preparation and extraction of Car constituents were performed according to the methods described by Yu et al. (2019) with some modifications. Then, the sample extracts were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC, Shim-pack UFLC SHIMADZU CBM30A, Shanghai, China) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS, Applied Biosystems 6500 QTRAP, Shanghai, China). Qualitative analysis was conducted according to second-level spectral information based on the comparison of the sample database with the database of metabolite. Quantification of Car constituents was completed using multiple reaction monitoring to first filter out the characteristic ion of each metabolic substance. As each ion's signal intensity was obtained, the area of the mass spectra peaks in the different samples were integrated and corrected (Fraga et al., 2010). According to the standard curve equation previously acquired, the absolute contents of Car were calculated (Petry and Mercadante, 2018)."
8,Gene transcript levels analysis,"2.7 Gene transcript levels analysis Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to estimate the expression levels of the genes using the respective primers shown in Table 1 . Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 7-d-treated tall fescue plants using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit (TAKARA, Kusatsu, Japan). After examining the quality of RNA by spectrophotometer and nucleic acid gel electrophoresis, cDNA was synthesized following the manufacturer's protocol with the HiScript®Ⅱ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, R211, Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). Then, qRT-PCR was performed using ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Q711) with the manufacturer's protocol on QuantStudio®5 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). FaActin and Faα-Tubulin were used in tall fescue for normalization, based on the geometric mean of these two selected internal reference genes. The control treatment (CK) was used as calibrator for all samples to calculate the relative expression of the relevant genes. The calculation was conducted according to 2−ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001)."
9,Measurement of H2S concentration and H2S synthetase activity,"2.8 Measurement of H2S concentration and H2S synthetase activity According to the method reported by Xie et al. (2014) with some modifications, endogenous H2S concentration was determined using fresh leaves from tall fescue. Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were harvested and dipped in 5.0 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer [pH 6.8, containing 0.1 M EDTA and 0.25% (w/v) zinc acetate] at 4 °C to be homogenized with precooled mortars and pestles. Then the extraction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000×g and 4 °C for 15 min. Three milliliters of the supernatant were removed, and 1.0 mL of 5 mM N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (dissolved in 7.2 M HCl) and 1.0 mL of 150 mM ferric trichloride (dissolved in 1.2 M HCl) were added. After the mixture reacted for 15 min, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 667 nm to compute endogenous H2S concentration. The activities of L-cysteine desulfhydrase 1 (DES1) and D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD) were determined based on the release of H2S from L-cysteine or D-cysteine when dithiothreitol (DTT) was present, following the method described by Riemenschneider et al. (2005) with slight modifications. DES1 activity was determined by the following steps. Tall fescue samples (0.5 g) were triturated with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and transferred to 5.0 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0). Then, the extract was centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min to collect the enzymes extract. One milliliter extract was added into 2.0 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0, containing 0.8 mM L-cysteine and 2.5 mM DTT) for DES1 determination. After 15 min, 1.0 mL of 5 mM N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (dissolved in 7.2 M HCl) and 1.0 mL of 150 mM ferric trichloride (dissolved in 1.2 M HCl) were added to terminate the reaction. The absorbance of the reaction liquid was obtained in the same way as for endogenous H2S measurement. When D-cysteine desulfhydrase was measured, L-cysteine and Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) were replaced by D-cysteine and Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), respectively."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis In this study, each experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three biological replicates. Using SPSS 22 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the data were tested by using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene's test. Homoscedastic data with normal distributions was subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for significance tests, with Duncan's multiple range tests at P < 0.05 threshold to determine differences between treatment means. All figures were all drawn using SigmaPlot (version 12.5, SYSTAT Software, Richmond, CA, USA)."
11,Results,
12,Morphology and photosynthetic parameters,"3.1 Morphology and photosynthetic parameters Significant differences were first observed in the morphology between different treatments (Fig. 1 A). Under LL stress, total biomass of tall fescue was significantly decreased, with a reduction of 46.35% compared to control plants. When exogenous H2S was added, the total biomass of tall fescue increased by 50.30%. However, biomass declined with the HT (H2S scavenger) treatment under LL stress (Fig. 1B). Under LL stress, P n and F v/F m were evidently decreased, whereas they were significantly enhanced, by 20.02% and 3.95%, under H2S application compared to the LL treatment alone, respectively. Under LL stress, HT (H2S scavenger) addition was found to inhibit the photosynthesis and electron transport in tall fescue compared to LL stress alone (Fig. 1C and D)."
13,Photosynthetic pigment contents,"3.2 Photosynthetic pigment contents Photosynthetic pigments, typically including Chl and Car, are essential to the absorption, transfer, and conversion of light in photosynthesis. Under LL treatment, the contents of total Chl, Chl a, Chl b and Car respectively decreased by 9.24%, 34.96%, 29.70%, and 33.89%, compared to control plants. However, the application of exogenous H2S significantly increased their contents by 5.60%, 27.66%, 20.68%, and 21.38%, compared with LL treatment alone, respectively. However, these increases were reversed by treatment with HT (Fig. 2 )."
14,Chlorophyll synthetic precursor contents,"3.3 Chlorophyll synthetic precursor contents The contents of six Chl synthetic precursors, including 5-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrinogen Ⅲ, coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and protochlorophyllide, were also measured. They all reduced significantly to various degrees under LL stress. The content of 5-aminolevulinic acid reduced most by 78.16% (Fig. 3 A), the content of porphobilinogen decreased least by 24.34% (Fig. 3B). The contents of six Chl synthetic precursors were significantly increased in the leaves of tall fescue under exogenous H2S. Compared to LL treatment, 5-aminolevulinic acid content increased the most, by 281.73%, while porphobilinogen content increased least, by 15.47%. Moreover, HT addition apparently decreased the contents of five precursors, but not coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ, compared to LL alone (Fig. 3)."
15,Transcript levels of chlorophyll enzymes,"3.4 Transcript levels of chlorophyll enzymes The expression levels of Chl synthesis enzyme genes were detected by qRT-PCR. After LL treatment, the transcript levels of FaHEML1, FaHEMB, FaHEMD, FaHEMG, FaDVR, FaCHL, and FaCAO decreased compared to control seedlings (Fig. 4 ). Meanwhile, exogenous H2S significantly enhanced the transcript levels of all these genes. For FaHEMF, LL treatment had no effect on its expression level, but it was evidently enhanced, by 3.33 times, under exogenous H2S compared to LL treatment alone (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we found that HT could indeed reverse the responses of exogenous H2S. Chl degradation enzyme genes were also associated with variation in Chl contents. Remarkable increases in FaNYC1, FaNOL, FaPPH, and FaPAO transcript levels were observed in plants exposed to LL stress, whereas the application of exogenous H2S appeared to significantly decrease their expression levels when compared with the LL alone treatment (Fig. 4). In addition, the HT treatment evidently increased the transcript levels of FaNYC1, FaNOL, FaPPH, and FaPAO."
16,Carotenoid components,"3.5 Carotenoid components Car can regulate LL stress through light capture and antioxidant defense in plants. Compared with control plants, tall fescue under LL stress showed apparent reductions of 40.46%, 29.45%, 64.51%, 30.68%, and 13.75% in the contents of β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin, respectively (Fig. 5 ). Additionally, treatment with exogenous H2S increased the production of these compounds compared to LL treatment alone. Nevertheless, HT treatment significantly decreased these five components under LL stress. Although antheraxanthin content showed a similar trend (Fig. 5D), the addition of HT had no significant effect compared to LL treatment alone."
17,Transcript levels of carotenoid enzymes,"3.6 Transcript levels of carotenoid enzymes In order to elucidate the pattern of variation of Car, the expression levels of FaPSY, FaZDS, FaLCYb, FaLCYe, FaCHYE, FaVDE, and FaZEP were detected. Genes encoding Car synthesis enzymes all showed significantly down-regulated expression levels when plants were under LL treatment, compared to control plants (Fig. 6 ). Nevertheless, compared with plants under LL treatment, all transcript levels of these genes revealed remarkable increases after exogenous H2S was added. Among these genes, FaZEP showed the highest up-regulation. The response was reversed in all of these genes under treatment with HT alone. LL treatment remarkably decreased the expression of FaNCED4, which encodes an enzyme involved in Car degradation, while its expression slightly increased after the application of exogenous H2S. The HT treatment instead significantly weakened the effect of H2S. The trend in FaCCD1 was similar to that of FaNCED4 across treatments (Fig. 6)."
18,Activity and transcript levels of H2S-related enzymes,"3.7 Activity and transcript levels of H2S-related enzymes To further explore the effect of H2S, endogenous H2S concentration and H2S-biosynthesis enzymes activities were measured. Neither LL- nor HT-treated plants showed higher endogenous H2S concentrations than that in plants which received exogenous H2S (Fig. 7 A). The average H2S concentration of LL and HT treatments significantly decreased by 40.22% and 70.34%, respectively, compared to the exogenous H2S treatment. The results of DES1 and DCD activities displayed a similar tendency (Fig. 7B and C). LL stress markedly increased their activities compared to control plants. In addition, the application of exogenous H2S led to a more significant increase compared with LL treatment. However, the H2S scavenger HT remarkably decreased the activities of these two enzymes. FaDES1 and FaDCD encode DES1 and DCD, respectively, in tall fescue. Their expression levels were very similar (Fig, 7D, E). LL treatment alone enhanced the expression of both FaDES1 and FaDCD, compared to control treatment, while HT evidently decreased their expression levels under LL stress. When compared with LL treatment, application of exogenous H2S increased FaDES1 and FaDCD transcript levels by 6.40% and 19.78%, respectively."
19,Discussion,"Low light intensity is one of the major reasons for turfgrass decline worldwide (Emmons, 2008). In this study, weaker performances were observed in LL-treated tall fescue plants, manifesting as decreased total biomass and turf quality (Fig. 1B). Similar research in perennial ryegrass and Arabidopsis thaliana L. has shown that insufficient light dramatically decreased the biomass of plants under LL treatment (Fu et al., 2020; Yavari et al., 2021). However, the application of exogenous H2S alleviated this inhibition of plant growth (Fig. 1B), in agreement with the findings of Duan et al. (2015). P n and F v/F m were found to provide vital information about photosynthetic capacity and PSII photochemistry characteristics, respectively (Zhang et al., 2018). In the present study, the P n and F v/F m values of H2S-treated plants were higher than those of plants only treated with LL (Fig. 1C and D). This indicated that H2S can alleviate photosystem damage induced by LL stress and enhance electron transport efficiency, especially in PSⅡ. This protective mechanism may be realized by the reaction center D1 protein, which was reported in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) exposed to drought stress as well (Li et al., 2015). Apparently, H2S is involved in photosynthetic improvement and subsequently contributed to LL tolerance in tall fescue. Photosynthetic pigments are key factors that reflect plant photosynthetic capacity (Takai et al., 2010). In the present study, the contents of Chl and Car were respectively decreased by LL stress and enhanced by H2S addition (Fig. 2), possibly through involvement of the biosynthesis and biodegradation of pigments in tall fescue. Our results are consistent with those of Tang et al. (2020), who demonstrated the role of H2S in preventing degradation of Chl under low temperature stress. A positive effect of exogenous H2S in photosynthetic pigment metabolism was also observed in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth (Bharwana et al., 2014). The biosynthetic pathway of Chl a and Chl b in angiosperm plants was first reported as a 15-step reaction starting from L-glutamyl-tRNA and catalyzed by 15 enzymes encoded by 27 genes (Matsumoto et al., 2004; Beale, 2005; Liu et al., 2017). Moreover, the degradation of Chl was mainly conducted through the PAO pathway from Chl b to nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs) (Lin et al., 2016). Chl metabolism might significantly affect the whole photosynthetic mechanism, especially light capture and optical signal communication (Tanaka and Tanaka, 2006; Wu et al., 2018). Therefore, abiotic stress caused by unfavorable environmental conditions influences the contents of Chl precursors, relevant enzymes activities, and expression levels of these genes. In this study, reductions of Chl biosynthetic precursors and down-regulation of associated genes were observed under both the LL and HT treatments (Figs. 3 and 4). This implied that the decrease in Chl content induced by stress resulted from the suppression of biosynthesis across each step. A research on pakchoi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) demonstrated that the decreased chlorophyll content may result from inhibition of ALA synthesis in leaves under cold stress (Wang et al., 2021). Similarly, NaHCO3 stress decreased HEMD and CAO genes expression in the process of Chl synthesis, consistent with that of their proteins (Zhang et al., 2020). Correspondingly, higher transcript levels of genes involved in Chl degradation were observed under LL stress, which demonstrated that LL stress decreased Chl content by degrading as well. Notably, when supplied with exogenous H2S, not only were Chl synthetic precursors and biosynthesis-related genes upregulated, but the expression levels of degradation genes were suppressed. These results agreed with those of Alamri et al. (2020), who verified the roles of NO and H2S in enhancing photosynthesis via regulating 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (encoded by HEMB) and chlorophyllase (a Chl biodegrading enzyme) activities. Research on kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) also demonstrated the positive effects of the upregulation of several genes involved in Chl biosynthesis under osmotic stress (Niu and Ma, 2018). Furthermore, intermediates of Chl degradation exhibited a phototoxicity to plant cells and chloroplasts (Hörtensteiner, 2013), hence the down-regulation of FaNOL, FaNYC1, FaPPH, and FaPAO as mediated by H2S also alleviated the damage to chloroplasts under LL stress. Therefore, H2S might act as a signal molecule directly enhancing Chl precursors contents and regulating genes expression in Chl metabolism. Car were reported to take part in light harvesting, energy transferring, and antioxidant properties (Chen et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Saini et al., 2018). Car biosynthesis is currently understood to proceed from a reaction consisting of several steps from isopentenyl pyrophosphate, among which lycopene was thought to be a vital node (Nisar et al., 2015). A portion of the synthesized lycopene is catalyzed by lycopene ε-cyclase (ε-LCY) and ε-carotene hydroxylase (ε-CHY), which were encoded by LCYe and CHYE, respectively, into lutein. Another portion of lycopene is converted into β-carotene by lycopene β-cyclase (β-LCY), which was encoded by LCYb. Previous research clarified the function of β-carotenoid in photosystem to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), principally in the PSII centers (D'Alessandro and Havaux, 2019). Similarly, lutein was involved in light capture by assisting with Chl a under stress (Liu et al., 2004). In the present study, the addition of exogenous H2S evidently enhanced FaLCYb, FaCHYE, and FaLCYe expression levels and the contents of lutein and β-carotene compared with LL treatment alone. This was associated with the downstream increase of Car components contents, such as zeaxanthin and neoxanthin. However, the effect was reversed under inhibition by supplemental HT (Figs. 5 and 6). Consistent with our findings, a study in transgenic sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) demonstrated that the up-regulation of β-LCY (a FaLCYb homolog) and down-regulation of ε-LCY (a FaLCYe homolog) were required for the increase of β-carotene content to resist salt stress (Li et al., 2017). Another study indicated that overexpressing AgLCY-ε (a FaLCYe homolog) resulted in greater salt tolerance associated with β-carotene and lutein increases (Yin et al., 2020). Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) generally catalyzed the generation of carotenoid-derived hormones such as strigolactone (SL) and ABA, with the destruction of Car (Wang et al., 2019). Previous research revealed that the CCD gene family was negatively correlated with Car accumulation (Nisar et al., 2015). However, our qRT-PCR results for FaCCD1 and FaNCED4 were contrary to these previous results, as they were increased by H2S application (Fig. 6). This disparity might be attributed to the comprehensive mechanism of Car degradation, in which several genes (CCDs and NCEDs) played a collective part. Thus, we proposed the involvement of exogenous H2S in photosynthetic pigment metabolism ultimately enhanced photosynthesis. H2S might act as a signal molecule increasing Car components contents, further scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and involving in light capture indirectly. The improvement in tolerance of LL stress in tall fescue is also relevant to endogenous H2S itself. On the one hand, an increase in endogenous H2S concentration was observed under the H2S treatment compared to LL alone in this work, whereas HT impaired the effect prominently (Fig. 7). This result agreed with those of Liu et al. (2019) and Chen et al. (2011), in which H2S was thought to be a signal molecule regulating physiological process. Also, other research indicated that the application of H2S may have a positively effect on helping maintaining appropriate sulfur level in plants (Kopriva et al., 2019). On the other hand, the activation of H2S-released enzymes and encoding genes was also detected. Recent research has clarified that the Cys persulfidation of DES1 can increase its activity and induce H2S generation (Shen et al., 2020; Aroca et al., 2021). Additionally, in our present research, the activity levels of DES1 and DCD were reinforced and weakened by H2S and HT, respectively, in agreement with results under salt-alkali stress (Jiang et al., 2019). At the same time, consistent variation was observed in the expression levels of FaDES1 and FaDCD (Fig. 7). Similarly, DES1-over-expressing plants had higher H2S contents and production rates, accompanied by enhanced drought resistance (Jin et al., 2018). However, different mechanisms were also found in Arabidopsis des1 mutants, which displayed decreased DES1 activity but enhanced tolerance to Cd stress (Álvarez et al., 2010). Thus, more evidence on the relationship between H2S synthesis genes and H2S signaling under LL stress is merited (Fig. 8 ). In summary, LL stress promoted endogenous H2S release by increasing the transcript levels of FaDES1 and FaDCD and activating the DES1 and DCD pathways. Thus, H2S might involve in enhancing photosynthesis by means of increasing total biomass and regulating Chl and Car metabolisms, further protecting against the detrimental effects of LL stress."
