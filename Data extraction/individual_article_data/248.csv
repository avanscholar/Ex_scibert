0,Introduction,"In the past few years, catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived platform compounds to fuels and chemicals has caught a lot of attention [1]. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA), as a versatile chemical intermediate, has been widely used for producing resins, synthetic fibers, and the fine chemicals, etc. [2]. FFA is one of the most promising potential platform compounds derived from lignocelluloses biomass, and has been commercially produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural (FF) with diverse catalysts. Among these catalysts, the Cu-Cr has been often used for producing FFA, yet this catalyst can cause severe environmental pollution because of its high toxicity of Cr (VI) [3,4]. In this scenario, numerous research teams have taken a great effort to synthesize different Cr-free catalysts with noble (Pt, Pd, and Ru) [5–7] or non-noble metal (Cu, Ni, and Co) [8–10] for FFA production. Nevertheless, these FFA production procedures are greatly dependent on H2, which is mostly derived from reforming of non-renewable natural gas, petroleum or coal resources [11,12]. Thus, any new strategy that could minimize the utilization of externally added H2 would be highly desirable. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) has been evidenced as a green and cost-effective method for hydrogenation reaction [12,13]. In the CTH process, multiple hydrogen donors including alcohols, organic acids, and hydrazine instead of exogenous H2 have been employed in the published studies [14,15], which made it possible to reduce the use of high pressure autoclaves. In recent years, formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source has attracted extensive attention because it is sustainable, that is, it can be generated from biomass through acid hydrolysis or oxidation [16,17]. Meanwhile, it is more convenient and safer for the storage and transportation of FA than the gaseous H2. FA as a hydrogen donor in the CTH reactions has been well understood in the reduction of carbonyl functionalities [12,18,19]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the production of FFA by a straightforward conversion of FF and FA has rarely been achieved. Just recently, a CTH reaction was reported by Neeli et al. [20]. However, the catalyst of Rh/ED-KIT-6 used in their study requires a very complex preparation process and also needs high-loading of noble metal (50.42 wt% Rh). In general, the noble metal-based catalysts especially Pd can efficiently decompose FA to produce hydrogen under mild conditions [21,22]. However, they are short of high selectivity for hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in the furyl ring [7,23]. By contrary, the Cu-based catalysts exhibited the high selectivity toward hydrogenation of the carbonyl group leaving the CC double bonds in the furyl ring intact, and they are also relatively inactive for hydrogenolysis of the saturated CO bond [24]. Moreover, Fulajtarova et al. have developed the 5% Pd-5% Cu supported MgO catalyst to convert FF to FFA under 0.6 Mpa H2 with the exceptional FFA selectivity of 98% [25]. Therefore, the above results inspired us to take full advantages of the two metals as a bifunctional catalyst for FF hydrogenation to FFA using FA as the hydrogen donor. Based on the review above, the physically mixed CuO and Pd/C were used for the conversion of FF and FA to FFA under mild conditions without the supply of an external hydrogen source in the present study. The catalyst properties and effects of the mass ratio of Cu/Pd, molar ratio of FF/FA, reaction temperature and time on hydrogenation reaction were investigated in turn. Furthermore, the underlying catalytic mechanism of Cu-Pd/C in FF hydrogenation to FFA was explored."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials FF, FFA, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), Furan, 1, 4-dioxane, methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and n-hexane were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich China Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). FA was purchased from Aladdin Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All reagents used in this study were analytical grade. The Pd/C (5 wt% Pd, containing 40–60% water), as well as CuO, Cu(HCOO)2·4H2O (98%), HCOONa, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and K2CO3 were supplied from Aladdin Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). In order to maintain the purity, the commercial FF and FFA were treated by vacuum distillation before use."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The catalyst used in this study was a physical mixture of commercial CuO and Pd/C powder. That is, CuO and Pd/C were directly added into the reactant solution without any other operation. The non-commercial CuO was also prepared by the modified co-precipitation method in this study. The details are: a 200 mL salt solution containing desired amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and a 200 mL K2CO3 aqueous solution ([CO3 2−] = 2 [Cu2+]) were simultaneously added, dropwise, into the round flask with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 3 h, the resulting precipitate was aged overnight, then washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral, and finally dried at 110 °C overnight. The obtained materials were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h under air atmosphere."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained by using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source at the following parameters: 30 mA, 40 kV, and 2θ from 10° to 90° at a scanning speed of 10°/min. The N2 adsorption-desorption analysis was performed for determining the specific surface area and pore distribution of the catalysts by using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88. Prior to the measurement of adsorption, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 373 K for 4 h. The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping images were observed by using a ZEISS SUPRA 55 SAPPHIRE field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) element mapping was carried out by using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was measured by using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. In a typical experiment for H2-TPR, 30 mg sample was first loaded into a U-shaped, flow-through, and quartz sample tube. Prior to the measurement, the sample was preheated under a He flow (20 mL/min) at 550 °C for 1 h to remove adsorbed species on the surface of sample. The reactor was then cooled down to 100 °C, and H2/Ar (10 vol% H2) mixture was introduced. The TPR test was conducted under a H2/Ar flow by increasing the temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed by using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer under a base pressure less than 2 × 10−9 mbar. A monochromatic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) excitation energy source was adopted."
5,Hydrogenation reaction,"2.4 Hydrogenation reaction The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FF to FFA was performed using a 50 mL Parr reactor. In a typical run, the reactor was loaded with 0.3 g FF, 20 mL 1, 4-dioxane, 0.575 g FA, and 0.04 g mixed solid catalysts. Then the reactor was sealed. After purging with N2 for 3–5 times, the reactor was heated to the target temperature, and then kept for a certain amount of time. Then the reactor was cooled to room temperature quickly, and the gas and liquid were collected separately for subsequent analysis."
6,Leaching and recycling tests,"2.5 Leaching and recycling tests In the leaching test, the catalyst was removed from the reaction system after the reaction lasted for 1.5 h. And then the reaction was continued for another 4.5 h at 170 °C. The products were sampled and analyzed at the time of 2 h, 2.5 h, 3 h, and 6 h, respectively. The reusability test of in-situ prepared Cu-Pd/C catalyst was performed as follows. After each reaction complete, the solution was taken out and centrifuged. Subsequently, the supernatant obtained from each cycle was collected for products analyses, while the precipitate was directly used in the next cycle after washing several times by 1, 4-dioxane."
7,Products analyses,"2.6 Products analyses The gaseous product was analyzed by using a Shimadzu GC-2010 system equipped with TCD detector and Agilent CP-7429 column. The liquid product was detected by using Agilent 7890 series equipped with DB-Waxetr column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm, Agilent) and flame ionization detector (FID) operated at 270 °C. The flow rate of carrier gas (N2) was 1.0 mL/min. The following programmed temperature was applied: 40 °C (4 min) - 15 °C/min - 250 °C (5 min). FF conversion (XFF, %), FFA selectivity (SFFA, %) and FFA yield (YFFA, %) were, respectively, calculated according to the following equations: X FF = 1 - mol of FF in products mol of FF in substrate × 100 % S FFA = mol of FFA in productions mol of FF in susbstrate - mol of FF in production × 100 % Y F F A =S FFA × X FF × 100 %"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD analyses The XRD patterns of monometallic Pd/C, CuO, and physically mixed CuO-Pd/C catalysts before and after reaction were obtained for their crystallinity analyses. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the three fresh catalysts Pd/C, CuO, and physically mixed CuO-Pd/C exhibited respective characteristic peaks [26,27], indicating that the crystal structure of CuO-Pd/C was unaffected by the physical mixture. Notably, the characteristic peaks of Pd in physically mixed CuO-Pd/C should be overlapped by the much stronger signal peaks of CuO, resulting in their invisibility. Compared to the fresh CuO-Pd/C, the peak patterns of CuO-Pd/C-0.5 h changed significantly. The characteristic peaks of Cu and Cu2O appeared with the disappearance of the characteristic peaks of CuO (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the CuO had been in-situ reduced at the initial stage of the reaction. Considering the hydrogenation reaction usually lasted for 3 h, the in-situ reduced Cu or Cu2O rather than CuO was believed to played a key role in the FF hydrogenation. In order to further characterize the dimension of Cu or Cu2O, their crystallite sizes were calculated according to the Scherrer equation. The crystallite sizes of Cu and Cu2O were 16.7 nm and 12.1 nm respectively, according to the full widths at half maximum of 2θ around 43.3° and 36.3° (Table 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic peaks of CuO were not detected in all the used Cu-based catalysts, indicating that the CuO was completely reduced after the hydrogenation. Unexpectedly, both the Cu-Pd/C-blank and Cu-Pd/C-1st showed a peak centered at around 41.4° between the peaks of Cu and Pd based on the deconvolution patterns, which was defined as the Cu-Pd alloys based on the known study [28]. Intriguingly, the Cu-Pd alloys were also detected in the Cu-Pd/C-5th similar to that in the Cu-Pd/C-1st, indicating its structural stability after multiple recycling process. 3.1.2 Textural properties of the catalysts The textural properties of the fresh and used catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. As shown in entries 1–3 of Table 1, the commercial Pd/C featured the highest BET surface area, exhibiting an excellent catalyst structure; on the contrary, the CuO showed the lowest BET surface area; the physically mixed CuO-Pd/C presented a proportionately decreased BET surface area relative to the Pd/C as expected, which may ascribed to the incorporation of bulk CuO particles. Interestingly, the BET surface area of the in-situ reduced catalyst Cu-Pd/C-blank (Table 1, entry 4) was much higher than that of the mixed CuO-Pd/C. The slight increase in BET surface area of the Cu-Pd/C-blank should result from the loading of nano Cu on the carbon support, the formation mechanism of nano Cu was going to discuss below. Moreover, the morphology change of CuO in the physically mixed CuO-Pd/C before and after reaction was also observed intuitively by their SEM images (Fig. 2c and d). The BET surface area of Cu-Pd/C-1st and Cu-Pd/C-5th still maintained the high values as that of the Cu-Pd/C-blank, highlighting an excellent structural stability of the Cu-Pd/C (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). In addition, the change trend of pore volume was also observed similar to that of the BET surface area, further demonstrating the results of the formation of Cu-Pd/C. 3.1.3 SEM and TEM analyses The typical SEM images of the Pd/C, CuO, the mixed CuO-Pd/C, and the used Cu-Pd/C catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 . Despite a smooth surface of the Pd/C was presented under low magnification, a rough surface of the catalyst was observed with small uniform particles under high magnification (Fig. 2a), which were characterized by the high surface areas (Table 1). Both the separate CuO and mixed CuO were rod-shaped (Fig. 2b and c). Furthermore, the CuO and Pd/C in the physically mixed CuO-Pd/C presented an independent distribution, which could be observed in the mapping profiles of the Pd, C, Cu, and O (Fig. 2c). However, the nano Cu in the used Cu-Pd/C was uniformly distributed on the surface of the Pd/C based on the SEM-EDS analysis (Fig. 2d). Moreover, based on the X-ray and corresponding elemental analyses of the randomly selected four points in the used Cu-Pd/C, both the Pd and Cu located in the same regions on the support surface, and the Pd was not completely covered by Cu on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 2e). Therefore, we inferred that the Cu-Pd alloys were formed during the reaction. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the in-situ reduced Cu-Pd/C was shown in Fig. 2f. The fine Cu particles were uniformly dispersed in the catalyst. The EDX elemental maps analyses demonstrated that the in-situ formed catalyst comprised of the homogeneously distributed Pd, C, Cu, and O elements. Based on the TEM-EDS and SEM-EDS element analyses, it was found that the Cu and Pd overall atomic percent contents of 4.24% and 0.04% (Fig. 2f) were far below their superficial average atomic percent contents of 14.24% and 0.55% (Fig. 2e), demonstrating clearly that both Pd and Cu mainly distributed on the surface of the nano Cu-Pd/C catalyst. 3.1.4 H2-TPR analyses The H2-TPR profiles of the fresh and used catalysts were presented in Fig. 3 . For the fresh catalysts, the separate CuO and physically mixed CuO-Pd/C showed the same reduction peak centered at 256 °C, in accordance with the previous studies [19,29]; while the Pd/C showed multiple peaks in the whole temperature range (Fig. 3a). The Pd-based catalyst possesses strong hydrogen chemisorption capacity based on the study by Jiang et al. [30]. Hence, the multiple peaks of the Pd/C in this study attributed to the absorption of hydrogen during the H2-TPR test. Although the Pd hydrogen absorption peak was partially covered by strong CuO reduction peak in the mixed CuO-Pd/C at low temperature, the absorption peak was detected at above 400 °C, indicating the Pd in the mixed CuO-Pd/C was still presenting strong hydrogen adsorption capacity. For the used catalysts, only the separate CuO-0.5 h showed a weak peak at 215 °C, indicating that the reduced Cu possessed a poor H2 chemisorption capacity. While the other three Pd-containing catalysts showed the similar multiple peaks with those of the fresh Pd/C (Fig. 3b), the position and intensity of these peaks changed greatly relative to the fresh Pd/C. As summarized in Table 2 , the hydrogen adsorption amounts of the catalysts at different temperatures were estimated by integration of the peak areas. Below 400 °C, the adsorption amount of the fresh Pd/C was significantly lower than those of the three used catalysts; whereas the opposite results were presented above 400 °C. Moreover, this phenomenon was further confirmed by the increase of adsorption ratio of low temperature to high temperature from 0.26 to 3.10, which implied that the used Pd-containing catalysts exhibited the much stronger capability of hydrogen adsorption at low temperature. Considering the previous study that the formed Cu-Pd alloys affected H2 desorption property [30] and the variation of the H2-TPR profiles before and after reaction in this study, it is suggested that the Cu-Pd alloys were formed during the reaction. Based on the XRD, SEM, and HRTEM analyses, it is concluded that an excellent hydrogen adsorption capacity of the well-dispersed Cu-Pd alloys contributed to the FFA formation from FF hydrogenation under mild conditions. 3.1.5 XPS analyses To study the chemical environment of the Pd and Cu species, the fresh mixed and used catalysts were determined by XPS analyses. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the fresh and used CuO-Pd/C exhibited an intense doublet centered at 336.2 and 341.3 eV assigning to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, which implied the presence of metallic state (Pd0). However, the catalysts contained a fraction of PdO based on the deconvolution of Pd 3d, which may be from the slowly passivated samples. The doublet peak shift of in-situ reduced Cu-Pd/C against the fresh Pd/C suggested that the formation of Pd-Cu alloys affected the binding energy of Pd. The intensity decrease of the doublet peak in the reduced Cu-Pd/C catalyst demonstrated a surface concentration of Pd decreased relative to that of the fresh catalyst, probable causing by the partial covering of in-situ reduced Cu during the reaction. This could be confirmed by the decrease of Pd surface chemical element content (Table S1). Similarly, the intense and broad peak centered at 934.3 eV (Cu 2p3/2) along with the satellite peaks suggested that the Cu oxidation state was +2 in the fresh mixed CuO-Pd/C (Fig. 4b). However, the deconvolution of Cu 2p3/2 presented two peaks centered at 934.8 eV and 932.7 eV assigning to Cu2+ and Cu0/+ in the Cu-Pd/C after reaction. Furthermore, the peak intensity of Cu0/+ relative to Cu2+ increased dramatically in the used Cu-Pd/C, suggesting the more reduced states Cu situated on the surface of the sample."
10,Catalyst activity,"3.2 Catalyst activity 3.2.1 Effects of FA and FF concentrations on the hydrogenation of FF As we known, FF is sensitive to acidity of FA, the concentrations of FF and FA were thus tested to determine the optimum additions. As shown in Table 3 (entries 1–3), the FF/FA molar ratio of 1:4 revealed the best hydrogenation activity. When increasing the FF/FA molar ratio to 1:5, the selectivity of FFA (SFFA) decreased to 92.1% in spite of FF complete conversion (Table 3, entry 4). It was because the by-product 2-[(formyloxy)methyl]furan was formed in the reaction of FFA with excessive FA [31]. Therefore, the 1:4 M ratio of FF/FA was relatively optimum, and was used in the following hydrogenation of FF. Meantime, the effect of FF concentration on the yield of FFA (YFFA) was investigated. As shown in Table 3, the conversion of FF (XFF) and YFFA kept at a high level with elevating FF concentration from 1.5% to 5% (entries 3, 5, and 6). Even if the concentration of FF reached up to 10%, the XFF was still very high with a slight decrease in S FFA. Obviously, the high FFA yield under a high FF concentration showed the excellent activity of the catalyst. 3.2.2 Effects of Pd and Cu contents on the hydrogenation of FF Based on the different functions of metal species in the physically mixed bimetallic CuO-Pd/C, the effects of Pd and Cu contents on the hydrogenation reaction were investigated. On the one hand, under the constant CuO amount, the amounts of Pd/C from 0 to 0.33% (Pd wt%) were tested. As shown in Fig. 5 a, with increasing the Pd content, XFF and YFFA progressively raised, and finally reached a maximum value at the Pd content of 0.25%; while SFFA remained at a high level under the optimum Cu content. The increases of XFF and YFFA were attributed to an outstanding ability of Pd for FA decomposition to produce hydrogen based on the mechanism analysis below, which was also reported in the previous studies [32–34]. On the other hand, under the constant Pd/C amount, the amounts of CuO from 0 to 5.33% (Cu wt%) were tested. As shown in Fig. 5b, with increasing the amounts of CuO, XFF, YFFA and SFFA also gradually raised. In addition to FFA, the by-product was mainly 2-MF only in the presence of Pd/C (Table S2, entry 1). At the 5.33% Cu, a slight decrease of X FF may result from the partial covering of Pd caused by the agglomeration of excessive Cu (Fig. S1). Dissimilarly, SFFA still remained at a high value, possibly being due to the high selectivity of Cu-based catalysts toward hydrogenation of the CO group of furyl ring, which was in accordance with the previous study [24]. In contrast to the always high selectivity of the former in Fig. 5a, this selectivity continues increased with the increase of Cu content in Fig. 5b, indicating that Cu was the key factor determining the selectivity. 3.2.3 Effects of the reaction temperature and time on the hydrogenation of FF The effects of reaction temperature and time on catalytic efficiency were carried out at the conditions of 0.01 g CuO (2.66 wt% Cu) and 0.03 g Pd/C (0.25 wt% Pd). Both XFF and YFFA were relatively low when below 160 °C (Fig. 6 a), which may result from the low hydrogenation rate at low temperature [35]. Then, the FF complete conversion with the SFFA of 98.1% were obtained at 170 °C. But the YFFA slightly decreased at 180 °C, which was due to the hydrogenolysis of FFA to 2-MF (Table S2, entry 2). This result was consistent with the previous study that Pd exhibited the stronger capability of hydrodeoxygenation at higher temperature (200 °C) [36]. In addition, a range of reaction times were determined. As shown in Fig. 6b, the XFF and YFFA gradually increased with prolonging the reaction time until it stabilized after 3.0 h. In contrast, the SFFA was relatively stable within temperature ranges of 140–170 °C and reaction times of 1–3.5 h, indicating that the physically mixed CuO-Pd/C possessed an excellent selectivity for the CTH of FF to FFA. 3.2.4 Effect of the polarity of solvents on the hydrogenation of FF In addition to the above studies, the effect of polarity of four solvents on the hydrogenation of FF was investigated. As shown in Table 4 , the two medium polar aprotic solvents (1,4-dioxane and THF) and non-polar n-hexane presented much higher XFF against the strong polar protic solvent methanol. Dissimilarly, 1,4-dioxane and THF showed much higher SFFA relative to the two other. The analyses below (see Section 3.3) indicated that the CuO was first dissolved and then reduced by H-species. Accordingly, the Cu2+ form in the different solvents affected the reduction and consequent hydrogenation. In the present study, we found that the different solutions with the same concentration of Cu(HCOO)2 presented different colors (Fig. S2). The chain coordination polymer CuBr2(1,4-dioxane)2(H2O)2 presented in the 1,4-dioxane based on the study by Shi et al. [37]. The new vibration adsorption peak at 1168 and 1725 cm−1 of Cu(HCOO)2–1,4-dioxane relative to the pure 1,4-dioxane appeared in the FTIR spectra (Fig. S3), and the maximum adsorption wavelengths of Cu(HCOO)2 in H2O (786 nm) and 1,4-dioxane (663 nm) were significantly different in the UV–vis spectra (Fig. S4), implying that the Cu2+ existed in the 1,4-dioxane in the form of a coordination polymer, which was helpful to disperse and reduce Cu2+ to more uniform small nano Cu particles."
11,The evolution of CuO in the hydrogenation reaction,"3.3 The evolution of CuO in the hydrogenation reaction The chemical form of CuO would change during the hydrogenation reaction, which had been confirmed based on the results of catalyst characterization mentioned above. Therefore, figuring out the CuO evolution would be helpful to propose the hydrogenation mechanism. The one-step reaction described above did not clearly reveal the intermediate state of CuO reduction to Cu, so the two-step reaction was designed to explore this process. Firstly, the CuO was dissolved into Cu2+ by FA in 1,4-dioxane, and then the Pd/C and FF were added to the resultant solution, following reaction for a certain time. Disappointedly, the low XFF and YFFA were obtained in the two-step reaction despite the CuO was completely dissolved in the first step (Table 5 , entry 1). Surprisingly, the high XFF and YFFA could be achieved when increasing the amounts of CuO and Pd/C (Table 5, entry 2). By comparison with the concentration of Cu2+ in the first-step, it was found that the Cu2+ obviously increased with increasing the amount of CuO (Table S3, entries 1 and 2). These results indicated that the Cu2+ in the solution affect the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Based on the remarkable difference between the detection value (1.16 ppm, Table S3, entry 1) and the theoretical value (400 ppm) of the Cu2+ in the first-step solution, it was inferred that almost dissolved CuO was reduced to Cu by the in-situ hydrogen in the first step (Fig. 7 , commercial CuO had a weak ability to produce hydrogen by decomposition of FA), resulting in the absence of formed Cu-Pd alloys and the low reaction activity in the second step. In contrast, a sufficient amount of Cu2+ from the enough amount of CuO could be reduced on the surface of Pd/C and then formed Cu-Pd alloys. The combined evidences, including the solution color change from blue to colorless (Fig. S5), Cu2+ concentration in the reduced solution (Table S3, entries 1–4) and the XRD pattern of the two-step reaction catalyst (Fig. S6), indicated that the dissolved Cu2+ was reduced to Cu, which formed Cu-Pd alloys with Pd/C. To further confirm the evolution of CuO, Cu(HCOO)2 and Cu(NO3)2 were used in this reaction to replace of CuO. As shown in Table 5 entries 3 and 4, the high XFF and YFFA were achieved under the above-mentioned Cu salts, implying that (i) the Cu2+ functioned in this hydrogenation reaction, and (ii) Cu salts should be a great substitute for CuO, as a catalyst precursor for this hydrogenation reaction. The reduction of Cu2+ and the formation of Cu-Pd alloys were evidenced by the XRD patterns of the two Cu salts catalysts after reaction (Fig. S7). In addition, to identify the prerequisite of the CuO dissolution, the HCOONa in place of FA was used in this reaction (Table 5 entry 5). The low YFFA of 5.1% may be caused by either HCOO− incapable of providing hydrogen or the non-dissolution of CuO by HCOONa. However we found that the HCOO− could be used as hydrogen donor according to a high YFFA of 74.7% when using Cu(HCOO)2 instead of FA and CuO (Table 5, entry 6). Hence, non-dissolution of CuO by HCOONa brought about the low reaction activity. The XRD analysis demonstrated that the Cu2+ could be reduced to Cu under the presence of Cu(HCOO)2; the CuO did not be dissolved under the presence of HCOONa (Fig. S8). As a results, the acidity of FA was necessary for dissolution CuO into Cu2+."
12,The reaction mechanism on the hydrogenation of FF to FFA,"3.4 The reaction mechanism on the hydrogenation of FF to FFA To shed light on the reaction mechanism for the hydrogenation of FF to FFA, we firstly determined the function of Cu and Pd. The three catalysts including commercial Pd/C, commercial CuO and prepared CuO were used for the FF hydrogenation. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 7, the Pd/C produced the most amount of hydrogen, indicating that it was responsible for hydrogen production. Conversely, the commercial CuO produced small amount of hydrogen, which was inconsistent with previous study [12]. When the prepared CuO was used for the hydrogen production, the amount of hydrogen significantly increased. Therefore, we deduced that the structural difference between the commercial and prepared CuO brought about the different capability for decomposing FA to producing hydrogen. On the other hand, a high SFFA but low XFF were obtained using the CuO under the 3Mpa H2 (Table 6 , entry 1), while the opposite results were observed using the Pd/C (Table 6, entry 2). Compared with the results under FA as in-situ hydrogen source, the high hydrogen pressure promoted the SFFA when using CuO as catalyst; while for Pd/C, although the XFF increased significantly, it stimulated the side reaction to generate THFA, the over-reduction product of FF. Accordingly, it was validated that Cu played a major role in increasing the FFA selectivity through the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group (CO) [9], while the high hydrogenation activity of Pd brought about over-reduction under the sufficient H2. The function of the Cu-Pd alloys was further explored in this hydrogenation reaction. When using the physically mixed CuO-Pd/C, the Pd, and the nano Cu originated from CuO formed the Cu-Pd alloys (Fig. 1b). However, substituted CuO with commercial Cu, the Cu-Pd alloys were not formed based on the XRD patterns (Fig. S9), accompanied by the low YFFA of 14.8% (Table 6, entry 3). The results, combined with previous research on the H2-TPR analyses (Table 2), confirmed that the Pd in Cu-Pd alloys functioned in increasing the FF conversion by enhancing hydrogen adsorption capacity. In addition, the hydrogenation of FF over physically mixed CuO-Pd/C under 3 Mpa H2 was also carried out to examine the mechanism of the CTH of FF to FFA. As shown in Table 6 entry 4, although the XFF was high, the product distribution with physically mixed CuO-Pd/C was similar to that with the Pd/C alone (Table 6 entry 2) and the SFFA of 20.2% was far below that of 98.1% under FA as in-situ hydrogen source, indicating that the high H2 pressure promoted the conversion of FF, but decreased the selectivity of FFA. When the H2 pressure reduced from 3 Mpa to 1.5 Mpa, the obvious increase of the SFFA and decrease of the XFF were observed (Table 6 entry 5). Evidently, the FA decomposition of Cu-Pd alloys provided the moderate in-situ hydrogen source with H species adsorbed directly on the Cu-Pd alloys surface, promoting the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FF to FFA and avoiding the over-reduction of FF. Therefore, based on the analyses above and previous studies [20,38,39], the plausible reaction mechanism for the CTH of FF to FFA was proposed, as illustrated in Scheme 1 . Initially, CuO was dissolved by FA to form Cu(HCOO)2, which was adsorbed on the surface of the Pd/C [22]. And then, the HCOO− species were decomposed by Pd to Pd-H species along with the release of CO2. Subsequently, the Cu2+ was in-situ reduced by Pd-H species to nano Cu, which uniformly distributed on the Pd/C surface and formed the Cu-Pd alloys in this reaction. The FF was adsorbed by the Lewis acidic sites on the surface of the Cu-Pd/C through carbonyl oxygen atom (The Lewis acid sites were determined based on the analyses of NH3-TPD in Fig. S10 and Py-FTIR in Fig. S11). Finally, the hydrogen atoms on the Cu-Pd alloys surface were transferred to the carbonyl carbon of FF, resulting in the formation of FFA."
13,Leaching and reusability tests,"3.5 Leaching and reusability tests In order to exclude the contribution of leached Cu and/or Pd species to the reaction, leaching tests were performed in this study. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture after 1.5 h, both the XFF and YFFA remained unchanged even the reaction time was prolonged for another 4.5 h. The result revealed that the active specie did not leach into the resulted solution. In the reusability tests, the XFF and SFFA remained stable from the 1st to 5th cycle, in spite of the presence of a slight downward trend of them (Fig. 8b). It indicated that the Cu-Pd/C exhibited an outstanding stability during the FF hydrogenation, which was also verified by the N2-BET and XRD analyses above. The slight decrease in YFFA might be due to the weight loss of the catalyst during the recovery process."
14,Conclusions,"The in-situ prepared Cu-Pd/C catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity for FF to FFA using FA as hydrogen donor. In the process of catalyst formation, the Cu2+ from CuO dissolved uniformly dispersed in 1,4-dioxane solution. Then the Cu2+ was further reduced to nano Cu by in situ Pd-H, and then the Cu-Pd alloys formed in this process. The FFA selectivity of 98.1% and complete FF conversion were achieved at the optimal reaction conditions. The selectivity of FFA was greatly dependent on the proportion of Cu. The reaction mechanism study revealed that the Cu mainly acted on improving the selectivity of FFA, and the Pd was mainly responsible for increasing FF conversion by enhancing hydrogen adsorption capacity. Furthermore, Cu salts instead of CuO could also be used as a potential catalyst precursor for the hydrogenation reduction. Finally, the in-situ prepared Cu-Pd/C catalyst exhibited stable structure and outstanding recycle property."
