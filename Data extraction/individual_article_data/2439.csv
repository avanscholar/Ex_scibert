0,Introduction,"New energy supplier systems are urgently needed to comply with environmental restrictions and decrease the dependence on petroleum. Investigations show that hydrogen is a strong candidate as an environment friendly energy carrier. Metal borohydrides are the best hydrogen storage materials known since they are nonflammable, are easy to transport, produce no pollution and yield high amounts of energy that can then be converted to different forms. Sodium borohydride occupies the center stage in these efforts as an environment friendly clean fuel. It contains 10.8wt% hydrogen. Practical use of hydrogen energy is strongly dependent on easiness and feasibility of hydrogen storage and production. NaBH4 was firstly synthesized by Schlesinger et al. [1] according to the following reaction: (1) 4NaH+B(OCH3)3 ⇄NaBH4 +3NaOCH3 Reacting diboron and elemental sodium may be an alternative way in producing NaBH4. Dehydrated borax, quartz and sodium metal can also yield NaBH4 under a hydrogen atmosphere at 450–500°C [2]. Boron oxide and sodium hydride can react at about 340°C to yield NaBH4. Calcium or magnesium hydrides tend to react with NaBO2, a by-product of dehydration, to yield NaBH4 [3]. In order to obtain hydrogen, an alkaline NaBH4 solution in water is prepared with NaOH or KOH. These basic substances suppress sudden hydrogen release. Water alone is never enough to take all the hydrogen from metal borohydrides in a reasonable time span, therefore suitable long-life catalyst must be used [4]. Catalytic applications are advantageous since hydrogen and water can be recovered [5–7]. Thermal method is not the preferred in hydrogenation since high temperatures are required and the yield is low [6]. Sodium borohydride can be used as a hydrogen source and it can be made to retake hydrogen into its structure [8,9]. In this article, sodium borohydride, an indispensable hydrogen source for fuel cells, is attempted to be synthesized according to Reaction (1). Different reactant ratios, temperatures and times were tried. The produced NaBH4 is purified and different catalysts are applied for an effective dehydrogenation."
1,Experimental,"NaH and ethylene diamine with 99% purity were bought from Merck. Whole of the catalysts were supplied by Aldrich with 98% purity for NiCl2–ZnCl2 and 97% purity for CoCl2–CuCl2 and succinic acid. Trimethyl borate (TMB) was synthesized in a rotary evaporator. Commercial and produced TMB were analyzed with GC–MS and 30% methyl alcohol impurity was found in both, as shown in Fig. 1 . NaH and TMB were placed in a 150ml stainless steel reactor under argon atmosphere. Reactant ratios in the reactor were changed from 0.847 to 2.260mol TMB/mol NaH during the operation. The reactor lid was closed and the sample was treated at 225, 250 and 275°C for 45, 90 and 150min. The reactor was then opened under argon atmosphere and the liquid phase was taken away. Samples were analyzed with FT-IR. For purification, the solid component was dissolved with ethylene diamine and filtrated at 75°C. The solution was then dried under argon atmosphere at room temperature. Ethylene diamine vapor was held in a cold trap. This purification process was repeated 4 times. Synthesized product was analyzed with a titrimetric method [10], XRF equipped with SEM and XRD. In order to dehydrogenate the product, only 0.1g of produced NaBH4 was mixed with 0.05g of NaOH and just 1ml of water was introduced to the dehydrogenation reactor in the presence of catalyst. The hydrogen produced was measured by burette connected to the reactor as illustrated in Fig. 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Reaction time,"3.1 Reaction time Reactions are usually accelerated and reach their maximum rate when the conditions are right. Time is an important factor determining the reactants residence and interaction in the reactor. Thus, optimum time required for obtaining satisfactory conversion must be investigated. Generally, infinite time gives best yield unless the reaction is reversible. In this study 45, 90 and 150min reaction times were investigated. FT-IR analysis is given in Fig. 3 for different times of reaction. At 2800–3000cm−1 methoxy and at 2800–3500cm−1 hydroxide groups of methyl alcohol–TMB are observed. It is well known that FT-IR analysis usually indicates water between 3000 and 3600cm−1, and methyl peaks are between 1500 and 1000cm−1. It is clear that 45min is not enough to obtain the desired product, NaBH4. Its characteristic peaks are seen between 2400 and 2200cm−1 but they are weak for this time span. 150min trial yielded more by-product (BO and BO2 −) which appeared at 1400–1300cm−1. 90min study has more NaBH4 content as seen in Fig. 3. 90min can be taken as the optimum reactor residence time to produce NaBH4 relative to others. Longer durations seem to have no positive effect on the yield and cause slightly more by-product decreasing process feasibility."
4,Reaction temperature,"3.2 Reaction temperature All reactions have a certain temperature to overcome the activation energy levels of reactants. Thus, reaction temperature affects the yield exponentially. In NaBH4 production, the temperature should be kept over 200°C in Schlesinger process [1]. To further optimize for temperature, we repeated the experiment for three temperatures varying from 225 to 275°C. The reaction products were analyzed with FT-IR (Fig. 4 ). The prominent peak observed for the 250°C experiment, at 1100–1200cm−1 must belong to some hydrocarbons including boron hydrogen bonds. A similar peak is also observed at 1630cm−1. Yields given for 225 and 250°C seem superior to the one at 275°C. The 250°C trial has more obvious NaBH4 peaks. It was thus selected as the optimum temperature."
5,Reactant ratios,"3.3 Reactant ratios In order to determine the optimum reactant ratios NaH amount was kept at 2.5g and TMB volume was varied from 15 to 40ml in 5ml increments. Mole ratios of TMB over NaH were thus changed from 0.847 to 2.260. From Fig. 5 , it is apparent that 1.413mol TMB/mol NaH ratio yields more NaBH4. This ratio implies that TMB is used 6 times in excess. Excess of the liquid phase causes a more homogenous reaction environment. Ratios below 1.413mol TMB/mol NaH are not enough for the dispersion or solution of NaH in the reactor. It is apparent that ratios between 1.413 and 2.260 cause a decrease in the yield; probably a result of the reversibility of the reaction."
6,Purification of NaBH4,"3.4 Purification of NaBH4 Sodium methoxide is the main by-product of the NaBH4 production reaction. Fuel used in fuel cells must be as pure as possible. Purification protects catalyst from poisoning and increases the hydrogen release performance. Also pure fuel means purer by-product NaBO2 and is desired and beneficial for recycling NaBO2 back to NaBH4. A few different solvents are commonly used to purify metal borohydrides. Filtration and drying are the necessary steps of crystallization and are the last phases of the purification procedure. In order to obtain purer products these operations may be repeated several times. In our studies ethylene diamine was used as solvent. Solubility of NaBH4 is maximum at 75°C and this is the temperature we maintained. Purity is determined by titrimetric method and with SEM equipped XRF. Na, C and O content of the samples are measured in the elemental analysis. Decreasing oxygen and carbon and increasing sodium indicate that NaOCH3 is taken from the product and purer NaBH4 is synthesized. XRF results of these purification applications can be seen in Fig. 6 . Moreover, titrimetric results of purified, half purified and raw products are supporting this fact with 85.17, 63.49 and 40.32% NaBH4 contents, respectively."
7,Dehydrogenation,"3.5 Dehydrogenation An alkali solution was prepared with produced NaBH4 and treated in the presence of catalysts in a system illustrated in Fig. 2. Many chemicals were tried as candidates to find a suitable catalyst. Most of them yield negligible amount of hydrogen. But, 3d transition metal chlorides, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2 and succinic acid gave satisfactory results as shown in Fig. 7 . These chlorides proved their catalytic activity by releasing more hydrogen than that provided by NaBH4. These catalysts cause water to release its hydrogen as well [4,11]. Therefore it is possible to obtain hydrogen yield more than theoretically calculated amount (1005ml/g produced NaBH4) as illustrated in Fig. 7. Similar behaviors were obtained in our LiBH4 dehydrogenation studies catalyzed by either Ni or NiO [5]. Furthermore, CoCl2 yields Co2B as a by-product through a reduction reaction shown below. Co2B was described as a new catalyst for dehydrogenation, causing a faster and deeper reaction [12]. pH values for all reaction media were measured between 12 and 14. CoCl2 +2NaBH4 +3H2O⇄6.25H2 +0.5Co2B+2NaCl+1.5HBO2"
8,Conclusion,"In this study production conditions for NaBH4 are studied for different reaction times, temperatures and reactant ratios. Experimental results show that 6 times excess of trimethyl borate at 250°C reacting for 90min are the optimum conditions for the synthesis of NaBH4. Obtained product has 40.32% purity and this value could be increased to 85.17% by a series of extraction–recrystallization processes with ethylene diamine solvent at 75°C. This product was used as a hydrogen source in a dehydrogenation apparatus in the presence of catalysts. Results show that just 1g of purified NaBH4 yielded 2387ml of hydrogen with 0.37g of CoCl2 catalyst. This indicates that, some of the hydrogen of water is also released."
