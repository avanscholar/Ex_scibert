0,Introduction,"With a growing array of applications, the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based advanced oxidation process has emerged as a viable technology for the abatement of various recalcitrant organic contaminants in water [1–3]. The PMS activation is commonly achieved by physical stimulants (e.g., heat and light) or transition metal oxides (e.g., CuO, Fe3O4 and MnO2) [4–6]. However, these state-of-art approaches suffer from challenges such as significant metal leaching, narrow range of working pH, catalyst inactivation and need for post-separation [7]. Therefore, the identification of the effective and sustainable strategies for PMS activation is vital. The electrolysis of water can produce the atomic H* intermediate via Volmer reaction at the specific functional cathodes [8]. The atomic H* can serve as a one-electron donor possessing a much lower redox potential of -2.1 V (vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) for the H*/H+ pair than -0.77 V (vs SHE) for the Fe2+/Fe3+ pair. This indicates that the radical formation via atomic H*-activated PMS is thermodynamically favorable [9]. It is worth noting that the atomic H* is more likely to convert to the gaseous H2 through the Heyrovsky and Tafel routes in the absence of noble metal catalysts for retaining hydrogen [10], and such side reactions inevitably deteriorate the H* utilization efficiency. Palladium (Pd) is the most desirable noble metal capable of catalyzing the reactions relevant to the formation of the atomic H* due to its unique physicochemical attributes, such as the large unit cell gap and strong affinity towards the H atoms [11,12]. For instance, Zeng et al. reported the Pd/Al2O3 powder catalyst for peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. It was observed that the electro(E)-generated H* was responsible for the one-electron reduction of PDS to produce SO4 •–/•OH [9]. Further, the results suggested that the organic degradation kinetics remained low, and the powdered catalysts could hardly be reused. It has reported that the organic degradation performance is highly dependent on the mass transport in the conventional batch reactors, where the organic pollutants are oxidized at a rate much faster than their diffusion from the bulk solution to the surface of the catalyst [13]. In other words, enhancing mass transport is the key to heterogeneous catalytic reactions, which can be realized by adopting an alternative flow-through design due to the convection-enhanced mass transfer. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an alternative flow-through electrocatalytic system with in situ formation of the atomic H*, thereby leading to an enhanced H*-mediated PMS activation. The post-separation of the catalyst can be addressed by anchoring it onto a conductive support [7]. To this end, the carbon nanotubes (CNT) may represent a suitable choice for hosting the Pd catalyst owing to the superior electric conductivity and desirable chemical robustness. In particular, the rich surface chemistry of CNT provides abundant anchoring sites for the surface-bonding of Pd. In addition to the PMS activation by the atomic H*, CNT can also activate PMS via a non-radical pathway by triggering electron-transfer process from an electron donor (i.e., organic compounds) [7]. In this way, it is feasible to further enhance the efficiency of the PMS activation process owing to the synergistic interaction of the H*-mediated radical and CNT-mediated non-radical pathways in the flow-through electrocatalytic system. However, to the best of our knowledge, this study is among the very first comprehensive works to explore the feasibility in the H*-mediated catalytic degradation of organics by synergistically employing the radical and non-radical pathways in a flow-through design. Herein, a novel flow-through electrocatalytic nanohybrid filter containing the Pd-CNT cathode has been rationally developed for the high-efficiency PMS activation and ultrafast degradation of the emerging contaminants by using sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a model compound. First, the morphology and composition of the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter were characterized, followed by the identification of H* production by using the electrochemical measurements. Second, the mechanisms of the H*- and CNT-mediated PMS activation were studied experimentally and theoretically. Third, the SMX degradation and PMS activation were examined as a function of the essential parameters such as solution pH, dissolved oxygen, flow rate, and solution chemistry. Forth, the SMX transformation pathway was elucidated. Last, a practically relevant evaluation of the flow-through electrocatalytic system was performed in terms of energy consumption, economic cost and stability. Overall, the findings reported in this study provide new insights into the design of the robust and effective system by integrating AOPs with membrane separation for water decontamination."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The chemicals employed were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification. Palladium chloride (PdCl2, ≥98%), peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HKO5S·0.5HKO4S·0.5K2O4S, ≥98%), sodium chloride (NaCl, ≥96%), nitric acid (HNO3, 36-38%), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol (TEMP, C9H19N, ≥96%), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-n-oxide (DMPO, C6H11NO, ≥97%), furfuryl alcohol (FFA, C5H6O2, ≥98%), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, C4H10O, ≥98%), methanol (CH3OH, ≥98%), ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥96%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36-38%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96%), methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S, MW = 319.85 g mol-1) and methyl orange (C14H14N3SO3N, MW = 327.33 g mol-1) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, ≥98%), tetracycline (C22H24N2O8, ≥98%) and bisphenol A (C15H16O2, ≥96%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The CNT samples were provided by TimesNano Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China)."
3,Fabrication of Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter,"2.2 Fabrication of Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter The fabrication of the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter was carried out following a reported electrodeposition protocol with modifications (Fig. S1). To this end, the CNT powder was pre-treated with concentrated HNO3 at 120 °C for 6 h to remove any residual metal catalyst and introduce the surface oxygen functional groups. Subsequently, the CNT filter was formed by vacuum filtration of the HNO3-treated CNT dispersion onto a commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter with a diameter of 47 mm. The Pd2+ ions were loaded onto the CNT filter by electrodeposition in a three-electrode system (i.e., CNT working electrode, Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode; 0.195 V vs SHE). The 150 mL electrolyte solution contained 15 mM NH4Cl and 1 mM PdCl2, where the NH4Cl served as an electrolyte and a substance contributing to the generation of the Pd crystal [10]. Following electrodeposition for 10 min, the as-obtained Pd2+-loaded CNT were transferred to a filtration casing, and 5 mL 0.5 mM NaBH4 solution was passed through the hybrid filter at 1 mL min-1 to reduce Pd2+ to Pd° on site."
4,Setup and procedures for PMS activation and SMX degradation,"2.3 Setup and procedures for PMS activation and SMX degradation The electrochemical PMS activation for achieving the SMX degradation was carried out on a polycarbonate filtration casing (Whatman) with electrochemical modifications (Fig. S2) [14]. The as-prepared Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter served as the cathode and a perforated Ti sheet served as anode. All SMX degradation experiments were conducted after achieving filter adsorption saturation by flowing through 180 mL of 0.04 mM SMX solution for 3 h (controlled by an Ismatec ISM833C peristaltic pump, Switzerland). In a typical experiment, 50 mL of 0.04 mM SMX solution with 1.5 mM PMS were passed through the system. The extracted liquid samples were mixed with 1 M ethanol solution and 1 M FFA to terminate radical- and non-radical-induced reactions, respectively. A voltage was applied exerted by using a DC power supply (Model DH1766A-1). The solution pH was adjusted by 1 M NaOH and/or HCl. The effect of the flow rate (1.0 to 2.0 mL min-1), solution pH (3.0 to 9.5), Pd loading, and PMS dosage on the SMX degradation kinetics was investigated systematically. To further examine the practicability of the developed system, the SMX-spiked tap and lake water samples, as well as other selected refractory organic contaminants (e.g., antibiotic tetracycline, methylene blue, bisphenol A and methyl orange) also challenged the filtration system."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The morphology and composition of the Pd-CNT filter were characterized by field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, a Talos F200S) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JOEL 2100 F). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the angle range of 5 to 90 ° (Model D/max-2550VB+/PC). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using an Escalab 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis of the samples was performed using a Mettler Toledo thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, Switzerland) from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 under oxygen atmosphere. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed over the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz at an amplitude of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were acquired at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 50 mM Na2SO4 electrolyte."
6,Analytical Methods,"2.5 Analytical Methods The SMX concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 3000) equipped with a UV detector. A mixture of methanol and water (0.05% phosphoric acid) (volume ratio: 40/60) was used as the mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The SMX degradation intermediates were identified via a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, PR-LCMS-2020). The reactive species were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR; Bruker, Germany) with TEMP or DMPO used as the capture agents. The concentration of the reactive oxygen species was measured by using the chemical probe methods (Text S1) [15,16]."
7,Theoretical calculations,"2.6 Theoretical calculations A computational model with a Pd atom located at the CNT surface was constructed to mimic the as-prepared catalyst. The geometry optimizations were performed using the B3LYP methods. The Pd element was treated with the LANL2DZ basis set, whereas the other elements were treated by the 6-31 G(d) basis set. The frequency analysis was followed at the same level enabled the characterization of the nature of the stationary points. The DFT calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 09 program."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter,"3.1 Characterization of Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter The FETEM characterization of the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter is presented in Fig. 1 a and b. The Pd NPs with an average diameter of 7.6 ± 1.5 nm were observed to be deposited onto the CNT walls (Fig. S3). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c) revealed the typical lattice fringes spacing of 2.32 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the Pd {111} plane (2.32 nm, PDF no. #18-0951). The XRD pattern of the sample revealed that the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.7 °, 43.1 ° and 65.6 °, which corresponded with the standard peaks of the face-centered cubic crystallographic structure of the metallic Pd ({111}, {200} and {220} reflections, respectively) (Fig. 2 a, PDF no. #18-0951). The EDS elemental mapping confirmed the bright spots in the HAADF-FETEM image to be the nanoscale Pd particles (Fig. 1d). The uniform distribution of C, O and Pd in the EDX mapping indicated the successful incorporation of the Pd NPs into the carbon matrix (Fig. 1e, f and g). A fraction of 4.7% of Pd on the CNT surface was in good agreement with the TGA measurements (Fig. 2b, Fig. S4), while Cu and Si were confirmed to be the intrinsic elements contained in the copper mesh used during the FETEM characterization (Fig. 2b). The electronic state of the Pd surface was determined by XPS (Fig. 2c), revealing two main peaks with the binding energies of 341.4 eV and 336.1 eV, corresponding to the spin-orbit coupling of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of the Pd, respectively [10]. Other two peaks located at 338.0 eV and 343.3 eV were recognized as the characteristic peaks of Pd2+, indicating the combination of oxygen on the CNT surface with Pd to promote the formation of the Pd nanoparticles [17]. The O 1s spectrum in Fig. S5 revealed two types of oxygen atoms on the filter, i.e., 531.7 eV, assigned to the Pd-O bonds, and 533.1 eV, associated with the oxygen atoms from the carbonyl groups [7,18]. The charge transfer resistance (R CT) of the Pd-CNT filter electrode was characterized by EIS. As shown in Fig. 2d, a remarkably smaller radius of the circular arc associated with Pd-CNT filter electrode (R CT = 35 Ω) was observed as compared to the Pd-free CNT electrode (R CT = 50 Ω), thus, suggesting that the Pd loading significantly decreased the interfacial resistance and accelerated the electron transfer kinetics [19]."
10,Mechanisms of H* evolution by Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter,"3.2 Mechanisms of H* evolution by Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter It has been reported that the exposure of the Pd {111} facets theoretically endows the capability of the Pd catalyst to form the atomic H* [20]. To explore the mechanism of H* evolution, the electrochemical analysis of the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter was performed. The electrode was firstly activated by performing continuous CV cycling between -0.95 and -0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 10 mV s-1 in the N2-saturated 50 mM Na2SO4 solution until obtaining a stable voltammogram. Based on the CV measurements at different starting potentials (from -0.95 to -0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl), three oxidative peaks were observed in the positive scan within the ranges of -0.80 to -0.50 V vs Ag/AgCl, -0.30 to -0.10 V vs Ag/AgCl, and -0.10 to 0.10 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3 a). The three peaks corresponded to the oxidation of molecular H2 at -0.80 V vs Ag/AgCl, absorbed H*abs at -0.30 to -0.10 V vs Ag/AgCl and adsorbed H*ads at -0.10 to 0.00 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively [21,22]. It is important to note that H*ads represented H* adsorbed on the Pd surface, whereas H*abs referred to H* adsorbed in the Pd crystal lattice. To identify the effect of the H* species, the CV and LSV behaviors of the Pd-CNT filter were compared by the addition of the atomic H* scavenger (2,4-dichlorophenol; 2,4-DCP, 2 mM). As observed in Fig. 3b, a complete disappearance of the H*ads oxidation peak occurred after 2,4-DCP addition, while the peaks of H*abs and H2 remained. Furthermore, the inertness of the molecular H2 was also confirmed by the LSV analysis performed with and without the presence of 2,4-DCP. As presented in Fig. 3c, the polarization curves demonstrated similar slopes in the presence and absence of 2,4-DCP in the H2 evolution-dominated region (<-0.84 V vs Ag/AgCl), thus, suggesting that the generated H2 did not contribute to PMS activation. Else, a more negative slope should be identified in the presence of 2,4-DCP [22]. These results confirmed that H*ads, rather than H*abs and H2, represented the key active species produced on the Pd-CNT filter. To maximize the H*ads yield, the influence of the external applied potential was investigated further. The CV data illustrated the emergence of H*ads, H*abs and H2 at -0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl, and the difference in the formation rates of H*ads and H*abs species was increased. Thus, H*abs was produced at a higher rate than H*ads. On applying a more negative starting potential (<-0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl), the peak value of H*abs was observed to exceed that of H*ads, probably due to the transformation of H*ads to H*abs or H2 (by a Heyrovsky or Tafel step, Eq. 1–2) within the applied potential range. (1) H 2 O + H * + e - → H 2 + O H - ( H e y r o v s k y ) (2) 2 H * → H 2 ( T a f e l ) In addition, the potentials from -0.45 to -0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl were also applied in the presence of 2 mM 2,4-DCP. The results revealed the optimum potential to be -0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl, at which 2,4-DCP was degraded with an efficiency of 86.60% (Fig. S6)."
11,H*-mediated PMS activation and decontamination,"3.3 H*-mediated PMS activation and decontamination 3.3.1 SMX degradation performance To examine the catalytic activity of the as-fabricated Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter for PMS activation, SMX (0.04 mM) was used as a model emerging organic contaminant. As shown in Fig. 3d, the catalytic performance of the control groups, e.g., PMS (10.5%), CNT (3.8%), CNT/PMS (27.9%) and CNT/E (4.9%), exhibited a limited SMX removal with a maximum efficiency of <30%. The PMS activation was not expected to produce the active species responsible for decontamination in the absence of the Pd catalyst, though the electric field was applied subsequently. It is well known that Pd or its alloys can participate into the production of Pd-H* [20,23], thus, making it possible to utilize H* to accelerate the PMS activation process. In this study, an ultrafast 100% SMX removal with the first-order kinetic constant k as high as 1.65 min-1 (R2 = 0.999) was achieved on incorporating Pd to CNT in the Pd-CNT/PMS/E system (-1 V). The hydraulic residence time within the nanohybrid filter was less than 2 sec (Text S2), indicating a superior catalytic activity of the integrated system. To decouple the role played by the different factors, the Pd-CNT, Pd-CNT/PMS and Pd-CNT/E systems were examined, which exhibited a poor SMX degradation tendency. This ruled out the possibility of PMS activation by Pd-CNT and H*-mediated SMX degradation in the absence of the electric field. Meanwhile, the PMS concentration was recorded as a function of time, and 89.3% PMS decomposition was observed to occur simultaneously (Fig. S7). Considering the possibility of the electro-activation of persulfate, the impact of electric field on PMS was examined with a pure PTFE membrane in the reactor [24,25]. As observed in Fig. S8, the PMS concentration began to decrease from 1.5 mM to 1.2 mM only in the case of a more negative voltage (<-1 V). Thus, in this study, the PMS activation by the electric field could be excluded at a voltage of -1 V (equivalent to a cathode potential of -0.57 V vs Ag/AgCl). 3.3.2 Identification of reactive species The EPR technology was employed to identify the active species responsible for the SMX degradation, with DMPO and TEMP serving as the spin trapping agents. As the •OH radicals produced by the anode might exert a quenching effect on H* [21], the radicals formed at the anode and cathode were detected using a dual-chambered electrolytic cell. As shown in Fig. S9, the strength of the characteristic •OH peak appeared to be much weaker than that of H*, thus, the quenching effect resulting from the anodic •OH was concluded to be negligible. Subsequently, the reactive species in the reaction systems were detected with different combinations of PMS, CNT and electric field, as displayed in Fig. 4 . No characteristic peak was observed for CNT in the presence or absence of the electric field, thus, suggesting insensitivity of CNT to electric stimulation. The addition of PMS resulted in the weak EPR signals of the DMPO-•OH adduct as well as a triplex peak of the TEMP-1O2 adduct, thus, indicating the interaction between CNT and PMS under the action of the electric field [26]. To confirm the generation of 1O2 during this process, an excessive amount of FFA (100 mM) was added, leading to a 34.2% decay in the reaction rate from 1.65 min-1 to 1.18 min-1. Thus, a minor contribution of 1O2 was noticed in the CNT/PMS/E system. In addition to 1O2, the electron-rich molecules may also be attacked by the electrophilic peroxide and superoxide species [27], both of which can be identified by using the iodometric titration method. However, considering the possibility of a reaction between potassium iodide and free radicals (e.g., •OH and SO4 •−), the EPR analysis was conducted first. No obvious change in the signal was identified, thus, this possibility was ruled out as well (Fig. S10). As shown in Fig. S11, supplementing the iodometric titration with CNT resulted in a decline in the SMX degradation efficiency from 29.9% to 5.1%. This provided a quantitative verification of the presence of the electron-deficient species like electrophilic peroxide (O2 2−) and superoxide species (O2 −). Such species were able to abstract an electron from PMS to produce 1O2 via electron-transfer and radical self-quenching reactions (Eq. 3–4) [27]. It should be noted that the iodide molecules could also react with the PMS molecules, however, the reaction kinetics was several orders of magnitude lower than that of the iodide reaction with the electron-deficient species [28]. (3) H S O 5 - - e – → H + + S O 5 ∙ - (4) 2 S O 5 ∙ - → S O 4 ∙ - O 2 S O 4 ∙ - → O 2 1 + 2 S O 4 ∙ - Unlike the CNT/E system, nine characteristic peaks for the DMPO-H* adduct and TEMP-1O2 adduct signals with an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 were observed in the Pd-CNT/E system, thus, confirming the generation of the atomic H* [29,30]. The addition of PMS (1.5 mM) resulted in an EPR spectrum of the DMPO-•OH adduct with an intensity of 1:2:2:1 and weak DMPO-SO4 •− signals, whereas the signals of DMPO-H* disappeared. Such a transformation might be caused by the H* transfer or electron transfer. To further prove the presence of SO4 •−, TBA and methanol were dosed in an excess concentration (100 mM) as the selective radical scavengers for •OH and SO4 •− radicals [31,32]. As shown in Fig. 5 a, TBA inhibited the SMX degradation, indicated by a decline in the rate constant from 1.65 to 1.38 min-1. A rate constant of 1.0 min-1 caused by a similar amount of methanol verified the contribution of SO4 •− towards SMX degradation on a qualitative basis. To gain deeper mechanistic insights into the generation of SO4 •−, •OH and 1O2 in the Pd-CNT/PMS/E system, the concentration of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was further quantified using different chemical probes [15,16]. As shown in Fig. 5b, the concentration of SO4 •−, •OH and 1O2 was determined to be 121.6 μM, 442.0 μM and 58.9 μM, respectively. As ROS were undetectable under similar conditions in the presence of only PMS, the essential role of CNT, Pd and electric field could be confirmed. Taking into account the oxidative capability of the high-valence cations, it was of interest to explore whether they might mediate the electron transfer from organic compounds to PMS. To this end, methyl phenyl sulfoxide, methanol and FFA were added to the SMX solution to simultaneously quench both high-valence cations and ROS [33–35]. As a result, the role of the high-valence cations could be excluded owing to the non-detection of the PMSO2 signal, the characteristic product formed by the reaction between methyl phenyl sulfoxide and high-valence cations. Meanwhile, the SMX degradation was not observed on incorporating FFA and methanol. These results confirmed SO4 •−, •OH and 1O2 to be the dominant ROS synergistically responsible for the SMX degradation at the solid-solution interfaces. The most likely mechanism for the PMS activation by using the electrochemical Pd-CNT filter is illustrated in Scheme 1 . 3.3.3 DFT calculations The DFT calculations were carried out to gain theoretical insights into the mechanism of PMS activation. On the Pd-CNT surface, the energy required for the H*-transfer pathway (12.4 kcal mol-1) was one order of magnitude lower than that for the electron-transfer pathway (243.3 kcal mol-1). This suggested the predominance of the H*-transfer pathway, which was much more thermodynamically favorable for PMS activation (Fig. 6 ). For the H*-transfer mechanism, the formed H* on the Pd atoms is transferred to PMS, followed by the cleavage to generate HSO4 − and •OH. The protons in the solution can be adsorbed on the Pd atoms to re-form H* by accepting an electron driven by the electrochemical reduction occurring at the cathode [9]. In comparison, only a single electron is transferred to PMS, leaving hydrogen at the Pd atoms for electron-transfer, which is consistent with the experimental observations."
12,SMX degradation pathway in Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter,"3.4 SMX degradation pathway in Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter The SMX degradation pathway was studied by identifying the reaction byproducts in the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter. For this purpose, the theoretical DFT calculations were performed on the basis of the Fukui function by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fig. S12 displays the calculated Fukui index reflecting the electrophilic (f -), radical (f 0 ) and nucleophilic (f + ) attacks, as per the natural population analysis (NPA). The results indicated a high Fukui index on N11, S14 and N17 sites that were the most vulnerable for SMX molecule to be attacked by •OH, SO4 •− and 1O2, which occurred dominantly at the solid-solution interfaces. Combining the DFT data and LC-QTOF-MS findings (Fig. S13), three major SMX degradation pathways were identified, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . In pathway I, the possible product (B) was formed by attacking the S atom, followed by the subsequent oxidation to C via hydroxylation reactions and final conversion to D. In pathway II, SMX was first converted to aminobenzene sulfonamide (E), followed by the formation of F via substitution of the -NH2 group with the hydroxyl group and G via oxidation of the amino group. In pathway III, the N11 atom would be attacked in favor of H formation, followed by the transformation to I via hydroxylation reaction."
13,Impact of solution chemistry and operational parameters,"3.5 Impact of solution chemistry and operational parameters The solution pH is an essential parameter in the radical-induced PMS activation [36,37]. As the presence of Cl− did not have any effect on the SMX degradation kinetics (Fig. S14), thus, HCl was used to adjust the solution pH. As shown in Fig. S15a, the highest SMX degradation efficiency of 100% (with a k value of 1.65 min-1) was recorded at pH 3.0 and 5.5. In contrast, the SMX degradation efficiency was significantly decreased at nearly neutral pH (∼40%) and alkaline (pH 9.5; 32.1%) conditions. The observed phenomenon could be explained in the context of PMS specification and H* formation at different pH values. First, H2SO5 has a negative pKa1 value (<0) and a pKa2 value of 9.4 [38]. Therefore, PMS predominantly existed as HSO5 − in the acidic and pH-neutral conditions, whereas the dominant species at pH 9.5 was SO5 2–. The alkaline condition was unlikely to produce the radical and non-radical ROS due to the deficiency of HSO5 −. Second, the electrons coupled with H+ participated in the reactions relevant to the formation of H* by consuming H+ [39]. Based on the CV scans as a function of pH, the peaks attributed to H*ads and H*abs became weak on increasing the solution pH (Fig. S16). Although the previous studies have reported that H2O can be used as precursor for H* in the neutral or alkaline solutions (Eq. 5–6) [21,22], however, the slow reaction rate leads to the insufficient generation of the atomic H* for PMS activation. (5) P d + H 2 O + e - → M - H * + O H - N e u t r a l o r a l k a l i n e s o l u t i o n (6) P d - H * + e - + H 2 O → H 2 + P d + O H - N e u t r a l o r a l k a l i n e s o l u t i o n Similarly, the chronoamperometry profiles also revealed a higher reductive current under acidic conditions than neutral or alkaline conditions (Fig. S17). Thus, the accelerated electron transport also contributed to the improved SMX degradation at lower pH values. In addition to pH, the presence of the dissolved oxygen (DO) in water may compete with SMX for both electrons and H* on the cathode surface, thus, inhibiting the PMS activation and SMX degradation. The impact of DO was examined by a stepwise decline in the DO concentration from 9.0 mg L-1 to 0.62 mg L-1, obtained by purging the solution with N2. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the rate constant of the SMX degradation and DO level, indicated by a dramatic decrease in the k values from 1.65 min-1 (DO = 0.62 mg L-1) to 0.56 min-1 (9.0 mg L-1; Fig. 5a). This suggested the sensitivity of the Pd-CNT system, where PMS was activated to the DO level in water, agreeing well with the previous studies [10,30]. Further, the impact of flow rate and operating mode on the SMX degradation was investigated. As shown in Fig. S15b, as compared with the batch-fed reaction mode, an enhanced SMX removal rate was observed for the flow-through mode. The resulting degradation efficiency could reach 100%, 90.0% and 80.7% at the corresponding flow rate of 1, 1.5 and 2 mL min-1 as well as 40.3% in the batch system, thus, accounting for the first-order kinetic constant values of 1.65, 1.45, 0.82 and 0.10 min-1, respectively. The significant enhancement should be due to the enhanced mass transport by convection in the flow-through configuration, while diffusion is the mass transfer pathway in the batch reactor [40,41]. The SMX degradation efficiency was observed to decrease on increasing the flow rate in the single-pass mode, preliminarily due to the reduced hydraulic residence time necessary for the contact between SMX molecules and active sites on the Pd-CNT surface [42]. The experiments were also performed to explored the impacts of PMS dosage and Pd loading on the SMX degradation. As shown in Fig. S18a, the degradation of SMX was significantly enhanced from 64.2% to 100% on increasing the PMS dosage from 0.5 to 2 mM. As PMS was the precursor of ROS, an enhanced PMS concentration was conductive to an enhanced ROS yield. In addition, an increased Pd loading also had a boosting effect on the SMX degradation kinetics due to the increased active sites for H* generation (Fig. S18b). A higher concentration of Pd was not tested as the complete degradation was already obtained at 0.04 mM."
14,Stability evaluation,"3.6 Stability evaluation The robust catalysts are required for the heterogeneous processes, thus, the stability of the Pd-CNT filter was further evaluated based on the continuous-flow operation and complex water matrices [43]. As shown in Fig. S19a, the SMX degradation kinetics could be sustained at 90.7% with an acceptable extent of decay on using the SMX-spiked tap water and lake water samples. Moreover, the potential leakage of the metal ions may also be a concern. For example, Sun et al. reported the iron loss up to 12.5 wt% in the PMS system based on the reduced graphene oxide supported iron oxide catalyst [44]. In this study, a rather negligible Pd loss was observed (<10 μg L-1) under continuous operation over 24 h. Both XPS and XRD analyses of the Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter suggested a negligible change in the surface chemistry of the filter, thus, demonstrating the excellent chemical and structural robustness of the nanohybrid filter (Fig. S20). To further explore the potential of the Pd-CNT filter for contaminant removal, four refractory pollutants with varying molecular structures (e.g., methylene blue as a cationic azo dye; methyl orange as an anionic azo dye; tetracycline as a typical antibiotic and bisphenol A as a typical endocrine-disrupting compound) were also added to the system (Fig. S19b). All of these refractory organic compounds could be effectively degraded by the Pd-CNT filter at -1 V (>90%), indicating the wide applicability of the proposed system."
15,Economic analysis,"3.7 Economic analysis The economic aspect is a key factor in evaluating the remediation techniques for practical applications. The cost of the Pd-CNT filter mainly consists of two components, i.e., materials cost and energy consumption. It has been calculated that 0.66 g CNT can form a 1 μm thick layer over a 1 m2 area, indicating the material cost of ˜$1.83 m-2 [45]. The price of CNT has declined significantly in the recent years owing to the advances in the mass production technologies [46]. Further, although the cost is always an issue for the noble metal catalysts, however, the superior stability and negligible Pd loss (<10 μg L-1) in the proposed system may compensate this concern. Besides, the energy consumption for the SMX degradation at -1 V was calculated to be 0.43 kW h mol-1. The observed value is far lower than those observed for a majority of the state-of-the-art electrochemical processes [47]. Table S1 compares the performance and energy requirement of the several literature-reported PMS activation processes. The results suggested that the proposed system provided a promising remediation technique, with the potential of harnessing for the practical treatment of the water matrices."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, an electrocatalytic system was developed for activating PMS and degrading the organic contaminants by using a Pd-CNT nanohybrid filter as the functional electrode. Both radical and non-radical pathways contributed to the organic degradation process, thus, an effective, rapid and robust degradation of various refractory compounds could be achieved. The underlying working mechanism of the H*-mediated PMS activation was verified by the DFT calculations and experimental evidence. The flow-through configuration provided the convection-enhanced mass transport, leading to an excellent catalytic performance as compared to the conventional batch system. The developed technology paves the way to rationally construct the effective electrocatalytic systems for water decontamination."
