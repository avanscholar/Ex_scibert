0,Introduction,"Recently, much interest has been shown in various transition metal nanoparticles (MNPs), due to their unique catalytic behavior, electronic properties and high surface areas. Some transition MNPs are most promising catalysts because of low cost, high abundancy and good catalytic performance as compared to noble metals like Au, Ru, and Pd (Saha, Pal, Kundu, Basu, & Pal, 2010; Yildiz, Aktas, & Sahiner, 2014). However, instability issue is related to these MNPs which generally become self-aggregated and oxidize because of their high surface energy and surface area. Catalytic efficiency is related directly to catalytic surface area and MNPs have much high surface area, which might be a reason for the un-stable nature of these MNPs. Therefore, a supporting material is necessary for their loading, but its activity is reported to be reduced with supporting matrices as MNPs get embedded in it. Owing to this, the catalytic activity is decrease due to less catalyst-reactant contact (Lin, Tao, Hua, Ma, & Zhou, 2013; Wunder, Polzer, Lu, Mei, & Ballauff, 2010). Therefore, to get full benefit of tremendous catalytic activity of MNPs, innovative materials for the support of MNPs are of big scientific concern. The development of polymer hybrid nanostructured materials is recently growing because the composite materials form by the combination of fillers with polymers, generally increases numerous properties of a polymer (Abral et al., 2020; Atikah et al., 2019; Ilyas, Sapuan, Ishak, & Zainudin, 2019). Furthermore, the selection of low cost, renewability, non-toxic and environmentally friendly polymer to obtain the composites materials which can be used for numerous scientific purposes is vital (Ilyas, Sapuan, Ishak, & Zainudin, 2018; Kamal, Anwar, Khan, Chani, & Asiri, 2016). A variety of materials have been utilized as support for metallic nanoparticles such as SiO2 (Mangal et al., 2016), nitrides (Zha & Wang, 2015), zeolites (Zeng, Walker, & Zhu, 2017), carbon based nanomaterials (Chen, Cao, Wei, Gong, & Xian, 2016), cellulose (Ahmad, Kamal, Khan, & Asiri, 2016; Khan, Wei, Haq Khan, Tahir, Ahmad, Khan et al., 2016; Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry, & Asiri, 2018; Haider et al., 2016; Kamal, Ahmad, Khan, & Asiri, 2017; Kamal, Ahmad, Khan, & Asiri, 2019b; Khan, Ali, Kamal, Anwar, Asiri, Seo et al., 2016; Kamal, Khan, & Asiri, 2016a; 2016b; Kamal, Khan, Haider, Alghamdi, & Asiri, 2017; Kamal, Ul-Islam, Khan, & Asiri, 2015), chitosan (Ali, Khan, & Asiri, 2018; Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry, Bakhsh et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017; Khan, Khan, Kamal, Yasir, & Asiri, 2016; Kamal, Ali, Naseem, Khan, & Asiri, 2016; Kumar-Krishnan et al., 2016), and chelating resin (Shi, He, Long, & Li, 2016). Among different supporting materials, polymers are widely exploited as a stabilizer for metallic nanoparticles since its extensive accessibility, cost effectiveness, free of toxicity, biodegradability and presence of various functional groups in the polymer backbone. The metal gets adsorb on some carbohydrate polymers by electrostatic interaction with hydroxyl (OH) and amine (NH) group (Bakhsh et al., 2018; Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry, et al., 2017; Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry et al., 2017; Ali, Khan, Kamal, Anwar et al., 2017). In literature, several works have been published on composites materials form by combining fillers with polymers, thus enhancing polymer characteristics (Jang et al., 2011; Khan, Akhtar, Bakhsh, & Asiri, 2019; Kamal, Ali et al., 2016; Ul-Islam et al., 2016). For example, the thermal stability, barrier and mechanical properties of polymers was improved by cross-linking of baric acid with poly vinyl alcohol (PVA/BA). The metal-polymer complexes has also been mostly investigated in the research area of composite materials, where polysaccharide biopolymers, like starch, alginate and chitosan provide a support for the growth of metals nanoparticles (Kamal, Ahmad, Khan, & Asiri, 2019a; Kamal et al., 2016a; Kamal, Ahmad, Khan, & Asiri, 2018; Kamal, Ahmad, Khan, Ul-Islam, & Asiri, 2019; Lee, Gong, Huong, Oh, & Chang, 2016). Therefore, in this study cotton cellulose based simple disposable, cheap and stable supporting material was designed and fabricated for the stabilization of MNPs in order to get full benefits of these tremendous catalysts. Nowadays, hydrogen energy have attracted a lot of interest because of its clean nature, racialization and carbon free gas (Muir & Yao, 2011). Various hydrides have been utilized for the H2 production (Demirci & Sahiner, 2014). NaBH4 is the most common hydride since it contains higher hydrogen amount (Zhong et al., 2016), fast reaction (Sahiner, Yasar, & Aktas, 2015), easy regeneration (Ouyang et al., 2014), less toxic and non-flammable behavior (Schlesinger et al., 1953; Yu, Pellechia, & Matthews, 2014). Recently, H2 has been produced from methanol and water by treating with NaBH4 where methanol has the capability to produce higher H2 with fast rates as compared to water (Santos & Sequeira, 2011): (1) NaBH4 + 4CH3OH → 4H2 + NaB(OCH3)4 Moreover, water contamination is a critical matter facing by the world and most of these contaminants are organic pollutants, colored compounds, microorganisms and harmful substances (Ahmad, Khan, Kamal, & Asiri, 2017; Ahmed et al., 2016; Al-Mubaddel et al., 2017 Ali, Khan, Kamal, Anwar, Anwar et al., 2017; Kamal et al., 2018; Kavitha et al., 2019; Khan, Kamal, Ali, Asiri, & Khan, 2019; Khan, Khan, Kamal, & Asiri, 2019; Khan, Khan, Marwani, Bakhsh, Anwar, Kamal et al., 2016; Bakhsh et al., 2019). These contaminants pose a risk to the life and the humanity everywhere in the world. The major sources of wastewater pollutions are industries. Wastewater effluents from the industries often contain pollutants with intense smell and color. Such effluents are reported to be potential threat to our environment due to their intense toxic, hazardous and carcinogenic nature (Dong, Ding, Zhang, & Liang, 2007). Therefore, these contaminants require treatment before releasing in the environment. It is highly favored to develop new technologies to eliminate contaminates from waste-water. In this study, we have developed a simple and effective catalytic system based-on zero-valent MNPs (Cu, Ag and Fe) grown onto a cotton cellulose and used for the hydrogen production and removal of organic dyes and nitrophenols from contaminated water."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Iron chloride (FeCl3, 96 %), stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2.2H2O, 97 %), chitosan (degree of deacetylation >75 % and molecular weight of 800−2000 cP) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99 %) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99 %) was purchased from MERCK. Methanol, copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H2O, 98.5 %), and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) were bought from BDH chemicals, England. While acetic acid was obtained from NTN Ltd. The easily available cotton rolls in the pharmacies were used as a source of polysaccharide. Distilled water was used in all the reactions."
3,Material preparation,"2.2 Material preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of Fe-SnO2 Fe-SnO2 was prepared by adding 0.1 M SnCl2.2H2O into a reaction flask and then 0.1 M FeCl3 was added to the reaction flask and kept on stirring (Asif, Khan, & Asiri, 2014). The aqueous solution of mixed salts was kept on stirring for complete dissolution and proper mixing of salts. 0.5 M of fresh NaOH solution was slowly transferred to the mixed salts solution flask and adjusted the pH 10 of the solution containing mixed salts. The basic solution was stirred for 10 h at 60 °C and cool down to room temperature. The reaction product was then centrifuged in order to collect the precipitate by removing the supernatant. The liquid part of the solution was discarded, and the solid materials were dispersed in water and centrifugation was repeated for washing solid materials. The washing and centrifugation of the solid materials were repeated three times and then dried in the oven. The dried product was further calcined at 500 °C. 2.2.2 Preparation of CC, Cu@CC, Fe@CC and Ag@CC nanocomposites CuSO4 (3.1 g/100 mL) was dissolved in distilled water to get clear solution. The CuSO4 solution gets precipitated upon addition of NaOH solution (1.6 g/100 mL) which indicate the formation of copper hydroxide. NH4OH was then added to copper hydroxide and gave a clear solution of Cu(NH4)2(OH)2. Cotton was then dipped in Cu(NH4)2(OH)2 and after complete dissolution of cotton, Fe-SnO2 was dispersed in the cotton cellulose-Cu(NH4)2(OH)2 complex solution. The characterization of cotton is given in our previous report (Ali, Khan, & Asiri, 2019). Fe-SnO2 dispersed cotton cellulose-Cu(NH4)2(OH)2 complex solution was dropped by syringe in chitosan solution and got the beads of nanocomposite which named as CC. CC beads were then dipped in copper, silver and iron metal salt (0.05 M) solutions for overnight. The beads were washed after removal from salt solutions and dried. The dried beads of CC and metal adsorbed CC were then treated with NaBH4 and named as CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC. All the prepared materials were utilized for hydrogen production and catalytic reduction of different pollutants. The cellulose and chitosan are biopolymers which has good biocompatibility and contains large number of hydroxyl groups, while chitosan additionally contains amino groups. These groups play a key role in binding and adsorption of Cu, Ag and Fe ions and further stabilize Cu°, Ag° and Fe° when produced by reduction of the adsorbed Cu, Ag and Fe ions. The procedure followed for the synthesis of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC is graphically shown in Scheme 1. In first step, CuSO4 was dissolved in water and then NaOH was added to prepare copper hydroxide. NH4OH was then added to copper hydroxide solution. Cotton was dissolved in Cu(NH4)2(OH)2 and Fe-SnO2 was dispersed in the cotton cellulose-Cu(NH4)2(OH)2 complex solution. The above mixture was added dropwise to the chitosan solution and prepared composite spheres (CC). In 2nd step, CC was dipped into CuSO4, AgNO3 and FeCl3 solution individually where CC adsorbed the Cu, Ag and Fe ions from their corresponding solution. CC was kept in CuSO4, AgNO3 and FeCl3 solution for the maximum adsorption of metal ions. In the 3rd step, pure CC and the metal ions loaded CC were treated with NaBH4 where growth of the corresponding nanoparticles were observed by color change of the CC and metal ions loaded CC in few minutes. In just few seconds, the color of CC and the treated CC having metal ions was changed into black, which shows that the NaBH4 reacts quite fast with metal ions and reduced to nZV-MNPs. The reactions proposed during this method are as follow (Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry et al., 2017): (2) 2Cu2+ + 4BH4 – + 12H2O → 2Cu0 + 4B(OH)3 + 14H2 (3) 2Fe3+ + 4BH4 – + 12H2O → 2Fe0 + 4B(OH)3 + 14H2 (4) 2Ag+ + 2BH4 – + 6H2O → 2Ag0 + 2B(OH)3 + 7H2 Thus, nZV-MNPS templated on CC (abbreviated as M@CC) were resulted from this treatment with NaBH4 aqueous solution. The synthesized M@CC were then utilized as catalyst for H2 production from NaBH4 methanolysis and catalytic reduction of organic pollutants."
4,"Characterization of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC","2.3 Characterization of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC The prepared nanoparticles have been characterized by different techniques. Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used for investigation of catalyst morphology, energy dispersive X-rays spectrometry (EDS) for elemental analysis of the catalyst, X-ray diffractometer (XRD) for assessment of catalyst crystallinity, attenuated total reflection technique of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for verification of functional groups and UV–vis spectrophotometer for monitoring the catalytic reduction of pollutants using the designed catalyst. The morphology of the samples was investigated by FESEM of JEOL, JSM-7600 F, Japan. Before FESEM observations, the samples were ﬁrst coated with thin layer of platinum for 20 s. The samples were stuck onto a stab of 1 cm diameter with the help of carbon tape. ImageJ software package was used to obtain further histograms of the nanostructure dimensions. EDS equipment attached with FESEM was utilized for elemental investigation of the samples. XRD (ARL X'TRA powder X-ray diffraction) having λ = 0.154 nm of Cu Ka radiations source was used to record the crystal structure of the samples. The operated voltage and current of the instrument were 40 KV and 50 mA, respectively. The data was recorded between 10° and 80° at a scan rate 2° 2θ min−1. ATR-FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet™ iS50 FTIR Spectrometer - Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to record the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Thermo scientiﬁc, Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer was used to monitor and record the residual concentrations of organic pollutants."
5,"Catalytic production of hydrogen using CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts","2.4 Catalytic production of hydrogen using CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC were used as catalysts in the methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 for H2 production. The reaction for H2 production was performed using a reaction reactor (100 mL flask) with 0.1008 g of NaBH4 in 20 mL of methanol (CH3OH) at room temperature with a constant stirring in the absence/presence of catalyst. The amount of each catalyst used in the reaction was 0.025 g. Besides, we investigated the production of H2 from methanolysis of NaBH4, by using different concentration of NaBH4 (0.0504−0.2016 g) and amount of catalyst (0.0125−0.05 g)."
6,"Catalytic reduction of NPs and dyes using CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts","2.5 Catalytic reduction of NPs and dyes using CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts The prepared nanocomposites were evaluated for the catalytic reduction of dyes and NPs. To perform this procedures, aqueous solution of dye or nitrophenol (100.0 mL) and nanocomposite catalyst were transferred to a beaker and treated with aqueous NaBH4 (100.0 mL). The treated dyes and NPs solution were monitored by UV–vis at an interval of a specific time. The concentration of dyes and NPs expected to be gradually decreased, which were investigated through UV–vis spectrophotometer. The catalytic efficiency of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts was evaluated by applying the following equation: (5) Reduction ( % ) = C o − C t C o × 100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Structure elucidation of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts","3.1 Structure elucidation of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts 3.1.1 FESEM FESEM images of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC are depicted in Fig. 1 . The left side (Fig. 1(a–d)) and right side (Fig. 1(a'–d')) images are representing low and high magnification pictures. Fig. 1 obviously shows the formation of nanoparticles in all the catalysts. Further, to investigate the morphology in detail, one can clearly see that the prepared materials contains particles along with blocks shape morphology. The block type structure is related to complex and Fe-SnO2 which were added to the complex while the particles are related to MNPs present in the complex. This suggest that MNPs are well grown in the aggregated form and successfully templated on the surface of CC. The metal ions were adsorbed due to presence of OH and NH2 groups in the chitosan and cotton cellulose and converted into nanoparticles, where EDS was analyzed in order to approve the existence of corresponding MNPs in each catalyst because the composition analysis is not possible to elucidate from SEM analysis which only defined the surface morphology of the catalysts. Pure cotton has fiber like structure as shown in Fig. S1. 3.1.2 EDS The elemental compositions of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC were assured by EDS analysis which employed to check the elements which exist in the prepared catalyst materials. The successful formation of CC nanocomposite was assured by EDS analysis, in which Cu, Fe, Sn and Pt were noticed in the CC composition (Fig. 2 ) along with C and O which are observed in high percentage. C and O are owing to the presence of cellulose along with Cu nanoparticles and Fe and Sn were appeared due to presence of Fe-SnO2 while Pt is coming from spurting. In case of Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC, Cu, Ag and Fe were detected along with Cu, C, and O. Cu, C, and O is originated from the CC while in Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC, Cu, Ag and Fe appeared due to the growth of Cu, Ag and Fe on the surface of CC, respectively. According to the EDS results, the metallic content was 30.4 %, 40.6 %, 25.4 % and 43.8 % in the CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts, respectively. 3.1.3 XRD Among all the prepared samples, the Cu@CC was selected for detail study and its XRD pattern is presented in Fig. 3 (a). The selection of Cu@CC for detail characterization was based-on its best catalytic performance (see Sections 3.3 and 3.4). The diffraction pattern attained for Cu@CC with strong intensities were identified for Cu nanoparticles. The XRD peaks of Cu nanoparticles were appeared at 43.3 (111), 51.4 (200), 73.6 (220). These observed peaks suggest the existence of Cu nanoparticles. The observed crystalline peaks and crystal planes of face center cubic (FCC) Cu nanoparticles are consistent with literature and JCPDS library (JCPDS 04-0836). Hence, the XRD pattern of the prepared material suggest the growth of Cu nanoparticles in Cu@CC (Barakat et al., 2009). In literature, similar XRD patterns are reported for Cu nanoparticles stabilized by different stabilizers. A broad diffraction between 20˚ and 30˚ suggest that presence of amorphous cellulose and chitosan in Cu@CC. This amorphous structure of other polymers are similarly reported that give a broad peak in the same 2θ value (Sánchez-Vergara et al., 2015). The XRD peaks at 27.4 (110), 34.0 (101), 52.9 (211), 64.3 (112), 72.0 (202), 75.0 (321), and 78.3 were assigned to Fe-SnO2 (Cajas, Aragon´, Campo, Coaquira, & Rodr´ıguez-Paez´, 2012). Thus, X-ray diffractogram reveals the successful preparation of Cu@CC. 3.1.4 FTIR The functional groups of Cu@CC were confirmed by interpretation of the FT-IR spectrum as shown in Fig. 3(b). A broad band at 3299 cm−1 was observed which correspond to OH and NH group present in cotton cellulose and chitosan. CH, CO, CN, NH and COC peaks also observed in FT-IR spectrum at 2889 cm−1, 1640 cm−1, 1399 cm−1 and 1048 cm−1, respectively. It also gives a broad band at around 500 cm−1 which comes from Fe-SnO2 (Ali, Khan, Kamal, Alamry et al., 2017; Bakhsh et al., 2018; Khan, Khan, Farooq, & Asiri, 2019)."
9,"Catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC toward H2 production","3.2 Catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC toward H2 production CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC were used as catalysts for the generation of H2 from methanolysis reaction of NaBH4. In the chemical hydrides, NaBH4 was considered because it is the most suitable hydride for H2 generation (Ali, Khan, Asiri et al., 2018, 2019). In addition, methanol was utilized instead of water because it has low freezing point (–97.6 °C), so it can be applicable in vast range of temperature. The methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 without using any catalyst and catalyzed by CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC were investigated at room temperature of 24 °C. The methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 without catalyst produces 188 mL of H2 in approximately 20 min as shown in Fig. 4 (a). However, the same reaction generates 188 mL of H2 in 13 min, 6 min, 11 min and 12 min in presence of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC, respectively. It can be observed from the Fig. 4(a), that the catalytic efficiency of the Cu@CC was much better than CC, Ag@CC, Fe@CC and self-methanolysis of NaBH4. All of these reactions generating almost same amount of H2 (i.e., 188 mL), which suggest 100 % conversion. In these reactions the H2 generation is fast in the beginning; however, its rate decreases as the time passes towards the end of the reaction due to NaBH4 exhaustion. The obtained results were compared with literature, as shown in supplementary material (Table S1) (Ali, Khan, Asiri et al., 2018; Bandal, Jadhav, & Kim, 2017; Jadhav, Bandal, & Kim, 2017; Su, Lu, Wang, & Huang, 2012; Wang et al., 2017). 3.2.1 Effect of Cu@CC amount in H2 production As Cu@CC shows better performance than CC, Ag@CC, and Fe@CC, therefore, various amount of Cu@CC was testified on NaBH4 methanolysis reaction. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 4(b), where, 0.0150 g, 0.0075 g and 0.0038 g were utilized in the methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 by fixing another condition. The mL of H2 produce by using different amount of catalyst was plotted against time. It is noticeable that at the same reaction conditions, the production rate of H2 was faster by increasing the amount of catalyst. As can be observed from Fig. 4(b), that 0.0038 g of Cu@CC take 11 min to complete the reaction, while 0.0075 g and 0.0150 g take only 8 min and 6 min for its completion. As the vital part of completion of reaction was carried by the Cu@CC, therefore increasing its amount will boost the reaction to complete for the same content of NaBH4. 3.2.2 Reusability of Cu@CC in H2 production The practical application of the catalyst is an important aspect for any catalyst; therefore, the reusability of the catalyst was determined. The catalytic efficiency of Cu@CC was examined by using the same catalyst for three cycles under identical reaction conditions (Fig. 4(c)). % hydrogen production and time taken were calculated and plotted for each cycle as can be seen from Fig. 4(c). The values for percent conversion were assessed from the complete H2 production in each cycle from methanolysis reaction of NaBH4, while the values for percent efficiency were found from the ratio of H2 production rates for each cycle of the catalysts (Cu@CC, re-use) to the first H2 production rate (freshly prepared Cu@CC). It is clearly observed from the Fig. 4(c) that Cu@CC catalyst shows 100 % conversion for each cycle in NaBH4 methanolysis reaction by producing same amount of H2 (188 mL). However, minor decline in efficiency after each cycle was observed, since initially 0.0150 g of Cu@CC produced 188 mL of H2 in 6 min while in 2nd and 3rd cycles, it took 9 min and 10 min to complete the reaction. This decline in efficiency might be due to either leaching (desorption) of Cu from the surface of CC or might be oxidation of Cu, which play the vital role in catalytic activity."
10,"Catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC toward catalytic reduction of NPs","3.3 Catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC toward catalytic reduction of NPs Organic aromatic pollutants like dyes and nitro-aromatic compounds have considerable adverse environmental effects. Nitro-aromatic organic compounds are regularly used and supplied in laboratories and industrial processes as they are of great importance in pesticides, synthetic dyes, photochemicals and pharmaceutical raw materials processing. The nitroaromatic organic compounds present a harmful effect on human health despite their high toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Besides, nitroaromatic compounds are toxic to aquatic plants and animals (Löser, Oubelli, & Hertel, 1998). NPs have been studied to substantially inhibit the development of cell components (chlorophyll a, protein, and carbohydrate), as well as the activities of some enzymes of Nostoc linckia species like nitrogenase, glutamine synthetase and nitrate reductase (Megharaj, Pearson, & Venkateswarlu, 1991). In addition to the issue of odors, NPs also induce color problems in water bodies to some extent and thus become sources of pollution to aquatic organisms by reducing sunlight and as a result cause a disruption in aquatic life as well (Kamal et al., 2016a). Therefore, the presence of very lower NPs concentrations poses a real risk to aquatic ecosystem since it is hard to degrade even their lower concentration (Gul et al., 2017). NPs are very toxics aquatic and environmental pollutants and therefore, elimination of NPs from aquatic system is mandatory in order to get rid of these pollutants for the sake of aquatic animals and environment. Also, the catalytic reduction of NPs has attracted great attention and has been broadly explored. Hence, different catalytic systems have been established and tested for the catalytic reduction of NPs. Therefore, in search of highly stable and efficient system for the catalytic reduction of NPs, here we developed cotton cellulose stabilized nanoparticles i.e. CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC and employed as catalysts where the developed materials have shown superior catalytic activities toward the reduction of 4-NP in the presence of NaBH4 as shown in Fig. 5 . The reaction of 4-NP reduction is considered as thermodynamically favorable and kinetically unfavorable as the standard electrode potential of 4-NP (0.67 V) is larger than zero. 4-NP when dissolved in water, it imparts yellow color to the solution with a strong absorption band at 317 nm in UV–vis spectra. However, after adding NaBH4, 4-NP solution converts to bright yellow color with red shift in the wavelength (from λmax, 317 nm to λmax, 400 nm). This color change is related to 4-nitrophenolate ions formation in the solution as previously reported in literature (Naraginti & Sivakumar, 2014). Even in the excess of NaBH4, no change in this bright yellow color was observed, which indicated that 4-NP could not be completely transformed to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by only NaBH4 or it take very long time. The maximum absorption intensity of aqueous 4-NP appeared at 317 nm. Then added 0.5 mL of 0.2 M aqueous NaBH4 solution and with the addition of NaBH4 to the cuvette, the shift in 4-NP absorption peak occur. With the addition of NaBH4 the color of the solution changed from light to deep yellow. Actually, with the addition of borohydride solution to the UV cuvette raises the pH of the nitrophenol solution and generates nitrophenolate ions which are indicated by deep yellow color. CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC catalysts were added individually to a cuvette for a catalytic reduction of 4-NP where cuvette was filled with a mixed solution of 4-NP (3 mL) and NaBH4 (0.5 mL) solution. After addition of catalyst, the disappearance of color of the solution and decrease in absorbance of nitrophenolate ions was observed and a new peak at 320 nm appeared which is ascribed to 4-AP and thus it indicates the catalytic transformation of 4-NP into 4-AP (Fig. 5). Herein, UV–vis spectral data were recorded continuously after each minute. The gradual decrease in peak intensity at λmax, 400 nm and rise at λmax, 320 nm can be observed with passage of time in all the spectra, which associated to the transformation of 4-NP to 4-AP with time. These findings exhibited the good catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC toward nitrophenol reduction reaction. Comparing catalytic activity of CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC, Cu@CC was more efficient among all the selected catalysts (Fig. 5). Cu@CC catalyst completely reduced 4-NP to 4-AP in 4 min while 4-NP was completely reduced to 4-AP by CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC in 9, 13 and 23 min, respectively. This clearly indicate that Cu@CC is highly active and therefore selected for detail catalytic reduction of different NPs and dyes. As demonstrated by the Fig. 5(e), a strong linearity between ln(Ct/C0) versus time is obtained, showing that the catalytic reduction of 4-NP reactions fits the pseudo-first order reaction due to the high concentration of NaBH4 used in the above reaction. The pseudo-first order equation was used to determine the rate constant of NP reaction. (6) r = ln Ct / C0 = ln At / A0 = −kappt Where r is the rate of reduction of NP; t shows the reaction time; c is the reactant NP concentration; C0 show relative concentrations of reactant at time zero (initial concentration); Ct is the concentration of the reactant NP at different interval time of the reaction. Based on the results, it was found that rate constants of 4-NP reduction by CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC and Fe@CC were 0.39171 min–1, 0.97366 min–1, 0.27447 min–1, and 0.12925 min–1, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP is thermodynamically favorable by reducing agent NaBH4 in ambient conditions (E for 4-NP / 4-AP is –0.76 V) because borohydride ions are very strongly reducing agent in aqueous media (H3BO3 / BH4 = –1.33 V) but very sluggish kinetically and the probability of this reduction reaction decreases owing to the presence of kinetic barriers and potential discrepancies between acceptor (4-nitrophenolate) and donor (borohydride ions). The presence of the carbohydrate part in the Cu@CC catalyst has an adsorptive role for the 4-nitrophenolate and borohydride ions. Both cellulose and chitosan have been used extensively for adsorption of various pollutants (Al-Mubaddel et al., 2017; Kamal, Ali et al., 2016; Khan, Wei, Haq Khan, Tahir, Ahmad, Khan et al., 2016; Khan, Ali, et al., 2016). Thus, due to the high adsorption capacities of the mentioned carbohydrate polymers may provide high concentration reaction site for catalytic reaction. After the enhanced adsorption, the inorganic part of the Cu@CC catalyze this reaction by making it easier for the donor to overcome the kinetic barrier to pass the relay of electrons to acceptor molecules (Khan, Wei, Haq Khan, Tahir, Ahmad, Khan et al., 2016). The reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP takes place on the surface of Cu@CC catalyst. The catalytic reduction of 4-NP begins with the transfer of electron from borohydride to 4-nitrophenolate ions as soon as 4-nitrophenolate and borohydride ions adsorbed on the surface of Cu@CC catalyst. Cu@CC thus facilitates the 4-NP reduction reaction by lowering the energy of activation and playing a catalyst's role in a reaction. 3.3.1 Catalytic activity of Cu@CC in different NPs and dyes Besides 4-NP, Cu@CC was also used for the reduction of 2-NP, 3-NP and 2,6-DNP to aminophenols. As shown in Fig. 6 , Cu@CC can more efficiently catalyze the 4-NP among all studied NPs. Cu@CC catalyst shows outstanding activity in the reduction of 4-NP and complete 97.7 % 4-NP reduction in the presence of NaBH4 in 4 min, while it took 18 min for 91 % reduction of 2-NP, 9 min for 79.7 % reduction of 3-NP and 30 min for 94.4 % reduction of 2,6-DNP as shown in Fig. 6. Since the reactant NPs are color and show strong absorption peaks in the UV–vis spectra, therefore the rate of reaction of pseudo-first order could be expressed and determined from the relative absorbance intensity at time t, as described in Eq. (6). The plot between ln(Ct/C0) versus time (t) and the kinetic data of 4-NP, 2-NP, 3-NP and 2,6-DNP reduction catalyzed by Cu@CC catalyst are shown in Fig. 6(e). The calculated rate constants kapp for pseudo first-order at room temperature from the linear relations of ln(At/A0 ) were 0.97366 min–1, 0.12397 min–1, 0.13830 min–1 and 0.08816 min–1 for 4-NP, 2-NP, 3-NP and 2,6-DNP, respectively in the presence of Cu@CC. Besides NPs, Cu@CC was also used for the reduction of dyes like MB and ArO which are hazardous by nature and most commonly used in the leather, textile, foodstuffs, paper and pulp industries. Dyes cause water contamination because of hazardous nature. Chemical stability, versatility and non-biodegradability of these dyes cause water pollution once they are released into the outdoor environment. Some azo dyes are extremely toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic. Thus, effluent spill from the textile factories to water bodies has become a major issue for the urban society. Due to its complex organic structure, dyes are highly persistent for marine life. When Cu@CC was employed for the catalytic reduction of dyes, it efficiently reduced both MB and ArO. Cu@CC completely reduced MB and ArO in 15 min and 26 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 , Cu@CC can more efficiently catalyze MB as compare to ArO. However, when we compare with 4-NP, Cu@CC is much more efficient toward the reduction of 4-NP. Reduction rates of 4-NP (kapp =0.97366 min–1), MB (kapp =0.24679 min–1) and ArO (kapp =0.08082 min–1) by sodium borohydride in the presence of Cu@CC catalyst clearly indicate that Cu@CC more efficiently and specifically reduce 4-NP. Moreover, the Cu@CC nanocomposite has been compared with other reported nanocatalyst in term of required time to achieve complete reduction (Table S2) (Akhtar et al., 2020; Balakumar, Kim, Ryu, Manivannan, & Son, 2020; Dat et al., 2020; Sahu, Satpati, Singhal, & Mohapatra, 2020; Tran, Hussain, & Kim, 2020). 3.3.2 Effect of Cu@CC amount and NaBH4 concentration in catalytic reduction of 4-NP Cu@CC was comparatively more efficient than all other prepared catalysts as well as it was more effective for 4-NP as compare to 2-NP, 3-NP and 2,6-DNP. Therefore, different parameters were optimized for this reaction using Cu@CC as a catalyst. The effect of reducing agent was examined by using different concentration of NaBH4 i.e. 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.2 M using fixed amount of Cu@CC. As shown in Fig. S2, the rate of reaction increases with increase in concentration of reducing agent. Additionally, we tested the effect of 4-NP concentration. The concentrations of the 4-NP tested in the reaction were 0.065 mM, 0.098 mM and 0.13 mM, where it was observed that the kapp depend on the concentration of 4-NP. The dependency of the 4-NP concentration is clear from Fig. S3, which clearly indicate that the rate of reaction decrease as the concentration of 4-NP increase from 0.065 mM (kapp =2.0865 min–1) to 0.13 mM (kapp =0.9736 min–1). 3.3.3 Recyclability of Cu@CC in catalytic reduction of 4-NP Catalyst reusability and recyclability is a very crucial issue during catalysis. Majority of catalysts become deactivated after first or second use. Catalyst reusability is very significant because it reduces the process cost. That is why it is very important to separate the active catalyst easily and simply from the reaction for reusability and catalyze the reaction without any loss or deactivation. Therefore, Cu@CC was used for the reusability experiment in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP in the current study. In the case of Cu@CC catalyst, the catalytic reduction of 4-NP by borohydride is better than dyes and NPs. Reusability study of Cu@CC was assessed three times for the complete reduction 4-NP. Cu@CC reusability were performed by washing the used catalyst two times with distilled water and again used for the next reactions of 4-NP reduction in the same condition. Same experimental process was followed as explained above. Fig. 8 demonstrates the reduction of 4-NP and time taken in each cycle for complete reduction of 4-NP using same Cu@CC in each cycle. For the first use, the catalytic reduction of 4-NP took 4 min for the complete reduction, for the 2nd use it took 6 min, while for the 3rd use it took 9 min as shown in Fig. 8. Such recyclability results suggest that Cu@CC has superior catalytic ability and could be used as a catalyst in reduction reactions for several times. The developed Cu@CC catalyst therefore has real potential being used as an economic catalyst. 3.3.4 Application to real samples The catalytic reduction process for 4-NP using Cu@CC catalyst was ultimately assessed in real samples. Four types of juice samples (apple, mixed fruits, orange and peach) along with one milk sample (full fat milk) were collected from local markets (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) and used for this study. All the real samples solutions were prepared by taking 1 mL of real sample and add 100 mL of DI water. After that 2.5 mL of real sample solution was taken in UV cuvettes and analyze it than add 0.5 mL of 0.3 mM 4-NP and 0.5 mL of NaBH4 having a concentration of 0.2 M. Catalyst amount was 0.01 g of Cu@CC. The catalytic transformation of 4-NP was monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometer. It can be noticed that the % reduction of 4-NP was varied from 22.62 to 95.21% in 6.0–30.0 min, where milk sample spent an extended time to achieve the transformation process with very low %reduction (Table 1 ). This behavior is ascribed to the high interfering component content in milk that may restrict the transformation process. Results demonstrated that Cu@CC catalyst is reasonable and reliable for catalytic conversion and removal of 4-NP from real samples."
11,Conclusion,"We investigated a simple approach to prepare the nanoparticles decorated on cotton cellulose beads and applied as catalyst. We have demonstrated that all the catalysts were effective in hydrogen production as well as in degradation of NPs and dyes. Among all the studied catalysts, Cu@CC is more efficient toward hydrogen production and catalytic reduction of 4-NP, 2-NP, 3-NP, 2,6-DNP, MB and ArO but was more effective and specific for 4-NP. The reduction of 4-NP was completed by Cu@CC within 4 min, and thus showing excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of all types of organic contaminants especially 4-NP. The reusability of Cu@CC was also investigated for three repeated cycles in the reduction of 4-NP in which complete reduction was attained in 4, 6 and 9 min. The catalyst separation was performed easily by just taking the beads from the reaction. Thus Cu@CC is a good catalyst for H2 production i.e. the methanolysis of NaBH4 reaction and catalytic reduction of NPs and dyes. In addition, Cu@CC can be synthesized by simple process and are easily recyclable by just towing out from the reaction matrix. Furthermore, the cotton cellulose is abundant, easily available, environmentally friendly, and can readily adsorbed metals. Therefore, these catalysts have the potential to be utilized as environmentally friendly for the next generation catalyst system of H2 production from NaBH4 methanolysis reactions and catalytic reduction of NPs and dyes. Further, the high performance along with cost-effective and simple treatment approach of Cu@CC has the possibility for their potential to be practically applied instead of commercial catalysts."
