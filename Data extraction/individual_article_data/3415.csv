0,Introduction,"Entamoeba histolytica is the human intestinal parasite that causes amebiasis. This organism as a trophozoite lives under microaerophilic environments of <5% atmospheric O2 (i.e., <30μM dissolved) in in vitro cultures [1]; these O2 concentration values are similar to those usually found in the human colon [2]. Hence, the parasite is adapted to a fermentative glycolysis as the main pathway to produce ATP for cellular work. Remarkably, its glycolytic pathway deviates in several aspects from that in the human host [3]. It contains the pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes PPi-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase as well as a GDP-dependent 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (GDP-PGK) [4–6], which replace the functions in mammalian cells of the ATP-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and ADP-dependent PGK, respectively. Furthermore, amebas lack lactate dehydrogenase and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, nor do they have pyruvate decarboxylase as yeasts. Instead, pyruvate (Pyr) is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR, E.C. 1.2.7.1) [3,7] where the reductive equivalents are transferred to ferredoxin. Acetyl-CoA can be converted to ethanol (etOH) by the action of a bifunctional aldehyde–alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE, E.C. 1.2.1.10 1.1.1.1) [3,7], which consumes two NADH molecules per etOH produced, regenerating the NAD+ moiety necessary for continuous glycolytic flux. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA can also be transformed to acetate by the ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcCoAS, E.C. 6.2.1.13) [3,8] in a reaction that produces one mol of ATP per mol of formed acetate [3]. Early reports [8,9] established that under anaerobic conditions (N2 atmosphere) the major end-products of glycolysis in monoxenic amebas were 67% etOH and 33% acetate (etOH production rate of 5.7nmoles/min×mg protein, and acetate production rate of 2.1nmoles/min×mg protein). In contrast, under aerobic conditions (buffer equilibrated with air at 37°C), these rates were inverted and acetate production was favored (acetate 3.5nmoles/min×mg protein; etOH 1.7nmoles/min×mg protein; recalculated from [8] assuming that 1×106 amebas equals 1mg of protein as described before [10]). Later, the same group demonstrated that axenic amebas produce acetate only under aerobic conditions [9]. Recently, we reported that after exposure to a supraphysiological O2 concentration (0.63mM for 30min) amebas showed decreased etOH (∼30% remaining) and increased (40%) acetate contents during a recovery period of 60–90min compared to control amebas without stress. These changes were consequence of PFOR and ADHE inhibition induced by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated under such conditions [11,12]. Although these studies allowed us to determine the effects on energy metabolism of a strong and acute oxidative-stress condition, such high O2 concentration used is not found in living tissues or in in vitro experimentation. Therefore, it was considered necessary to explore the effect of an oxidant condition such as that found in in vitro experiments (∼0.18mM O2 concentration) to determine how the energy metabolism is affected and to identify which pathway component controls the acetate and etOH formation under this aerobic condition. By applying the fundamentals of metabolic control analysis (MCA) it can be quantitatively determined the degree of control that an individual enzyme exerts on a pathway flux, namely the flux control coefficient ( C ai J ). The C ai J values represent the impact on the pathway flux (J) of slightly changing the activity (a) of only one of its enzymes (i) in the cell; thus, a C ai J value of 1 means that the enzyme totally controls the pathway flux and it represents the one and only rate-limiting step of the pathway (for a review on MCA and its applications see [13]). However, MCA studies have demonstrated that the control of a pathway flux is shared in different degrees amongst all the pathway enzymes [13]. To determine physiological meaningful C ai J values under a particular metabolic state, the enzyme activity in the cell has to be titrated and in parallel the steady-state pathway flux has to be determined. From plots of pathway flux versus enzyme activity, the C ai J can be calculated from the derivative at the point of interest (wild type enzyme activity level). One of the MCA strategies to determine the C ai J is to titrate with specific inhibitors the enzyme activity in the cell [13]. Although this strategy has been successfully used in several cell types to determine the C ai J of each respiratory complex over oxidative phosphoryation (ATP synthesis) [13], this strategy has not been used for glycolysis because of the lack of inhibitors that specifically target one glycolytic enzyme without affecting the rest of the pathway enzymes and transporters. Recently, it was determined that diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of electron-transport chain flavo-enzymes inhibits Trichomonas vaginalis PFOR [14], whereas tetraehylthiuram disulfide (disulfiram; DSF) is a potent inhibitor of aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases [15]. Therefore, DPI and DSF can be used as specific inhibitors to determine the flux control coefficients of these glycolytic enzymes. In the present study we report the determination of the control coefficients of PFOR and ADHE on the fluxes of etOH and acetate formation in amebas subjected to moderate aerobic conditions. The aerobic condition was selected because when the parasites are invading the colon adjacent tissues or in in vitro experiments where air-equilibrated solutions are used, they become exposed to an environment with a higher O2 concentration than that found in the microaerophilic milieu from which they migrate. Since PFOR and ADHE are the enzymes with higher susceptibility to damage caused by oxygen stress, they can compromise the energy metabolism of the parasite."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and chemicals,"2.1 Reagents and chemicals Disulfiram and DPI chloride were from SIGMA (St. Louis MO, USA). All other reagents for enzyme activity and metabolite determination were of analytical grade."
3,Amebas,"2.2 Amebas Virulent E. histolytica trophozoites of the HM1:IMSS strain were isolated from experimentally induced amebic liver abscesses in hamsters and cultured in TYI-S-33 medium as previously described [16]. This procedure was routinely repeated every four weeks to ensure a stable virulent phenotype. Before use, the parasites were harvested at 450×g and washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS; 137mM NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 10mM Na2HPO4, 2mM KH2PO4) at pH 7.4."
4,In vivo enzyme titration assays,"2.3 In vivo enzyme titration assays Amebas were suspended at a density of 1×106 per ml in aerobic (air-equilibrated) PBS supplemented with 10mM glucose (PBS-G buffer; 0.18±0.09mM O2 concentration at 36°C and 2240m altitude; n =3). Samples of 1ml were poured into eppendorf tubes and incubated at 36°C in the presence of either 0.1μM DPI for 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60min to titrate PFOR activity, or 0.05μM DSF for 0, 10, 20 and 30min to titrate ADHE activity. At least six tubes were removed at the indicated times, one pair of samples were pooled together whereas the others were kept individual and all the tubes were centrifuged to remove the inhibitors. The cellular pellet from the pooled samples was processed to obtain cytosolic extracts for enzyme activity determinations as described below. The other tubes were processed for pathway flux determination as follows. The cells in two tubes were re-suspended in 1ml of PBS-G and immediately extracted with perchloric acid for further acetate and etOH determination (t =0). The cells from another pair of tubes were re-suspended in a similar fashion and incubated for 30min at 37°C; thereafter, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant recovered for metabolite determination. Similar series of tubes were processed in the absence of the inhibitor and used as control of enzyme activities and fluxes. At the end of each incubation protocol, the cell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion."
5,Enzyme activity determinations in amebal cytosolic fractions,"2.4 Enzyme activity determinations in amebal cytosolic fractions To determine the glycolytic and AcCoAS enzyme activities of amebas subjected to aerobic conditions, the cells were harvested and re-suspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer (25mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5mM dithiothreitol and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the activity determined under aerobic conditions as previously described [10,12]. For determination of PFOR and ADHE activities, the lysis buffer (which was supplemented with detergent for PFOR determination), lysis procedure and enzyme activity measurements were conducted under reductive conditions and a N2 atmosphere as described before [12]. ADHE activity was determined as described elsewhere [12] using saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA and NADH as substrates but in the absence of pyrazol. Since the activity was determined under initial velocity conditions (in the absence of products) mainly the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was evaluated."
6,Determination of metabolites,"2.5 Determination of metabolites Metabolites (glucose-6-phosphate, G6P; fructose-6-phosphate, F6P; Pyr and ATP) were determined using 20×106 trophozoites of control amebas or exposed to the inhibitors. Samples were treated and metabolites quantified as described before [10]. For the estimation of the metabolite intracellular molar concentrations, it was assumed that amebal trophozoites have an intracellular water volume of 20μl per 107 cells [10]."
7,Ethanol and acetate measurement,"2.6 Ethanol and acetate measurement Samples from the different conditions were extracted with perchloric acid and neutralized as described before [10]. Acetate was determined as described elsewhere [12]. Ethanol was determined in filtered acid extracts using a gas chromatograph GC 2010 (Shimadzu; Kyoto, Japan), equipped with an HP-PLOT/U fused silica capillary column (divinylbenzene/ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 30m×0.32mm×10μm) (Agilent, St Louis MO, USA)."

9,Determining the specificity of DPI and DSF inhibition on PFOR and ADHE activities in trophozoites,"3.1 Determining the specificity of DPI and DSF inhibition on PFOR and ADHE activities in trophozoites To determine the flux control coefficient using the specific inhibitor titration approach (reviewed in [13]), it is first necessary to determine that the inhibitor affected only one pathway enzyme during the experiment. DPI is a potent (K i values of 1–10μM) irreversible-type inhibitor of flavin-dependent oxido-reductases. T. vaginalis exposed for 2h to 10μM DPI showed no detectable levels of PFOR activity [14]. In a similar fashion, E. histolytica trophozoites exposed to submicromolar DPI concentrations showed a time-dependent PFOR inactivation (Fig. 1 A). The cell viability at the highest DPI concentration was 84% and 76% after incubations of 60 and 90min, respectively. The experimental condition of 1h incubation with 0.1μM DPI was selected because PFOR activity can be reliably titrated without compromising parasite viability (remaining PFOR activity of 25%±20 with 90% cell viability). Using this inhibitor concentration it was also necessary to determine that at each incubation time, there was neither increased inhibition nor reactivation of the enzyme for a further period of at least 30min, time required for pathway fluxes determination. Indeed, DPI caused an irreversible and steady time-dependent PFOR inactivation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, under this condition DPI only inhibited PFOR activity, showing negligible effects on the rest of the glycolytic, ADHE and AcCoAS enzymes (Table 1 ). The ADHE activity in amebas was titrated with several inhibitors of NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases such as gossypol and pyrazol. Amebas incubated for 30min with gossypol displayed an IC50 of 5μM for ADHE (Fig. S1A in Supplementary material), but this concentration also inhibited GAPDH (58% remaining activity, Table S1) and it diminished trophozoites viability by 66% at the end of the incubation. Pyrazol inhibited ADHE within the cells with an IC50 of 0.2mM (Fig. S1B) but it also had effect on GAPDH, showing 13% and 7% remaining ADHE and GAPDH activities after treatment with 0.5mM of the inhibitor for 30min (Table S2; cell viability was 76% at the end of the incubation). Finally, DSF potently inhibited ADHE activity with an IC50 of 0.05μM and, although the inhibition was not complete at this concentration (Fig. 1C), the activity could be reliable titrated (Fig. 1D) and the degree of inhibition was constant after the 30min period of flux measurement (data not shown). Therefore, 0.05μM DSF mainly affected ADHE activity (Table 1) and did not compromise cell viability (85% live cells after treatment); higher DSF concentrations also affected GAPDH activity (Table S3)."
10,Determination of PFOR and ADHE flux control coefficients under aerobic conditions,"3.2 Determination of PFOR and ADHE flux control coefficients under aerobic conditions The results described above clearly demonstrated that under aerobic conditions and short-term incubations, DPI and DSF can be used as specific inhibitors of amebal PFOR and ADHE, respectively, to determine their flux control coefficients on the rates of ethanol and acetate formation ( C ai Jetoh and C ai Jacetate , respectively) since they did not significantly affect the activities of all other pathway enzymes or cell viability, a requirement for flux-control coefficient determination by inhibitor titration [13]. Therefore, the activities of PFOR and ADHE were titrated with their respective inhibitors in cells subjected to aerobic conditions and the fluxes towards etOH and acetate formation were determined at each inhibitor concentration used. A plot of percentage of enzyme activity versus percentage of flux was constructed from which the C ai J values are usually calculated from the slope of the points closest to 100% enzyme activity (i.e. in the absence of the inhibitor). However, all experimental points allowed for a high fidelity linear fitting (Fig. 2 ). The calculated C PFOR J and C ADHE J values determined are shown in Table 2 . The negative value of the C ADHE Jacetate means that the enzyme represents a leak from the acetate production branch, thus disfavoring its production. The results indicated that ADHE mainly controls both, the etOH and acetate formation under aerobic conditions. Remarkably, amebas incubated in the absence of inhibitors showed aerobic glycolytic fluxes of 26±7nmol etOH/min×mg cell protein (n =3) and 3.6±0.8nmol acetate/min×mg cell protein (n =3). These results are in agreement with our previous observations showing that the route of etOH production prevails over that of acetate production also after being subjected to a strong oxidizing episode (15.3nmoles etoh/min×mg cell protein and 2.8nmoles acetate/min×mg cell protein [12]). Thus, contrary to what is usually thought about carbon fluxes in amebas, etOH is the preferred end product over acetate under mild aerobic conditions and after an acute exposure to high O2 concentration. Under microaerophilic conditions much lower acetate fluxes would be expected."
11,Inhibition of PFOR and ADHE promotes accumulation of glycolytic intermediaries,"3.3 Inhibition of PFOR and ADHE promotes accumulation of glycolytic intermediaries It was also evaluated the effect of PFOR and ADHE inhibition on the glycolytic intermediaries and ATP contents under the conditions described above (80% PFOR inhibition, 50% ADHE inhibition; Fig. 1B and D). When PFOR or ADHE in amebal trophozoites were inhibited with DPI and DSF, respectively, there was accumulation of G6P, F6P and Pyr, in parallel to a decrease in the ATP content (Fig. 3 ); however, most of the changes were statistically significant only when ADHE was inhibited. This pattern of metabolite changes correlated with the higher C ai J of ADHE over the aerobic fermentative glycolytic flux in E. histolytica. The results described above were schematized in Fig. 4 , in which the metabolic changes induced by PFOR and ADH inhibition in amebas subjected to aerobic conditions are represented. Compared to the control condition (Fig. 4A), PFOR inhibition (Fig. 4B) promoted (i) ∼10% (Fig. 2A and B) decrease in etOH an acetate fluxes (represented by the thickness of the arrow); (ii) 2.5-fold, 50% and 2-fold accumulation of G6P, F6P and Pyr, respectively; and (iii) not significant decrease in ATP content (Fig. 3). In contrast, ADHE inhibition (Fig. 4C) induced (i) significant 30% decreased flux to etOH and 15% increased flux to acetate (Fig. 2C and D); (ii) hexose-phosphates and Pyr hyper-accumulation; and (iii) 50% decrease in ATP content (Fig. 3)."
12,Discussion,"When amebas leave the lumen of the human intestine and invade the tissues they find higher oxygen concentrations (38.3 and 65μM in human liver and gastric mucosa tissues, respectively) [17]. Furthermore, in the hamster’s amebic hepatic abscess model, after amebas are injected into the portal vein, it takes at least 6h to develop ischemic and hypoxic foci, time at which the trophozoites initiate proliferation [18]. Moreover, it has been determined that virulent amebas have a more robust antioxidant defense compared to non-virulent amebas [11] and recently, we reported that in amebas subjected to a supra-physiological O2 concentration (0.63mM), PFOR and ADHE were drastically inhibited [12]. We hypothesized that during these periods under oxidizing conditions, the energy metabolism of amebas might be impaired, which in the long term affects the parasite’s survival abilities. However, such high O2 concentrations are not normally found in vivo or used in in vitro experiments. Therefore, it was relevant to determine under aerobic conditions (0.18mM dissolved O2 concentration) the control that the oxygen-inhibited PFOR and ADHE have on the glucose fermentation fluxes of the amebas. Using the MCA quantitative approach we determined that PFOR, despite being susceptible to inhibition by ROS [12] did not exert significant control (less than 10%) over the glycolytic flux in amebas subjected to aerobic conditions. In turn, ADHE exerted significant control on both the etOH and acetate fluxes under aerobic conditions (30% and −19% in average; Table 2). The rest of the control (60%) must lie in the reactions that produce Pyr but not in that of AcCoAS. Preliminary results using the elasticity analysis approach to determine the control distribution of a metabolic pathway [13] suggest that the group of enzymes that consume Pyr (which comprises PFOR, ADHE and AcCoAS), has a C ai Jetoh value near to the sum of the C ai Jetoh for ADHE and PFOR obtained here (cf. Table 2) (Erika Pineda & Emma Saavedra, unpublished results). This suggests that the flux-control exerted by AcCoAS is negligible. Our present results indicated that ADHE determines the fate of Pyr in the energy metabolism of the parasite subjected to aerobic conditions. The reason of the low PFOR control is that it is the second fastest pathway enzyme after TPI within the cell (Table 1). Therefore, PFOR has overcapacity over the glucose fermentative metabolism even under aerobic conditions in which partial inhibition of the enzyme can occur. On the other hand, ADHE displayed a higher flux-control most probable because of its low activity in the cell; its flux-control coefficient value is comparable to those of HK and PGAM that are the enzymes that also control the glycolytic flux, as determined by kinetic modeling of the entire pathway [10]. In E. histolytica, ADHE is the only enzyme able to transform acetyl-CoA to etOH at expenses of NADH oxidation, thus being the predominant enzyme involved in the regeneration of NAD+ for a continuous glycolysis. In the amebal genome there are five open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for ADHE which however share 98–100% sequence identity [19], which suggests that only one enzyme isoform encoded by 5 duplicated genes is present in amebas. On the other hand, there are many other ORFs for alcohol dehydrogenases and one for an aldehyde dehydrogenase in amebas [19], and some of them have been kinetically characterized showing the use of free aldehyde/etOH and NADP(H) as substrates [20–22]. Since the ADHE enzymatic assay employed here used acetyl-CoA and NADH as substrates, the effect of DSF inhibition was determined only over this enzyme; however, effect of DSF on other aldehyde or alcohol dehydrogenases cannot be ruled out but their contribution to fermentative glycolysis is expected to be negligible because they are unable to use AcCoA as substrate. The E. histolytica ADHE has an iron-binding domain that is essential for activity [23] and which may be involved in the enzyme strong inactivation under oxidizing conditions [12]. Its high sensitivity to ROS and its high control over the glucose metabolism under aerobic conditions may compromise the cellular ATP production as demonstrated by a marked decrease in ATP content when it was specifically inhibited by DSF. ADHE may also be inhibited by O2 under closer physiologically conditions after prolonged exposure to aerobiosis. In addition to its emerging relevance for the control of the energy metabolism of E. histolytica under aerobic conditions, recently it has been demonstrated that ADHE is also involved in iron uptake [24]. These features make this enzyme a suitable and novel therapeutic target for drug intervention. The present results also indicated that despite the 15% increased flux towards acetate under aerobic conditions, the extra ATP synthesized by the AcCoAS in the acetate branch does not suffice to maintain the basal ATP levels. Therefore, the contribution of the acetate branch to ATP synthesis seems low under aerobic conditions. Instead, acetate formation may mainly function for draining acetyl-CoA accumulation, which may slow down the glycolytic flux, since most of the pathway reactions are physiologically reversible with the exception of those of HK and the glucose transporter. Hence, AcCoAS may serve to replenish the CoA necessary for a continuous glycolysis. Interestingly, unbalanced accumulation of hexose-phosphates and Pyr was observed in amebas treated with either DSF or DPI (Fig. 3). This result contrasted with the balanced changes in glycolytic metabolites seen in amebas subjected to 0.63mM O2 [11]. The change in the metabolite profile induced by the DSF and DPI may favor increased fluxes through glycolytic branches, e.g. the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and glucosamine-6-phosphate synthesis at the F6P level; and/or increased glycogen degradation at the G6P level. In turn, an increase in erythrose-4-phosphate brought about by an enhanced flux through the PPP may metabolically affect hexose-phosphate isomerase (HPI) activity since this metabolite is a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (K i =5.9μM) [25]. Indeed, increases in intermediaries of several glycolytic branches have been documented in amebas subjected to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide and methyl viologen [26]. Hence, an environmental stress causing inhibition of the latter reactions of glycolysis may function as a signal for carbon-skeletons mobilization to other important glycolytic branches."
