0,Introduction,"Syngas is the basic material of chemical industry, which mainly contains H2 and CO. Syngas can be used in the synthesis of ammonia, hydrocarbons, oxycompound. Syngas is also a good candidate as fuel in the field of electricity generation or direct combustion when the ratio of hydrogen is higher. Especially in transportation industry, gas engine or fuel cell can use syngas to power the automobiles that can improve the energy efficiency and reduce the exhaust emission [1]. Considering the difficulty in energy storage, syngas can be stored in the form of chemical energy and instantaneously produced as needed [2]. Thus, the suitable syngas storage substance and preparing method are required. Syngas is mainly produced from coal and natural gas in industry. However, coal and natural gas belong to non-renewable energy resource. Meanwhile, these processes usually require efficient catalysts and high operating temperature [3]. In recent years, syngas produced from alcohols has been studied by some researchers. Pompeo F et al. [4] researched steam reforming from glycerol/water mixtures for syngas production, achieving 70% H2 in gaseous products with Pt/SiO (2 wt%) catalyst. Lin L et al. [5] investigated syngas production from water and methanol using Pt/α-MoC catalysts that hydrogen yield can reach 18,046 mol H2/(mol Pt·h) at 190 °C. Smith CH et al. [6] applied filtration combustion in ethanol conversion to syngas that the yield of H2, CO can be achieved 45%, 65% respectively. Wu H W et al. [7] analyzed steam and autothermal reforming of ethanol for hydrogen-rich syngas production. Blended with aqueous urea, the reforming efficiency can be achieved over 93%. Xin Y et al. [8] published a method of syngas production from ethanol solution by liquid phase discharge plasma. With the addition of water, energy consumption of H2 was only about 1.69 kWh/m3H2. Ulejczyk B et al. [9] studied syngas production from ethanol solution by dielectric barrier discharge. The percentage concentration of H2, CO and energy yield of hydrogen are 56%, 21%, 6.15 mol H2/h. Among these methods, ethanol can be generated by biological fermentation, which is economic and sustainable for hydrogen production. Besides, plasma reforming, which has been applied in pollutant degradation, biomass conversion, hydrogen production, is instant, efficient, free-catalysts and can be executed in normal pressure and temperature [10–13]. As a result, syngas/hydrogen production from ethanol by plasma reforming is a promising method. Discharge plasma can be initiated in gas or liquid [14]. Considering that the raw material ethanol is liquid, plasma discharge in liquid is more suitable. Discharge plasma in liquid ethanol for syngas/hydrogen production has been studied in some researches that can be categorized into glow discharge [15,16], microwave discharge [17,18], micro-arc discharge [19], pulsed discharge [20–25]. Tao J et al. [15] studied glow discharge in ethanol solution for syngas production. The flow rate and percentage concentration of hydrogen can reach 260 mL/min, 70% respectively. Sun B et al. [18] investigated syngas produced by direct standing wave coupling microwave discharge, achieving a high flow rate of hydrogen about 13,530 mL/min. Saksono N et al. [19] researched plasma electrolysis in KOH-ethanol solution. The flow rate of hydrogen can reach 1100 mL/min at the peak voltage of 700 V, while the energy consumption of hydrogen was about 18.5 kWh/m3 H2. Zhou R et al. [23] [[,24] [][][] used in-liquid pulsed discharge with needle-needle configuration reforming ethanol for hydrogen production. A relatively high H2 content of 90% was achieved in their work. As for discharge plasma, electrode corrosion exists in most of applications. The electrode structure of plate-pinhole-plate can overcome this problem because the plasma is initiated in the pinhole of insulant. The structure has been used in phenol degradation [26], organic dye removal [27], organisms eradication [28] and bacteria inactivation [29]. In this work, syngas produced by pulsed electrodeless discharge in ethanol/water mixtures is investigated. It is equivalent to storing the syngas in ethanol/water mixtures and releasing it by pulsed discharge as needed. Pulsed electrodeless discharge is achieved by the plate-pinhole-plate configurations. A small and portable device of syngas production is designed, which can satisfy some needs of military and industry like fuel cells [30,31]."
1,Experimental,"Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of experimental setup, which contains three parts: power system, generation system, and monitoring system. In power system, a direct current (DC) power supply, two rotating spark gap (RSG) switches, an energy storage capacitor (Ce), a pulse forming capacitor (Cp) and a drainage resistance (R) compose the high-voltage pulse power supply (DGM-60, Dalian Power Supply Technology). In generation system, syngas is produced by pulsed discharge with plate-pinhole-plate configurations. The two plate electrodes (d1 = 50 mm) are made of stainless steel, which are connected to high voltage and ground respectively. The pinhole (d2 = 1 mm) is in the center of the Teflon plate, which lies between the two plate electrodes. Before discharge, the reaction chambers on both sides of the Teflon plate are filled with ethanol/water mixtures. It should be confirmed that the plasma is initiated in the liquid. In monitoring system, the produced gas firstly passes through a buffer, which is used to stabilize the gas. Then, a rotor flow meter (LZB-3, ZhengXing) is applied to measure the flow rate of gas. After gas collection by a sampler, a mass spectrometry (HALO201, Hiden) and a gas chromatography (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU) are used to make qualitative and quantitative analysis of gas respectively. The computing methods of flow rate and percentage concentration of gas can be found in our previous work [8]. Discharge plasma can be generated in both sides of pinhole that one side is positive polarity discharge and the other is negative polarity discharge. The photo of typical pulsed discharge in both sides is shown in Fig. 2 . Besides, different type of discharge can be formed in one discharge process by adjusting the gap between plate electrode and pinhole. It’s great for comparing syngas production capacity by different discharge type under the same conditions."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Spark or corona discharge,"3.1 Spark or corona discharge With the variation of peak voltage, pulsed electrodeless discharge can be divided into two forms: corona and spark. Corona discharge can be generated in low peak voltage and many streamers appear just like Fig. 2 shown. Spark discharge is generated at relatively high voltage and a flash appears between pinhole and plate electrodes. Fig. 3 shows the electrical characteristics of pulsed electrodeless discharge in ethanol/water mixtures. All the tree lines of voltage, current and power show a gradual decline about corona discharge. With the peak voltage of 22 kV, the peak current and power can simultaneously attain 13 A, 0.25 MW, respectively. The voltage of spark discharge drops suddenly during propagation, meanwhile, a strong current forms within 1 μs? With the peak voltage of 25 kV, the peak current and power can simultaneously attain 210 A, 2.9 MW, respectively. By comparison, the peak power of spark discharge can reach over ten times than that of corona discharge. The aim of this work is acquiring hydrogen-rich syngas from ethanol/water mixtures. The chemical bonds C–C (3.606 eV), C–O (3.783 eV), C–H (4.302 eV), O–H (4.824 eV) exist in ethanol/water mixtures. The bond energy of hydrogen-containing chemical bonds is usually high, so higher energy is needed to break hydrogen-containing chemical bonds to obtain high purity hydrogen. Meanwhile, Wang S et al. [32] found that the electron density and temperature of spark discharge are higher than that of corona discharge. As a result, spark discharge is more suitable for the decomposition of raw materials to produce syngas."
4,The effects of peak voltage and electrode distance,"3.2 The effects of peak voltage and electrode distance The previous section illustrates that spark discharge is great for acquiring syngas with high hydrogen content. Therefore, the experiments in this section are carried out under spark discharge. The effect of peak voltage on syngas production was studied by varying voltage from 28 kV to 31 kV, while the discharge frequency, the volume fraction of ethanol, the distance between pinhole and plate electrodes were kept at 30 Hz, 50%, 6 mm respectively. The flow rates of total gas and H2 increase with the increase of peak voltage as shown in Fig. 4 (a). Meanwhile, as Fig. 4(b) shows, the percentage concentrations of H2 and CO are also higher with high peak voltage. The percentage concentration of other produced gas (including CO2, CH4, C2H2 et al.) decreases with the increased peak voltage. As mentioned before, the bond energy of hydrogen-containing chemical bonds is usually high, so the flow rate of gas is limited due to the low inject energy when the peak voltage is low. As the increase of peak voltage, the inject energy is relative high that it increases the probability of molecular dehydrogenation. Thus, both the flow rate and the percentage concentration of H2 increase. At the same time, the percentage concentration of CO increases and other produced gas (including CO2, CH4, C2H2 et al.) decreases with the increased peak voltage. This phenomenon results from the decomposition of these produced gas. For example, the decomposition of CO2 to CO and ·O is difficult to occur at low energy that it usually requires 350–500 kJ/mol. However, when the peak voltage is increased, enough energy makes it to react across the energy barrier, so the percentage concentration of CO2 decreases and CO increases. Besides, the products of CH4, C2H2 are easy to be decomposed to H2 at high peak voltage. This further explains why the percentage concentration of H2 increases at relative high peak voltage, while the percentage concentration of other gas decreases. Influence of distance between pinhole and plate electrodes on syngas production was investigated by varying the distance from 2 mm to 10 mm. The operational conditions were discharge frequency = 30 Hz, volume fraction of ethanol = 50%, peak voltage = 30 kV. As Fig. 5 shows, both the flow rates of total gas and H2 increase with the increase of the distance. Meanwhile, the percentage concentrations of H2 and CO are also higher with the long distance. However, the trends are contrast when the distance is 10 mm. It is mainly because the inject energy is constant at the same peak voltage and discharge frequency, the discharge plasma cannot maintain the type of spark at the long distance. When the discharge type converts to corona, the efficiency of gas production decreases. At this time, the percentage concentration of other gas increases mainly because of the ethanol and water vapor. When the distance was 8 mm, the negative polarity discharge was a form of spark alternated with corona. So the next experiment considers whether syngas production can be further increased by narrowing the distance between pinhole and high-voltage plate electrode. In the new experiment, the distance between pinhole and ground plate electrode is 8 mm and the distance between pinhole and high-voltage plate electrode is varied from 2 mm to 8 mm. As shown in Fig. 6 , both the flow rate and the percentage concentration of H2 can reach the peak at the distance of 6 mm. At this time, both sides of the pinhole are violent spark discharge. As the results shown above, if pulsed electrodeless discharge is used to acquire hydrogen-rich syngas with high yield, both high peak voltage and appropriate electrode distance are important. The long electrode distance can increase the interaction space of the plasma with ethanol and water molecules, so that more reactants can participate in the reaction and improve the syngas production efficiency. However, continuous spark discharge is necessary. The economic benefits of hydrogen produced by different methods are shown in Table 1 . The energy consumption is calculated by the integration of V–I obtained from the oscilloscope and the cost of hydrogen production mainly includes electricity and raw materials. The energy consumption of in-liquid discharge is lower than water electrolysis because electrolysis follows Faraday’s law, energy consumption usually cannot be lower than 3.5 kWh/m3H2, while plasma reforming is not limited. About the cost of hydrogen production, in-liquid discharge is basically equivalent to catalytic reforming of nature gas and methanol, which have been applied in industrial hydrogen production. Compared with catalytic reforming, in-liquid discharge does not require the heating process and the participation of high-temperature catalysts. Therefore, in-liquid discharge is more suitable for in-situ hydrogen production, which needs immediacy and long-term stable operation."
5,The role of free radical ·H,"3.3 The role of free radical ·H Pulsed discharge plasma can generate high-energy electrons thereby leading to the decomposition of ethanol, water molecules [36,37]. The intermediate products can be found by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) analysis as shown in Fig. 7 that OH (A2Ʃ+ (υ = 2)→X2П (υ = 0)), Hα (n = 3→n = 2), O ((3p5P0)→(3s5S0)), O ((3p3P)→(3s3S0)), CH (A2Δ→X2П), C2 Swan (A3Пg (υ = 4)→X3Пu (υ = 2), A3Пg (υ = 3)→X3Пu (υ = 2)) can be found in the discharge process. The oxidation potentials of free radicals ·OH, ·O are 2.8 V, 2.4 V, respectively that these two free radicals are great for the molecular breakdown. The production of ·CH and ·C2 illustrates the decomposition of ethanol molecules. The carbonaceous gas products, such as CO, CO2, C2H2, CH4 are primarily generated from ·CH and ·C2. The free radical of ·H is also generated that some work shows the generation of ·H may be beneficial to hydrogen production [38,39]. In order to verify the importance of ·H, CCl4 as a scavenger of ·H was added in ethanol/water mixtures [40,41]. Of course, in practical applications, the Cl-containing substances cannot be added to avoid fuel cell poisoning. The volume concentration of added CCl4 were 0.8%, 1.2%, 2.0%, 4.0%, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the effect of added CCl4 on the spectral diagnosis. The intensity of Hα decreases with the increase of the volume concentration of CCl4; meanwhile, the flow rate of hydrogen also decreases as shown in Fig. 8 that means hydrogen production is associated with ·H generation. In addition, Fig. 7 shows that the intensities of OH, CH, C2, O simultaneously reduce with high volume concentration of CCl4. It illustrates that the reduction of ·H also influence the generation of other free radicals. Furthermore, the flow rate of CO also decreases maybe due to the reduction of ·CH and ·C2 as shown in Fig. 8. To sum up, the generation of ·H is the key for syngas production by pulsed electrodeless discharge that ·H is not only the important substance for hydrogen production, but also affects the generation of ·CH and ·C2 thereby determining the CO production. The possible chemical reactions of free radical ·H generation are listed as below that e−∗ and e− refer to high-energy electrons and low-energy electrons, respectively [10,42]. The free radical ·H generated from water needs more energy compared with ethanol. It should be attributed to high O–H bond energy in water. (1) C 2 H 5 O H + e - ∗ → C 2 H 5 O ⋅ + H ⋅ + e - Δ H = 107.57 k c a l / m o l (2) C 2 H 5 O H + e - ∗ → C H 3 C H O H ⋅ + H ⋅ + e - Δ H = 99.25 k c a l / m o l (3) H 2 O + e - ∗ → O H ⋅ + H ⋅ + e - Δ H = 117.93 k c a l / m o l The chemical reactions of (4–7) are the possible pathways of free radical ·H consumption [43,44]. The reactions with ·H participation are usually accompanied by hydrogen production, so the reduction of ·H could decrease the yield of hydrogen. Meanwhile, the reactions involving ·H often lead to the formation of carbon-based radicals as shown in reactions (5–7). The carbon-based radicals can further react with some free radicals detected by OES like reactions (8–12) leading to the generation of syngas [45,46]. Therefore, free radical ·H can not only affect hydrogen production but also determine the formation of some carbon-based products.

6,Conclusions,"In this work, syngas production by pulsed electrodeless discharge in ethanol/water mixtures was investigated. A small and portable plate-pinhole-plate device for syngas production was designed, which can satisfy some needs of military and industry. It is equivalent to storing the syngas in ethanol/water mixtures and releasing it by pulsed discharge as needed. The positive and negative discharge can be simultaneously generated in both sides of the pinhole. Spark discharge can provide high discharge power, which is great for the molecular breakdown. Thus, spark discharge is more conducive to efficient syngas production. Among the produced gas, H2, CO are the main components, which account for about 99%. Including CO2, CH4, C2H2, other gas accounts for only 1%. Meanwhile, in order to acquire hydrogen-rich syngas with high yield, both relatively high peak voltage and appropriate electrode distance are important. The spectral diagnosis varied by the volume concentration of added CCl4 shows that the generation of ·H is the key for syngas production. The free radical ·H is not only the important substance for hydrogen production, but also affects the generation of ·CH and ·C2 thereby determining the CO production. Further research should consider how to improve the generation efficiency of the free radical ·H thereby improving syngas production."
