0,Introduction,"Furan-2-carboxaldehyde, better known as furfural (FAL), is a key platform compound produced from lignocellulosic biomass on a large scale [1–5]. Among the processes of FAL conversion, its catalytic hydrogenation is of great importance and has recently attracted huge attention as an approach to obtaining a wide range of valuable chemicals from a renewable source [4–7]. Numerous supported catalysts containing Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Au, Ni, Cu, Co were proposed for the hydrogenation of FAL in the liquid phase [4–7]. Recently, Chen et al. [6] have reviewed the catalysts for hydrogenation of FAL and discussed the dependence of the direction of its reductive conversions on the nature of metals and support, on the catalyst preparation conditions, and on the conditions of FAL hydrogenation including solvent, temperature, and pressure. The nature of the solvent in which the hydrogenation proceeds is of paramount importance, especially if the solvent is able to chemically interact with the reactants and reaction intermediates. This situation may occur when water is used as a solvent. In the case of aqueous-phase catalytic hydrogenation of FAL under harsh hydrothermal conditions (>100 °C and > 1 bar), water involves in the hydrolytic reactions of furan ring opening and rearrangements, which significantly expands the range of the resulting products. A variety of C5 alcohols and carbonyls like cyclopentanone (CPONE), cyclopentanol (CPOL), 4-oxopentanal (4-OPAL), 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone (5-HPONE), 1,4-pentanediol, and many other compounds (Fig. 1 ) can be obtained from FAL only by its catalytic hydrogenation under hydrothermal conditions [4–16]. These products are highly valuable chemicals and have a very diverse application. For instance, CPONE is an intermediate in the production of fungicides (pencycuron), drugs (cyclopentobarbital, cyclopentolate), and fragrances (hedione) [17–19], 4-OPAL was reported as a starting compound for the synthesis of different terpenoids and carotenoids [20], 5-HPONE is a building block in the synthesis of antimalarial medications (chloroquine, mepacrine), vitamin B1, and rubber chemicals (azopentanol-C) [21–23]. It is clear that an effective control of reaction pathways and thus selectivity to the desired products requires an understanding of the reaction mechanism, i.e. a step-by-step sequence of reactions with the participation of intermediates. However, most of the works concerning the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL are focused on the study of catalysts and reaction conditions providing a high yield of target product. As a rule, the reaction schemes for this process are supposed (or postulated) based on a simple analysis of the reaction mixtures without a direct in-depth investigation of the reaction mechanism. On the other hand, the catalytic hydrogenation of FAL in an aqueous solution at high temperatures and pressures includes numerous reductive and hydrolytic transformations, which makes the reaction mechanism very difficult to be studied experimentally. For these reasons, the data concerning the mechanism of FAL hydrogenation under hydrothermal conditions are contradictory or incomplete. Moreover, some reaction routes of this complex process elude the attention of researchers. There are main routes proceeding upon aqueous-phase catalytic hydrogenation of FAL and which can be distinguished depending on the catalyst composition and reaction conditions. The best known route with the participation of water is the direct conversion of FAL into CPONE over supported metal catalysts, first studied by Hronec et al. [24,25]. One of the reasonable explanations of this conversion is that intermediate furfuryl alcohol (FOL) resulting from FAL hydrogenation undergoes an acid-catalyzed Piancatelli rearrangement [5,6,13,14,16,26]. The reaction sequence includes protonation and dehydration of FOL, nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to the 5-position of the furan ring, opening of the furan ring, and C5 ring closure. Subsequent hydrogenation of the rearrangement product ultimately yields CPONE. This scheme explains the formation of intermediate 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (4-HCPONE), 3-hydroxycyclopentanone (3-HCPONE), and 2-cyclopentenone (2-CPONE) often detected among the products of FAL conversion. To study the role of water in the rearrangement reaction, Yang et al. [14] used 18O-enriched water as a solvent. The hydrogenation of FAL in H2 18O on the NiCu/SBA-15 catalyst under hydrothermal conditions (160 °C, 40 bar) gave CPONE which, according to mass spectrometry, was labeled with 18O. This result directly confirms the participation of water in the rearrangement reaction, but does not allow judging the reaction mechanism, since the authors did not track the passage of the isotope through the reaction course, including the detection of 18O-labeled intermediates. Other possible routes of catalytic aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL are poorly studied. So, the data about the formation of such carbonyl compounds as 4-OPAL (also known as levulinaldehyde), 5-HPONE, and 1,5-dihydroxy-2-pentanone (1,5-DHPONE) are very scarce [5,16,27–29], and it is still not clear which reductive and hydrolytic reactions lead to these compounds. Liu et al. [10] proposed the reaction network according to which 5-HPONE is formed from FAL (hydrogenation over Ru/C catalysts in H2O) due to deprotonation and hydrogenation of one of the Piancatelli rearrangement intermediate. Although the authors did not observe the formation of 4-OPAL, other researchers [5,16,27] consider 4-OPAL to be a precursor of 5-HPONE. Recently, we have shown [16,30] that during aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL on the Pd/C catalysts, the reaction pathway leading to 4-OPAL may be predominant (selectivity to 4-OPAL up to about 58%) depending on the composition of the catalyst and reaction conditions. Based on a thorough NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures, we assumed the possible mechanism of conversion of FAL into 4-OPAL [16]. This route is consistent with that proposed by Liu et al. [10] and includes the acid-catalyzed hydrolytic furan ring opening which is followed not by a C5 ring closure (as would be for Piancatelli rearrangement), but by hydrogenation of intermediate at the C = C bond. Therefore, despite the success in studying the catalytic aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL, we did not find any experimental results in the literature that would directly prove the reaction schemes proposed for this process. Although several powerful in situ spectroscopy methods have been developed to study the mechanisms of catalytic reactions [31–36], their implementation in the case of liquid-phase heterogeneous reactions under harsh conditions encounters a number of technical difficulties. Then, it may be beneficial to select the isotopic labeling technique which has been employed for a long time to investigate the catalytic reaction mechanisms [37–39]. Recent works [40–45] have demonstrated the advantages of this approach in studying the mechanisms of metal-catalyzed liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions proceeding at elevated temperatures and pressures. The present work continues our investigations on the aqueous-phase Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation of FAL [16,30,46]. Herein, we present the results of an experimental study of the mechanism of reactions occurring in the FAL hydrogenation under hydrothermal conditions over the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported palladium catalyst well-characterized earlier using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The following approaches have been used to study the reaction mechanism: (1) hydrogenation of key intermediates, which are formed upon FAL conversion, in order to reveal their role in the whole scheme of FAL hydrogenation; (2) isotopic labeling experiments using heavy water (D2O) as a reaction medium in the hydrogenation of FAL, which provides direct evidence of the occurring reactions. In order to identify the reaction products and monitor deuterium incorporation into intermediates, we employed NMR spectroscopy since this method in its various modes is currently regarded as a powerful tool providing useful structural information in the analysis of complex mixtures of various organic compounds [16,45,47–50]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents FAL (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was purified by distillation and stored in a refrigerator at –15 °C to prevent oligomerization. FOL (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF, 99%, Acros Organics), 5-HPONE (95%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-CPONE (96%, J&K Scientific), and CPONE (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received without further purification. 4-HCPONE and 4-OPAL were synthesized by known procedures (see the Supplementary Materials for more details). Heavy water D2O (deuteration degree 99.9%, purity 99.5%) was provided by Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. The multiwall CNTs Baytubes C 150 HP (S BET 196 m2·g−1, total pore volume 1.49 cm3·g−1) were purchased from Bayer MaterialScience AG (Germany) and, after drying overnight in static air at 120 °C, used as a support for catalyst preparation. Palladium(II) chloride (˃98% purity) was supplied by Aurat (Russia) and used for catalyst preparation without any purification. High-pure hydrogen gas (99.99%, NCCP, Russia) was used for catalytic hydrogenation."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Pd/CNTs catalyst containing 1 wt% Pd was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the support with an aqueous solution of H2PdCl4, as described earlier [16,30]. The impregnating solution was prepared by dissolving PdCl2 in water containing equimolar amount of HCl. After deposition of palladium precursor, the catalyst was dried in air at 120 °C and then in flowing argon at 150 °C for 0.5 h. Before the catalytic experiments, the catalyst was reduced in flowing hydrogen for 2 h at 300 °C. The 1% Pd/CNTs catalyst has been used previously, and its detailed characterization has been reported in our recent study [16]. Briefly, the palladium loading was determined by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma and found to be 1.0 wt%. According to pulse CO chemisorption, the catalyst contains highly dispersed palladium particles, and an average particle size (1.9 nm) is close to that determined by transmission electron microscopy (2.3 nm; see Fig. S1)."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments The hydrogenation reactions were performed in a Miniclave drive (Büchi AG) batch-type reactor. For isotopic labeling experiments, the reaction vessel was loaded with 200 mg of a catalyst and a solution of FAL (2.0 cm3) in 50 cm3 of D2O. In other cases, ordinary water (H2O) was used as a solvent, with the same amounts of reagents and catalyst. The reactor was flushed with argon and hydrogen to remove air. Then, the reactor was heated to a temperature of 150 °C and simultaneously filled with hydrogen gas to a total pressure of 30 bar (water–vapor pressure of 5 bar, partial pressure of hydrogen gas of 25 bar). The experiments were conducted under the indicated conditions and vigorous stirring at 1000 rpm for 1 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored either by measuring the amount of consumed hydrogen or by sampling the reaction mixture (1–2 cm3) at regular time intervals. The stirring was stopped after 1 h, and the reactor was cooled down to ambient temperature as quickly as possible. The reaction mixture recovered from the reactor was then filtered to separate the catalyst."
5,Analysis of the reaction products,"2.4 Analysis of the reaction products The identification of products and the monitoring of deuterium incorporation into intermediates were carried out by NMR spectroscopy. Note that the products were not isolated from the reaction solutions. 1H, 2H, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance-400 (Bruker) NMR spectrometer operating at 400, 61, and 101 MHz, respectively. The 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the zgpr pulse sequence to suppress the water signal at about 4.7 ppm (standard pre-saturation experiment). The J-modulated spin-echo (JMOD) technique was employed to record all the 13C NMR spectra. In the 13C JMOD NMR spectra, the methine (CH) and methyl (CH3) signals have opposite phase to those of the quaternary (C) and methylene (CH2) resonances. The spectral width was 28409 Hz (281 ppm) with a relaxation delay of 10 s. 1H–13C HSQC spectroscopy was also used in studying the deuterated samples. The two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra were recorded using the hsqcedetgp pulse sequence program optimized for a 13C–1H coupling constant of 145 Hz. The acquisition parameters were as follows: spectral width 10.5 ppm in F2 (1H) dimension and 219 ppm in F1 (13C) dimension, an inter-scan delay of 1.5 s. The quantitative analysis of the as-obtained reaction solutions (without any pre-treatment) was carried out by gas chromatography (GC) on a GKh-1000 (Khromos) instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a ValcoBond VB-Wax capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm, polyethylene glycol, stationary phase thickness 0.50 μm). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature of 50 °C for 12 min, increase 10 °C·min−1 up to 240 °C, hold 31 min. The carrier gas was argon (flow rate 30 cm3·min−1). The volume of sample injected was 1.0 μL. The area normalization method was used to determine the relative content of each component. The GC method was also used to confirm the qualitative composition of the reaction solutions by comparing the retention times of the components with those of the available authentic compounds."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogenation of intermediates detected in the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL,"3.1 Hydrogenation of intermediates detected in the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL In our previous work [16], based on a thorough NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures, we assumed a scheme of reactions (Scheme 1 ) that occur during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL in the presence of supported palladium catalysts including 1% Pd/CNTs. The transformations proceed mainly in two directions associated with the formation of either CPONE or 4-OPAL and 5-HPONE, which are the main products after 1 h of the process at a temperature of 150 °C and a total pressure of 30 bar (Figs. S2–S4; see also Table S1, entry 3). In the present work, to elucidate the proposed sequence of reactions, the intermediate products were hydrogenated on the 1% Pd/CNTs catalyst under reaction conditions that were the same as those used in the FAL hydrogenation (i.e., 150 °C, 30 bar, 1 h). According to the proposed scheme, FOL is a primary intermediate, and its hydrogenation should give the same set of products that are formed during the hydrogenation of FAL. Indeed, the formation of 4-HCPONE, 3-HCPONE, 2-CPONE, CPONE, 4-OPAL, 5-HPONE, and THFOL is observed during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FOL (Fig. 2 ; see also Figs. S5, S6). FOL is completely converted under the indicated conditions already after 20 min of the experiment. After 1 h, the main products are CPONE (selectivity of about 79%) and 4-OPAL. The selectivity to 4-OPAL changes little after 10 min and does not exceed 18%. Thus, on the whole, the results on the FOL hydrogenation do not contradict our scheme of the FAL hydrogenation (Scheme 1). The results on the hydrogenation of other intermediates are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen, THFOL and 2-MTHF are not converted under the reaction conditions applied (entries 1 and 2). For this reason, these compounds can be considered as final products of the FAL hydrogenation. The stability of THFOL under hydrogenation conditions, therefore, excludes the possibility of its hydrodeoxygenation to 2-MTHF in the FAL hydrogenation, which we assumed previously. The study of the hydrogenation of 4-OPAL and 5-HPONE (Table 1, entries 3 and 4) confirms the route leading to 2-MTHF (Scheme 1). 4-OPAL is a fairly stable compound and, under the specified hydrogenation conditions, is converted rather slowly (12% after 1 h) to give 5-HPONE and 2-MTHF. According to earlier studies [51,52], 5-HPONE exists in equilibrium with the cyclic hemiketal 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-ol (2-MTHFOL) already under ambient conditions. Thus, we suggest that the 5-HPONE conversion during hydrogenation proceeds via intramolecular cyclization into 2-MTHFOL. This intermediate is not detected in reaction solutions. The chromatograms of reaction solutions (see Fig. S2) exhibit a small peak corresponding to 4,5-dihydro-2-methylfuran which is formed possibly due to dehydration of 2-MTHFOL upon GC analysis. This assumption is confirmed by a GC–MS study of some samples. 4-HCPONE and 2-CPONE are readily hydrogenated at 150 °C and 30 bar to give CPONE with high selectivity (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). This fact, together with the FOL hydrogenation results (pay attention to the shape of the kinetic curves for 4-HCPONE, 3-HCPONE, 2-CPONE, and CPONE in Fig. 2), strongly confirms the reaction sequence leading to CPONE (Scheme 1). CPONE is hydrogenated to CPOL with a low rate (Table 1, entry 7). On the other hand, CPOL was not found among the products formed upon hydrogenation of FAL and FOL. Earlier, Hronec et al. [13] indicated that the conversion of CPONE to CPOL during the FAL hydrogenation is suppressed due to the blocking of the catalyst active sites by the products of FOL polymerization. Therefore, under the reaction conditions applied, CPONE can be considered as a final product of the FAL hydrogenation. Thus, we have determined the role of intermediate compounds in the reaction sequence during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL over a palladium catalyst. On the whole, the results obtained are consistent with the scheme proposed previously and clarify some of its stages (the conversion of THFOL to 2-MTHF is excluded under the reaction conditions used). However, the application of a direct method is required to get a deeper insight into the detailed reaction mechanism. In particular, it remains unclear what the role of water is in the intermediate interactions, what the interactions of water with the reactants and subsequent transformations of the intermediates lead to the formation of detectable compounds such as 4-HCPONE and 4-OPAL. In the present work, we performed isotopic (deuterium) labeling experiments using D2O as a reaction medium in the hydrogenation of FAL. As emphasized in [37], the information obtained by the isotopic labeling technique is unique in providing strong evidence of the true mechanism."
8,Deuterium labeling experiments,"3.2 Deuterium labeling experiments One of the confirmations of the involvement of water in the FAL hydrogenation (1% Pd/CNTs, 150 °C, 30 bar) was obtained when measuring the kinetic isotope effect. The rate constants were determined from the slopes of the initial linear regions of the hydrogen consumption curves recorded during the hydrogenation of FAL in ordinary and heavy water under the same reaction conditions (Fig. S7). The calculated values of the rate constants are k H = 1.88 (mmol H2)·min−1 in H2O and k D = 1.51 (mmol H2)·min−1 in D2O. Hence, k H/k D = 1.2, which is in good agreement with the literature value of about 1.1 for this reaction [14], indicates a secondary deuterium isotope effect [39,53], and confirms the participation of water in the hydrogenation of FAL. The application of 1H, 2H, and 13C NMR spectroscopy for the analysis of products obtained by the FAL hydrogenation in D2O (1% Pd/CNTs, 150 °C, 30 bar) made it possible to monitor deuterium incorporation into intermediates and thereby convincingly prove the reactions previously only assumed. A comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum of the solution obtained by hydrogenation of FAL in water (Fig. 3 a; the assignment of signals is shown in Table 2 ) with the 1H and 2H NMR spectra of the solution obtained by hydrogenation in D2O (Fig. 3b and c) clearly demonstrates what positions of organic molecules are occupied by deuterium atoms. So, the CPONE molecule is labeled with deuterium at the 2- and 5-positions (α-positions) of the ring. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3b), this is manifested in a strong decrease in the intensity of signal from these protons (2.12 ppm) compared with that from the H-3 and H-4 protons (1.84 ppm). At the same time, in the 2H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3c), the signals from deuterium linked to the CPONE ring appear only at 2.12 ppm. This confirms the absence of deuterium at the 3- and 4-positions (β-positions) of the CPONE ring. Similarly, from an analysis of the spectra presented in Fig. 3, one can conclude that when FAL is hydrogenated in heavy water, 4-OPAL, 5,5-dihydroxy-2-pentanone (5,5-DHPONE, product of the hydration of 4-OPAL), 5-HPONE, and 1,5-DHPONE are labeled with deuterium at the α- and β-positions (methyl and methylene moieties) relative to the keto group. Unfortunately, due to signal overlapping, the 1H and 2H NMR spectra did not allow us to establish the exact composition (degree of deuteration) of all isotopologues of CPONE and other detected products. Therefore, to further refine the structure of the products obtained in the deuterium labeling experiment, we used 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as two-dimensional 1H–13C HSQC correlation spectroscopy. Before proceeding with the analysis of 13C NMR spectra of deuterated products, it should be noted how the introduction of deuterium into an organic molecule affects its 13C NMR spectrum. The main effects of replacing hydrogen by deuterium are as follows [54–56]: 1. Deuterium isotope effect on the 13C chemical shifts, which implies that the signal of 13C–D is upfield shifted (shielded) relative to that of 13C–1H by about 0.2–0.7 ppm. The isotope shift for 13C–C–D is even less (0.11 to 0.15 ppm). The signal of carbonyl carbon in the deuterated aldehydes and ketones (e.g., in the O=13C–C–D moiety) is downfield shifted (deshielded) compared with the parent compounds (so-called negative deuterium isotope effect). 2. The CH, CH2, and CH3 groups give only singlets in the 1H broad-band decoupled 13C NMR spectrum, whilst a 1:1:1 triplet is observed for CD, a 1:2:3:2:1 quintet for CD2, and a 1:3:6:7:6:3:1 septet for CD3. The 13C–D couplings are smaller than the corresponding 13C–1H couplings by a factor of ca. 6.5. Therefore, usually only the direct 13C–D couplings (1 J CD = 20–30 Hz) are observed. The split of the signal for 13C nuclei into a multiplet leads to the loss of intensity. 3. The decrease in intensity or complete loss of signals for fully deuterated 13C nuclei is due to the fact that the relaxation time is increased and the nuclear Overhauser effect is reduced. An accurate analysis of the 13C NMR spectra, taking into account the above isotope effects, allowed us to identify the isotopologues of compounds formed upon the FAL hydrogenation in D2O. So, the 13C NMR spectrum of CPONE derived from FAL in heavy water contains two groups of signals (Fig. 4 ; see also Table S2, entries 1–3) which may correspond to three isotopologues: unlabeled CPONE, CPONE monodeuterated at the 2-position (CPONE-d 1), and CPONE deuterated at the 2- and 5-positions (CPONE-d 2). The singlet at 22.6 ppm corresponding to C-3, C-4 carbons in CPONE-d 2 and C-3 carbon in CPONE-d 1 is upfield shifted by 0.1 ppm compared with that for unlabeled CPONE (positive deuterium isotope effect). The signal for the deuterium-labeled C-2 and C-5 carbon atoms (38.2 ppm) is upfield shifted by 0.3 ppm and, in addition, is split into a triplet with a characteristic coupling constant 1 J CD of 20 Hz. This result confirms the above 1H and 2H NMR data about what carbons in CPONE are bonded to deuterium atoms (Fig. 3) and, furthermore, is consistent with the earlier published spectral data for deuterated CPONE [56,57]. To obtain deuterium-labeled intermediate 4-HCPONE, 3-HCPONE, and 2-CPONE, the FAL hydrogenation in D2O was stopped at an early stage (15 min after the beginning of the reaction), when the conversion is still incomplete. According to 13C NMR analysis of the reaction solution, 4-HCPONE is deuterated only at the hydroxy group, while the ring remains unlabeled (Fig. 5 a; see also Table S2, entries 4 and 5). At the same time, the ring of 3-HCPONE and 2-CPONE molecules turns out to be deuterated at the 5-position, which is indicated by a positive deuterium isotope effect for the signals corresponding to nearby C-4 carbons and especially by the splitting of the signals for C-5 carbons into low-intensity triplets (1 J CD = 20 Hz) shifted to a high field by 0.3 or 0.4 ppm (Fig. 5b and c; Table S2, entries 6–9). Based on these results and also assuming that a Piancatelli rearrangement is realized during the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation of FAL under hydrothermal conditions [5,6,13,14,16], we formulated the reasonable reaction mechanism that includes the formation of all isotopologues of 4-HCPONE, 3-HCPONE, 2-CPONE, and CPONE detected in the reaction solutions (Scheme 2 ). As can be seen, the initial acid-catalyzed opening of the furan ring in FOL proceeds with the participation of water. Since 4-HCPONE produced via a Piancatelli rearrangement is deuterated only at the hydroxy group, the appearance of deuterium at the ring of 3-HCPONE, 2-CPONE, and CPONE can be explained by the addition of deuterium to the C = C bond via the proton–electron transfer (PET) mechanism proposed by Shangguan and Chin [58]. According to this mechanism, polar protic solvent facilitates ionization of H-adatoms, resulting in the formation of protons. Then, solvated protons attack the substrate, while electrons are transferred into metal’s d band. Considering the PET mechanism and taking into account the exchange process between H2 and D2O on supported Pd (see Equations (1), (2), and (3) in Section 3.4), we proposed a mechanism leading to the formation of ring-deuterated 3-HCPONE and CPONE as a result of the D2O-assisted hydrogenation of the C = C bond in 4-HCPONE-d 1 and 2-CPONE-d 1 (Scheme 3 ). Note that the C = C bonds in 4-HCPONE and 2-CPONE molecules are polarized owing to the proximity of the keto group, which determines the sites of attack by active species. The 13C NMR analysis of the reaction solution obtained by the FAL hydrogenation in D2O (under the same conditions as described above, for 1 h) allowed us to definitely establish what carbon atoms in such products as 4-OPAL and 5-HPONE are bonded to deuterium. According to the results obtained (Fig. 6 and Table S2, entries 10, 11), two isotopologues of 4-OPAL are present in the reaction solution: 4-OPAL-d 3, in which deuterium occupies the 2-, 3-, and 5-positions, and 4-OPAL-d 2 labeled only at the 3- and 5-positions (α-positions relative to the keto group). For 4-OPAL-d 3, both signals corresponding to C-2 and C-3 carbons (36.8 and 35.2 ppm, respectively) are split into triplets (1 J CD = 20 Hz), proving the compound to be monodeuterated at these positions. The presence of 4-OPAL-d 2 is indicated mainly by the emergence of a singlet (206.5 ppm, C-1) which is upfield shifted by 0.1 ppm compared with that for 4-OPAL-d 3 (negative deuterium isotope effect). For 5-HPONE, only one isotopologue (5-HPONE-d 3), in which deuterium occupies the 1- and 3-positions (α-positions relative to the keto group) and possibly also the hydroxy group (exchangeable alcohol protons should be easily replaced by deuterium in D2O medium), is reliably identified (Fig. 6 and Table S2, entry 12). Based on the NMR data and taking into account the previous assumptions [10,16], we formulated the reaction mechanism which explains the formation of deuterated 4-OPAL and 5-HPONE detected in the reaction solution (Scheme 4 ). This mechanism includes the acid-catalyzed hydrolytic furan ring opening which is followed not by a C5 ring closure (as would be for the 4-HCPONE formation), but by hydrogenation of intermediate at the C = C bond. The appearance of deuterium at the carbon chain of 4-OPAL and 5-HPONE is apparently explained by the addition of deuterium via the PET mechanism (Scheme 5 ), as in the case of the formation of ring-deuterated 3-HCPONE and CPONE. Probably, the presence of deuterium at the 2-position of 4-OPAL-d 3 is caused by the keto-enol tautomerization (although intermediate enol was not detected by NMR). The appearance of 2-MTHF deuterated at the methyl group and 3-position of the ring (Table S2, entry 19) reliably proves that, as discussed above, 5-HPONE undergoes cyclization into 2-MTHFOL which is then converted to 2-MTHF. However, the above reaction schemes do not provide any explanations for the formation of such compounds as 2-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-ol (2-HMTHF) and 1,5-DHPONE which were identified in the reaction solutions. According to the 13C NMR data, the FAL hydrogenation in D2O yields, in particular, 1,5-DHPONE deuterated at the α-positions relative to the keto group (1- and 3-positions) and 2-HMTHF deuterated at the 3-position of the ring and at the methylene group next to the alcohol group (Fig. 6; see also Table S2, entries 13 and 15). From an earlier study [59], it is known that the acid-catalyzed ring opening of 2-HMTHF results in the formation of 1,5-DHPONE. Thus, based on the foregoing and considering possible ways of the FOL protonation [60,61], a plausible reaction mechanism can be proposed for the formation of deuterated 1,5-DHPONE from FAL (Scheme 6 ). The “unusual” 2,3-addition of water to FOL is possibly due to such configurations of the adsorbed FOL molecule that are not favorable for the reactions at the 5-position of the furan ring. Among the products formed upon the FAL hydrogenation, THFOL and tetrahydrofuranyl methanediol (THFMOL) were detected in small amounts. According to the 13C NMR analysis of the reaction solution obtained by the hydrogenation in D2O for 1 h, the carbon atoms in THFOL and THFMOL turn out to be non-deuterated (Table S2, entries 17, 18). For this reason, the hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL can be described by a simple mechanism (Scheme 7 ). As can be seen, the absence of deuterium at carbon atoms of the products is strong evidence that only H2 molecules (and not HD) react with organic molecules and, moreover, that THFOL is not further converted to 2-MTHF (only 2-MTHF deuterated at the methyl group and 3-position of the ring was detected in the reaction solution). Apparently, the reactions leading to THFOL occur only at the beginning of the process, when the degree of Pd-catalyzed H/D exchange (vide infra) is still insignificant. This is also indicated by the fact that the selectivity to THFOL is always low under the chosen hydrogenation conditions (less than 5 mol.% after 1 h of the experiment) and does not change in time during the process (see Fig. 2 and our earlier data [16]). Note that the assignment of signals in the one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra was confirmed by employing the two-dimensional 1H–13C HSQC correlation spectroscopy for the product analysis (Fig. 7 ; see also Fig. S8). The 1H–13C HSQC NMR spectrum of the reaction solution obtained by the hydrogenation of FAL in D2O for 1 h shows three intense positive cross peaks (Fig. 7). One of them corresponds to isotopologues of CPONE and represents the correlation between the signals of the H-3 and H-4 hydrogen atoms (δH 1.78 ppm) and the carbon atoms (δC 22.2 ppm) directly bonded to them. Other strong positive cross peaks (1.59/25.4 ppm, 3.40/60.5 ppm) correspond to CH2 at the 4- and 5-positions of deuterated 5-HPONE and 1,5-DHPONE molecules. In addition, the spectral coordinates of numerous weak cross peaks observed in the HSQC NMR spectrum confirm our assignments made for the one-dimensional NMR spectra. For instance, the positive cross peak at 2.03/28.8 ppm corresponds to monodeuterated methyl groups (i.e., CH2D) in 4-OPAL-d 2 and 4-OPAL-d 3. The negative cross peak at 4.18/66.5 ppm can be assigned to monodeuterated methylene group (i.e., CHD) at the 1-position of 1,5-DHPONE-d 4. Thus, it is clearly seen from the obtained results that deuterium labeling experiments using D2O as a tracer provides all the information needed to get a deeper insight into the detailed mechanism of the aqueous-phase catalytic hydrogenation of FAL. The use of NMR spectroscopy allowed us to establish the structure of the deuterated products and thus to track the passage of deuterium through the process course. As a result, we have proposed the mechanisms for four reaction pathways occurring throughout the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation of FAL under hydrothermal conditions."
9,H/D exchange between H2 and D2O,"3.3 H/D exchange between H2 and D2O A “blank” experiment without substrate (i.e., FAL) was performed to ensure that during deuterium labeling experiments, the H/D exchange between H2 and heavy water occurs in the presence of palladium catalyst. For this, the reaction vessel was loaded with the 1% Pd/CNTs catalyst (200 mg) and D2O (50 cm3). The reactor was filled with argon to a pressure of 5 bar and heated to 150 °C. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, the reactor was cooled down to ambient temperature and depressurized. A sample of D2O (2.0 cm3) was removed from the reactor and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Then, the reactor was filled with H2 gas to a pressure of 30 bar, and the suspension was vigorously stirred at 150 °C for 1 h (i.e., under the same conditions as those used for the FAL hydrogenation). After cooling, a sample of D2O (2.0 cm3) was removed from the reactor and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The quantitative analysis was carried out using acetonitrile as an internal standard (see the Supplementary Materials for more details). The 1H NMR spectra of D2O samples (Fig. 8 ) show the signal at 4.75 ppm corresponding to the protons of semiheavy water (HDO) [62]. According to the analysis, the initial heavy water contains 1.0 wt% HDO. The slight increase in the HDO content after stirring of D2O and the catalyst in an argon medium (Fig. 8b) may be caused by the H/D exchange between D2O and OH groups (or H2O) covering the catalyst surface. After stirring the suspension under hydrogen pressure, an almost 3.5-fold increase in the HDO content is observed (Fig. 8c). This unequivocally indicates the occurrence of H/D exchange between H2 and D2O in the presence of 1% Pd/CNTs catalyst. Based on these results and published data [63,64], we proposed a mechanism for this process (Scheme 8 ). Note that H/D exchange proceeds very slowly, since according to the calculation from the 1H NMR data, only 4 mmol of H2 is consumed within 1 h of the exchange (turnover rate of 355 h−1), whereas the amount of hydrogen consumed during the FAL hydrogenation in D2O for 20 min (see Fig. S7) is > 20 mmol (turnover rate of 7718 h−1). Besides, the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 8) do not show a signal corresponding to H2O protons (the peaks for protons of H2O and HDO appear to be close in chemical shift, but not overlapped [65]). This indicates that, under the chosen conditions, direct H/D exchange between H2 and D2O proceeds with a relatively low degree (D2O conversion of about 5% for 1 h). Evidently, H/D exchange plays a crucial role in the formation of products deuterated at carbon atoms (see Schemes 3 and 5 together with Equations (1), (2), and (3) in Section 3.4), and despite the low efficiency of H/D exchange, this is sufficient to produce the corresponding deuterium-labeled compounds from FAL. Therefore, during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL, water is involved not only in acid-catalyzed hydrolytic reactions but also in hydrogen transfer processes. The result concerning Pd/C-catalyzed H/D exchange between H2 and D2O is in good agreement with the earlier works [63,64,66] in which approaches to the synthesis of deuterium-labeled organic compounds were developed based on this reaction."
10,Assumptions on the nature of active sites,"3.4 Assumptions on the nature of active sites The knowledge of the nature (structure, composition) of catalytically active sites is of fundamental importance in studying the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. Obviously, the active sites differing in their nature are present on the surface of Pd/C catalyst [46], and the joint action of various active sites may occur during the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of FAL. In this regard, the determination of the precise role of each site type in catalytic reactions is very difficult task. However, based on our results and the literature data, we can make some assumptions concerning this issue (Table 3 ). Evidently, palladium is an essential catalytically active component for the first stage of hydrogenation of FAL to FOL and for the further reductive transformations, since no conversion of FAL is observed in the presence of pristine CNTs. We found earlier that the low-percentage Pd/CNTs catalyst contains palladium in both metallic Pd0 and electron-deficient Pdδ+ states [46]. The Pdδ+ species are considered as small palladium clusters and/or palladium ions stabilized due to their presence in an appropriate chemical environment [67,68]. The electron deficiency on palladium nanoparticles may be caused by their interaction with acid sites (oxygen functionalities) of the support. It can be supposed that the oxygen functionalities of CNTs (e.g., OH groups which were identified by infrared spectroscopy in previous work [16]) and electron-deficient palladium clusters, acting as Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively, catalyze the reactions of FOL protonation, thereby causing the hydrolytic furan ring opening. Also, the [Pd n –H]+ couples consisting of Pd clusters and protons (so-called collapsed bifunctional active sites) can catalyze all the stages of the process without desorption of intermediates [68]. Moreover, during the aqueous-phase catalytic process, the generation of additional acid sites can proceed on the catalyst surface, as indicated by van Santen and Neurock when considering interactions at the metal-water interface [69]. The interaction of H2O molecules with atomic hydrogen adsorbed on Pd surface yields hydronium ions which then migrate to the solution bulk: Pd–H + H2O → Pd + e– + H3O+ [69,70]. Taking into account the ability of palladium complexes to interact with hydrogen by its heterolytic splitting [71], the exchange process between H2 and D2O on supported Pd may also occur as follows: (1) [Pd n ]+H 2 + D 2 O ⇄ [Pd n - H] - +HD 2 O + (2) H D 2 O + + D 2 O ⇄ D 3 O + + HDO (fast) (3) [Pd n - H] - + D 3 O + ⇄ [ P d n ] + HD+ D 2 O where [Pd n ] denotes a palladium cluster containing electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites. Evidently, as noted above, these exchange reactions play a crucial role in the formation of deuterium-labeled compounds during the FAL hydrogenation. From the foregoing it follows that one of the approaches to regulate the directions of catalytic conversions during the FAL hydrogenation under hydrothermal conditions can be variation in the content of acid sites participating in acid-catalyzed hydrolytic furan ring opening. On the one hand, as we showed earlier [16], the support nature has a huge impact on the reaction routes. In contrast to, for example, carbon-supported palladium catalysts, on which acid-catalyzed reactions occur, the Pd catalysts prepared using basic support (MgAl oxide) do not catalyze reactions involving water, as a result of which FOL and THFOL are the principal products. On the other hand, changing the pH of the reaction solution can also serve as an effective tool for regulating the directions of catalytic conversions during the FAL hydrogenation. Despite previous works considering this issue [6,25], in the light of the mechanistic results obtained here, a further detailed study is required. It is important to note that the relative content of different active sites in Pd/C catalysts is determined by the nature of carbon support, Pd loading, as well as the conditions of the catalyst preparation, which has a large impact on the reaction rates and on the selectivity to products of the FAL hydrogenation. Despite this, the composition of the products (under the same reaction conditions) remains qualitatively unchanged when using various Pd/C catalysts [16,30]. Therefore, it can be accepted that the reaction mechanism of FAL hydrogenation under hydrothermal conditions, studied in the present work using the 1% Pd/CNTs catalyst, is also implemented on other Pd/C catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"Thus, in the present work, we have established the mechanism of Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation of furfural under hydrothermal conditions. The following approaches have been used to study the reaction mechanism: (1) hydrogenation of key intermediates, which are observed upon furfural conversion, in order to reveal their role in the whole scheme of furfural hydrogenation; (2) deuterium labeling experiments using D2O as a tracer in the hydrogenation of furfural, which provides direct evidence of the occurring reactions. It was found that the furfural hydrogenation process is realized through four reaction pathways (Scheme 9 ): 1. Piancatelli rearrangement of furfuryl alcohol formed upon the furfural hydrogenation. The reaction sequence includes protonation and dehydration of furfuryl alcohol, nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to the 5-position of the ring, opening of the furan ring, and C5 ring closure. Subsequent hydrogenation of the rearrangement product ultimately yields cyclopentanone. 2. Acid-catalyzed hydrolytic furan ring opening which is followed not by a C5 ring closure (as would be for Piancatelli rearrangement), but by hydrogenation of intermediate at the C = C bond. Subsequent reactions result in the formation of 4-oxopentanal, 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. 3. Protonation of furfuryl alcohol and 2,3-addition of water followed by the ring opening to 1,5-dihydroxy-2-pentanone. 4. Hydrogenation of furfural to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol via furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfural. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is not further converted to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Moreover, the dual role of water in the aqueous-phase process was revealed: 1. Water acts as a nucleophile, causing the hydrolytic conversions (ring opening reactions) of organic molecules. 2. Water is involved in the hydrogen transfer processes during hydrogenation (according to the H/D exchange experiment). The knowledge of the reaction mechanism for the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of furfural will allow one to control the selectivity to target products and may help in the development of highly selective catalysts for this process. The methods and approaches used in the present work, as well as the results obtained, can be useful in studying the mechanism of aqueous-phase hydrogenation of a wide range of oxygen-containing substrates in the presence of catalysts of different compositions."
