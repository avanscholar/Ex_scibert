0,Introduction,"One of the main barriers in the transition toward sustainable growth is the substitution of polymers from fossil sources with renewable based ones. Among the building blocks that can be obtained from sugars or platform molecules, diols are quite interesting as they are involved in the production of important polymers such as polyurethanes and polyesters. In particular, 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) could be the monomer of new renewable- or semi-renewable polyurethanes and polyesters with improved properties [1]. 1,4-PDO can be quantitatively produced starting from levulinic acid (LA) in the presence of Au/TiO2 or Au/ZrO2 catalysts at 150 °C under Micro Wave irradiation and 50 bar of H2 [2]. However, significant amount of catalyst was needed and, although the reaction was supposed to proceed through intermediate formation of γ-Valerolactone (GVL), direct hydrogenation of the lactone gave much lower conversions and yields. Several recent studies are reported describing GVL synthesis from biomass derived intermediates through heterogeneous catalysis [3–5]Other examples of noble metal-based catalysts are reported to give pretty good conversion and selectivity starting from LA [6–8]. Production in high yield of 1,4-PDO over copper-based Layered Double Hydroxides at 170 °C under 40 bar of H2 and using isopropanol as solvent was reported starting from both LA and GVL. Also in this case, better results were obtained starting from LA and equal amounts of catalyst and substrate (by weight) were used [9]. Bimetallic Cu-Fe-systems were found to hydrogenate ethyl levulinate to GVL in very high yield at 140 °C and 30 bar H2. On the other hand, reduction of GVL to 1,4-PDO over these systems requires much harsher conditions (210 °C, 70 bar of H2 and a catalyst/substrate ratio > 1.5) to reach 80% yield [10]. Ni-MoOx/Al2O3 systems were found to be active at 200 °C and 40 bar of H2 at a catalyst/substrate ratio = 0.01 but maximum yield in PDO was 67%. Surface defective MoOx species were recognized as the key factor to improve activity by facilitating the adsorption and activation of carbonyl group in GVL [11]. Thus, in spite of excellent results obtained with homogeneous catalysts in the direct hydrogenation of GVL into 1,4-PDO, with up to 98% isolated yield [12], only few effective heterogeneous catalysts have been reported up to now. While a Re-Ru/C catalyst gave 82% of 1,4-PDO starting from LA under 150 bar of H2 [13] when GVL was hydrogenated over 5% Ru/C in water under 70 bar of H2 at 200 °C, selectivity to 1,4-PDO was very low [14]. In this case 2-butanol was the main product as the decarbonylation reaction has a lower energy barrier with respect to the hydrogenation of the surface intermediate [15]. Moreover, high temperatures and the presence of acidic sites can promote dehydration of 1,4-PDO to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-Me-THF) (Scheme 1 ). For this reason, up to now high selectivity was achieved only with metal catalysts supported on amphoteric or basic supports. Cu/MgO with a 9% Cu content prepared by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on laminar MgO gave 64% yield in 1,4-PDO under 80 bar of H2 and 240 °C in dioxane [16].Moreover, the abundant basic sites in CuMg catalyst with the low content Cu was found to be essential for the opening of furan ring in GVL to form 1,4-PDO [17]. A remarkable 96% yield was obtained over a 30% Cu/ZrO2 catalyst calcined at 700 °C in ethanol under 60 bar of H2 at 200 °C. However, lowering the calcination temperature to 300 °C and rising the reaction temperature to 240 °C allowed to obtain a 87% yield in 2-Me-THF and no 1,4-PDO [18]. Best results were obtained in the presence of Cu supported on a hydrotalcite material with a Cu content of 54% by weight. This catalyst gave almost quantitatively 1,4-PDO at 93% conversion of GVL in dioxane under 50 bar of H2 at 160 °C [19]. Such high selectivity was ascribed to the introduction of strong Lewis base sites through calcination and reduction of the precursor thus promoting the formation of a bifunctional metal-base catalyst. It is interesting to note that under the same conditions a 37% Cu/SiO2 catalyst gave only 5% conversion. On the other hand, Cu/ZrOCO3 under hydrogen transfer conditions gave poor results [20,21]. Here, we wish to report that low loading Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the Chemisorption Hydrolysis (CH) method, already presented in the literature for the successful preparation of highly dispersed and low size copper catalysts [22] can effectively and selectively promote the hydrogenation of GVL to 1,4-PDO given that feature influencing the product desorption and secondary reaction inhibition are taken into account."
1,Experimentals,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Silica materials used as supports: SiO2 A (SSA = 210 m2 g−1, PV = 0.33 mL g−1) and SiO2 C (SSA = 380 m2 g−1) were obtained by Evonik, SiO2 B (SSA = 410 m2 g−1, PV = 0.63 mL g−1) was purchased by Fluka Chemicals, SiO2 D (SSA = 690 m2 g−1, PV = 0.62 mL g−1) was provided by Mitsubishi Chemicals. GVL with purity 99%, 1,4-PDO with purity 99%, copper nitrate trihydrate with purity 99% and 1,4-dioxane with purity 99% were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene at > 99.5% purity was purchased by Tokyo Chemical Industry."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Catalysts were prepared using the Chemisorption-Hydrolysis (CH) method [22] by adding the support to an aqueous [Cu(NH3)4]2+ solution prepared by dropping NH4OH to a Cu(NO3)2•3H2O solution with the desired concentration (8 g for 10 g of support to reach a nominal copper loading of 16%) until pH 9 had been reached. After 20 min under stirring, the slurry was diluted with 3 L of water in an ice bath at 0 °C. The solid was separated by filtration with a Büchner funnel, washed with water, dried overnight at 120 °C and calcined in air atmosphere at 350 °C for 4 h. The metal loading was confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis in previous works [23]. The following code was used in the discussion of this paper: CuO in the case of calcined catalysts, Cu in the case of reduced catalyst slash the utilized support."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Before any reaction the catalysts (100 mg) were pre-treated for 20 min at 270 °C under air and for 20 min under vacuum and then reduced through three hydrogen (1 bar) and vacuum cycles (5 mins each) at the same temperature. Generally, γ-Valerolactone (5 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of solvent. Then the pre-reduced catalyst was suspended in the reaction mixture and they were loaded under nitrogen flow in a 100 mL Parr reactor under different H2 pressure (30–50 bar) and temperatures (140 180 °C) for 22 h under mechanical stirring (750 rpm). Reaction conversions and selectivity were determined by GC-FID analysis using an Agilent 6890 Gas 0,25 Chromatography system with a Alltech Heliflex AT-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm ID × 0.25 μm). Dodecane was used as internal standard (carbon balance >98%). Byproducts were qualitative determined with GCMS– analysis using an Agilent 5957C GC–MS chromatograph with an HP-5 column. Conversion was determined using the following equation: % C = n ( t 0 ) − n ( t ) n ( t 0 ) × 100 Where n(t0) are the initial moles of GVL introduced in the reactor and n(t) are the unreacted moles of GVL determined with GC-FID analysis. Selectivity was determined using this equation: % S = p ( t ) n ( t 0 ) − n ( t ) × 100 Where p(t) are the moles of products formed determined by GC-FID analysis."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Static contact angle measurements of the tested solid supports were performed by means of a Krüss Easy instrument. Notably, moulded thin disks (25–30 mg of the sample powders, 1–5 tons) were prepared by using a Specac manual hydraulic press to achieve a compact and flat surface. A 1,3-propanediol drop of 5 μL was gently placed on the surface disk; the drop profile was extrapolated using an appropriate fitting function to acquire the static contact angle (θ). Measurements were repeated ten times to obtain a statistically relevant population. The specific surface area (BET method) and Pore Volume (determined by using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method) were measured after evacuation of the samples (ca. 0.2 g sieved as particles in the range of 80–200 mesh) at 350 °C for 4 h under vacuum by collecting N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C using a Sorptomatic 1990 version instrument from Thermo Scientific Carlo Erba. Mass loss of bare silica supports was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA 7, Perkin Elmer analyser) with targeted experiments aimed at determining the amount of the surface hydroxyl groups. Prior to the analysis, the sample was stored in a vessel with water vapor at room temperature overnight for saturating the surface. Then, a weighted amount of the saturated sample (ca. 10–15 mg) was loaded on the pan of the thermobalance. Each experiment was carried out under air flowing gas (60 mL min−1). The thermal program comprised three steps: i) heating at rate of 5 °C min−1 from 25 to 200 °C; ii) maintenance of the temperature of 200 °C for 30 min and iii) heating at rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 900 °C [24]. The instrument accuracy is around few μg. The hydroxyl amount of each sample was evaluated through the determination of the loss of mass in the range 200°−900 °C (third step of the thermal program) using the following formula: mmo l OH g cat − 1 = [ ( 2 × Δ wt % ) × 10 ] 18 g mo l − 1 The acid-base liquid-solid titrations on the samples were performed using 2-phenylethylamine (PEA, pKa = 9.90) as a probe in different solvents namely cyclohexane (aprotic-apolar), CPME and dioxane (both aprotic-polar). The experimental set up consisted in a HPLC line, comprising a pump (Waters, model 515), a reservoir and a monochromatic UV detector (Waters, model 2487, λ = 254 nm), coupled to a personal computer for the collection, storage, and processing of the data. The sample (0.050–0.100 g, crushed and sieved as 80–200 mesh particles) was placed in a small stainless tubular sample holder between two sand pillows. The sample was successively activated at 350 °C for 16 h in flowing air (8 mL min−1), then evacuated and eventually filled with the operating solvent. The sample holder, inserted in a glass jacket connected with a water thermostat to maintain a constant temperature (± 0.1 °C), was placed instead of the chromatographic column. The titrations were carried out by injecting successive dosed amounts of PEA in the operating solvents (20 50 mL, 0.10 0.15 M) into the line in which the solution continuously circulated. For each injection, the PEA solution recirculated onto the sample until adsorption equilibrium was achieved, revealed by the attainment of the UV-detector signal stability. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the PEA adsorption on the acid site, the number of acid sites per sample mass titrated at each equilibrium PEA concentration was evaluated, obtaining adsorption isotherms for the various samples. During the first run, the injections of PEA solution were done until surface saturation; then, clean solvent was flowed through the sample to remove the physisorbed PEA, and the second run adsorption was collected. Subtraction of the second run from the first gives the chemisorption isotherm, from which the strong acid sites can be computed. Total amount of acidic sites and strong acidic sites per mass of solvent were obtained through Langmuir linearization model of the experimental adsorption isotherms. The FT-IR studies of the absorption of the probe molecule were carried out on a FTS-60 spectrophotometer equipped with mid-IR MCT detector purchased from BioRad. The experiments were performed on a thin disk of sample (20–30 mg, pressed at 1–2 tons) after a reduction pre-treatment consisting in 20 min at 270° at air followed by 20 min at 270 °C under vacuum and finally a reduction under H2 through three hydrogen (1 bar) and vacuum cycle at the same temperature. The first spectrum was collected before pyridine adsorption as a blank. Then, pyridine vapours were adsorbed at room temperature and then desorbed in steps of 30 min until 250 °C at the given vacuum (10–5 bar). The spectrum of each desorption step was collected every 50 °C up to 250 °C. For quantitative analysis the amount of absorbed pyridine (mmolpy gcat −1) was calculated on the basis of the relationship reported by Emeis [25]. Surface composition of all the samples was analysed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) by means of an M-PROBE Surface Spectrometer with an Al (Ka) source and a spot size from 0.15 mm to 1 mm in diameter. An applied voltage of 10 V and a vacuum of 10−8 –10−7 Torr were used. The survey scans were investigated in 0–1100 eV binding energy range, using a spot size of 800 µm with an energy resolution of 4 eV (scan rate of 1 eV per step). The samples were pre-treated with the same procedure of FT-IR analysis. ESCA Hawk Software was used for data curation. All the resulting binding energy values were corrected using the C 1 s peak (C–C) fixed at 284.6 eV, as a reference. Normalized surface concentrations of all the species were computed by ruling out only the contribution of adventitious carbon (C–C at 284.6 eV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): TEM analysis was performed using a ZEISS LIBRA200FE. The samples were gently smashed in an agate mortar, suspended in isopropyl alcohol for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath and dropped onto a lacey carbon-coated copper TEM grid. The samples were analysed after complete solvent evaporation."
6,Results and discussion,"Four commercial silicas with different textural properties, two pyrogenic (SiO2 A and SiO2 C) and two silica gel (SiO2 B and SiO2 D) were taken into account as supports for the preparation of the corresponding copper catalysts to be tested in the hydrogenation of GVL to give 1,4-PDO (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge no evidence of effective silica copper catalyst in this type of reaction is present in the literature, mainly due to the limited activity and selectivity of silica supported systems. As already mentioned in the Introduction paragraph, good results were actually obtained with basic or amphoteric supports. The preferential adsorption of reactants and subsequent desorption of products on the catalyst surface play a significant role in determining both the activity and selectivity of this reaction, due to the different polarities of GVL and the produced diol. The surface acidity is also very relevant: on one hand a proper acidic character takes part in the activation of GVL favouring its conversion [26]. On the other hand it enables the formation of dehydration by-products such as 2-Me-THF, thus limiting the selectivity of the process. Indeed, wettability and surface acidity are moreover related to each other [27], sometimes requiring a fine tuning to balance their role in the reaction pathway. In this respect the solvent could also play a significant role. The surface properties of these matrices were therefore deeply investigated and in particular their hydrophilic character and surface acidity were evaluated to better understand their role in affecting the catalyst performances. Among the different methods known and reported in the literature [28], the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of the solids were investigated by using the contact angle measurement and the TGA analysis. In Table 1 the contact angle values together with the surface hydroxyl number determined by TGA experiments, are reported. A representative example of the results obtained is reported in Fig. S1. Notwithstanding the several repetitions, the contact angle standard deviations in the case of SiO2 B sample is relevant and ascribable to the inhomogeneity surface texture. Moreover, although slight differences are appreciable in the wettability features due to intrinsic hydrophilic nature of silica, it is interesting to note that on SiO2 C, the hydroxyl number (expressed in mmolOH g−1) was under the detection limit by using this method. The lower hydrophilic character of this silica was also confirmed by the contact angle value that is the highest among the analysed samples. On the other hand, SiO2 D resulted to be the more hydrophilic sample among the measured ones, presenting the highest value of the surface hydroxyl amount and the lowest contact angle. Porous fumed SiO2 A was chosen as the less hydrophilic support and, among the most hydrophilic ones, SiO2 B, was selected due to its commercial availability. As far as both hydroxyl number and contact angle the materials B and C samples can be considered comparable. Liquid-phase acid−base titrations of these two silicas by a strong base probe, such as 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) were performed to have a quantitative information of the acidic behavior of the supports before copper deposition. For titrations, cyclohexane was chosen to dissolve PEA, in first place. As a result of the apolar aprotic character of cyclohexane, the amount of the acid sites determined in this liquid, corresponds to the intrinsic acidity of the samples [29,30]. Experimental adsorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 1 . Data were collected and elaborated as explained in the materials and methods section. The first run gives account of the total amount of acid sites following the surface saturation with PEA; the second run gives rise to the weak acid sites obtained with a new titration after desorption of physisorbed PEA. The difference in adsorbed PEA between the two runs is therefore related to the number of strong acid sites. It clearly appears that the surface of SiO2 B exhibits a higher number of acidic sites compared to SiO2 A coherently with the more hydrophilic behavior shown by the contact angle values [27]. Interestingly SiO2 A e SiO2 B were not able to adsorb PEA probe in liquids acting as reaction solvents. This indicates that the support acidity does not participate in the reaction. The copper deposition was carried out exploiting the Chemisorption Hydrolysis method (CH). This technique ensures over CuO/SiO2 B a high dispersion of the CuO phase [22].In fact, this method involves the addition of the support to a [Cu (NH3)4]2+ solution at pH=9. When the support is silica possessing an acidic surface pH, the electrostatic interaction between the support and the solution allows the formation of a well dispersed CuO phase [22] easily reducible to the metallic phase with the formation of well-structured very small particles with cuboctahedral geometry [23,31]. The distribution was found, as already reported, to be centered around 3.4 nm for Cu/SiO2 B [31] and 4.7 nm for Cu/SiO2 D [23]. TEM analysis of CuO/SiO2 A sample shows a similar nanoparticle morphology. The particle size distribution is centered around a mean value of 2.8 nm, where more than 90% of the particles are anyway < 3.5 nm (ranging between 1.3 to 5.0 nm – Fig. 2 ). Moreover, as highlighted by STEM measurements, nanoparticles disperse onto the SiO2 support homogeneously without aggregation (Fig. S2). Therefore, we can conclude that this particular kind of silica favours high dispersion and formation of very small particles. Previously, XRD had showed no significant copper phase reflections suggesting that the particle size is too small to be detected [22]. It has been demonstrated that this morphology can lead to a higher hydrogenation activity [23]. Moreover, the presence of unsaturated coordination sites on the Cu particle, particularly when the metallic phase is reduced, gives these particles a Lewis acid character [23]. Insights into the acidity (nature and quantity of acid sites) of the reduced catalysts could be obtained from the analysis of acid sites present at the surface of the reduced catalysts by spectroscopic approach. These properties were evaluated by IR spectroscopy using pyridine as probe molecule, that allows to distinguish between Lewis and Brønsted sites and to quantify them according to the different diagnostic absorption bands of each site. Bands around 1450 cm−1 and 1610 cm−1 can be ascribed to pyridine bounded to Lewis acid sites, while absorption at 1550 cm−1 together with peaks near 1620 cm−1 and 1640 cm−1 are related to the presence of Brønsted acid sites [25]. Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the pre-reduced Cu/SiO2 A and Cu/SiO2 B compared with the bare supports. From the spectra it is evident that both catalysts bear the sole Lewis acidic sites, identified through the distinctive bands. A slightly higher number of sites can be detected on Cu/SiO2 A with respect to Cu/SiO2 B according to quantification calculations (Table 2 ). This evidence once again witnesses that the deposition of highly dispersed copper particles imparts to the material a Lewis acidic character, otherwise absent on the silica. Investigation on copper dispersion was studied through XPS analysis. This was performed to investigate the surface elemental composition of the two catalysts CuO/SiO2 A and CuO/SiO2 B also after reducing H2-treatment (Cu/SiO2 A and Cu/SiO2 B). Results in terms of surface atomic compositions expressed in percentage are shown in Table 3 . As expected, Si, O e C were the elements present on the surface of all the samples at the awaited binding energies. Carbon was still present in moderate quantities also after the exclusion of the adventitious one, probably due to some residues from the precursors of the silica synthesis. Cu/Si ratio were determined for all the calcined and reduced samples to have an indicator for the copper surface dispersion. In the case of Cu/SiO2 A, the Cu/Si ratio decreased by half passing from the calcined to the reduced form (Table 3). This could be likely due to the formation of Cu-clusters that occurred during the reduction treatment. In spite of this, CuO/SiO2 A has a very higher surface Cu/Si ratio compared to CuO/SiO2 B and to Cu/SiO2 B (both before and after reduction). This observation indicates that, it is possible to achieve higher copper dispersion associated with a stronger interaction between the metal phase and support depending on the silanol density of the silica support. In particular, considering that the preparation method gives account of an electrostatic interaction between the silica surface and the copper precursor, a lower hydroxyl density in the case of SiO2 A allows a distribution of the copper center not vicinal that prevents aggregation in calcination step conditions. Moreover, for both oxidized and reduced catalysts, photoelectron spectra of the Cu 2p region were recorded and deconvoluted (Fig. 4 ). This was useful to deeply investigate the copper oxidation state before and after the reduction pre treatment under hydrogen and to evaluate some possible interactions between metallic phase and silica. The binding energy values of the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks can be found in Table S1. As expected, on the fresh CuO-samples, split spin-orbit components can be observed with the characteristic splittings (Δ ca. 19 eV) [32]. In particular, Cu(II) species can be readily identified in CuO/SiO2 B through the characteristic binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 peak at about 933 eV and of Cu 2p1/2 peak at about 953 eV. It can be confirmed also acknowledging the presence of the typical shake up peaks near the main 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 ones [33]. However, in the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 photopeaks of CuO/SiO2 B two contributions are present indicating the existence of two different Cu(II) species [34]. Cu(II) species are still recognizable in the case of CuO/SiO2 A through the presence of the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 photopeaks which in this case present only one main contribution. Nonetheless, it can be noticed that binding energies for all contribution are shifted towards higher values respect to CuO/SiO2 B and many CuO-systems of the literature. The shift of copper species binding energies was noticed also by Zhu et al. for a Cu/SiO2 system [35]. They ascribed this phenomenon to the diminishing electron density of the copper species due to electron scavenging properties of the SiO2. This could be an indication of a stronger interaction between the metal phase and the support that leads to a total shift for the Cu 2p of CuO/SiO2 A. This was observed also in CuO supported on SiO2/Al2O3 systems [36]. The reduced samples (Cu/SiO2 A and Cu/SiO2 B) presented different peak profiles without any shake ups [33]. As known, even if Cu(I) and Cu(0) species are hardly distinguishable according to the binding energies of the relevant peaks, it can be hypothesized that almost all the Cu(II) species was reduced to Cu(0). In fact, the highest contribution peaks are now at 933.1 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 952.9 eV (Cu 2p1/2) in the case of Cu/SiO2 A and 932.7 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 952.3 eV (Cu 2p1/2) in the case of Cu/SiO2 B. The values are in accordance to the values of binding energies of a several standard Cu(0) samples reported by Dong et al. and other systems [37,38]. Another small contribution to both the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks can be observed in the deconvolution for both reduced samples. This could be ascribable to the presence of Cu(I) due to a brief contact with air previous the analysis. The over described features, namely acidity and highly Cu dispersed phase, make these catalytic systems very promising candidates for the GVL hydrogenation into 1,4-PDO. Results obtained in this reaction are summed up in Table 4 . First, we compared the two copper catalysts under the same conditions already reported for the CuMgAl catalysts, that is in dioxane under 50 bar of H2 and T = 160 °C (Table 4, entries 1 and 2) [19]. Both catalysts were found to be moderately active and fairly selective toward the formation of 1,4-PDO, showing similar conversion and selectivity, with yields in the desired product ranging from 50 to 60%. The deposition of CuO has a different impact on the acidity of the two supports, as shown on Fig. 5 . The number of total sites on SiO2 B decreases after copper deposition (from 0.813 to 0.512 mmolPEA gcat −1, for SiO2 B and CuO/SiO2 B, respectively), whereas the strong sites slightly increase in number (from 0.336 to 0.392 mmolPEA gcat −1) and significantly as percentage (from 41 to 76%). On the contrary, the total number of sites slightly increases on CuO/SiO2 A compared to SiO2 A (from 0.427 to 0.483 mmolPEA gcat −1) whilst the number of strong sites is almost doubled (from 0.180 to 0.316 mmolPEA gcat −1) with a percentage increase from 42 to 65%. The copper deposition entails a decrease of surface silanols that are those mainly involved in the total acidity (as measured by PEA titration). In addition, the dispersed copper phases on silica surfaces contribute also to additional acid sites (of Lewis type) as a function of the copper dispersion. Actually, XPS results indicate higher copper dispersion on CuO/SiO2 A, then the coverage of the surface silanols by copper is balanced by the addition of the dispersed copper phase, that leads to an increase of total acidity. Conversely, the lower copper dispersion of CuO/SiO2 B is not sufficient to cause an acidity increase compared to SiO2 B. Moreover, as already mentioned, both the intrinsic acidity and the number of strong acidic sites of SiO2 gel B are almost twice the ones from the pyrogenic one. However, after formation of the CuO phase on the two supports both the number of total sites and the number of strong acidic sites where much more comparable between the two materials due to a strong decrease of the total sites on the more hydrophilic silica. In particular, weak acidic sites can give account of this decrease as shown by the corresponding increase in strong sites percentage. In order to move toward a more sustainable solvent we chose a more polar ether such as CPME. In this solvent a sharp difference between the two catalysts became evident. Thus, the Cu/SiO2 A catalyst allowed us to obtain a 78% yield in 1,4-PDO and no formation of 2-Me-THF (Table 4, entry 3) whereas in the presence of Cu/SiO2 B no differences were observed. This is quite remarkable if we consider that a 37% Cu/SiO2 catalyst under the above-mentioned conditions gave only 5% conversion [19]. A wide series of 30% Cu catalysts at 200 °C and under 50 bar of H2 gave unsatisfactory results, in particular Cu/TiO2 gave 84% selectivity to 1,4-PDO at 45% conversion whereas Cu/SiO2 allowed to reach 58% conversion but no selectivity to pentanediol [39]. When the reaction was carried out in a continuous flow reactor under H2 pressure a 27% Cu/SiO2 catalyst gave very poor results as far as both activity and selectivity are concerned, with respect to a 44% Cu/ZnO catalyst that gave 98% selectivity at 16% conversion. Under these conditions Ni catalysts gave mainly 2-Me-THF whereas noble metal catalysts favoured the formation of pentanoic acid [40]. Moreover, a deep study of the influence of reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent, Substrate/Catalyst ratio of Cu/SiO2 has been reported by Simakova et al. allowing to reach 32% conversion of GVL and 67% selectivity [41]. We also observed some effect of these parameters in our protocol. Lowering the temperature or the H2 pressure had a negative effect on the conversion (Table 4, entries 5 and 6), whereas increasing the temperature to 180 °C promoted conversion but compromising significantly selectivity, thus lowering the yield to 63% (Table 4, entry 7). On the contrary, the increase of the Substrate/Catalyst ratio or the reduction of reaction time had a negative impact on conversion while keeping good selectivity (Table 4, entries 8 and 9). The significant increase in both conversion and selectivity when working in CPME was mainly observed for the Cu catalyst supported on the less hydrophilic silica, whereas the activity and selectivity of the other did not show remarkable differences. This prompted us to investigate whether the effective acidity of the two catalysts could be modified by the presence of the two solvents. The strong effect of the solvent on the catalyst acidity can be highlighted from the effective acidity titration with PEA. Actually, as shown in Fig. 5 and in Table S2 the density of total acid sites and in particular the density of strong ones over CuO/SiO2 A significantly diminishes both under dioxane and under CPME. Experimental isotherms are shown in Fig. S3. Looking at the effective acidity measured with PEA under the two reaction solvents, it appears that in dioxane the number of strong sites is comparable whereas in CPME both the number of sites and particularly the number of strong acidic sites are very much higher on SiO2 B (0.163 vs 0.025 mmolPEA gcat −1) (Table S2, Fig. 5). The presence of a lower density of strong acid sites observed with CuO/SiO2 A in CPME could therefore be the main reason for its much higher selectivity in this solvent. Therefore, the acidity can be tuned through the reaction solvent, allowing the lactone activation, while limiting the side reactions. In fact, moving from dioxane to CPME a strong effect was observed in the selectivity obtained with Cu/SiO2 A due to the mitigation of strong acid sites, notwithstanding the maintenance of a good total sites density. This effect is also combined with an increase in activity; the mitigating effect on hydrogenation activity, when using dioxane with Cu catalysts, has already been observed in other copper catalysed reductions [42,43] The choice of CPME was therefore found to be the turning point to achieve good results for this reaction. The physicochemical properties of this solvent, in particular its low toxicity, high boiling and low melting points, low peroxide formation rate, make CPME a valuable eco-friendly solvent in a very wide series of chemical reactions [44–46] and with potential application in biotechnology and biorefineries [47]. However, it has rarely been used in platform molecules transformations. It should also be noted that an alcoholic solvent is not suitable for this reaction, as some of us already reported that alcohols can nucleophilically add to the carbonyl group forming esters. This is a reaction that gives high yield in the ester when it is carried out over Cu/SiO2 catalysts, in particular Cu/SiO2 D, at 250 °C and 10 bar of H2 [23]. We could show that this kind of activity is catalysed by Lewis acid sites, namely Cu atoms at the steps of the metal nanoparticle. Cu/SiO2 A in CPME moreover expresses a higher activity. This solvent therefore allows to exploit the higher dispersion of this catalytic system shown by the XPS results above discussed. Not only, but, a significant role in this respect could be played by the less hydrophilic nature of this silica support that favours desorption of the product. Actually, the careful tuning of the support wettability to meet reaction requirements has recently been identified as a new tool for the design of catalytic processes. A superhydrophobic mesoporous acid, e.g., allowed to obtain HMF as the only product in dehydration of fructose, by completely preventing HMF re-hydration of the product [48], while the hydrophobic characteristics of the carbon supports were used to enhance the efficiency of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) for the dehydrogenative coupling of organosilanes [44]. An excellent catalytic turnover frequency for the hydrolysis of acetate esters with a long alkyl chain was obtained through surrounding of a sulfonic group by a highly hydrophobic environment [49] while the relevance of matching surface hydrophobicity of Zr zeolites and solvent polarity in MPV reactions was recently highlighted [50]. However, among the reactions more affected by this approach we should mention gas-liquid-solid three–phase reactions, such as catalytic hydrogenations [51,52] Thus, the solubility of H2 in solvents is quite low resulting in low H2 availability on the catalyst surface. It has already been shown that hydrogen availability on the catalyst surface increases with lowering of its hydrophilicity, that is with its aerophilicity, thus allowing to carry out hydrogenation reactions under lower pressure. This could be the case also in the present work. Indeed, by lowering the H2 pressure over the more hydrophobic catalyst Cu/SiO2 A we have the same result obtained at higher P over the less hydrophobic Cu/SiO2 B (entries 5 vs 4). This may be also the reason of the higher activity observed by some of us in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones and sulphones when using a catalyst supported on a less hydrophilic silica [53]. On the other hand, in the present case lower hydrophilic degree of the SiO2 A allows the highest conversions, whereas a lower average value of ca. 6.6 mmolOH g−1 (SiO2 B) gives rise to bad activities (< 60%). This behavior is in full agreement with the contact angle trend: an increase of θ corresponds to a lower affinity between the surface and the diol (Fig. 6 ). Thus, the lower hydrophilicity seems to increase the desorption of the diol molecules, which represent the actual reaction product, justifying the optimal conversions. Some of us recently reported on the hydrogenation of 3-methylcyclohexanone in the presence of two Cu/SiO2 catalyst, one supported on a silica gel (SiO2 B in the present paper) and the other on a less hydrophilic, granulated fumed silica (SiO2 A in this paper) [31]. Both catalysts were found to be very active and selective under very mild conditions (1 bar of H2, 60 °C) but the initial reaction rate observed over the catalyst supported on the less hydrophilic silica almost doubled the other one (42.7 vs 24.4 mmol h − 1) probably due to easier desorption of the alcohol formed. To confirm this hypothesis, that is the relationship between hydrophobic character of the support and activity, we carried out the reaction on the catalysts supported on SiO2 C and D (entries 10 and 11). It is apparent that Cu/SiO2 C allows one to obtain very high conversion (83%) that is comparable with the one obtained with Cu/SiO2 A, thus confirming the important effect of the less hydrophilic character when using CPME in this application. In the same way Cu/SiO2 D, prepared over a silica possessing 7.85 mmolOH g−1 and presenting a contact angle of 17°, shows a behavior in terms of activity very similar to the one observed for Cu/SiO2 B."
7,Conclusions,"The transition toward a biobased economy requires a continuous and fine adjustment of catalytic processes. The availability of lactones from renewable sources gives the chance to produce diols through their hydrogenation. The presence of acidic sites is needed to activate the carboxyl group of lactones that are quite recalcitrant to opening and require harsh reaction conditions, but this often results in early production of dehydration products. Here we have shown that a very fine tuning of the process of GVL hydrogenation, involving catalyst preparation method, choice of the support and choice of the solvent allows one to obtain 78% 1,4 –PDO yield. In particular the role of support hydrophobic/hydrophilic features is multiple: i) It drives copper dispersion, thus XPS shows that a higher Cu/Si ratio is obtained over SiO2 A, ii) It increases H2 availability on the surface, iii) It promotes product desorption. On the other hand, the solvent turned out to be a very effective tool to carefully dose the catalyst surface acidity. Thus, moving from dioxane to CPME the number of acidic sites increases by 24% on the catalyst supported on the less hydrophilic silica, thus boosting activity, whereas the strong ones are reduced by nearly one third, therefore allowing to reach 98% selectivity. This work shows the relevant role of liquid-solid acid-base titrations with PEA in elucidating the contribution of surface acidity to catalyst performance in the presence of solvents."
