0,Introduction,"Renewable energy sources are the second largest contributor to global electricity production. They accounted for 19% of power generation in 2000 compared with 39% from coal-fired power plants, 17% from each of nuclear and natural gas-fired power plants and 8% from oil fired power plants [1]. 92% of the electricity generated from renewable energy sources comes from large scale hydropower stations. Biomass utilisation schemes contribute 5% towards renewable electricity with the remaining 3% being produced by utilisation of new renewable sources, i.e. geothermal, solar, wind, wave and tidal energy [1]. There are many drawbacks, however, in the utilisation of new renewable energy sources for electricity generation, including [2]: • Requirement of large installation because of low energy density. • Low controllability and endurance because of frequent fluctuations. • Quantitative and temporal mismatches between demand and supply. To resolve the problems of dispatching large amounts of variable, intermittent and largely unpredictable renewable electricity to remote areas of a conventional electrical grid, an alternative efficient means of storing and transporting the energy will be needed. Energy storage in the form of chemical compounds is likely to play an important and increasing role. Hydrogen is the most promising storage medium due to its excellent energy content to weight ratio and the high conversion efficiencies achievable in its production (electrolysis) and use (fuel cells). Electrolysers can operate successfully with a variable power supply with a typical conversion efficiency >85% [3]. Electrolysers can be placed near the source of the renewable energy generated electricity, avoiding, therefore, the need for transmission line upgrades and preventing flows of power back up the distribution network. However, hydrogen produced from water electrolysis is relatively expensive due to the high capital cost of electrolysis cells. Gaseous hydrogen also has the disadvantage of low energy density. The introduction of gaseous hydrogen as an energy carrier requires a complete technical and organisational infrastructure for storage, transport, distribution and use. Liquid energy carriers (i.e. liquid fuels) have the great advantages of high energy density for storage and transportation and ease of handling. Despite the associated conversion efficiency, the conversion of gaseous hydrogen to liquid methanol results in a more convenient alternative energy carrier that can be handled by the existing infrastructure [4]."
1,Use of methanol,"Methanol (methyl alcohol, CH3OH or simply MeOH) may be used as • a hydrogen carrier; • a fuel; or • a feedstock for chemical synthesis. Methanol is the simplest liquid organic hydrogen carrier. It can be viewed either as a hydrogen storage compound or directly as a fuel. In methanol, each m3 of carbon combines with 1100m3 of hydrogen. In contrast, a maximum amount of 800m3 of liquefied hydrogen can be theoretically stored in a 1m3 tank at −253°C [5]. Methanol is specially favoured for future application in fuel cell-powered vehicles as an onboard hydrogen storage medium. This is mainly due to the fact that it can be broken down relatively easily, with the use of steam, into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, from which the fuel cell extracts the H2 fuel [6]. Biofuels (i.e. alcohols and biodiesels) and other renewable fuels offer clear advantages in terms of security of supply, reducing the dependency on imported petroleum products and technical and environmental performance. Biofuels can be manufactured via numerous production options. Because of its physical and chemical characteristics, methanol has proved to be an attractive automotive fuel [7,8]. Methanol can be mixed with conventional petrol without any technical modifications having to be made to the vehicle fleet. Most methanol fuelled vehicles use M85, a mixture of 85% methanol and 15% unleaded gasoline. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils (triglycerides) with methanol. Biodiesel could be used without any major technical problems to replace mineral diesel. MeOH can be used in direct methanol fuel cells, where there is no need for an onboard reformer [6]. For the power industry, fuel grade methanol is a clean and efficient alternative fuel for gas turbines [9]. Approximately 70% of the methanol produced worldwide is used in chemical synthesis [10]. Globally, formaldehyde production consumes 35% of the methanol produced worldwide. 25% and 9% are employed for the production of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and acetic acid, respectively [11]."
2,Manufacturing and processing of methanol,"Methanol can be synthesized from hydrogen and several carbon containing feedstocks including: • carbon concentrated sources, such as natural gas, coal or biomass; and • carbon dioxide from flue gases of fossil fuel-fired power plants or cement factories and the atmosphere."
3,Methanol from natural gas,"3.1 Methanol from natural gas Currently, more than 75% of methanol is produced from natural gas [12]. The production is based on three fundamental steps: natural gas reforming in order to produce synthesis gas (syngas), conversion of syngas into crude methanol and distillation of the crude methanol to achieve the desired purity [12–15]. Table 1 shows the main methanol-production technology suppliers and the operating conditions of the methanol synthesis."
4,Methanol from coal,"3.2 Methanol from coal The production of methanol from coal involves similar basic processing steps to those involved in its production from natural gas: production of synthesis gas by gasification of the coal, synthesis of crude methanol and purification of the crude methanol [16–18]. The same methanol reactors as those employed for the natural gas based process can be used. The syngas produced from coal has, however, a lower hydrogen content. The liquid phase methanol (LPMeOH) process is well suited for this application [18]. An important feature of the LPMeOH technology is its potential integration with a combined cycle power plant, i.e. integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation [18]. With this integration, methanol could be produced from the excess syngas not committed for power generation."
5,Methanol from biomass,"3.3 Methanol from biomass Methanol can be produced from nearly all organic materials [19]. Biomass consists of carbon, which is already available in an enriched form so that this resource is advantageous for the production of synfuels containing carbon [14]. When sustainable biomass production is guaranteed, a CO2 neutral system is formed. The process for producing methanol from biomass has the same steps as that of natural gas and coal based processes: syngas production, methanol synthesis and purification [14,19–22]. However, conventional gasification processes applied to biomass do not always produce a syngas with the quality required for methanol synthesis. In contrast to the biomass gasification process for electricity generation, the synthesis gas for methanol production should only contain a small proportion of inert gas components. The use of air as a gasification agent results in a syngas with high nitrogen content. For methanol synthesis, the optimal H2:CO2 molal ratio in the syngas is >2 [19]. The gasification of biomass always results in a gas with a too low H2:CO2 ratio. Specht et al. [22] studied the two principle methods for adjusting the H2:CO2 ratio in the derived syngas for methanol production: • Carbon dioxide separation. Excess carbon in form of CO2 is removed by an acid gas separation process. • Addition of hydrogen. An adequate amount of H2 is added for CO2 hydrogenation."
6,Methanol from CO2,"3.4 Methanol from CO2 Methanol can be produced by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide [22,23]: CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 OH + H 2 O In contrast to the previous processes, the production of methanol from CO2 is only possible via the input of renewably produced hydrogen. The process is presented in Fig. 1 . Available sources of CO2 that have been considered include flue gases of fossil fuel-fired power stations, cement factories, fermentation processes and water purification plants, as well as the atmosphere [6,22,24,25]."
7,Comparison of the processes,An evaluation of the processes described in Section 3 was performed. The criteria adopted for this preliminary screening process are • the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during methanol production and use; • energy conversion efficiency; and • estimated costs per tonne of methanol produced.
8,CO2 emissions,"4.1 CO2 emissions Life cycle CO2 emissions (i.e. CO2 emitted over the entire cycle of methanol production and utilisation) were evaluated by Specht and Bandi [19]. These include emissions due to the transport of the feedstock to the synthesis plant, the production process, the transport of the methanol to consumers and the emissions produced when it is used in a passenger car. The coal based process has the highest emissions, 3.8kg CO2/kg MeOH. Synthesis from natural gas leads to CO2 emissions of 1.6kg CO2/kg MeOH. In the biomass case, since energy inputs (typically fossil fuel energy) are needed for growing, harvesting and transport of the biomass and for the delivery of the methanol to consumers, total life cycle emissions, although very small compared with fossil fuel systems, are not zero (typically, 0.2kg CO2/kg MeOH). For the production of methanol from CO2 in the flue gases, life cycle CO2 emissions are 0.8kg CO2/kg MeOH. 50% of these emissions are due to the CO2 separation process. If atmospheric CO2 is the carbon source for methanol production, any CO2 emissions as a result of its separation, liquefaction and transport are offset by the CO2 removed from the atmosphere. Consequently, this option is almost CO2 neutral, producing only 0.1kg CO2/kg MeOH."
9,Energy conversion efficiencies,"4.2 Energy conversion efficiencies Values of the energy conversion efficiencies for different methanol production processes have been obtained from the studies of Roan et al. [12], Williams et al. [16], Specht and Bandi [19], Specht et al. [22] and Larson and Tingjing [26]. Because of the different definitions of the conversion efficiency employed, degrees of maturity of the individual processes and the capacities of the plants considered, these values should be considered only as first approximations for guidance purposes. The widely used commercial process of methanol production from natural gas is the most efficient methanol production process, exhibiting a typical value of 75%. This is followed by coal (48.5–61.3%) and the biomass process (51%). Both CO2 process options have higher energy demands, mainly due to the separation stage. The energy efficiency for the concentrated CO2 process is about 46% while that utilising atmospheric CO2 exhibits an efficiency of only 38%. With more advanced technologies, the efficiency can be improved to more than 50% and 44%, respectively [22]."
10,Production costs,"4.3 Production costs Estimates of the costs of methanol produced from natural gas, coal, biomass and CO2, according to the studies of Roan et al. [12], Williams et al. [16], DOE [18], Specht and Bandi [19] and Specht et al. [22,27], are presented in Fig. 2 in 2005 Euros. The selection of system components, the energy demand and the feedstocks are crucial [18,19]. Many other factors, such as capacity, mode of operation, operating conditions and the desired grade of purity of the final product affect the process economics. Therefore, the values presented in Fig. 2 are only guide figures for preliminary screening. Methanol from biomass or flue gas CO2 is at least 2–3 times more expensive than fossil fuel based methanol. Methanol can only compete with conventional fossil fuels under an environmental taxation system based on pollutant emissions, particularly those of CO2 [16,19,21,22,27,28]. Such a tax will favour mostly the production of methanol from biomass or CO2 in flue gases. Comparing the untaxed renewable methanol costs with taxed gasoline, the cost difference may be rather small [19]. Among the new processes proposed for the employment of renewable hydrogen for the production of methanol, the biomass process is the most cost effective. However, utilisation of flue gas CO2 for methanol production presents a competitive alternative. Therefore, the processes of methanol production from biomass and from CO2 in flue gases are selected for a more detailed analysis."
11,Methanol production from biomass,
12,Process technology,"5.1 Process technology A biomass to methanol plant consists of two main components, a biomass gasifier to convert the feedstock to synthesis gas and a methanol synthesis plant. Biomass gasification technology is at the demonstration to early commercial stage. However, integration of biomass gasification with the methanol production process is only at the R&D stage, and scale up and environmental issues may prove difficult to overcome [29]. The process proposed by Ouellette et al. [21] is taken as an example for this technology. Apart from the type of biomass used, the gasifier and the methanol reactor, no more details about the process were specified by the authors. Various studies have, therefore, been reviewed to complete the process description. Several routes involving conventional, commercial, or advanced technologies, which are under development, are possible. The proposed methanol production facility, based on the process suggested by Ouellette et al. [21], consists of the following basic steps (see Fig. 3 ): • Feedstock pre-treatment. Biomass resources most appropriate for this application include wood and wood wastes [20–22,29,30]. Feed preparation is dependent on the biomass characteristics and gasifier requirement and commonly includes chipping and drying [30]. • Biomass gasification. The selection and design of any biomass gasification system are determined mainly by the characteristics of the feedstock, existing environmental legislation, the costs and performance of the equipment available, as well as the capacity needed [31]. The oxygen needed for the biomass gasification comes from water electrolysis using electricity produced from a renewable energy source. Ouellette et al. [21] indicated that an amount of 10.32ktonne of oxygen was used to gasify 10.1ktonne of dry biomass annually. Under these conditions, all CO and CO2 in the syngas reacted with both the electrolytic and syngas hydrogen, but oxygen was in excess. Making use of the readily available supply of electrolytic oxygen can improve the overall productivity of biomass derived methanol [21,25]. • Syngas treatment. The product gas from the gasifier contains tars, particles, dust, alkali, sulphuric and chloride compounds that can block or poison the catalysts downstream and cause corrosion of the equipment [30,32]. Generally, the smaller the molecules from which a gas is produced, the lower is the capital investment required in the treatment facilities [14]. According to Hamelinck and Faaij [30], advanced high temperature dry cleaning (see Fig. 4 ) achieves contaminant concentrations between 10 and 20ppbv, sufficient to avoid catalyst contamination and damage to the equipment. • Hydrocarbon reforming. In the presence of suitable catalysts (usually nickel based), methane, tars and other hydrocarbons are reformed into CO and H2 at high temperatures [30]. Both steam reforming at 830–1000°C and 1.0–3.5MPa or autothermal reforming (ATR) at 900–1000°C is possible. • Hydrogen addition. The addition of hydrogen is to adjust to the proper H2:CO ratio for methanol synthesis. This ratio should be slightly higher than 2 [12,19]. Ouellette et al. [21] reported an electrolytic hydrogen consumption of 1.29ktonne for the production of 12.2ktonne of methanol per year. • Methanol synthesis. Ouellette et al. [21] chose the Lurgi methanol reactor for conversion of the reformed syngas. The Lurgi methanol process produces methanol by catalytic conversion of synthesis gas at low pressure in the gaseous phase [14]. The main advantages of this technology are low investments and production costs, improved operational reliability and great flexibility in the choice of the plant size [14]. • Distillation. After cooling and separation of the purge gas, the crude methanol is processed in a distillation unit to achieve the required quality. Optional are the inclusion of a gas turbine or a boiler coupled with a steam turbine to utilise the unconverted gas for possible electricity co-production [30]."
13,Performance and economics,"5.2 Performance and economics In order to assess the energy conversion efficiency of the processes considered on the same basis, all energy inputs were converted into thermal energy, assuming a thermal energy-to-electricity average conversion efficiency of 38.2% [33]. The energy contents of the biomass input and the methanol produced were evaluated based on their respective lower calorific values. A reference plant with 8000 working hours per year [25] was considered in order to compare the results of different studies. It should also be noted that these studies were conducted in different countries at different times. This might have affected the prices of raw materials as well as the operation and maintenance costs. In this analysis, all the prices were converted to 2005 Euros. The evaluation of the biomass to methanol process is based on the investigations of Ouellette et al. [21] and Specht et al. [22]. Both studies proposed two possibilities; either vent some of the CO2 produced in the gasification step, or add extra hydrogen in order to achieve the syngas composition required for methanol synthesis. In this analysis, the later option was selected to avoid CO2 emissions. Tables 2 and 3 show the main results obtained from these studies. The figures for the electricity consumption differ so much because Specht et al. [22] considered the electricity used for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis (i.e. 4.2kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen produced) [27]. This resulted in a lower energy conversion efficiency of the process compared with the corresponding figure in the study of Ouellette et al. [21], where only the electricity required by the methanol production process was considered. This also explains the much higher capital investment for the plant proposed by Specht et al. [22] and the corresponding higher unit cost of the methanol produced. The energy conversion efficiency of methanol production from biomass depends on three main factors: • Additional process steps (e.g. gas cleaning and conditioning and gas compression) consume energy and decrease the overall conversion efficiency. • Co-generation of electricity and heat can improve the efficiency. • Energy efficiency increases with plant capacity. Although significant progress has been achieved in biomass gasification and new improved technologies are being demonstrated, the process, with only a few rare exceptions, remains in the development stage. The main reason is that gasification of biomass to produce fuels shows lower energy conversion efficiencies and higher costs compared with the production of heat or electricity by direct biomass combustion [34,35]."
14,Methanol from flue gas carbon dioxide,
15,Process technology,"6.1 Process technology Using flue gas CO2 as a feedstock to produce methanol presents the advantages of being an emission abatement technology for this greenhouse gas and recycling CO2 emitted from stationary sources as a hydrogen carrier. In this system, methanol is produced by hydrogenation of CO2. This novel, but proven, technology has been studied by many authors [3,25,27,33]. The three principle steps of the methanol production process are: • CO 2 separation/recovery. Amine absorption is the dominant technology for carbon dioxide extraction from flue gases. Several studies have shown it to be the most economic option for conventional pulverised coal power stations [25,27,36–38]. • CO 2 /MeOH transportation and storage. Once CO2 is recovered from the emitting source, it must be liquefied and transported to the hydrogen production site. Commonly, renewable electricity is available for water electrolysis in relatively remote areas, far from the methanol demand site. So also, methanol might need to be transported after its production [2,10,27,33]. • Methanol synthesis. The production of methanol from recycled CO2 and H2 consists of two steps: methanol synthesis (or CO2 hydrogenation) over a catalyst and methanol purification [25,33,38,39]. However, prior to entering the synthesis reactor, the gases may need some conditioning."
16,Performance and economics,"6.2 Performance and economics The evaluation of the CO2 to methanol process has been based on the investigations of Mignard et al. [25], Specht et al. [27] and Sakamoto and Zhou [33]. Energy losses, high capital costs and the energy needed to liquefy hydrogen make the option of transporting electrolytic hydrogen to the methanol generation plant economically unviable. Therefore, two possible practical scenarios can be adopted in the production of methanol from carbon dioxide: • Scenario A: transport the CO 2 to the hydrogen production site. The costs and energy consumption of transporting both carbon dioxide, captured from the flue gases of coal fired power stations and methanol to and from the hydrogen production plant, respectively, were assessed by Specht et al. [27] and Sakamoto and Zhou [33]. The methanol plant proposed by Sakamoto and Zhou [33] consists of two major facilities, the MeOH synthesis unit and a fuel cell unit, and produces 323tonne/h (2.58Mtonne/year) of MeOH. Specht et al. [27] based their studies on methanol synthesis using a bench scale plant with an assumed capacity of 200tonne per day. Results from both studies are given in Table 4 . The higher energy conversion efficiency of the system proposed by Sakamoto and Zhou [33] is due to the higher capacity of the methanol plant, which is more than 38 times the capacity of the plant suggested by Specht et al. [27], and the lower overall energy consumption is principally due to the lower energy consumption in the CO2 recovery process. Furthermore, Specht et al. [27] did not take into account the energy needed in the form of heat in the methanol process, so the actual efficiency of his process is slightly overestimated. This scenario entails the difficulty of providing the heat necessary for methanol distillation units, i.e. 9.83kWh/kmol of feed gas [38]. This amount of heat cannot be satisfied by the heat available from the methanol synthesis reaction, i.e. 2.01kWh/kmol of feed gas [38]. To supply the remaining heat required, a small scale, efficient biomass combustion unit can be employed. • Scenario B: the CO 2 recovery site is very close to the electrolysis plant. The results of Mignard et al. [25] for this study are summarised in Table 5 . In addition to the advantage of the cost savings in processing, shipping and delivering the captured CO2, there is also the possibility of making use of the waste heat from the power station [25]. This avoids the production of steam to supply the methanol plant and, thus, eliminates any additional CO2 emissions. However, the limitation of this scenario is that renewable energy utilisation schemes are commonly located in remote locations, where they are more viable, far away from power stations from which the CO2 is recovered. Table 6 presents a comparison of available data concerning the economics of the processes investigated for scenarios A and B. The unit production cost of methanol depends strongly on the unit price of renewable electricity (assumed to be hydroelectricity) used for hydrogen production by electrolysis of water. The huge difference in capital cost, reported by Mignard et al. [25], compared with those for biomass processes is due to the inclusion of the extra units for flue gas cleaning, water purification plant for the electrolyser and a fuel cell plant to supply electricity when renewable energy is not available. For the production of methanol, the amount of CO2 recovered from the flue gases must be matched with electrolytic hydrogen with a 1:3 molal ratio. The hydrogen production will be usually limited to electricity off peak periods. Therefore, the capacity of the methanol plant will depend on the amount of renewable electricity committed for this purpose. Specht et al. [27] suggested that the efficiency of the entire process can be improved if more efficient CO2 recovery systems are employed. Commercially available catalysts employed in CO2 hydrogenation lose activity and selectivity. New catalysts for this process are currently under investigation."
17,Conclusions,"Excess generation capacity of renewable energy utilisation schemes at off peak periods can be used for hydrogen production by electrolysis. Currently, hydrogen has limited use as a fuel. Utilising this hydrogen for the production of methanol results in a more friendly fuel, ready to use within the current infrastructure. Because of their independence of fossil fuels and environmental advantages, two possible pathways of producing renewable methanol using electrolytic hydrogen have been investigated (see Fig. 5 ): methanol production by the synthesis of syngas resulting from biomass gasification and by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide captured from flue gases of mainly coal fired power stations. Methanol production from biomass has been proved cheaper and more efficient than from CO2 (see Table 7 ). It can, therefore, be considered as a realistic, short term option of producing methanol from renewable hydrogen. On the other hand, methanol production from carbon dioxide must also be seen as a way of abatement of the emissions of this greenhouse gas and reduce its emissions. Although many options are being investigated for utilisation of CO2 captured from flue gases of power stations, methanol production has been demonstrated to be a feasible alternative option. Further advances in CO2 recovery technology make this option a viable long term proposition for renewable methanol production."
