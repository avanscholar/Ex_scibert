0,Introduction,"A great attention has been devoted by researchers in recent years to hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, along with the identification of new processes for its production from non-fossil fuels [1–4]. Water photosplitting [5], photoelectrolysis [6] and photoreforming [7] are some of new sustainable technologies expected to allow in the near future an efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical one. However at present photosplitting and photoreforming efficiencies are still too low for industrial applications and new studies are still necessary. Although an efficient water photosplitting represents the final goal of all the investigations carried out in this field, photoreforming is of direct interest to the research community due to its ability of integrating hydrogen generation and wastewater treatment [8–10]. Indeed, wastewater organic pollutants or biomass-derived feedstocks can be used as hole scavengers able of reducing the occurrence of electron–hole recombination reaction, thus enabling photogenerated electrons to react with protons [7]. However, the scavenging effect exerted by organic species does not provide interesting hydrogen generation efficiencies. Literature reviews report different strategies to enhance hydrogen generation efficiency. One of these approaches is to modify TiO2, the most used semiconductor in photocatalytic studies, with noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt deposited on the oxide photocatalyst surface [11–14]. An increase in hydrogen generation rate is generally recorded on metal modified-TiO2 catalysts as a result of photogenerated electrons transfer from TiO2 surface to superficial metal spots. This photogenerated electrons transfer helps prevent electron-hole recombination [29]. The use of copper species, such as Cu2O, CuO, and Cu, instead of noble metals deposited on the semiconductor surface for hydrogen production has been investigated in the last years and recently reviewed [15]. In previous studies some of the Authors investigated hydrogen generation from different oxygenated compounds by adopting a nanocopper modified-TiO2-P25 catalyst prepared by a “in situ” deposition process [16,17]. Investigations on the nature of copper deposited on TiO2, supported by different diagnostic techniques, confirmed the formation of zero-valent copper nanoparticles with particle diameter of about 30nm. Moreover, the results obtained during these investigations indicated that hydrogen may be produced for the most part of the organic species tested at significantly higher rates than bare TiO2-P25. In particular, the best results were observed for organic species strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface such as methanol, glycerol, and formic acid. In the present work, investigations were extended to the development of a suitable mathematical model capable of simulating hydrogen production over the same catalyst (nano-Cu(s)/TiO2), developed in the previous study, when glycerol or methanol were adopted as sacrificial agents [17]."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All organic compounds used as sacrificial agents, TiO2 nanopowder (commercial grade, Aeroxide TiO2-P25, average particle size 21 nm, specific surface area 50±15m2 g−1, 80/20 anatase/rutile), cupric sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O,>98%) and chromotropic acid disodium salt dihydrate (C10H6Na2O8S2·2H2O, 78.5%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Glycerol (≥99.5%) was purchase from Sigma Aldrich, whereas methanol (99.9%) was purchased from Carlo Erba Reagents. Doubly glass–distilled water was used throughout this study."
3,Photocatalytic procedure,"2.2 Photocatalytic procedure Photocatalytic runs were carried out in an annular glass batch reactor (0.300L) thermostated at 25n°C and equipped with a magnetic stirrer. On the top of the reactor, an inlet allowed to feed reactants and nitrogen gas, and an outlet was used to collect liquid and gaseous samples at varying reaction times [30]. The reactor was endowed with a high-pressure mercury vapor lamp by Helios Italquartz (power input: 125 W), principally emitting at 305, 313, and 366nm (manufacturer’s data). The effective irradiances ( I λ i 0 ) at 305, 313 and 366nm are 2.56×10−6, 2.70×10−6 and 3.30×10−6 Einsteins−1, respectively. The lamp was located inside a glass cooling jacket in the center of the reactor and surrounded by the reacting solution. For each run a fixed amount of TiO2-P25 nanopowder was initially suspended in an unbuffered doubly distilled aqueous solution containing the sacrificial species. In order to avoid the undesired reaction between dissolved oxygen and photogenerated electrons, before starting the photocatalytic experiment, a nitrogen stream was bubbled into the solution for 30min. After this period, cupric sulfate pentahydrate was quickly added to the mixture. Moreover, throughout the photocatalytic runs, nitrogen was continuously fed at a flow rate of 0.3Lmin−1 in order to prevent the air inlet into the reactor."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures At different reaction times (≥5min), gaseous samples were collected by means of Tedlar gas sampling bags (1L) and injected into the gas-chromatograph to record the rate of hydrogen generation. For this purpose, a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) was used equipped with a HP-PLOT Molesieve 5A column (Agilent) and a TCD detector using argon as carried gas. Liquid samples, collected at different reaction times, were filtered on regenerated cellulose filters (pore diameter 0.20μm, Scharlau). The filtrate was used to measure concentrations of total dissolved copper and formaldehyde produced through the oxidation of methanol. In order to evaluate the concentration of total dissolved copper (cupric and cuprous species), a colorimetric method using an analytical kit (Macherey-Nagel) based on oxalic acid bis-cyclohexylidenehydrazide (cuprizone) was adopted. An UV/vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100 UV–vis Agilent) was used for the measurements at a wavelength of 585 nm. The concentration of formaldehyde was determined by the colorimetric method by Bricker and Vail [28], based on the use of chromotropic acid. The pH of the solution was monitored by means of an Orion 420 p pH-meter (Thermo). Irradiance measurements were carried out on the external wall of the reactor at different heights through a digital radiometer (Delta Ohm HD 2102.1). Two sets of measurements were done, the first on an empty reactor and the second with the catalyst slurry inside it. From each set of data it was possible to estimate the total power emerging from the reactor, in both the absence and the presence of absorption by the slurry. The difference between these two values was assumed as the power absorbed by the catalyst."
5,Kinetic model,"2.4 Kinetic model A simplified network of reactions was singled out by considering that, upon irradiation of Cu(s)/TiO2 catalyst nanoparticles, a couple of charge carriers is generated (r1): (r1) C u ( s ) / T i O 2 → h ν e − + h + reaction rate : G = Φ U V V · Q a , U V + Φ V I S V Q a , V I S The rate of reaction r1, which is a photochemical step, was accounted for by the products between quantum yields, in both the UVA ( Φ U V ) and the visible range ( Φ V I S ), and the respective average volumetric rates of photon absorption[34] by the catalyst suspension ( Q a , UV / V , Q a , VIS / V ), where V is the volume of irradiated solution (V =0.280L). Charge carriers may recombine through radiative or non-radiative processes (r2): (r2) e − + h + → k r h e a t a n d l i g h t reaction rate : k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] As reported by others [18], reaction r2 is regulated by a second-order kinetic law in which k r is the electron/hole recombination reaction constant. Otherwise, charge carriers can be scavenged. In particular, photogenerated holes can also react with the adsorbed sacrificial organic compound (S* ), which successively oxidizes on the catalyst surface (r4–r5), where reaction r4 is the rate-determining step for substrate oxidation: (r3) S + ∴ * ⇄ S * [ S * ] = C T ⋅ K a d s ⋅ [ S ] ( 1 + K a d s ⋅ [ S ] ) (r4) S * + h + → k h + S • * + H + reaction rate : k h + [ h + ] [ S * ] (r5) S • * + H + → H / f a s t ∴ * + S o x + 2 H + As previously proposed [19], the direct reaction between positive holes and organic substrates is only possible if organics are strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The adsorbed species concentration [ S * ] may be obtained by a Langmuir-type model for adsorption, as reported for the equilibrium r3 in which K a d s (M−1) is the adsorption equilibrium constant, and CT (M) is the total concentration of active sites on the catalyst surface for a fixed catalyst load q (gL−1). The term CT was calculated through the formula C T = q ⋅ N , where N is the total moles of active sites per unit mass of catalyst (molg−1). Photogenerated electrons react with protons (r6) arising from the organic oxidation (r4–r5): (r6) H + + e − → f a s t H → H / f a s t H 2 In this regard, some literature indications [27] report that hydrogen molecules are formed from the reduction of protons adsorbed on the solid surface, without clear details on the kinetics governing reaction r6. In the present work it was assumed that protons, arising from the organic oxidation on the catalyst surface (r4), immediately reduce and form hydrogen gas (r6). On the basis of assumptions reported above, a mathematical model was developed based on a set of mass balance equations for the main species involved in the process ( e q 1 − e q 7 ) : (1) d [ S ] d t = − k h + · [ S * ] · [ h + ] (2) d [ h + ] d t = G − k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] − 2 k h + · [ S * ] · [ h + ] (3) d [ e − ] d t = G − k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] − 2 k h + · [ S * ] · [ h + ] (4) d [ H 2 ] d t = k h + · [ S * ] · [ h + ] where (5) G = G U V + G V I S (6) G U V = Φ U V V · Q a , U V = Φ U V V ∑ i I λ i 0 · ( 1 − e ( − 2.3 · ε U V · [ T i O 2 ] ) ) (7) G V I S = Φ V I S V · Q a , V I S = Φ V I S V ∑ i I λ i 0 · ( 1 − e ( − 2.3 ⋅ ε V I S · [ T i O 2 ] ) ) The terms I λ i 0 , ε V I S , ε U V and are the irradiance of the lamp (see Experimental section), the extinction coefficients of the photocatalyst in visible and UVA wavelengths (measured parameters), and the light-path length (1.10cm) respectively. The equations ( e q 1 − e q 7 ) must be numerically integrated from the following initial conditions: [ S ] t = 0 = S 0 , [ h + ] t = 0 = 0 , [ e − ] t = 0 = 0 , and [ H 2 ] t = 0 = 0 in order to calculate the concentration of each species versus time, provided that a suitable value is available for each parameter included in the model proposed."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a,b show the results of two typical photorefoming runs on glycerol and methanol over bare TiO2-P25 and Cu(s)/TiO2-P25 nanomaterial, respectively. These figures indicate a sharp increase in hydrogen generation rate during the deposition of metal copper on the semiconductor surface, followed by a lower-reactivity steady state. For all photocatalytic runs, after reaching steady state, the lamp was switched-off and shortly after switched-on again. The new switch-on time was assumed to be the zero-time to collect data for modeling (orange box). According to the findings previously reported [17], a huge increase in radiation absorption in the visible range (λ>400nm) was recorded during the deposition of copper on the semiconductor. In order to understand if this phenomenon really contributes to charge carrier generation, some runs were repeated, both on glycerol and methanol, in presence of a filter (1M sodium nitrite solution) capable of cutting-off UVA radiation emitted by the lamp (λ<400nm) [31]. The results of these runs (data not shown) indicated that the Cu(s)/TiO2-P25 system is not reactive under visible radiation only (λ>400nm). The possibility of using the model proposed in the previous paragraph is conditioned by the availability of suitable values of kinetic parameters included in it ( Φ U V , Φ V i s , , k r , k h + and K a d s ). However, literature data are available only for some of the kinetic parameters needed. For example, some values for k h + and K a d s for glycerol [22,24] and methanol [21,24,33] using TiO2 are reported. For k h + parameter, a mean value of 1.4×1010 M−1 s−1 [24] was adopted as first attempt value for the modeling. On the other hand, comparing the values of K a d s reported for methanol, an one order of magnitude difference was found (1.4×10−2 mg−1 L [33], 1.9×10−3 mg−1 L [21]). The difference could be ascribed to the different experimental conditions adopted such as pH, composition of the aqueous matrices and temperature. This observation raised some doubts on the reliability of K a d s literature values, and it was therefore decided not to use them for the present modeling investigation. Therefore, in order to obtain values of the adsorption constants ( K a d s ) both for methanol and glycerol over Cu(s)/TiO2-P25, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type model expressing hydrogen generation rate was adopted: (8) r H 2 = k ' ⋅ K a d s · [ S ] 1 + K a d s · [ S ] Starting from Langmuir-Hinshelwood Eq. (8) and plotting the term 1 / r H 2 against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration (Fig. 2 ), a linear trend was observed from which it was possible to derive the suitable values for K a d s for methanol and glycerol (Table 1 ). Following the indications given above on the runs in presence of the UVA cut-off chemical filter, it was considered that Φ V I S = 0 , whereas no data were found for Φ U V and k r parameters for the catalyst used in the present investigation. The sole values found in the literature for these two parameters are related to bare TiO2-P25 [18,25,26], which could be adopted in the present modeling just as starting values for the optimization procedure. For the N parameter, that is the moles of active sites per unit mass of the catalyst, the value (3.98×10−4 molg−1) was calculated from hydroxyl group surface density reported by Mueller et al. [23] for TiO2-P25 and adopted as starting datum. A more careful analysis of the model proposed indicated that the value of the extinction coefficient ε U V for the catalyst investigated was required. Indeed, in the Lambert–Beer's-law-like equation (eq9 ) the term ε U V is used to account for the rate of photon absorption by the slurry ( Q a b s , U V ) : (9) Q a b s , U V = ∑ i I λ i 0 · ( 1 − e ( − 2.3 ⋅ μ ⋅ ε U V ⋅ [ T i O 2 ] ) ) With the aim to derive a reliable value of ε U V , data obtained for Q a b s , U V from the experimental measurements (see Experimental section) were inserted in Eq. (9). An average value for ε U V in the wavelength range 300–400nm was thus calculated following this approach. In Table 1 the values adopted for some known parameters ( K a d s , and ε U V ) are reported. Once these values were adopted, the set of mass balance equations ( e q 1 − e q 4 ) was solved by means of a proper numerical optimization procedures using the Matlab software. The procedures were initially applied to the analysis of data collected during methanol and glycerol photoreforming experiments carried out at different starting concentration of sacrificial agent and fixed catalyst load (150mgL−1) (Table 2 ). Values for the unknown parameters (N, k h + , k r ,and Φ U V ) were thus estimated by an iterative optimization procedure that minimized the square of the differences between the differences between calculated and measured data for hydrogen generation rate and methanol consumption. To measure methanol consumption, the amount of formaldehyde formed at different reaction times was subtracted from methanol starting concentration. Unfortunately, poor results were obtained from this optimization since the capability of the model to simulate the system behavior appeared too weak by using the parameters adopted (data not shown). In order to overcome this limit, considering that the values of K a d s constants were obtained directly from the experimental data by using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type model, the possibility to adopt different initial values for k h + constants of methanol and glycerol was considered. Indeed, as reported above, a straight line was obtained by plotting the reciprocal of hydrogen generation rate against the reciprocal of substrate concentration, both for methanol and glycerol (eq10): (10) 1 r H 2 = 1 k ' · [ S ] + K a d s k ' Since k ' = k h + [ h + ] N [ T i O 2 ] , the linear trend observed undoubtedly ruled out any dependence of [ h + ] upon [S], at least in the range explored. In other words, considering that the mass balance on the photogenerated holes ( e q 2 ) equals zero, for [ S ] values producing K a d s [ S ] ≤ 1 it was assumed that: (11) G ≫ 2 k h + C T ⋅ K a d s ⋅ [ S ] ( 1 + K a d s ⋅ [ S ] ) · [ h + ] As a result, equation 2 was equal to equation 12: (12) d [ h + ] d t = G − k r ⋅ [ h + ] ⋅ [ e − ] = 0 which allowed to assess that [ h + ] is not dependent upon [ S ] . From equation 11 it became that the last result is obtained when equation 13 is true: (13) Φ U V ≫ 4 ( C T ⋅ K a d s ⋅ [ S ] 1 + K a d s ⋅ [ S ] ) 2 · V Q a , U V · k h + 2 k r When the N value previously calculated for TiO2-P25 [23] is used along with that for k r given in the literature for the same oxide [18] and k h + found for methanol [24] respectively, depending on substrate concentration the right member in equation 13 was equal to the values reported in Table 3 . Results reported in Table 3 required a meaningless value of Φ U V for Eq. (13) to be satisfied. Therefore, values of k h + significantly lower than that previously reported [24] must be adopted for the reaction between organics and positive holes. However, the only additional indication found in literature on the reaction between an organic species and photogenerated holes was for benzyl alcohol [20]. The reaction resulted to be regulated by a kinetic constant more than five orders of magnitude lower than those reported for methanol and glycerol. In the absence of alternatives, this value was adopted as the starting one for k h + constant in the optimization procedure on data collected from methanol and glycerol photoreforming. Following this assumption, a new modeling attempt was performed resulting into a satisfactory simulation of the system behavior and producing best estimates for N, k h + , k r , and Φ U V unknown parameters with low associated uncertainties (Table 4 ). The low reported uncertainties indicated a high sensitivity of the model developed from the associated parameters. Figs. 3 and 4 a,b show a comparison between predicted and experimental data for photoreforming of methanol and glycerol respectively. The following remarks derived from these data: 1 the best estimated value of the rate constant for electron-hole recombination (kr ) on nanocopper-TiO2 is about four orders of magnitude lower than that reported in the literature for bare TiO2 (3.0×1010 M−1 s−1 [18]) thus confirming the electron trapping role of zero-valent copper nanoparticles and the consequent improvement in photocatalytic activity [17]; 2 a primary quantum yield higher than that found in the literature for TiO2 for similar wavelengths range [25,26] was estimated for the catalyst adopted showing a more efficient use of absorbed energy; 3 the values obtained for K a d s constants for methanol and glycerol on nanocopper TiO2 photocatalyst are several orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the same species on TiO2-P25; 4 the value estimated for N is quite similar to those previously calculated for TiO2-P25 (2.74×10−4 molg−1 [32] and 3.98×10−4 molg−1 [23]) suggesting that copper deposition may only negligibly modify the surface of semiconductor used. The model was validated by predicting the results of an additional set of glycerol and methanol photoreforming runs without any further adjustment of the kinetic parameters estimated (simulation mode). For this simulation procedure, data from experiments carried out at various starting concentrations of (i) sacrificial agent, (ii) cupric ion, and (iii) TiO2-P25 load were selected. The comparison between experimental and theoretical results highlights the ability of the model to successfully predict the hydrogen generation rates and methanol consumption (Figs. 5 and 6 )."
7,Conclusions,"In the present work methanol and glycerol were separately employed in photocatalytic reforming for hydrogen production on metal-copper modified TiO2 nanoparticles prepared “in situ” starting from an aqueous suspension containing cupric ions and TiO2. Starting from the mass balance equations for the main species involved in the photocatalytic process, a kinetic model was developed with the aim of simulating photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The model analyzed data collected during the experimental campaign at various substrate (methanol and glycerol) concentrations and catalyst loads. As a result, the best values of unknown parameters were estimated, such as (i) the rate of hole-capture and (ii) the adsorption equilibrium constants for both methanol and glycerol, (iii) the primary quantum yield and (iv) the rate constant for electron-hole recombination on the nanocopper modified-TiO2. From the values found for these parameters it can be stated that: (1) A decrease in the recombination reaction occurs for the catalyst adopted, thus indicating the fundamental role played by copper nanoparticles on TiO2 surface in trapping photogenerated electrons and therefore improving hydrogen generation; (2) The photocatalytic system adopted is characterized by a more efficient use of the energy absorbed; (3) The value estimated in this study for equilibrium adsorption constant of glycerol is more than one order of magnitude higher than that calculated for methanol. Both the estimated constants are orders of magnitude lower than those reported in the literature for the same species on bare TiO2-P25; (4) Copper deposition on the semiconductor surface negligibly modifies its surface. The model proposed provides a solid starting point to develop future analyses on kinetic mechanism regulating hydrogen production through photoreforming of organics over metal doped-TiO2 catalysts."
