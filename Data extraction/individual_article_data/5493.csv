0,Introduction,"The world today largely relies on fossil fuel for energy demand. The petroleum energy sources are finite and will be depleted one day. Currently, several important problems need to be resolved worldwide, such as high need for energy, high depletion of non-renewable energy resources, high local and global environmental pollution. Biofuels [1] (biomass-derived fuels, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, mixed alcohols, etc.) produced from renewable resources or lignocellulosic biomass (woodchip, switchgrass, corn stover, etc.) can be used as an alternative to fossil fuel. The utilization of biofuels can mitigate global warming, and minimize the fossil fuel burning and CO2 production. The two main utilization options of lignocellulosic biomass to produce useful and high-value fuel products are biochemical processes (biocatalytic hydrolysis) and thermochemical processes. The thermochemical processes mainly consist of gasifying biomass through gasification technology (thermal treatment), liquefying biomass (chemocatalytic hydrolysis), and pyrolysis technology [2,3]. Mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas (synthesis gas: CO+H2) or biomass-derived syngas [3] (producing from gasifier that consists of CO, H2, CO2, N2, CH4 and some small alkanes) is an important process for the production of oxygenates fuels, fuel additives and other intermediates for value-added chemical feedstock such as medicine, cosmetic, lubricants, detergents, and polyester [4,5]. There are two types of heterogeneous catalysts used for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas [5]: noble metal-based and non-noble metal-based catalysts. The noble metal-based catalysts, mainly Rh-based catalysts [6–9], show good catalytic performance but are too expensive for commercial application. The major non-noble metal-based catalysts available for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas include Cu-based catalysts and Mo-based catalysts. Mo-based catalysts (MoS2, Mo2C, etc.) [10–12] are sulfur resistant and less sensitive to CO2, but these catalysts must be carried out at high pressures and temperatures. Above all, Cu-based catalysts containing metal active toward Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (Fe, Co), such as Cu-Fe [4,13] or Cu-Co [14–18] based catalysts, are considered as the most promising catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas. However, Cu-Co based catalyst is not available for large-scale industrial application due to the poor stabilization with long-term run and the low total alcohol selectivity [5]. Cu-Fe based catalyst can be regarded as one of the potential candidate catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis via catalytic conversion of biomass-derived syngas. Lin et al. [4] found that in co-precipitated Cu-Fe catalysts, zinc could be used as electrical/chemical promoter, and manganese could be used as structural promoter. Lin et al. [4] also observed that there is an obvious synergism between Zn and Mn over co-modified Cu-Fe based catalyst, which led to a rise in the overall performance with high CO conversion rate and high selectivity of mixed alcohols. Thus, Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst could have good catalytic activity for the production of mixed alcohols using syngas or biomass-derived syngas. However, there are still many problems unresolved. For example, what is the active site structure and what is the reaction mechanism of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst to yield mixed alcohols? Therefore, it is very significant to investigate and understand the active site structures of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after it was reduced. Before using biomass-derived syngas to produce mixed alcohols via Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, it is very important to firstly use pure model syngas to evaluate the catalytic performance of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, and also to probe into the reaction mechanism of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst to produce mixed alcohols. In this work, the crystalline structure and catalytic performance of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst were investigated under model syngas evaluation and some significant results were obtained after the catalyst was reduced, and the reaction mechanism was also proposed for the formation of mixed alcohols based on the active site structures detected."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst (Cu/Fe/Mn/Zn=1/0.5/0.2/0.2 atom ratio) was prepared by co-precipitation method, using sodium carbonate as a precipitant. In this process, metal nitrate of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O were mixed together to be dissolved in distillate water in a beaker. Then the sodium carbonate solution was added to the aqueous solution of mixed metallic nitrates with strong stirring at room temperature until pH 7.0. After aging for 4h, the resulting precipitate was washed thoroughly with distilled water, filtered off and dried at 120°C for 12h, and finally calcined at 450°C in air for 5h. All chemicals (analytical reagent) were purchased from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA)."
3,Catalytic pretreatment and test,"2.2 Catalytic pretreatment and test Fig. 1 shows the flowchart of half-inch tubular reactor system used in this experiment. Fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was reduced using syngas (H2/CO=1) at ambient pressure in the half-inch tubular reactor, heating the catalyst to 200°C at 1°C/min, holding at that temperature for 1h, then heating the catalyst from 200°C to 300°C at 1°C/min and held 300°C overnight. A gas flow rate of 50mLmin−1 was maintained through the whole reduced process. The catalytic test was directly carried out in the half-inch tubular reactor using syngas (H2/CO=1) after the reduced process. After the pretreatment of the fresh catalyst, the temperature was decreased to 25°C, and the syngas (H2/CO=1) pressure was gradually increased to 700psi. And then the reaction temperature was gradually increased to the reacted temperature, for example 260°C. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was set to 2000h−1. The reaction period was set to 120h at 220°C, 240°C, 260°C and 280°C under the syngas (H2/CO=1) pressure of 700psi. The outlet gas CO, H2, CH4, CO2 and C1–C5 hydrocarbons were on-line analyzed by Shimazu GC (Columbia, MD) with packed columns of molecule sieve, TCD and FID detectors. The liquid hydrocarbon products and alcohol products were off-line analyzed by Agilent 5890 GC–MS (Santa Clara, CA) with capillary columns and TCD detector after being carefully separated by condensation. The test run was repeated three times, and the average value was used as the experimental result. CO conversion rate is the mole percentage of carbon monoxide converted to products: (1) CO conversion rate ( mol % ) = CO in − CO out CO in × 100 Space time yield (STY) is defined as weight of desired products (alcohols, hydrocarbons, etc.) produced per unit volume catalyst and per unit time: (2) STY ( g mL − 1 ( cat. ) h − 1 ) = weight of alcohols produced ( g ) volume of catalyst ( mL ) × ( h ) Selectivity is defined as the combined mole percentage of carbon present in both liquid and gas streams: (3) selectivity ( mol % ) = number of CO converted to given product total number of CO converted × 100 If the alcohol chain is formed step-wise by insertion or addition of C1 intermediates with constant growth probability (α), then the chain length distribution is given by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (A–S–F) distribution [19,20]. Assuming that α to be independent from alcohol chain length, an equation may be derived as follows: (4) W n n = ( 1 − α ) 2 α n − 1 or ln W n n = n ln ⁡ α + const. where W n is the mass fraction of the species with carbon number n. From the slope of the plot of ln(W n /n) against n, the value of α is obtained."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 Scan electron microscopy—energy diffusive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) SEM-EDS (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Peabody, MA) were used to characterize the morphology and elemental compositions of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. The silver conductive adhesive was brushed on the aluminum alloy stub, and then the catalyst sample was put on the silver conductive adhesive for SEM-EDS test. 2.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The phase composition and crystalline structure of fresh, reduced and reacted Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Ultima III XRD, Rigaku Americas, The Woodlands, TX) using Cu Kα (λ =0.15418nm) radiation, operated at 40kV and 44mA at a rate of 0.12°min−1, two theta from 20° to 70°. The particle size, t is calculated for the most intense peak using the Scherrer formula [21]: (5) t = 0.9 λ B × cos ⁡ θ B × 180 π Scherrer formula where t is the thickness of the crystal, λ =1.504Å is the wavelength of the target Cu Kα, θ B is the Bragg angle. B is the line broadening by reference to a standard so that B 2 = B M 2 − B S 2 , where B M is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffracted plane of the most intense peak at 2θ degree, and B S is the full width at half maximum (FWHM: 0.1° 2θ) of the standard material in radians. 2.3.3 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Fresh and reacted Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalysts were observed in a JEOL JEM-100CX II TEM (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA) operated at 100keV. The camera length for doing selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is 60cm. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and sonicated for 20min and then deposited over a Formvar copper grid to be observed in the microscope. In order to analyze the particle size distribution quantitatively, the particle size distribution was fitted by using a log-normal function [21]: (6) P ( D ) = A D σ D 2 π exp − 1 2 σ D 2 ln D D 0 where σ D is the standard deviation of the diameter and D 0 is the mean diameter. 2.3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) A PHI 1600 XPS surface Analysis System (Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN) was employed to obtain XPS data. The instrument used a PHI 10-360 spherical capacitor energy analyzer and an Omni Focus II small-area lens to focus the incident source to an 800μm diameter surface analysis area, using an achromatic Mg Kα X-ray source operating at 300W and 15kV. Survey spectra were gathered using an average of 10 scans with pass energy of 26.95eV and running from 1100 to 0eV. High-resolution spectra were gathered using an average of 15 scans with pass energy of 23.5eV and a step size of 0.1eV. The incident sample angle was held constant at 45°. The XPS data was collected and averaged using PHI Surface Analysis software, Version 3.0 (Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN). The XPS data was then analyzed by using Casa XPS software."

6,Scan electron microscopy—energy diffusive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS),"3.1 Scan electron microscopy—energy diffusive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) Fig. 2(a) shows SEM image of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. Fig. 2(b) exhibits the corresponding EDS spectrum analysis to Fig. 2(a). The weight percentage of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, and O elements were 44.99, 18.58, 11.19, 11.46, and 13.78, respectively; and the atom percentage of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, and O elements were 31.04, 14.59, 8.93, 7.68 and 37.77, respectively. EDS elemental mapping pictures in Fig. 2(c) shows that Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, O elements were homogeneously distributed in the individual particle of the fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. Fig. 3(a) shows SEM image of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after reaction at 260°C. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the corresponding EDS spectrum analysis of Fig. 3(a). The weight percentage of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, O and C elements were 21.78, 15.68, 5.60, 2.55, 6.79 and 47.60, respectively; and the atom percentage of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, O and C elements were 11.72, 9.60, 3.49, 1.34, 14.52 and 59.34, respectively. EDS elemental mapping pictures in Fig. 3(c) shows that Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, O and C elements were homogeneously distributed in the individual particle catalyst. The carbon deposited on the surface of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was observed. It may be due to the graphite deposition on the surface of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst and the formation of iron carbide."
7,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD pattern of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst is shown in Fig. 4(a). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the planes (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) at two-theta of 30.041, 35.421, 43.137, 53.235, 57.078 and 62.681, respectively confirmed to the formation of ZnFe2O4 spinel phase, which showed agreement with previous research references [22–24] and (JCPDS 077-0011). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the planes (111), (−202), (−311) and (113) at two-theta of 38.841, 48.682, 66.290 and 68.205, respectively showed the formation of CuO phase, which agreed with previous research reference [21] and (JCPDS 009-2364). Lin et al. [4,25,26] reported that FeMn mixed oxide catalyst was highly dispersed, and there had no obvious peak in the XRD pattern, and CuMn mixed oxide catalyst only showed the CuO diffraction peak. Therefore, only ZnFe2O4 and CuO phases were observed in the XRD pattern of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. The average particle size of the fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was 13.3nm through XRD calculation by using Scherrer formula [21], B M is the full width at half maximum (FWHM: 0.614° 2θ) of ZnFe2O4 (311) diffracted plane at 35.421° 2θ. XRD pattern of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst is shown in Fig. 4(b). The diffraction peak corresponding to the plane (200) at the two-theta of 21.599 confirmed to the formation of Chaoite (or graphite) phase, which was consistent with (JCPDS 024-0734). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) at the two-theta of 31.769, 34.434, 36.099, 47.552, 56.610, 62.875 and 67.967, respectively confirmed to the formation of ZnO phase, which was in accordance with (JCPDS 089-0511). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the planes (111), (200) at the two-theta of 43.379 and 50.541 confirmed to the formation of Cu phase, which agreed with (JCPDS 006-4699). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane (012), (104), (113), (202) and (116) at the two-theta of 24.347, 31.500, 41.566, 45.360 and 51.915, respectively confirmed to the formation of MnCO3 phase, which showed agreement with (JCPDS 008-0868). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane (100), (002), (101) at the two-theta of 37.700, 41.566 and 43.231 confirmed to the formation of iron carbide (Fe2C) phase, which was consistent with (JCPDS 036-1249). XRD pattern of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after reaction at 260°C for 120h is shown in Fig. 4(c). The diffraction peak corresponding to the plane (200) at the two-theta of 21.601 confirmed to the formation of Chaoite (or graphite) phase, which showed agreement with (JCPDS 022-1069). Compared with reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, the intensity of the graphite peak in the reacted catalysts significantly increased (see Fig. 4(d)). It may be due to that the graphite deposition gradually increased as the process of CO hydrogenation reaction. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane (111), (200) at the two-theta of 43.400, 50.519 confirmed to the formation of Cu phase, which showed agreement with (JCPDS 006-4699). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the planes (012), (110), (202), (116), (122) and (214) at the two-theta of 24.901, 38.421, 46.361, 52.961, 61.621 and 65.517, respectively confirmed to the formation of FeCO3 phase, which was in accordance with (JCPDS 029-0696). The diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane (012), (104) at the two-theta of 24.342, 31.500 confirmed to the formation of MnCO3 phase, which agreed with (JCPDS 008-0868). In summary, ZnFe2O4 and CuO phases were observed in the XRD pattern of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. Cu, Fe2C, ZnO, graphite and MnCO3 existed in the XRD pattern of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. And Cu, FeCO3, graphite and MnCO3 phases were shown in the XRD pattern of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after reaction at 260°C for 120h."
8,Transmission electron microscope (TEM),"3.3 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) The crystalline structure, particle size, and morphology of catalyst were investigated by TEM. TEM image of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst is presented in Fig. 5(a). The particles were approximately spherical in shape and their size in diameters was found to be in the range of 5–35nm. The corresponding SAED pattern of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst shown in Fig. 5(b) depicted well-defined rings, which was attributed to the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized co-precipitated Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst with fine grains. The index of the diffraction pattern is also shown in Fig. 5(b), several polycrystalline complex oxides were formed, which was consistent with the XRD analysis in Fig. 4. The distribution of the particles size of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst is shown in Fig. 5(c). A mean diameter D 0 14.29±7.38 was obtained from TEM image by using Eq. (6), which showed agreement with the particle size calculated based on XRD pattern in Fig. 4(a) using Scherrer formula. TEM image of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after reaction at 260°C is presented in Fig. 6(a). After reaction at 260°C under model syngas, the graphite cluster was observed on the surface of the reacted Zn-Mn promtoed Cu-Fe based catalyst, which agreed with SEM-EDS mapping of graphite (carbon) in Fig. 3(c), XRD analysis in Fig. 4, and later XPS analysis. The corresponding SAED pattern of reduced catalyst after reaction at 260°C shown in Fig. 6(b) depicted rings, which indicated polycrystalline nature of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after reaction at 260°C. And some spots are also observed on the diffraction pattern, because the grain size of the catalyst was increased after reaction at 260°C, such as graphite deposition and iron carbide formation on the surface of the Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. The index of the diffraction pattern is also shown in Fig. 6(b), which was consistent with XRD analysis in Fig. 4."
9,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS spectra of high resolution scan for Cu 2p, Fe 2p, Mn 2p, Zn 2p, and O1s in fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst are shown in Fig. 7(a–e). For high resolution scan of Cu 2p, two peaks at 933.6eV and 953.6eV attributing to the spin-obit doublet of Cu 2p were assigned to the bonding energies of Cu (2p3/2) and Cu (2p1/2) in CuO, respectively [27,28]. The two other peaks on the higher binding energy side of both Cu (2p3/2) and Cu (2p1/2) were satellite structures. These satellites can be attributed to shake-up transitions by ligand-to-metal 3d charge transfer [29,30]. This charge transfer can occur for copper present in the Cu2+ form (3d9 configuration) but cannot take place if it is present as a metallic or in a Cu+ state (3d10 configuration) because of their completely filled 3d shells. The binding energies of Fe (2p3/2) was 710.7eV and Fe (2p1/2) was 724.3eV, which corresponded to Fe2O3 [31,32]. For Mn 2p spectra, the binding energy of Mn (2p3/2) was 642.2eV and Mn (2p1/2) was 653.9eV, which was the characteristic of Mn4+ ions and was in accordance with the binding energy of MnO2 [33]. For Zn 2p spectra, the binding energy of Zn (2p3/2) was 1021.7eV and Zn (2p1/2) was 1044.7eV, which was the characteristic of ZnO [34]. For O1s high resoultion scan, the binding energy 530.0eV of O1s was attributed to metal oxide of CuO, Fe2O3, MnO2 and ZnO, which agreed with XPS database of NIST; and the binding energy 531.7eV of O1s was due to surface hydration of the Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. Fig. 7(f) presents XPS spectra of high resolution scan for Cu 2p of reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst and reduced catalyst after reaction at 260°C. The binding energy of Cu (2p3/2) was 932.4eV and Cu (2p1/2) was 952.2eV, which was the characteristic of pure Cu. The pure Cu phase characterized by XPS presented on the surface of reduced catalyst and reacted catalyst (260°C), which showed agreements with XRD analysis (in Fig. 4(b and c)) that pure Cu phase presented in reduced catalyst and also in the catalyst after reaction at 260°C. Table 1 lists surface composition analysis of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, reduced catalyst, and reduced catalyst after reaction at 260°C by XPS. Compared with fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, the carbon (graphite) content was pretty high on the surface of reduced catalyst and reduced catalyst after reaction at 260°C. It may be attributed to the formation of iron carbide (Fe2C) as active site for olefin and paraffin synthesis, and also the graphite deposition on the surface of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, which agreed with EDS mapping analysis in Fig. 3(c) and XRD analysis in Fig. 4."
10,Catalytic performance results,"3.5 Catalytic performance results Fig. 8 presents time on stream of CO conversion, CO2 selectivity, alcohol selectivity, hydrocarbon selectivity and distribution on Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst at the reaction condition of 700psi, 260°C, GHSV of 2000h−1 with syngas of n(H2)/n(CO)=1.0 after running 120h. The CO conversion rate was about 67.43%, the CO2 selectivity was about 13.79%, and the alcohol selectivity was about 32.54%. The overall performance of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst after being reduced with syngas for mixed alcohols synthesis appeared as a function of temperature (see Tables 2 and 3 ). Table 2 displays that the alcohol yield was fairly high at a relatively mild operation condition, i.e. 0.22gmL−1(cat.)h−1 of total alcohols at 260°C. The product distributions are listed in Table 3. The alcohol products composed C1–C6 mixed linear α-alcohols. Furthermore, the C2+OH selectivity was 39.22% in total alcohols at the temperature of as low as 220°C and reached 48.53% at 280°C. Alcohols and hydrocarbons distributions of Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst are presented in Table 3. The chain growth probability (α is larger than zero but it is lower than one because a part of intermediate desorbed from the catalyst's surface in each step of the growth of carbon chain [20]. Therefore, the yield of each alcohol in the product decreased with the increase of carbon chain according to the A–S–F distribution. Similar to Cu-Co based catalyst [14–18], the carbon number distributions of alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst obeyed excellent Anderson–Schulz–Flory (A–S–F) plots (see Fig. 9 ), because the mass fraction of each alcohol product was in an order of CH3OH>C2H5OH>C3H7OH>C4H9OH>C5H11OH [20]. The chain growth probability (α) over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst could be calculated as 0.188, 0.224, 0.262, 0.313, respectively at 220°C, 240°C, 260°C, 280°C using the slope of the imitation straight line of mixed alcohols. The chain growth probability (α) of alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was close to a positively linear function of reaction temperature (see Fig. 10 ). The higher the temperature, the bigger the chain growth probability of alcohols was. The mainly hydrocarbon products were olefin and paraffin (GC–MS analysis), and the CH4 selectivity was relatively low (GC analysis)."
11,Discussion,"In the process of mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, the major reaction is the alcohol formation, while hydrocarbon formation and water–gas-shift reaction are the side reactions [5]: alcohol formation: nCO+2nH2 =C n H2n+1OH+(n −1)H2O; hydrocarbon formation: nCO+2nH2 =C n H2n + nH2O; nCO+(2n +1)H2 =C n H2n+2 + nH2O; water–gas-shift reaction equilibrium: CO+H2O=CO2 +H2. Lin et al. [4] evaluated the catalytic performance of Cu-Fe based catalyst with or without Zn or Mn promoter in order to investigate their promotional effect upon Cu-Fe based catalyst. Cu-Fe based catalyst showed the reaction behavior of F–T synthesis rather than mixed alcohols synthesis derived from the strong activation tendency of iron towards CO dissociation. The addition of Zn promoter into Cu-Fe based catalyst promoted the formation spinel oxide ZnFe2O4 to enhance the stabilization of catalyst [4,35], which dramatically improved the catalytic performance of catalyst, increased CO conversion rate and decreased in higher alcohol selectivity. In contrast, the addition of Mn promoter into Cu-Fe based catalyst hardly improved the CO conversion rate, even less than non-promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst. However, the addition of Mn promoter increased the BET surface area of catalyst [4] and improved the dispersion of Cu and Fe. It promoted the synergistic effect between Cu and Fe, resulting in the higher selectivity to total alcohols despite a decrease in higher alcohol selectivity due to its dilution effect. Therefore, Zn and Mn promoted the catalytic performance of Cu-Fe based catalyst in different manner. Zinc oxide could be regarded as an electrical/chemical promoter, whereas manganese was a structural promoter [4]. The synergistic effect of Zn and Mn existed over Cu-Fe based catalyst, which largely improved the overall catalytic performance, as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3. Based on XRD and XPS analysis, the reduction of fresh Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst under syngas (H2/CO=1) at 300°C can be described as follows (Eqs. (7)–(9)): spinel oxide phase ZnFe2O4 was reduced to form iron carbide (Fe2C), CuO was reduced to form Cu, and MnO2 was reduced to form MnCO3. (7) ZnFe 2 O 4 + 4 H 2 + CO → Fe 2 C + ZnO + 4 H 2 O ↑ (8) 2 CuO + H 2 + CO → 2 Cu + CO 2 ↑ + H 2 O ↑ (9) MnO 2 + 2 CO + H 2 O → MnCO 3 + CO 2 ↑ + H 2 ↑ The reaction process of the reduced Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst under syngas (H2/CO=1) at 220°C, 240°C, 260°C, and 280°C can be described as follows: Cu (111) was the active site for mixed alcohols synthesis, and Fe2C (101) was the active site for olefin and paraffin synthesis. Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was gradually deactivated by graphite deposition on the surface of the catalyst and FeCO3 formation due to iron carbide (Fe2C) deactivation (Eq. (10)). The graphite deposition was observed via XRD, EDS and XPS spectra. (10) Fe 2 C + 7 CO + H 2 → 2 FeCO 3 + 6 C ( graphite ) + H 2 O ↑ Zinc promoted the formation of spinel oxide phase ZnFe2O4, but did not have significant role in carbide or metal formation. The reaction mechanism for CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols over Cu-Fe based catalysts is assumed to be similar that on La promoted Co based catalysts [36] and Rh-based catalysts [7,37,38]. For Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst, Cu was the active site for mixed alcohols synthesis, serving as the dissociative adsorption of H2 and associative adsorption of CO [36,37]. Iron carbide (Fe2C) was the active site of Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) function of dissociative adsorption of CO (carbon-chain growth) and associative adsorption of H2 [38]. The production of mixed alcohols required the synergetic functioning of iron and copper [5]. The reaction mechanism for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst can be outlined in Fig. 11 , where * represents a vacant site and *R or R* indicates a molecule adsorbed on a site. The reaction mechanism for CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst involved Cu (111) surface association of CO* and dissociation of H2, Fe2C (101) surface dissociation of CO* and association of H2, carbon species hydrogenation into CH x , CO* insertion into adsorbed CH x to form acyl species (CH x CO*) [7,36–38], carbon-chain growth of alkyl group (*C n H z ) via *CH x addition [7,36–38], *C n H z hydrogenation into olefin, paraffin products, and CO* insertion of *C n H z species and further hydrogenation into higher alcohol products. The active iron carbide Fe2C (101) surface acted as site for CO* dissociative adsorption, carbon-chain growth and for hydrogenation, while active copper site Cu (111) surface adsorbed CO* molecularly. CO* molecular moved to an adsorbed *CH x alky group and inserted between iron carbide (Fe2C) site and the *CH x alky group via surface migration over a short distance between Cu and Fe2C sites, which was further hydrogenated to form ethanol. The carbon-chain growth of the alkyl group (*C n H z ) was propagated through *CH x addition [38]. Then the direct hydrogenation of *C n H z species led to the olefin and paraffin products (which is consistent with GC–MS results analysis). The CO* insertion of *C n H z species and further hydrogenation resulted in mixed alcohols synthesis [7,36–38]."
12,Conclusions,"Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst had high catalytic activity, high yield of alcohols and hydrocarbons, and high alcohol selectivity at mild conditions. The production of alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst followed A–S–F distributions. The chain growth probability (α) of alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst was a function of reaction temperature. The mainly hydrocarbon products were olefin and paraffin, and the CH4 selectivity was relatively low. Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst could be regarded as a potential candidate for catalytic conversion of biomass-derived syngas to mixed alcohols. Cu (111) was the active site for mixed alcohols synthesis, and Fe2C (101) was the active site for olefin and paraffin synthesis. The reaction mechanism for CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst involved Cu (111) surface association of CO* and dissociation of H2, Fe2C (101) surface dissociation of CO* and association of H2, carbon species hydrogenation into CH x , CO* insertion into adsorbed CH x to form acyl species (CH x CO*), carbon-chain growth of alkyl group (*C n H z ) via *CH x addition, *C n H z hydrogenation into olefin, paraffin product, and CO* insertion of *C n H z species and further hydrogenation into higher alcohols products."
