0,Introduction,"The climate has changed dramatically because of the large amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The main reason is the increased use of fossil fuels. Furthermore, crude oil reserves are being depleted, so the production of renewable hydrogen is a promising energy supply. In this study, de-sizing textile wastewater, which contains a large amount of glucose from the starch used in the sizing process, was chosen as feedstock for dark hydrogen fermentation. The textile industry employs one of the most complicated processes in the manufacturing sectors, which involves washing, scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing and finishing processes. The processes produce a complex wastewater containing a type of dye, surfactants, as well as many textile additives. As a result, textile plants produce highly toxic wastewater [1–4]. Traditional methods for dealing with textile wastewater include various combinations of biological, physical and chemical treatment processes [5]. Common biological treatments are often ineffective in removing dyes which are highly structured polymers with low biodegradability [6]. Activated carbon (AC) is available for wastewater industries, solvent recovery, chemical catalyst, gold extraction, gas separation and liquid adsorption. There are many articles that highlight activated carbon as an adsorbent to treat wastewater. Celis et al. [7], Huang and Su [8], El-Sikaily et al. [9] and Suzuki [10] used AC to remove toxic metal. Temmink and Grolle used AC to remove cationic and color related compounds [11]. Ahmad and Hameed dealt with the use of activated carbon prepared from bamboo waste (BMAC), as an adsorbent for the removal of chemical oxygen demand and dyes [12]. Activated carbon and ion exchange have numerous applications for industrial as well as laboratory research. It is used in the production of various acids, bases, salts, for industrial drying and treatment of gases, in biomolecular separations as well as in the food industry. Ion exchange processes are also commonly used in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater in commercial and industrial applications such as water softening, demineralization and decontamination [13]. Many recent studies focus on anaerobic hydrogen fermentations. The substrates for hydrogen dark fermentation typically use sucrose or starch, which are not economically feasible. Waste and/or wastewater containing high concentrations of carbohydrates, generated from textile industries, agricultural processes and food industries are preferred for economic reasons. Many researchers have studied the production of hydrogen via the anaerobic fermentation of waste and wastewater, such as those used in sugar manufacturing [14,15], the food industry [16–18], restaurant food waste [19], lactic acid fermentation plants [20], municipal solid waste and wastewaters [21–25], the brewing industry [26] and starch manufacturers [27]. The objective of this study was to produce hydrogen from textile wastewater, which was hydrolyzed with amylase and pretreated with activated carbon and cation resin. The hydrogen production was compared with a different pretreatment. The hydrogen production from hydrolysate was worked out at 37 °C by dark fermentation. The bacterial communities corresponding to hydrogen production with different initial pH and the treatments of wastewater were characterized."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Pretreatment of wastewater,"2.1 Pretreatment of wastewater The textile wastewater used as the substrate in this study, was obtained from northern Taiwan. To prepare the hydrolysate for dark fermentation, the textile wastewater was hydrolyzed by β-amylase with concentration of 0.2 mL/L at 70 °C for 20 min. After hydrolysis, the hydrolysate was pretreated by activated carbon and cation resin with a concentration of 1% w/w and stirred for 30 min to remove the bio-toxic inhibitors. After detoxification, the liquid was filtered through a Whatman 47 mm filter paper."
3,Hydrogen production,"2.2 Hydrogen production Batch experiments of biohydrogen production were carried out in a 200 mL flask (working volume 50 mL) with 20% (by volume) mixed culture at the beginning. The mixed of culture sludge was thermally treated at 95–100 °C for 1 h, in order to eliminate the methanogens; the sludge was obtained from the Taichung municipal wastewater treatment plant. The nutrients were the same as those used in Endo et al. [18] formulations. The wastewater hydrolysate was obtained by β-amylase. Inhibitors were removed by activated carbon and cation exchange resin. After that, the hydrolysate was fed into the batch reactor for biohydrogen production. The batch reactor was set in the shaking incubator for hydrogen production at 37 °C. The total volume was measured using a syringe and the sample of biogas for analysis was also taken. After the experiment, the liquid was taken for liquid product analysis and biomass content measurement."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods The ion concentrations were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optima optical emission spectrometer. The bio-toxic inhibitors are coined by EC50 [28]. EC50 values were <25, 25–50, 51–75, 76–100 and >100 and reveal very toxic, moderately toxic, toxic, slightly toxic and nontoxic levels, respectively. The components of biogas in the headspace, including hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide were determined using gas chromatography (SHIMADZU GC-14B with TCD). Hydrolysate and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from fermentation were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and analyzed by liquid chromatography (SHIMADZU LC-10AT with RID) and the same method was used for sucrose, glucose, xylose, arabinose, lactate acid (LAc), formic acid (HFo), acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu) and ethanol (EtOH). The biomass content was measured by the APHA method [29]. The method took 10 mL liquid of biomass that was filtered through a Whatman 47 mm filter paper and then put into the oven at 105 °C for 24 h. Following that process, the dry filter paper containing biomass was weighed and once again placed into the oven. The temperature was set at 550 °C for 8 h. Then the sample was weighed again. The biomass concentration was calculated by drying the bacteria at 105 °C and 550 °C. Bacterial communities were analyzed with DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) with partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. Duplicate samples were taken from the final sampling points of the bacterial hydrolysis experiment and stored at −20 °C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Amylase hydrolysis and detoxification,"3.1 Amylase hydrolysis and detoxification The properties of textile wastewater were 23.88 g total sugar/L, 13.04 g reducing sugar/L and pH of 7.8. The textile wastewater was hydrolyzed by β-amylase with a concentration of 0.2 mL/L for 20 min. After β-amylase hydrolysis, the hydrolysate was pretreated with activated carbon and cation exchange resin with a concentration of 1% w/w for 30 min. The hydrolysate concentration was 21.36 g of reducing sugar/L with the enzymatic hydrolysis. The ion concentrations of different pretreatments are shown in Table 1 . Removal efficiencies were 39.14% and 95.85% respectively, by using the activated carbon and cation exchange resin methods. The results for EC50 of wastewater with/without activated carbon method and cation exchange resin were 4.99, >100 and 49.87, respectively (Table 2 ). The enzymatic hydrolysis enhanced the reducing sugar concentration and decreased microtox as well."
7,Fermentative hydrogen production from textile wastewater,"3.2 Fermentative hydrogen production from textile wastewater 3.2.1 Effect of pH In this study batch tests were carried out by using the textile wastewater as the substrate with initial variations in the pH values from 5.0 to 9.0 and an initial substrate concentration of 20 g total sugar/L at 37 °C. The cumulative hydrogen production at initial pH values are shown in Fig. 1 . The regression data using the Gompertz Equation Model, biomass concentration, hydrogen production yield and substrate utilization with different pH values are shown in Table 3 . From the results of Fig. 1 and Table 3, an initial pH of 7.0 obtained a maximum hydrogen production yield of 1.37 mol H2/mol hexose. Hydrogen yields of non-treated and cation resin varied from 0.04 to 1.04 mol H2/mol hexose and 0.75–1.45 mol H2/mol hexose, respectively. Soluble metabolite compositions with different initial pH levels and pretreatment methods are shown in Table 4 . The metabolites (HAc and HBu) of non-treatment, cation resin and activated carbon were 18.51–72.29%, 29.31–60.91% and 27.58–57.68%, respectively. A high ethanol concentration of 61.00% was obtained with an initial pH of 6.0 by using cation resin. As shown in Fig. 1, Tables 3 and 4, the highest state of hydrogen accumulation occurred when treated with activated carbon pretreatment and fermentation at pH 7 which is the optimal condition in this system. Under this condition, the highest sugar utilization reached 95.90% and acetate concentration of 33.1%. 3.2.2 Effect of substrate concentrations The accumulative hydrogen production at various substrate concentrations is shown in Fig. 2 , with initial pH values around 7.0. The regression data using the Gompertz Equation Model, hydrogen production yield and substrate utilization with different substrate concentrations is shown in Table 5 . The soluble metabolite compositions with different substrate concentrations are shown in Table 6 . As shown in the results, the hydrogen production yield varied from 0.53 to 1.37 mol H2/mol hexose. The main products were acetate (HAc) and butyric acid (HBu). The best hydrogen yield was 1.37 mol H2/mol hexose with an initial pH of 7.0 when substrate concentration was fixed at 20 g total sugar/L. The study was carried out by Lay et al. [30] on hydrogen production from textile wastewater. The maximum hydrogen yield of 0.97 mol H2/mol hexose which was obtained with the conditions of initial pH 7.0 and 35 °C."
8,Microbial community,"3.3 Microbial community From the microbial community analysis (Fig. 3 ), the main bacteria in the batch system were Clostridium butyricum and Klebsiella oxytoca. Clostridium sp. (e.g., C. butyricum) is frequently found in hydrogen-producing bacterial consortia and is also very effective in producing H2 from organic substrates such as carbohydrates. There is a merit in revealing the hydrogen production characteristics of Clostridium sp. in order to maintain or improve hydrogen production levels in a mixed-culture system [31]. Clostridia can extract energy from carbohydrates using various different metabolic pathways, which are promoted or inhibited by the prevailing culture conditions. Each pathway is characterized by a specific metabolite such as acetate, butyrate, ethanol, lactate or formate. The acetate and butyrate pathways are the only ones which involve the release of molecular hydrogen i.e. 4 mol H2/mol glucose with acetate production and 2 mol H2/mol glucose with butyrate production. Thus, the butyrate/acetate ratio can be used as a reliable indicator of the efficiency of fermentative hydrogen production and of the metabolic pathways used during glucose fermentation [32]. Although the Clostridium genus is a promising source for fermentative hydrogen production, few researchers have used pure strains to make a detailed study of the optimal conditions for hydrogen production [33–36]. K. oxytoca HP1 was isolated from a hot spring, as reported by Long et al. [37]. K. oxytoca HP1 belongs to Enterobacteriaceae and its hydrogen metabolism pathway may be similar to that of Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. The main metabolites were acetate, alcohol and butyrate (Table 4). The main product was butyrate (41.59%) and minor ones were acetate (33.11%) and ethanol (20.89%). From the metabolites (Table 6) produced, the results confirmed excellent performance in hydrogen production."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, textile wastewater was used as a substrate to investigate fermentative hydrogen production performance. The toxic material in textile wastewater can be removed by activated carbon. The enzymatic hydrolysis is effective in enhancing reducing sugar concentration. From the microbial community analysis, the main bacteria in the batch system were C. butyricum and K. oxytoca. The best hydrogen yield was 1.37 mol H2/mol hexose with an initial pH 7.0, when substrate concentration was fixed at 20 g total sugar/L."
