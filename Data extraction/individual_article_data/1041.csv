0,Introduction,"Monoethanolamine (MEA) is widely used as the industrial absorbent for removing CO2 in the flue gas [1,2]. In addition, due to its appropriate gas-liquid partition coefficient, MEA is added into the secondary circuit of nuclear plant functioning as corrosion inhibitors [3]. As the demand of MEA is rapidly growing and direct discharge of MEA-containing sewage can cause water pollution by increasing chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (T-N) [4], the degradation of MEA has become absolutely imperative. Conventionally, MEA-containing sewage is treated by chemical oxidation degradation and biodegradation. The former needs the participation of catalysts and/or oxidant which may lead to secondary pollution [5,6]. The latter involving microbes is considered as a natural and cost-effective alternative while its degradation time lasts long [5]. Several emerging degradation methods including electrooxidation [7,8], photocatalysis [9] and microbial fuel cell [4,10] have once been reported. However, most of abovementioned methods merely aim to degrade MEA by taking a lot of energy while leave the resource recovery out of consideration. Recently, hybrid water electrolysis which substitutes more favorable electrooxidation reactions for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been recognized as the preferred route for ultrapure H2 production, in part because of its lower supplied cell voltage and the exclusion of flammable and explosive H2/O2 gas mixture [11–19]. To date, many types of anodic reactions, like alcohols, aldehydes, amines, urea and hydrazine electrooxidation, have been investigated in the hybrid water electrolysis [11]. MEA electrooxidation could be a potential choice as well on account of the hydroxy group which can be readily oxidized in MEA molecule (CH2NH2CH2OH). Teresa Łuczak [20] published that in the light of experimental results, the electrooxidation products of MEA might be oxalic acid and ammonia. Dennis C Johnson et al. [21]pointed out that one of the products was glycine. Taking the oxalate ions and aqua ammonia as the final products in alkaline solution, a possible reaction equation representing MEA electrooxidation is proposed as following: (1) C2H7NO+10OH−-8e−↔C2O4 2− + NH3⋅H2O+6H2O E Θ = −0.96 V vs. SHE The standard electrode potential, viz., −0.96 V vs. SHE, is calculated on a basis of Δf G m Θ (standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation) data of different reactants and products in Equation (1) and reference reaction equation (see Document S1). The MEA electrooxidation possesses much lower standard electrode potential than OER (0.401 V vs. SHE), which therefore helps save a lot of supplied electricity in MEA-containing electrolyzer theoretically. Furthermore, the liquid-state anodic products of MEA electrooxidation guarantee the security of the electrolyzer. Despite those merits, one should note the normal operation of MEA-containing electrolyzer still requires external electricity input. An electrolyzer which contains two reactions with high and low standard electrode potentials can be altered into a fuel cell, such as the pure water electrolyzer altering into direct H2–O2 fuel cell, the urea-containing electrolyzer into direct urea fuel cell [22,23] and the hydrazine-containing electrolyzer into direct hydrazine fuel cell [24,25]. This illumines us that the power-consuming MEA-containing electrolyzer can be converted into power-generating fuel cell, and more aggressively, the direct MEA fuel cell (or fuel cell stack) can power the MEA-containing electrolyzer directly. In this fuel cell-electrolyzer series device, MEA is supposed to be degraded electrochemically in the anode sides of both fuel cell and electrolyzer, while high value-added H2 is thought to be produced in the cathode side of electrolyzer with a little supplied power or even without any. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device with MEA as fuel in the fuel cell and MEA-containing electrolyte in the electrolyzer has not been reported yet. But for the MEA electrooxidation, several kinds of electrocatalysts involving Au, Cu and Ni were studied with the purposes of developing electrochemical sensor [26] and recognizing MEA electrooxidation behavior [20,21,27]. As to both the fuel cell and electrolyzer, one of the vital components should be the anode. A good anode not only promotes the power generation performance of fuel cell, but also reduces the electricity consumption of electrolyzer. For this reason, it is necessary to systematically searching for and then fabricate suitable anodes from the perspective of electrocatalytic performance and anode cost. Herein in this paper, we firstly search for well-performed anodes for MEA electrooxidation. Afterwards, the structure-activity relationships on the anodes were analyzed. Finally, the performance of MEA-containing electrolyzer and direct MEA fuel cell, and the function of fuel cell-electroylzer series device are evaluated successively."

2,Screening of electrocatalysts for MEA electrooxidation,"2.1 Screening of electrocatalysts for MEA electrooxidation Nine kinds of metallic materials including Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, Au, Ru, Rh and Pd were chosen as the electrocatalyst candidates. The first six at a purity of at least 99.99 wt% were commercially available in the plate or wire shapes. Their shapes, projected surface area and pretreatment methods are shown in Table 1 . The last three electrodes, i.e., Ru, Rh and Pd electrodes were prepared by electrodepositing Ru, Rh and Pd on the carbon fiber cloth (CFC) supports. CFC (HCP330 N) was bought from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., LTD, China. Ru, Rh and Pd chloride salts were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., LTD, China. Prior to electrodeposition, CFC support was soaked in acetone for ~20 min and then rinsed by the deionized water thoroughly. Table 2 lists the preparation methods, bath solution for electrodeposition and electrodeposition parameters for Ru, Rh and Pd electrodes. During electrodeposition, CFC, carbon rod and Ag/AgCl (0.1981 V vs. SHE) electrode separately acted as working, counter and reference electrode. All the electrochemical depositions and performance tests were run by the CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., LTD, China) except where noted. The nine kinds of prepared electrodes were firstly activated in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH by cyclic voltammetry (CV) between the potential range of OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a large scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Following this, they were subjected to the performance tests at a small scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1 in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH with and without 0.05 mol L−1 MEA, respectively. Three-electrode system including working electrode (i. e., the nine kinds of prepared electrodes), carbon rod counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed in the evaluation of MEA electrooxidation performance. All the electrolytes were deaerated by bubbling highly pure N2 gas for ~20 min before testing and kept in N2 atmosphere during testing."
3,Fabrication of Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes and corresponding physico-chemical characterizations,"2.2 Fabrication of Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes and corresponding physico-chemical characterizations Ni foam (PPI: 110, areal density: 320 g cm−2) was pretreated in the same way as Ni plate in Table 1. The Au–Ni@Ni foam anode was achieved by electrodepositing Au on Ni foam in 1.0 mol L−1 NH4Cl and 1.0 mmol L−1 HAuCl4 using a three-electrode system as previously mentioned. The electrodeposition was triggered once a constant current of −5.0 mA cm−2 was applied to Ni foam. As the electrodeposition time varied from 5 min to 45 min, five different Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes were obtained. The Au mass loadings on Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes were determined by an Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer (ICP, IRIS Advantage Radial, ThemoElemental, USA). For ICP determination, the whole Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes were dissolved in the aqua regia and the aqua regia containing Au and Ni ions were diluted to 50 times after that. The crystalline structures of anodes were characterized by an X-Ray Powder Diffractometer (XRD, XPert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Netherlands) with a Cu target. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM400, FEI, USA) was provided to observe the surface morphology of different anodes. Another FESEM (ThermoFisher/Apreo S HiVac, USA) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) was used to examine the distributions of Ni and Au elements on the Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes. The surface elements on Au–Ni@Ni foam anodes were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher-Escalab250Xi, UK) with Al Kα excitation source."
4,"Assembly and performance evaluation of electrolyzer, fuel cell and the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device","2.3 Assembly and performance evaluation of electrolyzer, fuel cell and the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device The electrolyzer, fuel cell and the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device were assembled and tested in bench scale. The electrolyzer was a glass vessel composed of the optimized Au–Ni@Ni foam anode (1.0 × 2.0 cm2), Pt plate (1.0 × 2.0 cm2) cathode and MEA-containing electrolyte (Fig. 1 ). The custom-made fuel cell unit (from Changsha Spring New Energy Technology Co. LTD, China) had complicated configuration, and it contained electrodes, monopolar plates, separators, current collectors, fasteners (Fig. 1) and external pipelines, fluid storage tanks and pumps (not shown in Fig. 1). Specifically, the anode and corresponding electrode reaction in fuel cell were Au–Ni@Ni foam (1.0 × 2.0 cm2) and MEA electrooxidation, respectively, while the cathode and corresponding electrode reaction were Pd coated on CFC (Pd@CFC, 1.0 × 2.0 cm2) and H2O2 electroreduction. H2O2 was selected as the oxidant in direct MEA fuel cell owing to its faster reaction kinetics than O2 as well as its easier delivery than gas-phase O2. Beyond those, the thermodynamics calculations in Document S1 indicated the electromotive force (e. m. f.) drove by one direct MEA-H2O2 fuel cell reached up to 2.72 V, far larger than that (1.36 V) of direct MEA-O2 fuel cell. Pd was found to exhibit excellent catalytic performance for H2O2 electroreduction [28]. Herein, a Pd@CFC cathode was fabricated by a two-step electrodeposition procedure: the first CV electrodeposition (−0.2 V–1.0 V; 50 mV s−1; 100 segments) and the followed chronoamperometry electrodeposition (CA, 0 V vs, Ag/AgCl; 2000 s) in 0.1 mol L−1 HCl and 5.0 mmol L−1 PdCl2. Connecting the anodic current collector in fuel cell stack (two or more fuel cell units linked in series) with the cathodic current collector in electrolyzer, and the cathodic current collector in fuel cell stack with the anodic current collector in electrolyzer by lead wires, respectively, a fuel cell-electrolyzer series device was done (Fig. 1). During the operation of this series device, the peristaltic pumps kept running to transport the anolyte and catholyte in the fuel cell stack (see Video S1). Their volumetric flow rate was set as 4.0 mL min−1. As can be seen, only the peristatic pumps in the whole fuel cell-electrolyzer series device need external power. Moreover, we can sidestep the adoption of peristaltic pumps by using a static fuel cell instead of the dynamic one, in other words, the external power input can be entirely omitted in the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229783. The following is/are the supplementary data related to this article: Multimedia componenet 3 Multimedia componenet 3 The performances of individual electrolyzer and fuel cell (or fuel cell stack) were primarily evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), CP and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The Nyquist plots data from 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz in EIS were recorded at the open circuit voltage. It is impossible to acquire the current data flowing through the circuit of fuel cell-electrolyzer series device via the electrochemical workstation. Hence, we utilized a multimeter (B35T, owon, Fujian Lilliput Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd, China) with the function of data transfer to obtain the current, and meanwhile, the corresponding voltage data of fuel cell stack were still collected by the electrochemical workstation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Screening of electrocatalyst for MEA electrooxidation,"3.1 Screening of electrocatalyst for MEA electrooxidation The CV curves of different electrocatalysts in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH are shown in Fig. 2 , and the redox peaks appeared in which are firm evidences for the identifications of these nine kinds of materials. For instance, the redox peaks between 0.2–0.5 V in Fig. 2(a) and (b) stand for the Co(OH)2/CoOOH/CoO2 conversion reactions in Co material and Ni(OH)2/NiOOH conversion reactions in Ni material, respectively [23]. Cu has four different valence states including Cu (0), Cu (I), Cu (II) and Cu (III), as a result, many redox peaks are observed. There are two pairs of peaks in Fig. 2(d) representing the Ag/Ag2O and Ag2O/AgO conversion reactions [25]. For the noble Rh and Pd electrodes in Fig. 2(h) and (i), we can obviously see the hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks between −1.0 and -0.6 V. Pd and Pt electrodes in Fig. 2(i) and (j) also reveal the characteristic peaks at around −0.3 V relating to PdO and PtO electroreduction, respectively. The Au electrode shows two pairs of redox peaks in Fig. 2(k). The earlier one (1 and 1′) is associated with the reaction between Au and Auδ+⋅OHδ− (polar covalently-bonded species) while the later (2 and 2’) is attributed to the conversion between Auδ+⋅OHδ− and AuO [29,30]. In the solution of 1.0 mol L−1 KOH and 0.05 mol L−1 MEA, the potential in the CV procedure is started from low to high value and then returns to the low value. The initial and end potentials are identical, i.e., open circuit potential of the three-electrode system. We evaluate the MEA electrooxidation performance based on two criteria: catalytic current density and onset oxidation potential (subtracting the background current density in bare alkaline medium). Larger current density signifies faster reaction velocity, and lower onset oxidation potential means smaller voltage needed in the electrolyzer and larger open circuit voltage produced by the fuel cell. As seen in Fig. 2, Ag, Ru Rh and Pt should lie in the first list of incompetent electrocatalysts because of their low catalytic current densities. Particularly, we find the current densities of Ru electrode gradually fade with CV cycling during the activation stage (Fig. 1(e)), and Ru coated on CFC (Fig. 1(f)) exhibits similar CV shapes with bare CFC (Fig. 1(g)) no matter whether in KOH or in KOH + MEA solution. All these phenomena conclude that Ru is unstable and can be dissolved in KOH solution. Co, Ni and Cu electrodes (Fig. 1(a)–(c)) exert relatively large current densities. However, their onset oxidation potentials are a little high (0.27–0.29 V). In general, they are not the first choices for MEA electrooxidation. The onset potentials of MEA electrooxidation on Ni and Co electrodes coincide with those of NiOOH and CoOOH formation reactions, respectively. In this regard, we speculate that MEA electrooxidation occurring on Ni and Co electrocatalysts undergoes the typical electrochemical-chemical (E-C) reaction mechanism [7]. Pd electrode (Fig. 2(i)) shows a low onset potential and relatively large catalytic peak current density (~3.0 mA cm−2). However, such catalytic current density can be attributed to its abundant surface Pd atoms (seen from the strong PdO electroreduction peak). In comparison, Au electrode has weak AuO electroreduction peak while its catalytic peak current density reaches up to ~8.4 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2(l)). As a result, Au turns out to be the most preferred electrocatalyst. Previous reports indicate that MEA electrooxidation on Au electrocatalyst begins with the oxidation of hydroxy groups, and meanwhile, the amino groups are attached on the Au sites. The continuous oxidation of hydroxy groups would cease unless the adsorbed and reacted amino groups are replaced by the unreacted amino groups [21]. In contrast to Pt and Pd, Au can reversibly adsorb and desorb the amino groups [31], which accordingly explains the favorable MEA electrooxidation performance on Au. In the reverse scan of Fig. 2(l), it is found that the catalytic current density remains at nearly zero between 0.6 V–0.23 V, and then quickly increases upon the formation of Auδ+⋅OHδ−. Such phenomenon reveals Auδ+⋅OHδ− is a significant substance involving in the MEA electrooxidation and inspires us to develop the catalytic electrode with as many exposed Au atoms as possible. Overall, we order the nine kinds of materials according to their electrocatalytic performances as following: Au > Pd > Co, Ni, Cu > Ag, Ru, Rh, Pt."
7,Anode optimization and its structure-activity relationship,"3.2 Anode optimization and its structure-activity relationship Considering that Au is expensive and only the superficial Au atoms on the electrocatalyst play parts in electrocatalysis, we intend to fabricate an Au-containing electrode, in which small amounts of Au are coated on a support. Such support needs to be cheap, stable in alkaline medium, and own open structure to facilitate the mass transfer and large surface area to load with plenty of Au. Nickel foam should be by far one of the best options. Fig. 3 (a) displays the CV curves of five different Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes with the Au electrodeposition times setting as 5 min (II), 15 min (III), 22.5 min (IV), 30 min (V) and 45 min (VI), respectively, in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH. Because of the strong Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox peaks, only the Auδ+⋅OHδ− electroreduction peak locating between −0.1 V ~ -0.6 V can be observed clearly (inset of Fig. 3(a)). The appearances of Ni and Au characteristic redox peaks manifest the existences of exposed Ni and Au atoms on the Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes, both of which can catalyze the MEA electrooxidation. Fig. 3(b)and (c) compare the MEA electrooxidation performances of five different Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes. The MEA electrooxidation on Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes, with the boundary of 0.32 V, is divided into two phases: the initial electrooxidation process on Au electrocatalyst and the following electrooxidation on Au and Ni electrocatalysts. According to the catalytic current density at 0.56 V in Fig. 3(b), the MEA electrooxidation activity in the second phase is gradually enhanced with the augment of Au electrodeposition time. However, the peak current density in the initial phase rises at first and then falls, giving the maximum value of 27.2 mA cm−2 (area current) on the “V” electrode (Au electrodeposition time is 30 min). Since the Au electrodeposition time affects the MEA electrooxidation behavior more in the initial phase than in the second, we only compare the onset potential and Au mass current in the initial phase (inset of Fig. 3(b)), where the Au mass current refers to the current normalized by Au mass loadings. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the Au–Ni@Ni foam with the electrodeposition time of 30 min exerts a highest Au mass current of 58.1 A g−1 and a lowest onset potential of −0.44 V among five electrodes, demonstrating that 30 min is the optimal electrodeposition time. The Au mass current of the optimized Au–Ni@Ni foam is nearly 8 times that of the Au wire in Fig. 2(l), greatly shrinking the electrode cost. We attempt to dig out the structure-activity relationships concerning Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes by a succession of physico-chemical characterizations. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of Ni foam support (“I”) and five Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes under different magnifications. The surface of Ni foam (Fig. 4(a), (b) and (c)) turns to be porous due to its pretreatment in HCl solution. The diameter of the open pores is approximately 1–2 μm (Fig. 4(d)). Relative to the Ni foam, the 3-dimensional porous frames (Fig. 4(e), (i) and (m)) of “II”, “III” and “IV” electrodes are well retained. However, the coated Au or Au–Ni dispersions (Fig. 4(f) and (g), Fig. 4(j) and (k), Fig. 4(n) and (o)) become more and more from “II”, “III” to “IV” electrodes. We infer the coated dispersions are Au metal or Au–Ni bimetals rather than Ni metal, because the luminance of dispersions is significantly higher than that of the support in SEM images and Au has superior electrical conductivity over Ni. In fact, the SEM-EDS mappings (Fig. S1) of Ni and Au elements corresponding to each Au–Ni@Ni foam electrode have proved to be the case. Those brighter parts are rich in the Au element while the darker support contains a small proportion of Au element. Ni element can be examined in both brighter and darker parts of the electrodes. Aside from the dispersions, we also find the pore sizes of the supports in “II”, “III” and “IV” electrodes (Fig. 4(h), (l) and (p)) are much smaller than that in Ni foam. There are three side-reactions during the electrodeposition of Au on Ni foam in NH4Cl and HAuCl4 bath solutions, such as HER, Ni dissolution and Ni re-electrodeposition. These side-reactions can lead to the morphological change of the support. The “VI” electrode gets brighter (Fig. 4(u) and (v)) and the dispersions are even more (Fig. 4(w)) than “II”, “III” and “IV” electrodes. Not only that, the size of the dispersions is larger (Fig. 4(x), up to ~2 μm). Taken as a whole, the “II”, “III”, “IV” and “VI” electrodes exhibit similar surface morphologies, except the amount of coated dispersions. But for the “V” electrode, the surface morphology is totally different on a basis of 3-dimensional porous frame (Fig. 4(q)). The coated round-like substances should be no longer called “dispersions” because they nearly cover the whole support (Fig. 4(r) and (s)). These round-like coatings have sizes between 1–2 μm, and own nano/micro open pores (Fig. 4(t)). Such hierarchical porous structure in the “V” electrode guarantees enough exposed Au active sites on one hand, and on the other hand, facilitates the rapid mass transfer process. The crystalline structures of Ni foam and Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes are checked by XRD. In Fig. 5 (a), Ni foam shows three sharp diffraction signals at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal faces of fcc Ni (PDF#04–0850), respectively. All the five Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes exhibit three strong Ni diffraction peaks just like the Ni foam, however, there are weak Au diffraction signals locating at ~38.2° and ~64.6° (PDF#04–0784) due to the minute Au loadings. Particularly, the (200) lattice plane of fcc Au almost overlaps the (111) lattice plane of fcc Ni. A hypothesis of Au–Ni alloy formation can be proposed because both the Au and Ni electrodeposition would happen during the fabrication of Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes. According to the Bragg equation (Equation (2)), it is known that larger diffraction degree (2θ) means smaller interplanar spacing (d) under the same wavelengths (λ). Compared with the standard Au (111) diffraction signal, the Au (111) peaks in “III”, “IV” and “VI” electrodes clearly shift towards large diffraction degree while that in “V” electrode barely deviate (see the arrow in Fig. 5(a)). Based on the Bragg equation, such observations imply that the interplanar spacings of Au (111) in “III”, “IV” and “VI” electrodes become smaller. The size of Ni atom is smaller than that of Au. Thus, we can infer there is the formation of Au–Ni alloy in “III”, “IV” and “VI” electrodes but virtually all monometallic Au species in “V” electrode. (2) 2dsinθ = nλ This conclusion is further confirmed by the XPS characterization. According to the Ni 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 5(b), the Ni elements on the Ni foam and five Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes are found to exist both in metallic (Ni0, at ~852 eV) and oxidized (at ~856 eV and ~873 eV) states [32,33]. Ni metal can be oxidized upon the exposure to the air and aqueous solution due to its intrinsically high oxophilicity [34]. As a result, only a tiny amount of Ni0 species are detected by XPS (see the weak peaks in dashed rectangle). For Ni foam, two dashed straight lines are used to mark the peak positions of oxidized-state Ni in the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. Predictably, the formation of Au–Ni alloy would result in the shift of oxidized-state Ni peak towards high binding energy, since the electronegativity of Au (2.4) is larger than that of Ni (1.9). The XPS result is indeed the case. The peaks of oxidized-state Ni in all the five Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes situate at higher binding energies than those of Ni foam, signifying the formation of Au–Ni alloy in all the five Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes. Nevertheless, there should be the fewest Au–Ni alloys in “V” electrode on account of its minimal binding energy shift among the five. Combining the binding energy shifts in Fig. 5(b) with the onset potentials in Fig. 3(c), we find a rule: those having less Au–Ni alloys exhibit lower onset potentials. For instance, the “II” and “III” electrodes loaded with more Au–Ni alloys initiate the electrocatalysis of MEA oxidation till −0.20 V. In contrast, the “V” and “VI” electrodes share the same low onset potential with the Au wire in Fig. S2. The Au 4f XPS spectra in Fig. 5(c) are obtained under the same test conditions, hence we compare the amount of exposed Au active sites according to the area of Au signal peak. As seen in Table 3 , the “V” electrode owns the most Au active sites on its surface. In conclusion, the reasons why the “V” electrode expresses the best MEA electrooxidation performance lie in two aspects: the least Au–Ni alloys (conversely, the most monometallic Au species) and the most Au active sites on its surface among the Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes. It is precisely because there are Au, Au–Ni alloys and possible Ni coating on Ni foam support, we name the fabricated electrode as Au–Ni@Ni foam (Au–Ni bimetals coated on nickel foam) electrode."
8,"Performance evaluation of fuel cell, electrolyzer and fuel cell-electrolyzer series device","3.3 Performance evaluation of fuel cell, electrolyzer and fuel cell-electrolyzer series device Fig. 6 (a) shows the CV curves of the optimized Au–Ni@Ni foam in solution containing different concentrations of MEA. The concentration of MEA has no impact on the onset potential. However, the catalytic current density in the forward scan increases from 19.8 to 27.2 mA cm−2 when the concentration of MEA varies from 0.025 to 0.05 mol L−1. Further increase in the MEA concentration does not boost the catalytic current density of forward scan yet gives rise to gradual augment of catalytic current density in the reverse scan. The catalytic current density of reverse scan is derived from the electrooxidation of MEA or its intermediates. Its improvement range becomes narrower as the MEA concentration increases. Considered together, 0.05 mol L−1 is thought to be the most ideal concentration of MEA under the premise of 1.0 mol L−1 KOH. The large [KOH]/[MEA] molar ratio can be explained by Equation (1), where the stoichiometric coefficient ratio of KOH to MEA has gone up to 10:1. In order to get an understanding of electrode reaction kinetics in the MEA-containing electrolyzer, the LSVs of Pt plate and intercepted polarization curves of Au–Ni@Ni foam in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH with (red curves) and without (black curves) 0.05 mol L−1 MEA are plotted in Fig. 6(b). The polarization potential of OER in bare KOH solution is 0.35 V at the current density of 5.0 mA cm−2. By comparison, the polarization potential of MEA electrooxidation in MEA-containing solution is merely −0.26 V, moving negatively by 0.61 V. However, at the cathodic current density of 5.0 mA cm−2, the polarization potential in MEA-containing solution is 0.055 V lower than that in bare KOH solution. The slightly retarded cathodic reaction in MEA-containing solution is probably because the active sites for HER are blocked by MEA molecular. In the MEA-containing solution, other electroreduction reactions along with HER are very likely to occur, such as the electroreduction of CO2 which is absorbed from air by MEA [35]. CO2 electroreduction is an intrusive presence for HER, but from a different angle, it is another form of resource recovery [36]. We can estimate the power consumption of electrolyzers based upon the three-electrode testing results in Fig. 6(b). Owing to the very facile MEA electrooxidation reaction, the MEA-containing electrolyzer enables the electricity cost to be cut by 39.0% (from 1.46 V down to 0.89 V) and 29.2% (from 1.54 V down to 1.09 V), when the current densities consumed are 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm−2, respectively. Fig. 6(c) is the LSVs of the electrolyzer with and without MEA, respectively. In accordance with the results in Fig. 6(b), the two-electrode electrolyzer with MEA exhibits much lower voltage than that without MEA, no matter how large the current density is. As observed in the LSVs, there are two stages in both the electrolyzers, with the first one at lower voltages showing by a current peak while the second at higher voltages revealing by an upward curve. The CP curves of the electrolyzers are depicted in Fig. 6(d). Notably, there are two voltage platforms in the CP curves of bare alkaline electrolyzer at 5.0 mA cm−2 and MEA-containing electrolyzer at 10.0 mA cm−2, which well correspond to the two stages in Fig. 6(c). The CP results reflect the real power consumption of electrolyzers. In MEA-containing electrolyzer, the voltages needed to yield current densities of 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm−2 are ~1.16 and ~1.57 V, respectively. By contrast, those in bare alkaline electrolyzer are relatively higher, i.e., ~1.70 and ~1.81 V, respectively. We believe that the power consumption in MEA-containing electrolyzer can be further reduced by carefully selecting the cathodic catalyst, which is also one of the researches we are going to conduct in future. The anolyte and catholyte in direct MEA-H2O2 fuel cell are separately 1.0 mol L−1 KOH +0.05 mol L−1 MEA and 2.0 mol L−1 H2SO4 + 1.0 mol L−1 H2O2. Their individual electrode reaction kinetics are reflected by the LSVs in Fig. 7 (a). As observed, a current density gain of 4 mA cm−2 in the H2O2 electroreduction merely causes a potential change of 20 mV, far less than that (98 mV) in MEA electrooxidation. This comparison suggests MEA electrooxidation is the major constraint on the performance of direct MEA-H2O2 fuel cell. Connecting the fuel cell unit one after another by lead wire, the direct MEA-H2O2 fuel cell stack is achieved. All the fuel cell (FC) unit and FC stacks have stable open circuit voltages (OCVs), and with series numbers from 1 to 4, the OCVs are 0.67 V, 1.38 V, 2.09 V and 2.77 V, respectively (Fig. S3 (a)). The Nyquist plots in Fig. S3 (b) imply the progressively slower reaction velocity (seen from the gradually larger semicircle) from one FC, 2 FCs in series, 3 FCs in series to 4 FCs in series. Given that the electron transfer process affects the electrochemical reaction velocity, the progressively slower reaction velocity should partly result from the increasing ohmic resistance (seen from the real resistances at the imaginary resistance of 0 in the inset of Fig. S3 (b)) [37]. Fortunately, the ohmic resistances in FC unit and FC stacks are relatively small and it is only 1.6 Ω cm2 even in the 4 FCs in series. The ohmic resistance can be mostly eliminated by using the commercial bipolar plate instead of the monopolar plate and lead wire in bench scale [38]. Fig. 7(b) shows the polarization curves of one FC and FC stacks. As the series numbers increase, the fuel cell voltage is significantly elevated, except that from 3 FCs to 4 FCs in series under the discharging current densities above 25 mA cm−2. The polarization curves fluctuate at large discharging current densities, which is brought about by the large amount of gas products not dissolved in the anolyte. To get the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device to work properly, the output voltages of one FC or FC stacks should be larger than the input voltage of electrolyzer at the same current density. That means the FC unit or FC stacks must provide voltages over ~1.16 and ~1.57 V (Fig. 6(d)) at the current densities of 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm−2, respectively. As marked by the dashed straight lines in Fig. 7(b), the output voltage of 3 FCs in series at 5.0 mA cm−2 and 4 FCs in series at 10.0 mA cm−2 are separately 1.80 V and 2.22 V. Furthermore, the CP tests in Fig. 7(c) carried on 3 FCs in series and 4 FCs in series validate these FC stacks are able to constantly supply voltages (1.73 V and 2.10 V) beyond the need of electrolyzer at 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm−2, respectively. Thereupon 3 or 4 FCs in series and one electrolyzer make up the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device. Fig. 7(d) and (e) present the output voltage of FC stacks and corresponding current densities in the series device. During testing, the multimeter used to record current is in series arranged into the device (shown in Video S1). The accuracy of recorded current in this multimeter has been already verified by the electrochemical workstation (Fig. S3 (c)). As expected, the 3 FCs- and 4 FCs-electrolyzer series devices in Fig. 7(d) and (e) yield relatively stable current densities above 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition, myriads of H2 gas bubbles keep generating on the surface of Pt plate in the electrolyzer (see Video S2 and Fig. 7(f)), which accordingly proves this series device to be a tenable strategy for simultaneous MEA electrochemical degradation and hydrogen evolution. Specifically, the hydrogen evolution only happens in the electrolzyer while the MEA electrochemical degradation occurs in both the fuel cells and electrolyzer.

The following is/are the supplementary data related to this article: Multimedia componenet 4 Multimedia componenet 4 It is worth noting that there are two stages with the first one lasting for ~100 s in both Fig. 7(d) and (e). For 3 FCs-electrolyzer series device in Fig. 7(d), the reaction resistances (dividing the voltage by the current density) in the first and second stages are calculated to be ~83.6 and ~189.2 Ω cm2, respectively. The advent of two-stage characteristics may originate from the electrolyzer, because the FC stack outputs very stable voltage (Fig. 7(c)) while the electrolyzer not (Fig. 6(d)) under the constant current load. Compared with the 3 FCs-electrolyzer series device, the 4 FCs-electrolyzer series device in Fig. 7(e) exhibits much lower reaction resistances, i.e., 67.5 and 112.2 Ω cm2, respectively. It seems that we should prolong the first stage due to its much lower reaction resistances. It is necessary to investigate the MEA degradation efficiency and degradation amount of MEA in the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device. Firstly, we should note that in the fuel cell, the MEA degradation efficiency should be 100%, since there is no other competitive electrooxidation reactions happening in the anode side. For a direct MEA-O2 or MEA-H2O2 fuel cell of which O2 or H2O2 electroreduction takes place in the cathode side, the competitive O2 evolution reaction will not happen. However, in anode side of the electrolyzer, MEA electrooxidation is probably companied with the competitive O2 evolution reaction, because there are no thermodynamic constraints in its cathode side (H2 evolution reaction). Theoretically, the degradation amount of MEA can be calculated only through recording the inputted electricity quantity in the electrochemical degradation process. In practice, the competitive O2 evolution reaction may also consume a proportion of the inputted electricity quantity. Based on the above analysis, we switch to the change in chemical oxygen demand (COD) to represent the degradation amount of MEA. In the meantime, the MEA degradation efficiency can be obtained by combining the inputted electricity quantity with COD values. The COD values were determined by following the China's national environmental protection standard, viz., HJ 828–2017. Three kinds of solutions containing MEA were used for COD determination, i.e., solution NO. 1 (original, 1.0 mol L−1+0.005 mol L−1 MEA), solution NO. 2 (inputted current: 9.0 mA, inputted electricity quantity is 32.4 C) and solution NO. 3 (inputted current: 4.5 mA, inputted electricity quantity is 16.2 C). The electrochemical degradation was performed in a two-electrode system containing Au–Ni@Ni foam anode (3.0 × 3.0 cm2) and Pt plate cathode (1.0 × 2.0 cm2), respectively. The COD value, corresponding degradation amount of MEA and MEA degradation efficiency are listed in Table 4 . Results show MEA can be efficiently electrochemically degraded by the Au–Ni@Ni foam anode, and lower inputted current in the electrochemical degradation process favors larger MEA degradation efficiency."
9,Conclusions,"The systematical electrochemical tests indicated Au, among Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, Au, Ru, Rh and Pd, was the best-performed electrocatalyst for MEA electrooxidation. However, the high price hampered its heavy use. Loading the Ni foam support with minute amount of Au by the facile electrodeposition, Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes were obtained. The electrodeposition time was further optimized between 5–45 min. Results show an Au–Ni@Ni foam electrode with the Au electrodeposition time of 30 min exerted the largest area current of 27.2 mA cm−2, largest Au mass current of 58.1 A g−1 and lowest onset potential of −0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH and 0.05 mol L−1 MEA. The combined electrochemical testing results and physico-chemical characterizations shed light on the reasons why the Au–Ni@Ni foam electrode as stated above expressed the best MEA electrooxidation performance. Those reasons lay in two aspects: the least Au–Ni alloys (conversely, the most monometallic Au species) and the most Au active sites on its surface among all the Au–Ni@Ni foam electrodes. Continuous current was detected, and vigorous hydrogen bubbles were visually observed in the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device. In this regard, the fuel cell-electrolyzer series, which was designed for simultaneous MEA degradation and hydrogen production with a little supplied power, proves completely workable in bench scale. COD determinations show that MEA can be efficiently electrochemically degraded by the Au–Ni@Ni foam anode, and lower inputted current in the electrochemical degradation process favors larger MEA degradation efficiency. Several issues and perspectives involving this series device should be mentioned here to bring enlightenment: (1) Despite the optimization on anode fabrication process, MEA electrooxidation kinetics in direct MEA-H2O2 fuel cell was still slower than H2O2 electroreduction kinetics; (2) Aiming at this problem, replacing the Ni foam support with other supports, which own large surface area and are not prone to form alloy with Au, is highly suggested; (3) HER in MEA-containing electrolyzer was slightly hindered, probably because the active sites for HER were blocked by MEA molecules.; (4) At this point, it is necessary to carefully select cathodes which exhibit not only the favorable catalytic performance for HER but also the weak adsorption for MEA molecules; (5) MEA is exactly the absorbent for CO2 and the products of CO2 electroreduction also have high-added value. Based on these thoughts, the pure MEA in the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device can be replaced by MEA solution which has absorbed CO2. Thus, the fuel cell-electrolyzer series device is transformed into a series device for simultaneous MEA degradation, CO2 removal and production of high-added value substances from CO2 electroreduction with a little supplied power or even without any."
