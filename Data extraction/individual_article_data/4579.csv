0,Introduction,"Restrictions of gas emissions in the atmosphere, such as hydrocarbons (HCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), originated from internal combustion engines, are increasing. The industries are being constantly pressed for developing clean technologies, such as fuel cells [1,2]. It offers an efficient conversion of chemical into electrical energy without the emission of pollutants, generated in engine of internal combustion, being one of the most promising sources of energy generation in the future [3]. Hydrogen can be produced from different processes, such as steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols, biomass, electrolysis of the water or as by-product of the oil refining. Among them, steam reforming is probably the most common and cheapest way for hydrogen production [4]. The autothermal reforming or oxidative steam reforming has the main advantage that the initial oxidation reaction is extremely exothermic, generating heat for the subsequent endothermic reforming reactions [5]. Among various hydrocarbons, propane is drawing attention in hydrogen production studies primarily because it is a constituent of LPG [6,7]. LPG is a commercial gas that is easily transported and stored on site [8]. Moreover, due to its composition (short aliphatic C3–C4 chains and absence of sulphur or other electronegative atoms), LPG is reported to present some significant advantages compared to heavier feedstocks, especially in terms of catalyst resistance to deactivation led by limited carbon deposition during reforming [9]. Propane is produced in relative high amounts from natural gas and oil crude refining. For pressures of approximately 9bar, it is in liquid state and can be easily stored and distributed. Three-way catalysts are used in catalytic converters and in a narrow air/fuel ratio, allowing simultaneously the oxidation of HCs and CO, beyond the reduction of NOx [10]. Noble metals, such as Pd, Pt and Rh supported on γ-Al2O3 have been used. Palladium is very active for hydrocarbons and CO oxidation. The main advantage of Pd is the relatively low price in comparison to other noble metals [11]. Cerium oxide (CeO2) has been widely used as promoter due to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [12], acting as thermal stabilizer of the support [13,14], allowing better dispersion of the metal [15], and preventing coke formation [16,17]. The influence of sub-stoichiometric condition in the feed O2/C3H8 on the reaction is relatively scarce in the literature. Therefore, in the present work we investigate the influence of the sub-stoichiometric condition in the feed O2/C3H8 and the influence of the Pd precursors in the presence of a surface layer of CeO2 on the activity of the autothermal reforming of propane on Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, as well as the addition of water on the H2 selectivity."
1,Experimental,"The CeO2/Al2O3 system was prepared by grafting a cerium acetylacetonate precursor (Ce(acac)3) (Aldrich Corp.) over alumina (AL-3916P-Engelhard Corp., 208m2/g and 0.47cm3/g) surface hydroxyl groups, as described elsewhere [17]. After grafting, the sample was filtered and washed with toluene (Vetec, 99% P.A.) and distilled water, followed by drying in an oven at 393K for 18h and calcination under O2 flow at 673K for 4h using a heating rate of 1Kmin−1. The global process of preparation of the CeO2/Al2O3 support (grafting, filtration, drying and calcination) was carried out in six stages due to the low solubility of Ce(acac)3 in toluene. Three catalysts with 1% (wt) of palladium supported on CeO2/Al2O3 (18% wt CeO2, 193m2/g and 0.40cm3/g) were prepared, using different precursor salts of the metal, Pd(acac)2, Pd(NO3)2 and PdCl2, now designated as PdCeacac, PdCeN and PdCeCl, respectively. The PdCeacac catalyst was prepared using wet impregnation method. Toluene was used to dissolve Pd(acac)2 and the system was then filtered, whereas the PdCeN and PdCeCl catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation, using solutions of HCl and HNO3 for dissolution of PdCl2 and Pd(NO3)2, respectively. Finally, the samples were dried at 393K for 18h and calcined in an aerated muffle at 773K for 4h. Additionally, Pd catalysts with different precursors were prepared on γ-Al2O3, using the same methodology and were denoted as: Pdacac, PdN and PdCl. The crystallite sizes obtained were in the range of 3–8nm (CeO2) and 3–5nm (Pd), similar to reported data in the literature [18,19]. The crystallites of Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts were determined after calcination and reduction at 773K, using Scherrer's equation and in particular the Rietveld method on XRD data (not shown). Table 1 presents the metallic content and chemisorption results of the catalysts with different precursors, as reported previously [17]. It shows that depending on the precursor the dispersion is different, however, for the precursor of acetylacetonate (acac) both Pd/Al2O3 and promoted with Ce (Pd/CeO2/Al2O3) presented equal dispersions. The chloride precursor for Pd/Al2O3 displayed similar and high dispersion like the acac precursor, however, in the presence of CeO2 was reduced by half, indicating formation of larger particles. On the contrary, with nitrate precursor the presence of CeO2 increased the dispersion when compared to the Pd without the promoter, evidencing better dispersion in the presence of CeO2. Temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) measurements were carried out in a multipurpose unit equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers Prisma-QMS 200). The signal intensity of masses 2, 28, 29, 32 and 44, corresponding to H2, CO, C3H8, O2 and CO2, respectively, were monitored continuously. Quantifications were carried through calibration of each component and expressed in mol%. Contributions of C3H8 and CO2 in the signal of CO (m/e =28) and influence of C3H8 in the CO2 signal (m/e =44) were duly deducted in the calculation of the molar fractions of the components in the mixture. The samples were pretreated passing a flow of 5% O2/He at 673K for 60min to eliminate carbonated species, probably formed on ceria [20], and followed by flowing He at 773K for 90min. Then, the samples were reduced in pure H2 at 773K for 60min and, finally, cooled down to room temperature in He atmosphere. The oxidation stage was suppressed for catalysts supported only on γ-Al2O3. The same total flow rate (50mlmin−1) was used in all steps. The feed consisted of 0.5% C3H8 and 0.5R% O2 diluted in He, where R is defined as the O2/C3H8 molar ratio. Experiments containing water in the inlet composition were denoted by S, where S represents the H2O/C3H8 molar ratio. The total flow used in all the experiments was 150mlmin−1, with heating rate of 10Kmin−1 and 25mg of catalyst. Reactants and balance gas He was supplied through mass flow controllers. For the stability test of the catalysts, runs were performed during 48h with time on stream in a fixed bed reactor using the same experimental conditions as the TPSR test. The exit gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (9001 Chrompack CP-Column Haye Sep D 100/120#) and the calculations based with relation of the injection of the non-reacted gas loading (bypass)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effect of O2/C3H8 molar ratio,"3.1 Effect of O2/C3H8 molar ratio The products distribution and reactant (mol%) as function of temperature for the PdCeacac catalyst and for R =5 (O2/C3H8 molar ratio) are displayed in Fig. 1 . In this case, R =5 correspond to the stoichiometric amount for total oxidation of propane, according to the following reaction: (1) C3H8 +5O2 →3CO2 +4H2O,ΔH 298 =−2046kJ/mol Under this condition (R =5), all propane was practically consumed. The conversion of propane was initiated at 523K and reached about 85% conversion at 923K. The amount of hydrogen produced was insignificant. The partial oxidation reaction (2) was not observed in this case, because CO and H2 were not detected. (2) C3H8 +(3/2)O2 →3CO+4H2,ΔH 298 =−229kJ/mol Indeed, DRIFTS (“Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy”) results (not shown) confirmed this statement, after adsorbing propane, desorption with He flux and flowing O2, evidencing the formation of CO2 only. The product distribution under reductive conditions, R =2.5, for the PdCeacac catalyst is shown in Fig. 2 . Propane consumption started around 523K and increased abruptly at 700K. Concomitantly, oxygen concentration in the reactant mixture decreased until its complete consumption. Only at this moment, H2 and CO were formed with simultaneous formation of CO2, in accordance with observations found by Barbier et al. [21], on a Pt–Rh/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst, denoting the presence of two distinct regions in the composition profile for the autothermal reforming, where H2 is formed by steam reforming with the residual propane and water produced in the primary oxidation. However, at high temperatures (>880K), still CO and H2 increased, reacting with CO2, denoting propane dry reforming. Therefore, Fig. 2 can be divided in three distinct regions occurring, respectively: propane oxidation (T <690K), oxidation and steam reforming (690K< T <880K) and finally, simultaneous oxidation, steam reforming and dry reforming (T >880K). (3) C3H8 +3H2O→3CO+7H2,ΔH 298 =497kJ/mol (4) C3H8 +6H2O→3CO2 +10H2,ΔH 298 =395kJ/mol (5) C3H8 +3CO2 →6CO+4H2,ΔH 298 =620kJ/mol Indeed, Fig. 3 shows the results of dry reforming of propane at a ratio CO2/C3H8 equal 4 (Eq. (5)) producing H2 and CO at a ratio of 0.62 at 923K, evidencing the occurrence of dry reforming during the reaction. Higher temperature showed increasing H2 formation, which could be attributed to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2), however, although CO2 decreases the H2 formation increases, suggesting that equilibrium was not reached under such conditions."
4,Equilibrium calculations,"3.2 Equilibrium calculations Equilibrium calculations were done for products as function of temperature, pressure and composition, based on the Lagrange multipliers principle [22], and ideal gas hypothesis. In this procedure, chemical reactions are not involved directly in any of the equations, but the choice of a set of species is entirely equivalent to the choice of a set of independent reactions between the species. Therefore, it is necessary to know what possible products may be formed. Fig. 4 shows the profiles of thermodynamic equilibrium composition for 1bar and temperatures varying between 323 and 923K. The simulated inlet gas was the same as the experiment for R =2.5, with a feed composition of 0.5% C3H8, 1.25% O2 and 98.25% He. The profiles present interesting characteristics, mainly for hydrogen. The production of hydrogen initiates at low temperature, reaching a maximum around 600K and, finally, decreases with increasing temperature. However, the dry reforming reaction does not occur, as observed in the experiments (Fig. 2). The decrease of hydrogen at higher temperatures is attributed to the reverse water gas shift (RWGS), highly undesirable, because it consumes H2 with concomitant formation of CO. Exothermic reactions present high equilibrium constant values at low temperatures. For this reason, the oxygen consumption is complete at 300K. Therefore, experiments were performed far from equilibrium conditions. Thermodynamic simulations were done varying the O2/C3H8 ratio (Fig. 5 ). The productions of H2 and CO were calculated for each ratio, at the point of maximum hydrogen production. For low values of R (0.5< R <1.5), small water concentration is observed during oxidation, which does not allow total conversion of propane in the subsequent reforming reaction and therefore, H2 and CO are low. For higher R values, when oxidation of propane is complete (R =5), the amounts of CO and H2 are also very small, since practically all propane is converted into CO2 and H2O, as already observed experimentally (Fig. 1). On the other hand, high amounts of hydrogen can be formed for R between 1.5< R <2.5. In this region, the highest H2/CO ratio was obtained for R =2.5 and therefore, this ratio was used in the experiments aiming to evaluate the influence of different Pd precursors. The H2/CO ratio follows the same trend of R."
5,Autothermal reforming,"3.3 Autothermal reforming Fig. 6 presents the propane conversion as function of temperature, using different O2/C3H8 ratios (1.5< R <5) for the PdCeacac catalyst. All profiles under stoichiometric conditions (1.5< R <3.5) present a sigmoidal form, starting with the reforming reaction, while Table 2 presents the ignition temperature for steam reforming (T light-off). The values of the maximum conversion for each ratio R are represented by X max (Table 2), taken at the maximum temperature used in the experiments (923K). Except for R =3.5 and R =5, the propane dry reforming did not occur. Table 2 shows that the light-off temperature increases when R increases. It suggests that oxygen inhibits strongly the reforming, shifting the light-off temperature to higher temperatures. The highest final conversion was obtained for R =3.5. Yazawa et al. [23] determined an optimal condition for R, while Zhou et al. [24] observed that the oxidation state of palladium is strongly affected with this ratio. They also observed that for higher values the metallic fraction (Pd0) decreased until complete transformation in the oxidation state (PdO), and consequently, the activity decreased. XPS results showed that under such conditions the metallic fraction at the surface was only 12%. Different authors [24–26] claim that the active phases during the oxidation of propane consist of small metallic (Pd0) sites and PdO particles. Probably under reductive conditions (R =3.5) at 790K, Pd0 particles still exist, keeping the catalyst active. Here, approximately 30% of propane was converted under such conditions due to steam reforming. Additional experiments using DRIFTS in situ reaction (not shown) revealed that along the reaction CO was adsorbed on the metallic sites and PdO particles under autothermal condition (R =2.5). On the other hand, XRD in situ (not shown) results under similar conditions displayed only metallic palladium, suggesting that at the surface both sites are active during the reaction although in the bulk phase metallic palladium predominate. Autothermal reforming under reductive conditions, varying O2/C3H8 ratios are presented in Table 3 . Between 1.5< R <3.5 higher amounts of hydrogen are produced. Although for R =3.5 the conversion of propane is high (Fig. 6) the hydrogen concentration is low. For R =1.5 the hydrogen formation is high at higher temperatures (T >823K), however, the H2/CO ratio is lower compared to R =2 and R =2.5. In a narrow temperature range (723< T <823K) and for R =2.5, the hydrogen formation was the highest among all ratios and still the H2/CO ratio was relatively high (2–2.5). Higher temperatures favor higher amounts of hydrogen for R =1.5, but in the temperature range where reformer normally works (T =773K), the H2/CO ratio was higher for R =2.5. For R =2 the H2/CO ratio is high but the hydrogen concentration is low when compared to R =2.5. Finally, for total oxidation (R =5) hydrogen was not produced. Fig. 7 displays the product distribution for R =2.5 of the PdCeacac and PdCeCl catalysts. The profiles of PdCeacac and PdCeN catalyst are very similar. For this reason, the PdCeN profile was not included in Fig. 7. There is a noteworthy difference related to the start-up reforming temperature. It starts around 800K for the PdCeCl catalyst, 100K higher than for the PdCeacac catalyst. The presence of residual oxygen seems to inhibit the reforming, and only after total consumption of oxygen, H2 and CO commence. In addition, CO and hydrogen form concomitantly, but around 850K the CO concentration is higher than CO2. For R =2.5 the reforming reaction (3) prevails in relation to the reaction (4) above 850K. Concerning the hydrogen concentration, the PdCeacac catalyst reached 1.9%, whereas the PdCeCl 1.2%. It should be observed that the reactants are diluted in He (98.25%) and therefore, these values are of this order of magnitude. Contrary to the PdCeacac catalyst, the dry reforming was not seen in the PdCeCl catalyst. Repeated runs evidenced reproducibility of the results. Runs were repeated with different masses and temperatures with ascending and descending cycles. Results of product distribution and activity were reproducible with different precursors. The presence of residual chlorine ions on Pd/Al2O3 catalysts affects strongly the catalytic activity, according to the literature [27–32]. On the other hand, the negative effect of residual chloride is reversible and the activity may increase after elimination of chlorine ions, according to Pieck et al. [33]. Schmal et al. [26] observed that the addition of water increased significantly the conversion of propane after approximately 10h of reaction. The increasing activity with time on stream in this case was attributed to the elimination of chlorine due to water generated in the oxidation step, as follows: Cl–Pd*+H–Pd*→HCl+Pd* where * denotes an active site. The lower performance of the PdCeCl catalyst (Fig. 7) is due to blocking Pd sites. Water released during the oxidation is consumed during steam reforming, hindering chlorine removal, affecting the catalytic performance. Several authors [5,34] did not discard the hypothesis of methane formation during the hydrogenolysis (6) and methanation (7). They observed cracking of propane for high temperatures (T >900K), which may occur, generating methane, ethane and ethylene. In our experiments, these compounds were not observed. (6) C3H8 +2H2 →3CH4 (7) CO+3H2 →CH4 +H2O"
6,Effect of water,"3.4 Effect of water The addition of water (propane–oxygen feed) was investigated in the PdCeacac catalyst, varying water concentration (S =H2O/C3H8 molar ratio), where S =3 corresponds to reaction (3) and S =6 to the reaction (4). Results are shown in Fig. 8 . Autothermal reforming for R =2.5 in the absence of water and steam reforming (S =6) were included as reference. Notice that S =6 represent steam reforming of propane without oxygen. Water did not change the autothermal reforming cycle (R =2.5, R =2.5, S =3 and R =2.5, S =6), because CO and H2 formed independent of water in the inlet gas. However, the reforming initiated at lower temperature (about 50–70K) with water in the inlet gas. Propane conversion was high with addition of water. Hydrogenolysis and methanation did not occur under such conditions. However, small amount of water (R =2.5, S =3) increased the hydrogen production. At 823K, the hydrogen concentration increased 50%. Also, the CO2 concentration increased with less CO formation. Therefore, the effect of water on the selectivity was calculated according to the following equation: S CO = 100 % C O x 3 ( % C 3 H 8 in − % C 3 H 8 out ) Table 4 presents the selectivity of CO and CO2 for three different temperatures (723, 773 and 823K). Results show that water influenced the remarkable selectivity of CO and CO2. With increasing water content, CO2 increased and CO decreased, which is interesting, keeping the CO concentration low in the outlet gas. On the other hand, the temperature causes the opposite, augmenting the CO concentration, which is compensated by increasing the water content. Indeed, CO2 is formed through reaction (4) around 700K, and at higher temperature (≈823K) through reaction (3), generating CO. Through reforming alone (S =6), CO increases, enhancing the hydrogen production (Fig. 8). Fig. 9 shows the H2/CO ratio in the presence of water. For R =2.5 this ratio reaches 2.5 for wide temperature range, whereas with addition of water (S =6) it increases two-fold. Resini et al. [35] presented results of the propane steam reforming on Pd–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, using S =6. Hydrogen formed only above 800K. For low propane conversions (≈10%), they observed high selectivity to propylene and CO2, attributed to the propane dehydrogenation (8) and water gas shift reactions (9), respectively. At higher temperatures (≈1000K) propane conversion increased, resulting preferentially the formation of ethylene and methane according reaction (10). Aartun et al. [5] observed similar results for propane autothermal reforming with Rh catalyst supported on a Fe–Cr–Al alloys. The hydrogen was formed at 773K and increased up to 900K. Ethylene and methane were also formed at higher temperatures (>950K) by cracking (10). (8) C3H8 →C3H6 +H2 (9) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 (10) C3H8 →C2H4 +CH4 Whittington et al. [36] observed total conversion of propane for the Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst at 773K (R =13). Kolb et al. [37] observed total propane conversion at 1023K with a Rh–Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst and a ratio S =6. The catalyst was stable over 6h with time on stream. Barbier et al. [10] using similar catalyst, observed 95% conversion of propane at 723K for autothermal reforming (R =2, S =30). According to these authors, Pt promotes oxidation while Rh the reforming reaction. In conclusion, our catalyst seems to be more active and selective compared with reported results in the literature. The literature indicates [26,38–40] that water inhibits the oxidation reaction (first stage of the autothermal reforming). The dissociative adsorption of water occurs on the palladium sites leading to the formation of surface hydroxides. These, in turn, are much less active diminishing the reaction rate. On the other side, water is responsible for the elimination of residual chloride in the catalyst, blocking the active sites [26,33]. According to Wang et al. [41], water is also important for the elimination of coke formation during steam reforming. Our results show that water increases CO2 and H2 formation during steam reforming and reduces CO."
7,Effect of the ceria,"3.5 Effect of the ceria Fig. 10 shows the product distribution for R =2.5 for different palladium precursors (acac and nitrate) supported on CeO2/Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. Significant differences were observed in the hydrogen production. For both precursors, the presence of ceria modifies the propane autothermal reforming. The hydrogen production on the catalyst with ceria is higher than on the catalyst without ceria. At 773K, for example, the H2 concentration for PdCeacac, Pdacac, PdCeN and PdN is equal to 1.2, 0.8, 1.35 and 0.5%, respectively. Comparing the catalysts with and without ceria, oxygen does affect the start up reforming reaction in both cases. Whittington et al. [36] observed that cerium shifted the conversion of propane (T 50%) to higher temperature for Pd and Pt supported on Al2O3 catalyst. However, under reforming conditions the T 50% was reduced drastically for all catalysts, in good agreement with our results. Although the activity with ceria was lower than without ceria, during the reforming it was still high, compensating the low initial activity, affecting the entire process (oxidation+reforming) positively. Tagliaferri et al. [42] also observed the negative effect of ceria in the propane oxidation, while Guimarães et al. [43] observed different behavior between oxidation and reforming for the Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst. Indeed, CeO2 supplies the oxygen deficiency due to the initial consumption through the oxidation reaction. This factor contributes for the lower availability of metallic sites for adsorption of reactants and consequently inhibits the reaction. H2/CO ratios for different catalysts are displayed in Fig. 11 . The catalysts with ceria presented high H2/CO values (around 2.5 for PdCeacac and PdCeN). The product selectivity (for carbon compounds) is presented in Table 5 . Results show that those catalysts with ceria presented the highest CO2 selectivity, with exception of the PdN catalyst at 723K. The order in the CO2 selectivity is: PdCeacac>PdCeN>PdN>Pdacac. It should be noted the CO2 selectivity on the PdCeacac catalyst is higher than on PdCeN, but the homologous without ceria changed (PdN>Pdacac). Catalysts with ceria showed at the beginning of the reforming reactions (temperature around 700–800K) high CO2 molar fractions (Fig. 10). Different authors [44–46] reported the occurrence of the WGS reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) with noble metals supported on CeO2. Therefore, experiments were carried out aiming to evaluate the influence of the catalyst with ceria content (PdCeacac) for these reactions and compared to a catalyst without ceria (Pdacac). The feed consisted of a mixture 2% CO and 2% H2O diluted in He. The results are presented in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12 shows that the catalyst with ceria is the most active for the WGS. Consumption of CO for the PdCeacac catalyst initiate around 500K and reached maximum conversion around 650K. Then the CO conversion decreased with increasing temperature. On the other hand, the Pdacac catalyst showed low conversions for all temperatures. It suggests that the WGS reaction cannot be discarded, in particular for the catalysts with ceria. Due to this reaction at temperatures next to the reforming beginning (≈700K), the CO2 selectivity is high, however in opposite, at higher temperatures (≈823K), the selectivity decreases and presents low CO conversions, in accordance with Fig. 12. Indeed, with increasing temperature the reforming region causes a decrease in CO2 selectivity, which can be attributed to the two distinct phenomena: occurrence of the WGS reaction at temperatures around 700K and the reforming reaction (4), generating CO2, occurring preferentially at a first moment in the reforming region. Therefore, the selectivity of CO increases continuously with increasing temperature. For PdCeacac catalyst, the decrease in hydrogen yield after 640K is a thermodynamic effect that limits the reaction, discarding any catalyst deactivation under such conditions. Furthermore, on Pdacac catalyst, the hydrogen equilibrium was not achieved. Fig. 13 shows the conversion of propane with time on stream for the autothermal reforming (R =2.5) on PdCeacac and PdCeN catalysts. The catalysts were stable up to 48h, after small deactivation in the first hours. The initial conversions on PdCeacac and PdCeN were 73%, in accordance with the TPSR results where the conversions were 79 and 77% for the PdCeacac and PdCeN catalysts, respectively. After 48h, when the temperature was changed to 873K the conversion reached 95%. TPSR results showed an initial conversion of 95% at 873K under similar feed conditions. Therefore it can be inferred that the small deactivation occurs only during the first hours of reaction. Additionally, through thermogravimetry, coke formation was not detected in catalysts even after aging for 48h."
8,Conclusions,"High production of hydrogen was obtained by autothermal reforming of propane on Pd/CeO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, under sub-stoichiometric O2/C3H8 ratio in presence and absence of water. According to thermodynamic calculations, the optimum O2/C3H8 ratio for hydrogen production is between 1.5 and 2.5. In this interval, the results showed for R =2.5 the highest value for H2/CO. The PdCeCl catalyst was less active. The weaker performance is attributed to the presence of chlorine ions at the surface, competing for active sites on Pd. The catalyst prepared with acac precursor was the most active, because the reforming temperature was 100K lower than for the chloride precursor. Additionally, the H2/CO ratio and the H2 production on this catalyst were the highest. The addition of water to C3H8–O2 feed increased the propane conversion and lowered the reforming temperature, about 50–70K. For all conditions, methane formation was not detected, indicating the absence of hydrogenolysis, methanation and propane cracking reactions. Additionally, the selectivity of products (CO and CO2), showed that CO diminished with water addition. The Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 system presented higher hydrogen production, compared to Pd/Al2O3. The presence of CeO2 increased the H2/CO ratio and lowered the CO selectivity. The CeO2 influences positively to a large extent the high activity in the WGS reaction. The catalysts were stable for 50h with small deactivation in the first hours of reaction."
