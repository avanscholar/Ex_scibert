0,Introduction,"As the most abundant renewable biopolymer material, cellulose widely exists in wood, bamboo, rattan, cotton and hemp, and it could also be extracted from agricultural and forestry wastes. Cellulose is a linear biopolymer which consists of β-1,4-d-glucopyranose units associated by hydrogen bonds. Cellulose exhibits a two-phase structure alternately connected by highly ordered (crystalline) and disordered (amorphous-like) regions [1]. According to the arrangement of hydrogen bond network and molecular chain orientation, four cellulose allomorphs have been discovered (cellulose I–IV) and they could be obtained from various cellulose sources through different purification and treatment processes [2,3]. Generally, natural cellulose presents cellulose I allomorph, and cellulose II is obtained by mercerized or dissolved treatment of cellulose I. Due to their excellent strength and modulus, nanocelluloses derived from cellulose substrates could enhance the mechanical properties of polymer composites, and offer opportunities for new high value-added products, such as films, electronic devices, aerogels, hydrogel, etc. [4–8]. Nanocelluloses could be prepared from variable cellulose sources using different methods, including acid hydrolysis (referred to cellulose nanocrystals, CNCs) and high mechanical defibrillation with or without chemical or enzymatic pretreatments (called cellulose nanofibrils, CNFs) [6,9,10]. Currently, CNC is mainly produced by mineral acid hydrolysis of cellulose. Sulfuric acid is most widely used as it produces a negative surface charge on the CNCs, giving rise to more stable suspensions. The CNCs usually maintain the same allomorph as the original cellulose substrates after acid hydrolysis. Namely, cellulose I nanocrystals (CNC-I) are isolated from cellulose I substrates, and CNCs with type II allomorph (CNC-II) are derived from mercerized cellulose [11]. Besides, mercerization of CNC-I also results in production of CNC-II [12]. A few years ago, researchers found that CNC-II could be straightly prepared from cellulose I by sulfuric acid hydrolysis [13]. The soluble fractions of short cellulose chains recrystallized to be CNC-II in aqueous solution. In our previous study, it was found that CNC-II could be directly prepared from cellulose I substrate at a restricted range of conditions using concentrated sulfuric acid (≥60 wt%) hydrolysis at 45 °C for short reaction time (10–20 min) [14]. However, the yield of CNC-II was always lower than 20 wt% in those hydrolysis conditions. More than 60 wt% cellulose remained as under hydrolyzed solid residue when using 64 wt% sulfuric acid hydrolysis for 10 min. The regenerated CNC-II obtained is remarkably different from those prepared by hydrolysis of cellulose II substrates, as well as CNC-I, in crystalline structure, micromorphology, optical and thermal properties [13,15–17]. Those differences further affect their biodegradability and performances of the derived composites, emulsions and dispersants [11,18–21]. Non-biodegradable polymeric materials lead to serious environmental pollution and they are harmful to human beings through a series of complicated physical, chemical, and biological processes. These years, incorporation of nanocelluloses into biodegradable polymer matrix has been explored as a suitable alternative with environmental friendliness and security [10,22–24]. The barrier and mechanical properties of the biodegradable composites are greatly improved with addition of a small amount of nano-sized cellulose [7,8,25,26]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a biodegradable macromolecule material with low price, gas barrier property, biocompatibility, water solubility, excellent oil and solvent resistance [27,28]. Nanocelluloses, especially CNFs, have been applied as excellent reinforced materials to PVA matrix. Liu et al. [29] efficiently isolated CNFs from paper pulp by joint mechanical grinding and high pressure homogenization, and verified that CNF could improve the crystallinity, strength, modulus, and thermal stability of the PVA matrix because of its high aspect ratio, crystallinity and good compatibility. Miao et al. [30] investigated the different reinforcement effect between cellulose I and II nanofibrils prepared via the TEMPO-mediated oxidation method combing a mechanical disintegration on PVA matrix, and they found cellulose I nanofibrils contributed to a higher Young's modulus, while cellulose II nanofibrils resulted in a better toughness at the same content. Meanwhile, both of cellulose I and II nanofibrils can improve the thermal stability and lower the degradation rate of PVA. Rowe et al. [31] found that CNC or CNF incorporation in the PVA matrix did not markedly shift temperatures at the onset of degradation or at maximum degradation for the major stage of pyrolysis, compared to neat PVA. However, the inclusion of nanocellulose lowered the maximum rate of degradation, with larger reductions at higher filler contents. Lee et al. [32] compared the reinforcement effect of the CNC and CNF in PVA, and they reported that the CNF with a higher aspect ratio endowed the composite of higher strength and modulus but lower strain-at-failure than those of CNC composites at the same reinforcement content. However, to our knowledge, the reinforcement effect of regenerated cellulose II nanofibrils produced by direct sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cellulose I substrate on PVA composites have not been explored and compared with other CNF allomorphs. The broadening effect of CNFs on temperature window (Tonset − Tm) for the melt processing of CNFs/PVA nanocomposites have not been reported. In this study, cellulose I and II nanofibrils were prepared through sulfuric acid hydrolysis of eucalyptus cellulose using three different conditions followed by mechanical treatment. Specially, the yield of regenerated cellulose II nanoparticles produced by direct sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cellulose I substrate have been improved and their properties have been reported for the first time. The CNFs were characterized in terms of crystalline and chemical structure, micromorphology, surface charge and thermal properties. Then CNF/PVA composites films were prepared by solution casting. The effects of CNF allomorphs on the mechanical, thermal and optical properties of the CNF/PVA composites have been investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Eucalyptus wood powder (Eucalyptus urophylla × E. grandis, Jiangmen Mujiangweihua Inc.) (80-mesh) was used to produce CNFs. The chemicals used for mercerization (sodium hydroxide, 80 wt%) and hydrolysis (sulfuric acid, 95–98 wt%) were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, alcoholysis degree: 98.0–99.0 mol%, viscosity: 25.0–31.0 mPa.s, Aladdin) was used for the composites."
3,Preparation of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs),"2.2 Preparation of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) 2.2.1 CNF-I from eucalyptus cellulose (EC) EC was purified from eucalyptus wood powder as reported in our previous study [15]. The acid hydrolysis process was conducted at 10 mL/g acid to cellulose ratio using 58 wt% H2SO4 at 45 °C for 30 min with constant magnetic stirring. The following steps, including centrifugation, dialysis and sonication, were performed as reported previously [15]. After sonication, the resulting product was concentration adjusted to about 0.2–0.25 wt% for further process. 2.2.2 MNF-II from mercerized cellulose (MC) Firstly, EC was immersed in 20 wt% aqueous NaOH solution for 4 h at room temperature with a cellulose to alkali ratio of 1:20 (w/v). The mixture was filtered and washed with sufficient DI water to remove residual alkali. Then, the mercerized cellulose (MC) was freeze-dried and milled again. MC was hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid under the same condition of CNF-I production. The MNF-II mixture concentration was also adjusted to 0.2–0.25 wt%. 2.2.3 RNF-II from regenerated cellulose EC was hydrolyzed with 64 wt% sulfuric acid at 45 °C for 10 min, and all other processing conditions were the same as those used for CNF-I. The RNF-II mixture concentration was also adjusted to 0.2–0.25 wt%. 2.2.4 Homogenization process To further improve the dispersion of isolated cellulose nanoparticles in water and increase the yield of CNFs, mechanical treatments were applied to the three cellulose suspensions obtained above. Firstly, the suspensions were mechanically defibrillated using a household blender (Vitamix 5200) at a constant speed of 37,000 rpm for 30 min. After that, they were passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (50 Hz, 1.5 KW, AH-BASIC I, ATS Engineering Limited) under an operating pressure of 100 MPa at a rate of 50 mL/min for five cycles. The resulting CNF suspensions were stable for more than 30 days. The suspensions were concentration adjusted to 0.7 wt%, and then stored in sealed glass bottles at 4 °C."
4,Preparation of CNF/PVA nanocomposites,"2.3 Preparation of CNF/PVA nanocomposites Aqueous PVA solutions (10 wt%) were prepared by dissolving PVA powder in deionized water at 90 °C for 1 h. CNF suspensions (0.35 wt%) were added into the PVA solutions with different CNF contents (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 wt% of the composites) and the mixtures were stirred for 2 h. The mixtures were poured to polypropylene dishes and the water was evaporated at room temperature until films formed. The films were further dried at 60 °C for 5 h. The films obtained were approximately 0.1 mm thick and kept in sealed plastic bags until used."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystal structure of all samples was analyzed by a XRD powder diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity, and all samples were dried at 60 °C for 24 h prior to the test. Diffraction patterns were obtained with Cu Kα radiation generated at 40 kV and 40 mA at a rate of 2° /min from 5° to 50° 2θ. The crystalline and amorphous peaks deconvolution and crystalline index (CrI) were determined as reported previously [15] (Figs. S1–5). 2.4.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) A droplet of aqueous CNF suspension (10 μL, 0.01 wt%) was deposited onto a 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grid and then negatively stained with 2 wt% uranyl acetate for TEM imaging (JEOL, JEM-2100F, Japan). For each sample, the dimensions of the nanoparticles were measured and plotted using ImageJ and Origin Pro software by randomly selecting over 100 particles from several TEM images. 2.4.3 Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) FTIR spectra of EC, MC and CNFs were obtained using a FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA) at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity. For sample preparation, 1 mg of freeze-dried powder was grinded with 100 mg KBr and pressed into a circular pellet. The spectra were recorded from 4500 to 450 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and averaged from 60 scans in transmittance mode. 2.4.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface and cross section of the pure PVA and CNF/PVA composite films were observed by using an SEM (Car1-Zeiss Sigma HD, Germany). The samples were fractured using an ultra-thin blade (Lecia, Germany) after soaking in liquid nitrogen for several minutes. The samples were sputter-coated with a thin layer of gold using the sputtering system (Bal-Tec, SCD500) under vacuum condition. 2.4.5 Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) The elemental compositions of CNFs were evaluated by an EDS (HORIBA EX-250, Japan) adjunct to the SEM as reported previously [15]. The samples were freeze-dried before measurement. 2.4.6 Zeta potential The stability of the CNF suspensions was characterized by a Zeta Trac analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZSE, Malvern Panalytical, England). The zeta potential values (ζ, mV) of the aqueous suspensions (0.05 wt%) were measured three times at 25 °C with a 780 nm wavelength laser. 2.4.7 Mechanical properties The tensile strength (Rm) and Young's modulus (E) of PVA and CNF/PVA films were studied using a TA-XT Plux Texture Analyzer (Gao Tie, China) at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min until the samples reached 10% strain. E was calculated from the data of stress and strain in the initial linear region. The typical sample dimension for evaluation was 100 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm according to the ASTM D638 standard. For each material, at least five samples were used to obtain the average value and standard deviation. The mechanical test was carried out in a conditioning room (T = 23 °C, relative humidity = 50%), and all samples were dried at 60 °C for 24 h prior to the test. 2.4.8 Thermal properties The thermal properties of CNFs, PVA and CNF/PVA composite films were analyzed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA5500, TA, U.S.A). Each sample (~10 mg) was heated from 35 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere (30 mL/min). The thermal properties of PVA and CNF/PVA composite films were also studied by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC214 polymer, NETZSCH, Germany). DCS analysis was conducted under similar conditions but the operation temperature was raised from 35 to 240 °C. 2.4.9 Optical properties The optical transmittances of CNF suspensions, PVA and CNF/PVA composite films were measured over 300–800 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan). The CNF concentrations were 0.7 wt%. The PVA films and nanocomposite films were cut into rectangular shape (10 cm × 2 cm × 0.1 mm) and placed at 25 °C for 24 h to reach equilibrium moisture content before testing."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Preparation of CNFs with different allomorphs and high yield,"3.1 Preparation of CNFs with different allomorphs and high yield Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) with cellulose I and II allomorphs were prepared using sulfuric acid hydrolysis combined with mechanical treatment. The acid hydrolysis treatments varied with three different conditions: (i) classical sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cellulose I (CNF-I), (ii) sulfuric acid hydrolysis of mercerized cellulose II (MNF-II), and (iii) solubilization and hydrolysis of cellulose I by concentrated sulfuric acid and subsequent recrystallization in water (RNF-II). CNF-I was prepared from EC by 58 wt% H2SO4 pretreatment and mechanical defibrillation at a yield of 75.5% (Table 1 ). CNF-I suspension presented a stable light purple transparent appearance, and the light transmittance of 0.7 wt% CNF-I suspension was 91.8% at 600 nm wavelength (Fig. 1a). This result is consistent with high transparency of CNFs prepared from hydrolyzed solid residue [33]. EC and CNF-I exhibited typical cellulose I diffraction pattern (Fig. 1b), indicating that the raw cellulose crystal structure did not change in the acid hydrolysis process (58 wt% H2SO4, 45 °C, 30 min). Both diffraction diagrams showed a towering diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.6°, and two overlapping weak diffraction peaks appeared at 15.1 and 16.4°, corresponding to the (200), ( 1 1 ¯ 0 ) and (110) crystal plane in cellulose I crystalline structure, respectively [34]. The CrI of CNF-I (80.4%) was significantly higher than that of EC (70.8%) (Table 1). Under this acid treatment condition, the disordered regions were preferably hydrolyzed and the crystalline regions remained [14]. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of cellulose were partly sulfated by sulfuric acid treatment, which improved the dispersion and stability of CNF-I in water [35]. Moreover, the high turbulence and shear force in the high-pressure homogenization process further disrupted the disordered regions and increased the yield. MC was successfully obtained by immersing EC with 20 wt% NaOH solution at a yield of 90.0% (Table 1). MC exhibited cellulose II characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.0 ( 1 1 ¯ 0 ), 19.9 (110) and 21.8° (200) (Fig. 1b) [36]. During the alkali treatment, the cellulose inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds rearranged, leading to the transformation of parallel cellulose I chains into the antiparallel cellulose II [37]. Cellulose mercerization commonly includes three steps: cellulose swelling, crystalline regions destruction and new lattice formation after alkali removal. Generally, the dehydrated hydroxide ions easily penetrate and destroy the cellulose lattice when the concentration of NaOH solution reaches a critical value (e.g., 20 wt%). As a result, the CrI of MC (54.8%) was significantly lower than that of EC. MNF-II was obtained by treating MC with 58 wt% H2SO4 at 45 °C for 30 min. The resulting MNF-II was a stable homogenous lilac colloidal suspension, and the transmittance of 0.7 wt% MNF-II suspension was 86.7% at 600 nm wavelength (Fig. 1a). The yield of MNF-II was 73.0% based on the initial EC. MNF-II exhibited typical cellulose II diffraction peaks (Fig. 1b), similar to those of MC. However, compared with MC, the diffraction peaks of MNF-II on the (110) and (200) crystal planes showed obvious separation, and the intensity of diffraction peaks on the (200) crystal plane increased sharply, indicating that the CrI of MNF-II (84.8%) was higher than MC, which was possibly due to the removal of most disordered regions during sulfuric acid pretreatment. RNF-II prepared from EC by 64 wt% H2SO4 pretreatment at 45 °C combined with high-pressure homogenization also exhibited a milky white translucent appearance and had the lowest light transmittance of 77.3% at 600 nm wavelength (Fig. 1a). RNF-II presented XRD diffraction diagram similar to that of MNF-II. This interesting phenomenon showed that the crystalline structure of EC (cellulose I) was converted to cellulose II in the process of sulfuric acid pretreatment. Cellulose could become completely dissolved in sulfuric acid at a low temperature and high acid concentration (>62–63 wt%) [38,39]. According to our previous study [14], cellulose II nanoparticles could be directly prepared from cellulose I substrate at a restricted range of sulfuric acid treatment conditions (i.e. ≥60 wt%, 45 °C, 10–20 min). The partly or completely swollen or dissolved cellulose chains could recrystallize and form cellulose II when the acid was removed by washing. These results are also consistent with several previous studies [13,16]. The CrI of RNF-II was 73.7%, lower than that of CNF-I and MNF-II. The yield of RNF-II was 60.1%, also lower than that of CNF-I and MNF-II (Table 1). The regenerated cellulose II with a low CrI provided more space for hydronium ions to penetrate into the intermediate crystalline regions of cellulose and hydrolyze the 1, 4-glycosidic bonds in the molecular chains, resulting in a relatively low yield. However, compared to much lower cellulose II nanoparticles yield (<20 wt%) by sulfuric acid treatment of EC [14], the additional mechanical homogenization process following acid pretreatment significantly increased the production efficiency. Those under hydrolyzed cellulose II solid residue was broken apart and formed nanosized and stable RNF-II."
8,"Morphological, chemical and thermal properties of CNF allomorphs","3.2 Morphological, chemical and thermal properties of CNF allomorphs The micromorphology of CNF-I, RNF-II and MNF-II were studied by TEM and showed in Fig. 2 . CNF-I had a good dispersion and presented a rope-like structure (Fig. 2a and d). The length of CNF-I ranged from 50 to 600 nm with an average of 201.7 ± 92.8 nm, and the width ranged from 4 to 45 nm with an average of 15.0 ± 7.4 nm (Figs. S6–7, Table 1). The dimensions of CNF-I are consistent with those reported for CNFs prepared from hydrolyzed solid residue, which had a length between 50 and 400 nm [33]. CNF-I was relatively shorter and rigid possibly due to the concentrated acid hydrolysis of cellulose chains. RNF-II exhibited a twisted banded structure (Fig. 2b and e) with a wide size distribution of 50–1000 nm based on dynamic light scattering (DLS) result (Fig. S8). Cellulose dissolved during 64 wt% concentrated sulfuric acid treatment, and the structure of regenerated cellulose was distorted and deformed after washing and recrystallizing. Then the newly formed disordered regions were destroyed in high-pressure homogenization and the RNF-II was separated. TEM images indicate the RNF-II aggregated during the drying process. DLS result may reflect the aggregation state of RCNF-II in suspension. Similar to CNF-I, MNF-II also exhibited a short rod-like structure (Fig. 2c and f). The length of MNF-II ranged from 45 to 600 nm with an average of 176.7 ± 108.6 nm, slightly shorter than that of CNF-I (Fig. 2, Figs. S6–7, Table 1). The width of MNF-II ranged from 10 to 45 nm with an average width of 20.9 ± 5.9 nm, much wider than CNF-I. During the mercerization process, cellulose was swollen to form alkali-cellulose complex. At the same time, parallel molecular chains in cellulose I were transformed into antiparallel structures. After washing, the adjacent molecular chain segments with opposite polarity recrystallize to form cellulose II, which may lead to a larger diameter. The aspect ratio of MNF-II (8.5) was thus smaller than that of CNF-I (13.4). The FTIR spectra of EC, CNF-I, RNF-II, MC, and MNF-II are showed in Fig. 3a. Cellulose characteristic peaks were observed in all spectra at about 3348 (OH stretching), 2900 (CH stretching) and 1063 cm−1 (CO stretching), respectively [40]. Chemically absorbed water was found in all samples based on the intense band peak at around 1644 cm−1 signified the O − H bending [41]. The spectra of EC and CNF-I were similar while the spectra of MC and MNF-II were alike. These results confirm that the cellulose supramolecular structure retained the same when 58 wt% H2SO4 was applied at 45 °C for 30 min [17]. RNF-II prepared from cellulose I (64 wt% H2SO4, 45 °C, 10 min) exhibited similar FTIR spectrum to those of MC and MNF-II. The difference between the cellulose I and cellulose II spectra is summarized in Table 2 . Compared with EC and CNF-I, the FTIR profiles of MC, RNF-II and MNF-II had two additional weak peaks at 3499 and 3449 cm−1, corresponding to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of cellulose II [17,42]. The stretching vibration peak of CH in methyl and methylene group moved from 2902 to 2892 cm−1 [43]. The intensity of the symmetric bending vibration peak of CH2 at 1431 cm−1 became lower and shifted to a lower wave number at 1418 cm−1, indicating the new formation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the change of conformation from tg to gt of CH2OH [17,44]. The stretching vibration peak of CO at C6 became weaker and shifted from 1033 cm−1 to 1026 cm−1 [45]. The band at 899 cm−1 assigned as asymmetric stretching vibration peak of C-O-C shifted to 895 cm−1, and an absorbance increase was also observed. A decrease or even disappearance of the bands at 1115, 1063 and 710 cm−1 respectively assigned to planar stretching vibration of ring skeleton [46], CO stretching vibration at C3 and CC stretching [45], as well as C–O–H out-of-plane bending for cellulose Iβ [47] was observed. These results are strong evidences of the transformation of cellulose I into cellulose II [17,42,48] and consistent with the XRD results. The FTIR spectra of RNF-II, CNF-I and MNF-II all presented C-O-S symmetric stretch vibration at 818 cm−1, indicating the existence of C-O-SO3 [15]. The relative peak intensity decreased in the order of RNF-II, CNF-I and MNF-II. The hydroxyl groups on the cellulose chains were esterified by sulfate ions during acid hydrolysis [35]. These results indicate that RNF-II had the highest sulfate group content, while the sulfate content of MNF-II was the lowest [17]. Zeta potential and EDS measurements further supported the FTIR results (Table 1, Fig. S9, Table S1). The zeta potentials of CNF-I, RNF-II and MNF-II were −40.2, −42.6 and −26.8 mV, respectively. The sulfur content of CNF-I, RNF-II and MNF-II were 0.24, 0.41 and 0.21 at.%, respectively. In the hydrolysis process of preparing RNF-II, cellulose dissolved in 64 wt% H2SO4 at 45 °C and a homogeneous hydrolysis reaction would happen [3]. Thus, not only the hydroxyl groups on the original cellulose surface but also the newly exposed hydroxyl groups which came from the dissolution of the crystallization regions were sulfated. After the NaOH mercerization of EC, it was reported that some Na+ absorbed by MC would still remain on its surface even after washing [17]. Compared with CNF-I and RNF-II, the absolute value of zeta potentials and the electrostatic repulsion of MNF-II were reduced due to the electrostatic screening effect of cation counter ion Na+ [17]. Thus MNF-II had the lowest content of sulfate groups among the CNFs. The thermal properties of EC, MC and CNFs are showed in Fig. 3b and Table 3 . The TGA curves of all sample showed three-step mass loss including the evaporation of the adsorbed moisture, the degradation of the organic macromolecule and the charring occurred at around 30–100, 200–450 and 600 °C, respectively (Fig. 3b). The DTG curves indicated that the decomposition of EC started at around 220 °C (Tonset) and reached the maximum thermal degradation rate at 356 °C (Tmax). MC (T1: 240 °C and Tmax: 364 °C) was thermally more stable than EC resulted from its cellulose II allomorph. Compared with EC and MC, all three CNFs exhibited lower thermal stability owing to the catalytic pyrolysis of sulfates which were introduced by acid hydrolysis [15,49]. The thermal stabilities of three CNFs increased in order of RNF-II (T1: 120 °C and Tmax: 214/363 °C), CNF-I (T1: 150 °C and Tmax: 250 °C) and MNF-II (T1: 150 °C and Tmax: 260 °C). These results are consistent with the sulfur contents of three CNFs (Table 1). Specially, RNF-II regenerated from dissolution and hydrolysis of cellulose I showed two-step degradation of organic molecules. Detailly, the initial T1 was 125 °C, achieved Tmax at 214 °C, which might relate to the decomposition of regenerated and sulfated RNF-II. The second step of degradation occurred at 275 °C, and simultaneously reached their peaks at 363 °C. The position of the secondary DTG peak of RNF-II was close to the primary DTG peak of MC. Thus, this degradation stage might associate with the decomposition of interior unsulfured cellulose II crystalline regions. The crystal structure, surface charge, micromorphology and thermal properties of CNFs had significant influences on their performance. Therefore, CNF-I, RNF-II and MNF-II would show different enhancement effects on the polymer matrix."
9,Crystalline structures and micromorphology of CNF/PVA composite films,"3.3 Crystalline structures and micromorphology of CNF/PVA composite films The crystalline structure of PVA and CNF/PVA (10 wt% CNFs content) composite films was studied by XRD (Fig. 4 ). PVA is a semi-crystalline polymer and all samples showed strong PVA diffraction peaks at roughly 2θ = 19.2° [27]. In RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA, the PVA diffraction peak slightly shifted to large diffraction angle owing to the superposition of cellulose II (110) diffraction peak (2θ = 19.9°). In addition, weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.0 ( 1 1 ¯ 0 ) and 21.8° (200) could be observed in the RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA XRD profiles, evidencing the existence of cellulose II component. The CNF-I/PVA diffraction profile had weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.1 and 22.6° contributing by the ( 1 1 ¯ 0 ) and (200) crystal planes of cellulose I. These results indicate that 10 wt% CNF loading had a significant influence on PVA crystal structure that could be attributed to the formation hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals forces between the hydroxyl groups of the PVA polymer matrix and the CNFs reinforcing phase. The micromorphology of the surface and cross section of the PVA and CNF/PVA composites were investigated by SEM (Fig. S10). The surface of the pure PVA film was flat, while its fractured cross section displayed a continuous and compact hierarchical structure (Fig. S10a, b). After addition of 4 wt% CNFs, the surface of all three composite films looked rough (Fig. S10c, e and g). The fractured cross sections of the composites were rough, but no fibrous structure was protruded (Fig. S10d, f and h). This result indicates excellent interfacial compatibility between PVA and CNFs, owning to the extensive hydrogen bondings among these components, both containing abundant hydroxyl groups. CNF-I/PVA represented a relatively less heterogeneous appearance, while both RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA had radial folds that perpendicular to the surface of the cross section."
10,Tensile properties of composite films,"3.4 Tensile properties of composite films The ultimate tensile strength (Rm) and Young's modulus (E) of PVA and CNF/PVA composite films are shown in Fig. 5 . Typical stress-strain curves of all the films are shown in Fig. S11. All the samples did not break at 10% strain. It indicates that CNFs dispersed well in the polymer matrix and formed strong interfacial hydrogen bonding with PVA matrix. The Rm (76 MPa) and E (4220 MPa) of pure PVA film were markedly enhanced by CNFs. With the increase of CNF content, Rm and E of all composite films first increased and then decreased. When 4 wt% CNF-I was incorporated, the CNF-I/PVA composite film had the highest Rm of 109 MPa with 43% promotion compared to pure PVA. The E was 6836 MPa and showed 62% improvement. The maximum Rm of RNF-II/PVA (91 MPa) and MNF-II/PVA (97 MPa) increased by 20 and 28%, respectively, when the content of RNF-II or MNF-II was 2 wt%. The maximum E of RNF-II/PVA (5558 MPa) and MNF-II/PVA (6066 MPa) also increased by 32 and 44% when 4 wt% CNF was incorporated. When CNF content exceeded 6 wt%, Rm and E of the composite films decreased. These results indicate that CNFs were easy to agglomerate at high concentration and affected the enhancement effect [27].With the same CNF content, CNF-I had the best enhancement effects, while the RNF-II had the lowest. The reinforcement effects of CNFs on PVA composites related to their inner properties. According to the TEM results, CNF-I presented a long and thin rope-like structure, but MNF-II exhibited a short rod-like structure. The longest rope-like CNF-I were more easily to form continuous 3D network structure in composites, while it was hard for the shorter and wider MNF-II to link and form such structure [30]. The significant enhancement of rigidity reflecting by the Rm and E for CNF-I/PVA composites may be attributed to the formation of continuous 3D network structure in which stress transfer through CNF–CNF interactions may occur [7]. The stiffness of the CNFs and the adhesion force at the CNFs/PVA matrix interface also affected the mechanical properties of CNFs/PVA composites [30]. Crystalline cellulose I (138 GPa) has higher E than crystalline cellulose II (88 GPa) [50]. CNF-I with the highest aspect ratio (13.4) contained maximum surface hydroxyl groups, and the surface charge and sulfonic group of CNF-I was higher than MNF-II (Table 1, Fig. S9). Hence, the crystalline CNF-I (80.4%) were theoretically the strongest and the most homogeneously mixed with the PVA matrix, resulting in the highest E among three CNF composites. Although zeta potential and EDS results showed that RNF-II exhibited the highest surface charge and sulfonic groups among three CNFs, they were easy to entangle due to the twisted banded structure. The agglomerates showed the largest average size (416 nm) with the least surface hydroxyl groups (minimum specific surface area) and caused stress intensification. Thus, RNF-II had the lowest enhancement effect. These comparative tensile properties show clear association of geometry, crystal structure, and surface chemistry of CNFs with their reinforcing effects in the PVA matrix."
11,Thermal and optical properties of composite films,"3.5 Thermal and optical properties of composite films The thermal properties of PVA and CNF/PVA composite films were analyzed by DSC and TGA (Fig. 6 ). In DSC curves, the initial endothermic peak resulting from the evaporation of chemical adsorbing water appeared at 100–170 °C for all samples. Melting peaks appeared at 200–230 °C. Addition of 10 wt% CNF to the PVA matrix increased the glass transition temperature (Tg), this resulted from the strong H-bond interactions between PVA and cellulose molecular chain, as well as sulfonic group, that intensely limited the movement of PVA chain segments [27,51]. Compared with RNF-II and MNF-II, CNF-I with a relatively high aspect ratio had more surface hydroxyl group, leading to a higher Tg (CNF-I/PVA: 64 °C) at the same CNFs content. Although the aspect ratio of RNF-II was the lowest, the Tg of RNF-II/PVA (62 °C) was higher than that of MNF-II/PVA (57 °C) perhaps because of the highest sulfate content of RNF-II among three CNFs. MNF-II/PVA had the lowest Tg due to its low aspect ratio and sulfate content. However, the melting temperature (Tm) of RNF-II/PVA, CNF-I/PVA and MNF-II/PVA reduced to be 215, 217 and 219 °C, respectively, lower than that of PVA film (225 °C) (Table 4 ). The Tm of the composites decreased with increasing CNF sulfate content (Table 1). The CrI of CNFs may also impact the Tm of the composite films. Composite films contained CNFs with lower crystallinity showed relatively lower Tm. The melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of composite films (CNF-I/PVA: 51.33 Jg−1, RNF-II/PVA: 55.94 Jg−1, MNF-II/PVA: 55.72 Jg−1) were all lower than that of pure PVA film (57.55 Jg−1), consistent with a previous research [52]. The CrI of PVA was 35.75%, while the CrI of CNF-I/PVA, RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA composite films decreased to 31.88, 34.75 and 34.61%, respectively (Table 4). Formation of hydrogen bond between CNF and PVA interrupted the regular rearrangement of PVA molecular chains and reduced the crystallization of the PVA matrix [53,54]. The TGA results showed that with addition of 10 wt% CNF, the onset temperature of degradation (Tonset) for CNF-I/PVA, RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA were 267, 272 and 264 °C, and the thermal decomposition rate reached maximum (Tmax) at 354, 366 and 351 °C, respectively (Fig. 6b, Table 4). The thermal decomposition temperatures of the composites were greatly higher than those of pure PVA film (243 and 300 °C), probably due to the better thermal stability of sulfonic acid groups in CNF molecules [55]. As a drawback for PVA fabrication, the Tm of pure PVA (200–250 °C) is close to its Tonset, resulting in difficulty in hot melt processing of products with complex shape. [56,57]. The temperature windows (Tonset − Tm) for the melt processing of composites were tremendously broadened compared with pure PVA film (18 °C) (Fig. 6c). Detailly, they were widened up to 45 (MNF-II/PVA), 50 (CNF-I/PVA) and 57 °C (RNF-II/PVA), respectively, broadening with increasing CNF sulfate content. CNF plays an important role in reducing the Tm and promoted the thermal stability of PVA composites, which would benefit the effective production of PVA materials. The light transmittance of PVA film at 600 nm was 86.77%, and slightly decreased to 89.61, 89.27 and 89.10% for CNF-I/PVA, RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA, respectively (Fig. 6d). Incorporation of 4 wt% CNF had almost no influence on the transparency of the PVA films due to the similarity of refractive index between the two components, about 1.58 of cellulose vs 1.49–1.52 of PVA [25]."
12,Conclusions,"CNF-I, MNF-II and RNF-II were efficiently prepared from EC or MC by combining acid hydrolysis and mechanical treatment at 75.5, 73.0 and 60.1% yields, respectively. The allomorphism and hydrogen bonding network of the three CNFs were confirmed by XRD and FTIR. The morphology, surface chemistry, sulfate content and thermal properties of the three CNF allomorphs were characterized and compared. CNF-I and MNF-II were rope-like structure and rod-shaped with an average length of 201.7 ± 92.8 and 176.7 ± 108.6 nm, and an average width of 15.0 ± 7.4 and 20.9 ± 5.9 nm, respectively. RNF-II had a wide size distribution of 50–1000 nm, presenting a twisted banded structure. CNFs of 2–10 wt% were incorporated into PVA films as reinforcements. SEM and XRD studies demonstrated excellent interfacial compatibility between PVA and CNFs, which resulted from extensive hydrogen bondings among the components. Adding CNFs to PVA films significantly improved their tensile properties. At the same CNF loading, CNF-I/PVA showed higher tensile strength (Rm) and Young's modulus (E) than those of RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA composite films (e.g. The E of CNF-I/PVA, RNF-II/PVA and MNF-II/PVA were 6.8, 5.6 and 6.1 GPa at 4 wt% CNF loading, respectively) perhaps due to better dispersion, high aspect ratio and high modulus of CNF-I. Incorporation of CNFs into PVA films increased their glass transition temperature (Tg), onset degradation temperature (Tonset) and thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax), while decreased the melting temperature (Tm). The temperature window (Tonset − Tm) for the melt processing of PVA was only 18 °C for pure PVA and widen to 45, 50 and 57 °C for MNF-II/PVA, CNF-I/PVA and RNF-II/PVA, respectively, broadening with increasing CNF sulfate content. All CNF/PVA composite films with 4 wt% CNF contents remained excellent transparency of more than 89% transmittance at 600 nm. This work provided a general guideline in selecting the suitable CNF allomorph for fabrication of high-performance CNF/PVA composite films."
