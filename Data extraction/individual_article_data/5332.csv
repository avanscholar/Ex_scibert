0,Introduction,"Current energy sources mainly come from fossil fuels. However, the reserves of fossil fuels have been decreasing, and the combustion of fossil fuels shows negative impacts on environment because of emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and CO) resulting in global warming. There is necessity to find clean, sustainable energy sources that could substitute fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a clean and renewable energy carrier with a high energy yield of 122MJ/kg, thereby being considered as available alternative energy carrier of future (Kapdan and Kaegi, 2006). However, the major problem in utilization of hydrogen gas as a fuel is its unavailability in nature and the need for inexpensive production methods (Kapdan and Kaegi, 2006). Biologically hydrogen can be produced by the photosynthetic and fermentative routes which are more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive as compared to physicochemical processes (Kapdan and Kaegi, 2006). Biological production of hydrogen using glucose is too expensive to support economic H2 production, while making hydrogen from renewable sources (such as biomass) appears to be economically feasible. Cellulose is the major constitute of plant biomass and highly available in agricultural wastes and industrial effluents such as pulp/paper and food industry (Nowak et al., 2005; Brown and Saxena, 2000). Cellulolytic material are the largest source of hexose and pentose sugars with potential use for the production of fuel alcohol, chemicals and protein for food and feed purpose (Kuhad and Singh, 1993; Chandel et al., 2007; Herrera, 2004). In nature, cellulosic materials are degraded by the cooperation of many microorganisms. It has been reported that mixed cultures comprising cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria is ideal for degrading cellulose (Odom and Wall, 1983; Lewis et al., 1988). This bacterial community could degrade natural cellulosic materials aerobically and anaerobically without sterilization and with a high degree of stability. Microorganisms that degrade cellulosic materials and the enzymes involved (e.g. cellulase, xylanase and peroxidase) have been well studied (Fukumori et al., 1989; Hayashi et al., 1999). Several microbial related applications have been developed for textile, food and paper-pulp processing (Cherry and Fidantsef, 2003; Kirk et al., 2002; Bhat, 2000). Generation of H2 from lignocellulosic material by using dark fermentation usually requires substrate pretreatment procedures, which contribute significantly to the production cost. Therefore, it is of great demand to develop a more cost-effective and technically feasible cellulosic H2 production process. Utilization and degradation of cellulosic materials by microbes are considered very important for H2 production (Coughlan and Maye, 1992). Lay (2001) investigated the potential of producing H2 from microcrystalline cellulose using mesophilic digestion with heat shocked sludge. Liu et al. (2003) determined that mixed culture of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. produced H2 7.56mg H2/g cellulose from a 5g cellulose suspension at pH 6.5 and 55°C. The regulation of cellulolytic enzyme in bacteria has been studied in different microbial species, viz., Myrothecium verrucaria, Clostridium thermocellum and in various Cellulomonas sp. (Bhat, 2000; Golovchenko et al., 1986; Hulme and Stranks, 1971). In this study, we isolated microbial consortium and determined favorable medium in which the isolated consortium had higher efficiency in hydrolysis of a variety of cellulosic materials (namely, carboxymethyl cellulose, rice husk, bagasse and filter paper). Optimum conditions for cellulose hydrolysis (e.g., temperature, pH, agitation rate and substrate concentration) were determined. The resulting hydrolysate was used as the carbon substrate for dark fermentative H2 production using various isolated Clostridium strains known to produce H2 efficiently from sugar substrates (Lo et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2005). The knowledge obtained from this study could be used to assess the feasibility of using this two-stage (i.e., hydrolysis-fermentation) strategy for fermentative H2 production, taking cellulosic materials as the feedstock."
1,Methods,
2,The cellulose hydrolytic mixed bacterial consortium and culture medium,"2.1 The cellulose hydrolytic mixed bacterial consortium and culture medium NS sludge and QS sludge, both containing Cellulomonas sp. as identified by 16S rDNA sequence comparison (data not shown), were isolated from soil samples in southern Taiwan. Two milliliters of different soil samples were transferred to the fresh 100ml BHM medium containing CMC as the sole carbon source in 120ml sealed bottles. The culture was incubated under static condition and the controlled temperature and initial pH were 37°C and 6.2, respectively. After enrichment in CMC-amended medium for more than 5 times, 0.1ml of inoculum was transferred to the CMC agar plate stained by Congo red. Single colonies forming significant clear zone were picked up and transferred to a fresh CMC medium. The foregoing procedures were repeated at least twice to ensure that pure isolates were obtained. The mixed culture was grown on yeast extract mannitol (YEM) medium consisting of (g/l): carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 10; NaNO3, 1.0; K2HPO4, 1.0; KCl, 1.0; MgSO4, 0.5; yeast extract, 0.5. The other medium used for growing the mixed cultures was Bushnell Haas medium (BHM) consisting of (g/l): CMC, 10; MgSO4 ·7H2O, 0.2; K2HPO4, 1; KH2PO4, 1; NH4NO3, 1.0; FeCl3 ·6H2O, 0.05; CaCl2, 0.02."
3,H2-producing bacterial strains and culture medium,"2.2 H2-producing bacterial strains and culture medium Hydrogen-producing bacterial strains were isolated from effluent sludge of a continuous dark fermentation bioreactor capable of producing H2 from synthetic wastewater containing sucrose (20g COD/l) or xylose (20–40g COD/l) as the sole carbon source (Chang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004). The pure H2-producing strains were identified as Clostridium butyricum CGS2, Cl. butyricum CGS5, Cl. pasteurianum CH1, Cl. pasteurianum CH4, Cl. pasteurianum CH5, Cl. pasteurianum CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1. The detailed procedures for strain isolation and identification were described in our recent work (Chang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the bacterial isolates used in this study have been deposited in the NCBI nucleotide sequence databases under the following accession number: AY540106 (strain CGS2), AY540109 (strain CGS5), EF140980 (strain CH1), EF140981 (strain CH4), EF140982 (strain CH5), EF140983 (strain CH7), and AY540111 (strain HE1). Those pure strains were pre-cultured using sucrose (17.8g/l) as the sole carbon source."
4,Cellulose hydrolysis with the mixed bacterial consortium,"2.3 Cellulose hydrolysis with the mixed bacterial consortium The NS and QS sludge were inoculated (2% inoculum) into medium containing (10g/l) of cellulosic substrates to examine the cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. The cellulosic substrates tested were CMC obtained from Sigma (CMC-Sigma), Avicel, CMC obtained from Junsei Chemical Co. (CMC-Junsei), rice husk, filter paper (Whatmann No. 1), and sugarcane bagasse. For optimization of cellulose hydrolysis conditions, the factors influencing hydrolysis efficiency were examined. Those factors included the type of nutrient medium (YEM or BHM), the type of cellulosic materials, culture temperature, pH, agitation rate and cellulose concentration. In addition, the cell growth and hydrolysis kinetics were also determined using NS culture and BHM medium amended with CMC."
5,Fermentation medium and condition for bioH2 production,"2.4 Fermentation medium and condition for bioH2 production The medium for dark H2 fermentation with the pure cultures was (g/l): initial reducing sugar of hydrolyzed CMC-Junsei, 0.8; NH4HCO3, 6.72; NaHCO3, 5.24; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2 ·6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4 ·6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4 ·7H2O, 0.025; CuSO4 ·5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2 ·5H2O, 1.25×10−4. The culture temperature and pH was 37°C and 7.5, respectively. During the course of fermentation, cell concentration, pH, residual reducing sugar, biogas production, and soluble metabolite composition were monitored with respect to culture time."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector. The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by GC using a flame ionization detector. The detailed procedures for GC analyses were described in our recent work (Lo et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2005, 2001a; Chang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004). Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine biomass concentration. Reducing sugars were determined by using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller, 1959)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of mixed bacterial sludge and the culture medium on cellulose hydrolysis,"3.1 Effect of mixed bacterial sludge and the culture medium on cellulose hydrolysis The mixed bacterial sludge (NS sludge and QS sludge) used for cellulose hydrolysis contained mainly Cellulomonas sp. strains (data not shown). We determined the efficient mixed bacterial sludge and suitable culture medium in which maximum cellulose hydrolysis rate achieved. For this we have taken NS sludge and QS sludge in two different fermentation media YEM and BHM to investigate the effect of sludge and culture medium on cellulose hydrolysis (Fig. 1 ). When the NS sludge and the BHM medium was used to hydrolyze cellulose on static-flask incubation, the maximum reducing sugar production rate and the maximum reducing sugar production were reached. Hence, the combination of NS sludge and the BHM medium was used for following cellulose hydrolysis experiments."
9,"Effect of temperature, initial pH and agitation rate on cellulose hydrolysis","3.2 Effect of temperature, initial pH and agitation rate on cellulose hydrolysis Identification of optimum conditions, like temperature, initial pH and agitation rate, is important in increasing the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis. Thus, the effects of physical parameters (e.g., temperature (20–40°C), initial pH (4.0–10.0), and agitation rate (0–250rpm) on hydrolysis of CMC (10g/L) were determined with NS sludge under BHM medium. The maximum reducing sugar production rate and the maximum total reducing sugar production of cellulose hydrolysis were observed at 35°C, initial pH 7.0 and 100rpm agitation rate (Table 1 ). Under the foregoing optimum condition, the maximum reducing sugar production rate and the maximum total reducing sugar production was about 11.5mg/h/l and 483.1mg/l, respectively. This shows that this bacterial consortium could hydrolyze cellulose substrate under a mild condition. As most chemical hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis are usually operated under high temperatures (Mosier et al., 2005), the mesophilic bacterial cellulolytic system of this work seems to be advantageous in practical applications due to being less energy intensive."
10,Effect of carbon sources and concentration on cellulose hydrolysis,"3.3 Effect of carbon sources and concentration on cellulose hydrolysis The enzyme system originating from the cellulolytic mixed culture (e.g., NS sludge) may have different hydrolytic activity on different cellulosic materials comprising different composition of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. Hence, we determined the hydrolytic efficiency of NS sludge grown on BHM medium by taking different carbon sources (all at an initial concentration of 10g/l), including CMC-Sigma, Avicel, CMC-Junsei, rice husk, filter paper, and bagasse. Fig. 2 shows the effect of carbon sources on cellulose hydrolysis. All carbon sources could be hydrolyzed with NS sludge. However, hydrolysis of the carbon source with amorphous cellulose structure (i.e., CMC-Sigma and CMC-Junsei) exhibited high reducing sugar production rate than that with crystalline cellulose or more complex structure (i.e., avicel, rice husk, filter paper and sugarcane bagasse). Among the cellulosic materials examined, hydrolysis of CMC-Junsei gave the best hydrolysis efficiency with a maximum reducing sugar production quantity and rate of 983.7mg/l and 15.5mg/h/l, respectively. It was also observed that hydrolysis of CMC obtained from Sigma was less efficient that that of CMC obtained from Junsei. This is due probably to the difference in cellulose composition and impurity content of the two CMC products. Using the most effective cellulosic substrate (i.e., CMC-Junsei), the effect of cellulose concentration on cellulose hydrolysis was further investigated. As indicated in Fig. 3 , the reducing sugar production rate and the amount of reducing sugar produced increased when the carbon source concentration was increased from 5 to 50g/l. The maximum reducing sugar production rate (92.9mg/h/l) and the maximum reducing sugar production (5531.0mg/l) were achieved when carbon source concentration was 50g/l. The results (Fig. 3) show that there was essentially no signal of substrate inhibition on cellulose hydrolysis of CMC-Junsei when the concentration range was within 0–50g/l. The detailed kinetic characteristics of cell growth and cellulose hydrolysis are to be described in next section."
11,Kinetics of cell growth and reducing sugar production during bacterial hydrolysis,"3.4 Kinetics of cell growth and reducing sugar production during bacterial hydrolysis Information regarding the kinetics of cell growth and reducing sugar production is essential to bioreactor design and process scale-up for cellulose hydrolysis operations (Chen et al., 2001b). Unfortunately, very little work has been devoted to identifying such kinetic characteristics, especially for reducing sugar-producing bacterial hydrolysis systems. In this work, kinetic studies were conducted to provide kinetic information of bacterial growth and reducing sugar production of NS sludge, using CMC-Junsei as the carbon substrate for cellulose hydrolysis. The kinetic experiments were conducted under the optimal operation conditions of 35°C, initial pH 7.0 and 100rpm agitation. The dependence of cell growth rate of NS sludge on cellulose concentration was described by Monod-type model (Eq. (1)) indicated below (1) μ = μ max S K S + S , where μ denotes the specific growth rate (h−1), S denotes carbon substrate (CMC) concentration (g/l), μ max denotes the maximum specific growth rate (h−1), K s denotes the half-saturation constant (g/l). The estimated parameters for Monod-type model (i.e., μ max and K S,) were 0.054h−1 and 4.544g/1, respectively. This model could describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.953. In addition, the dependence of specific reducing sugar production rate on CMC concentration was also described by Michaelis–Menten (M–M) model (Eq. (2)). The model could describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.987 (2) ν = ν max S K m + S , where v represents the specific reducing sugar production rate (mg/h/gVSS), v max represents the maximum specific H2 production rate (mg/h/gVSS), K m represents the Michaelis constant (g/l). The estimated values of v max and K m from M–M model were 190.0mg/h/g VSS and 7.12g/l, respectively. It should be noted that the v max and K m values obtained here represented the apparent kinetics instead of intrinsic kinetics, because the whole cells, rather than a specific enzyme, were used as the biocatalyst. To our best knowledge, this is the first presentation revealing the details of both cell growth and reducing sugar production kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis with a bacterial consortium."
12,Dark fermentative H2 production from the cellulosic hydrolysate,"3.5 Dark fermentative H2 production from the cellulosic hydrolysate The efficiency of fermentative conversion of cellulosic hydrolysate into clean H2 energy was examined with seven H2-producing pure strains isolated from effluent sludge of high-rate H2-producing bioreactors developed in our recent work (Chang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004). The isolates were identified as Clostridium butyricum CGS2, Cl. butyricum CGS5, Cl. pasteurianum CH1, Cl. pasteurianum CH4, Cl. pasteurianum CH5, Cl. pasteurianum CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1. Fig. 4 shows bioH2 production from the CMC-Junsei hydrolysate. All the Clostridium species could use the hydrolyzed cellulose to produce H2, whereas Klebsiella sp. failed to produce H2 from the hydrolysate. With an initial reducing sugar concentration of 0.8g/l, the best H2 production and yield (obtained by Cl. pasteurianum CH7) was approximately 23.8ml/l and 1.21mmol H2/g reducing sugar (or 1.09mmol H2/g cellulose), respectively. Nguyen et al. (2007) demonstrated the H2 production in batch fermentation under thermophilic conditions by employing pure strain of Thermotoga maritima (39.8ml/l) and T. neapolitana (49.7ml/l) using cellulose as a carbon source. The production yield attained from their study was yield of 0.96 and 1.07mmol H2/g cellulose, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2007). Thus, despite operating at a mesophilic temperature, the H2 production performance of this work was similar to that obtained under thermophilic conditions (Nguyen et al., 2007). This suggests that our cellulose-to-H2 system could be more economical feasible for future large-scale applications. In addition, Table 2 also shows that the efficiency of our cellulosic H2 production system is comparable to that reported in the relevant studies, once again indicating the quality of the proposed two-stage bioH2 production process. However, it would require further optimization of bioreactor design and operation conditions to reduce the cost of bioH2 production via the sequencing hydrolysis-fermentation approach."
13,Conclusions,"Biohydrogen was produced from cellulosic feedstock using a two-stage approach, in which bacterial hydrolysis and dark fermentation were conducted in sequence. The NS sludge with BHM medium had the best hydrolysis efficiency with a total reducing sugar production of 5531mg/l and a reducing sugar production rate of 92.9mg/l/h for a CMC concentration of 50g/l under 35°C, initial pH 7.0, and 100rpm agitation. Using the cellulosic hydrolysate containing 0.8g/l reducing sugar, Cl. pasteurianum CH7 attained the best H2 production and yield of approximately 23.8ml/l and 1.21mmol H2/g reducing sugar, respectively."
