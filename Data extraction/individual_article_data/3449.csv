0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde (BzH), as an important fine chemical and intermediate in the chemical industry, is widely applied in the drug intermediate, fragrance, agrochemical industries and dye raw material [1–5]. The two commercial methods for actual production of BzH are benzal chloride hydrolysis and toluene oxidation [6,7]. Nevertheless, the former can cause serious chlorine pollution and the latter is limited by low selectivity. Recently, the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) has attracted many researchers due to its non-pollutant production and high selectivity [8–10]. Since the oxidant is essential for the oxidation reaction, a variety of oxidants have been used, such as ammonium permanganate, chromium trioxide, hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Usually, the readily desirable oxygen is used as the oxidant which only generate water as byproduct to provide an environmental-friendly oxidation process [11–14]. And at the same time, the types of catalysts also play an indispensable role in the solvent-free oxidation of BzOH. Nowadays, noble metal catalysts have drew more and more attention because of their high catalytic performance for the solvent-free oxidation of alcohols [15–19]. Among them, Au-based catalysts has been extensively studied to afford outstanding catalytic performance [20–27]. In addition, efforts have been made on Au-based materials for oxidation of alcohols, including optimization of reaction conditions and the synergistic effect between the support and Au NPs [28,29]. On the one hand, experimental studies show that alkaline conditions can greatly accelerate the oxidation of BzOH [30]. For example, Zhu et al. studied the specific effects of alkaline conditions on the oxidation reaction over Au/UiO-66 catalysts [31]. On the other hand, the synergistic effect between the support and Au NPs undoubtedly has a significant role in the reaction. For instance, Abad et al. demonstrated that the synergistic effect between Au NPs and CeO2 can efficiently induce oxidation of BzOH [28]. However, the catalysts adopted in the oxidation of BzOH is generally the Au NPs supported on the special carrier, which is prone to the loss of Au NPs during the process of preparation and reaction [32–35]. What's more, the high cost of Au and the reusability of Au-based catalyst should be taken into account, which is crucial to the development of Au-based catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols in the industry. In order to alleviate the above problems, numerous attempts have been made to encapsulate ultra-small and highly active Au NPs in novel structures to maintain their inherent cycle life [36–38]. Thereinto, the core–shell structure exhibits great superiority, which not only can give full play to the maximum advantages of the synergistic effect between shell materials and core materials, but also the outer shell can effectively prevent the loss of Au NPs. Moreover, few studies have reported the use of core–shell structure encapsulating Au NPs for solvent-free oxidation of BzOH. In this work, a unique core–shell structure was designed to encapsulate Au nanoparticles for better catalytic performance. Through the exploration of four reaction variables, this catalyst yielded 58% conversion and 82% selectivity in the reaction under the optimal operation conditions. Meanwhile, the high cycle performance made it a wide prospect in practical application."

In a typical process, solution A was obtained by mixing 30 ml of ethanol and 7.0 ml of ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, 28%). Meanwhile, 30 ml of ethanol and 3.4 ml of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) were mixed to get solution B. Solution B was dripped to solution A under mechanical stirring.

Then 0.1 g of the SCNH2 was ultrasonically dispersed in 75 ml of deionized water. After that, the above solution was added with trisodium citrate (1.2 ml, 40 mg/ml) and HAuCl4 (0.36 ml, 10 mg/ml) under stirring for 30 min. In the end, 4 ml of a freshly-prepared sodium borohydride (NaBH4 40 mg/ml) solution was injected.

8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The detailed synthesis process of catalyst was depicted in Scheme 1 . Firstly, SiO2 spheres, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and urea were mixed in distilled water and ultrasonic treatment was carried out to form uniform dispersion. In this process, the Co2+ ions in Co(NO3)2·6H2O are advantageously bonded to the negatively charged O atoms in the SiO2 sphere by electrostatic interaction. As the temperature increases, the following reactions occurred: (1) CO(NH2)2 + H2O → CO2 + 2NH3 (2) NH3 + H2O → NH4 + + OH− (3) 2Co2+ + 2OH− +CO2− → Co2(OH)2CO3 SiO2@Co2(OH)2CO3 is formed under the action of urea, and then SC is formed by one-step calcination [40]. Secondly, Au nanoparticles were supported on the surface of Co3O4 by the strong force of NH3 group for Au. Lastly, an m-SiO2 layer was loaded on the outermost layer to prevent the loss of Au particles and form a complete core–shell structure. SEM was applied to observe the morphology of the prepared sample. As the base material, the SiO2 spheres had a smooth surface and a uniform size of about 300 nm (Fig. 1 (a)). It is worth mentioning that silica is widely used as the raw material for core–shell structure due to its unique mechanical strength and structural characteristics, as well as its easy surface functionalization [41–43]. By simple precipitation method, cyclonic Co3O4 was grown in-sith on the SiO2 (Fig. 2 (b)). The specific morphology of Co3O4 was further observed using TEM with the successful preparation of Co3O4 with SiO2 as a template (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). Though the tremendous attraction of the NH3 group, the Au nanoparticles were tightly supported on the surface of Co3O4 (Fig. 1(e) and (f)). Especially, this whirlwind-like unique structure provided a broad load area for Au nanoparticles. The m-SiO2 acted as the outermost shell and gave a major role in protecting the loss of Au nanoparticles (Fig. 1(g)). Through HRTEM images (Fig. 1(h)), we found that the crystal plane spacing was 0.24 nm and 0.20 nm, which was attributed to Au (111) and (200) and also explained the plane-centered cubic structure of Au nanoparticles [34]. XRD measurement was performed to measure the crystal structure of the catalysts (Fig. 2). The broad peak at about 22 ° can be attributed to the amorphous form of SiO2. Noticeably, this peak disappeared during the preparation of the core–shell structure because it was wrapped inside, but this peak was displayed again after the load of m-SiO2. The peaks at 31.20°, 36.90°, 44.89°, 59.55° and 65.48° were attributed to the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystal planes respectively (JCPDS no. 43–1003), which suggests the successful preparation of Co3O4 [39]. There have an interesting phenomenon that compared with of SCAumS, the Co3O4 peaks at 36.90 of SCAu is weaker. The reason may be that after 550 °C calcination, Co3O4 crystallinity rise further. The fcc gold peak at 38.26° is associated with the (111) lattice pattern (JCPDS No. 65-2870). The XRD patterns and the above work confirm the successful preparation of SCAumS. The chemical composition and surface electronic state of SCAumS were investigated by XPS measurements. To this regard, the survey spectrum clearly shows five elements (Au, Si, C, O, Co) (Fig. 3 (a)), which to some extent indicates the successful preparation of the catalysts. The Au 4f spectrum displays two prominent peaks around 87.9 and 84.1 eV attributed to Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2, respectively (Fig. 3(b)), which indicates that the Au ion has been successfully reduced to Au0 [34]. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum revealed spin-splitting in the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 components, which corresponded to the binding energy of 795.88 and 780.92 eV, respectively (Fig. 3(c)). Specially, two fitting peaks in the Co 2p3/2 with the binding energies of Co3+ and Co2+appeared at 780.61 and 782.53 eV. Noticeably, two additional peaks located at 787.92 and 803.73 eV, which are important features to prove the crystal phase of Co3O4 [44, 45]. Since SCAumS contains a large part of oxygen element, the strong peak of 533.42 eV can be attribute oxygen atoms in SiO2 and Co3O4 (Fig. 3(d)). N2 physisorption analysis was performed to further research the surface area and porosity of as-synthesized SC and SCAumS. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the SC of specific surface area is 126.57 m2 g−1, which indicates that the cyclonic Co3O4 provides extensive load points for Au particles. It is worth noting that there is no obvious pore size distribution in this structure, so the strong force between NH3 group and Au particle must be adopted to evenly distribute it on the surface of Co3O4. Meanwhile, the absorption–desorption isotherms of SCAumS showed unique type IV modes with an H3 hysteresis loop and the P/Po range is 0.4–1.0, which proved the mesoporous properties of the prepared catalyst (Fig. 4(b)). The calculation in view of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method proved that the Material had a surface area of 42.81 m2 g−1. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution curve demonstrated that in addition to the outermost mesopores, there are some large pore size distributions in the prepared materials, which provides favorable conditions for the reactants and products to enter and exit the catalyst [46–48]."
10,Catalytic activity test,"3.2 Catalytic activity test From the perspective of green and economic chemistry, oxygen was used as the oxidant to selectively oxidize BzOH under the mildest and solvent-free conditions. Meanwhile, K2CO3 was added to provide alkaline conditions, which facilitated the hydrogen evolution during the alcohol oxidation and thereby accelerated the reaction. In view of our experimental results, BzH was the main product and benzyl benzoate (BzB) was the only by-product. Scheme 2 reveals the specific reaction path of BzOH. Then the optimum conversion and selectivity of the reaction were explored by investigating the dosage of catalyst, reaction temperature, reaction time and oxygen flow rate. 3.2.1 Effect of catalyst dosage For this particular reaction, its selectivity and conversion rate with catalyst amount as the only variable were depicted in Fig. 5 . When the amount of catalyst was zero, the conversion was only 1%, indicating the catalyst was a key factor in the reaction. Noticeably, the conversion added from 25% to 65% after the catalyst dosage was raised from 10 to 50 mg. The reason was that the increased amount of the catalyst provided more active sites and thereby sped up the reaction of selective BzOH oxidation. However, as the conversion increased, the selectivity decreased accordingly. The variation of selectivity and conversion rate was considered comprehensively, the optimal catalyst amount was set at 40 mg. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature Fig. 6 exhibits the change of conversion and selectivity in the reaction at different reaction temperatures (100–180 °C). Since the oxidation reaction of BzOH is endothermic, the temperature rise benefits the reaction progress. Particularly, the conversion added from 35% to 61% when the temperature rose from 100 to 180 °C. However, higher temperatures further promoted the oxidation of BzH, reducing the selectivity. When the temperature rose from 160 to 180 °C, the conversion of benzyl alcohol did not change much (58% vs 61%), but its selectivity decreased much (82% vs 74%). Based on the above analysis, the optimum reaction temperature was considered to be 160 °C. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction time The change of catalyst performance with different reaction time was shown in Fig. 7 . The conversion and selectivity at 2 h were 29% and 91%, respectively, and were 62% and 73% at 10 h, respectively. The prolonging of reaction time did not unexpectedly increase the conversion, but the side reaction also decreased selectivity over time. After 6 h, the BzOH conversion did not change significantly. However, the selectivity has declined markedly. Therefore, the best reaction time was 6 h. 3.2.4 Effect of O2 flow rate The results of selectivity and conversion corresponding to different oxygen flow rates are shown in Fig. 8 . When the oxygen flow rate increased from 20 to 60 ml/min, the BzOH conversion rate linearly increased. However, when the O2 flow rate further rose to 80 ml/min, the conversion rate decreased. The reason was that the oxygen was flowing too fast to normally contact with the active sites. The conversion rate and selectivity were optimized at the oxygen flow rate of 60 ml/min. 3.2.5 Durability of the catalysts Durability, a key factor in evaluating the practical application of catalysts, was evaluated through cycle experiments. The used catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and dried for the next experiment. No significant change was found in BzOH conversion or BzH selectivity during the 5 cycles (Fig. 9 ). Meanwhile, the morphology of used catalyst was tested (Fig. 10 ), we can see that the unique core–shell structure has not been destroyed and Au nanoparticles have no obvious loss. At the same time, it can be seen from Table 1 that there is no significant loss of Au content before and after the catalytic experiment (1.61 vs 1.58 wt%). This result indicates the unique core–shell structure acted a significant effect in preventing the loss of gold nanoparticles. Therefore, this type of catalysts has great prospects for large-scale industrial applications. The as-prepared catalysts for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol were compared with other noble metal catalysts and the result was shown in Table 2 . It is worth noting that comparing our results with the literature on various catalysts is a relatively difficult task due to the composition of different catalysts and the conditions under which the reactions are carried out. However, we can see that SCAumS catalyst owned comparable and even superior performance than other catalysts. It's worth noting that most of the catalysts used for this reaction are precious metal particles supported on a specific carrier, so the loss of precious metal particles may occur after the reaction, which reduces the cycling performance of the catalyst. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the core–shell structure design can minimize the loss of Au particles in this work, so that the catalyst has a good industrial application prospect. 3.2.6 The reaction mechanism Based on test results, a possible mechanism underlying the selective oxidation of BzOH in this system was proposed. Under alkaline and aerobic conditions, BzOH contacted with the catalyst, which led to the conversion of 58% BzOH and the selectivity of 82% BzH (Fig. 11 ). Since Co3+ and Co2+ coexist in Co3O4, this makes it have outstanding oxygen spillover capability. Co3+ was reduced to Co2+ and the lattice oxygen atom was transferred to benzyl alcohol to form carbocation intermediate; then, the carbocation intermediate removed the alcoholic H, which bonded to the Au nanoparticle surface through O atoms in this process. In the presence of O2, the reduced Co2+ is reoxidized to Co3+, thus supplementing the lattice oxygen from the oxygen supply. It is the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and Au that ensures the continuous oxidation process of benzyl alcohol [49,50]. It's worth noting that the basicity provided hydroxide, which was beneficial to the departure of H atoms, thereby accelerating the reaction [31]. Meanwhile, the specific path of selective BzOH oxidation also was depicted in Fig. 11. As far as we know, the selective BzOH oxidation involves four main competitive reactions, including Dehydrogenation (DH), Hydrogenolysis (HL), Disproportionation (DP), and Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH). Because BzB is the only by-product, we mainly consider DH and ODH. In the DP, BzH results from a one-step reaction after the active material contacts with the Au nanoparticles. Notably, oxygen is not involved in the process. However, BzOH removes two hydrogens into BzH with the help of oxygen by two-step reaction in ODH. Since oxygen is a key factor in the reaction, ODH is dominant compared with DH [51–54]."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the SCAumS catalysts with cyclone-shaped Co3O4 as the core and m-SiO2 as the shell were successfully prepared for liquid phase oxidation of BzOH to BzH. The unique structure of Co3O4 provided a broad loading point for Au NPs and m-SiO2 played an indispensable role in preventing the loss of Au particles, which all were beneficial to increasing the catalytic activity. It was found that the optimum reaction conditions were explored as 40 mg catalyst amount, 60 ml/min oxygen flow rate, 160 °C reaction temperature and 6 h reaction time, and conversion of 58% and selectivity of 82% were attained under the optimal operation conditions. What's more, the catalysts exhibited excellent durability and reusability in the recycling experiments, which are critical to the industrial use in the future. Surprisingly, our work may provide a new synthetic strategy for noble metal catalysts with core–shell structure applicating in the specific organic reactions."
