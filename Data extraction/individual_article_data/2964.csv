0,Introduction,"Water pollution due to industrial development is a serious issue in the field of environmental protection. The discharge of untreated wastewater into water bodies introduces chemical pollutants that have harmful effects on public health and ecology (Zainorizuan et al., 2017). Two strategies are used for removal of these pollutants, one is by a self-degradation method under irradiation (Wu, 2015), and the other is using an external material such as adsorbents (Abdulrahman Oyekanmi et al., 2019; Adeleke et al., 2017) and catalysts (Bai et al., 2019; Eisa et al., 2017) to remove the contaminants. In recent years, catalytic technologies have emerged to be promising, efficient, reliable, and economic for the elimination of organic contaminants. The use of cheap and earth-abundant base metals in catalytic processes, instead of expensive precious metals (Pd, Au, Ag … etc.), is a major objective in industrial applications. Copper-based nanomaterials (Cu, CuO, Cu2O, … etc.) represent an interesting class of the catalytic components due to their largely accessible surface areas and superb quantum effects (Wang et al., 2017). Among Copper-based nanomaterials, Cu2O-based nanocomposites show efficient catalytic performance in a wide category of industrial processes and water treatment fields, such as oxidation of CO (Wei et al., 2018), reduction of 4-nitrophenol (Sasmal et al., 2016), Pd-free coupling and oxidation reactions (Kar and Srivastava, 2019), and photocatalytic degradation of CO2 (Wan et al., 2019). Several approaches were described for the synthesis of Cu2O-based nanocomposites. A nanoporous Cu/Cu2O membrane was derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the continuous catalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) (Bai et al., 2019). Covalent organic frameworks were used to grow and stabilize the Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles which showed high catalytic performance for Glaser−Hay heterocoupling reactions (Chakraborty et al., 2019). The solvothermal method was used to produce Cu2O for the catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) (Sun et al., 2010). Muthukumaran et al. used the sonochemical method for the preparation of Cu2O nanoparticles for the photocatalytic degradation of malachite green (MG) and 4-NP under the visible light (Muthukumaran et al., 2020). Different morphologies of Cu2O were synthesized via a surfactant-free pathway and used as a Fenton-like reagent in catalytic degradation of organic pollutants (Kang et al., 2019). Zhang et al. developed a high-frequency electromagnetic field-assisted ball milling process to produce Cu2O nanoparticles to degrade rhodamine B, phenol red, and methyl orange dyes (Zhang et al., 2020). These studies have illuminated the way to understand the chemical and physical properties of Cu2O nanoparticles and have shown their outstanding catalytic properties, especially in wastewater disposal operations. However, the actual applications of these nanomaterials in the fields of catalysis are obstructed by many environmental and economic obstacles; (1) the preparation methods include the use of expensive and/or hazardous chemicals which represent a source of high contamination during the preparation, washing, and purification of the nanomaterials, (2) the preparation methods were carried out in multi-step reactions and might use complicated apparatuses adding an additional cost to the whole process, (3) the nanocatalysts have very high surface energy; makes it prone to instability issues in aqueous catalytic medium i.e. it suffers from shape change, size growth, aggregations, and/or agglomerations reducing its catalytic activity, and (4) the separation and recovery methods of the nanomaterials from the reacting solution are mainly decantation, centrifugation, filtration (Yang et al., 2013), magnetic separation, and precipitation by the pH change. These methods may be inappropriate in case of dealing with huge amounts of wastewater. Also, the nanosize of the particles may lead to catalyst loss, filter blocking, and energy/time-consuming processes. Therefore, there is an imperative need to develop and design preparation routes that use eco-friendly precursors and prevent or even minimize the release of toxicants to the environment. If these methods include the production of the nanocatalyst in such a way that provides an easy, effective, and inexpensive way for the catalyst recovery and separation, it will be attractive to the researchers, and industrialists for innovative catalysis research and applications. The present study demonstrated a facile and environmentally route to prepare Cu2O nanoparticles within biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix using gallic acid (GA) (Scheme 1 ). GA played a dual role where it acted as a reducing agent for the reduction of Cu2+ ions and as a crosslinking agent for the PVA matrix. GA is a naturally-occurring phenolic compound that existed in a wide category of plants, showing health-promoting effects. The environmental and industrial requirements are satisfied through this one-step protocol. Environmentally, the use of copper (earth-abundant and non-noble), PVA (biocompatible polymer), and GA (naturally occurring resource) will ensure the sustainable and clean production pathway. The proposed preparation route avoids pollution emission rather than cleaning it after creation. Industrially, the simplicity and the low pricing of the catalyst preparation as well as the efficient separation and recycling processes meet the economic requirements of the real applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite as free-standing film,"2.1 Preparation of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite as free-standing film In this work, preparation of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite was carried out by the solvent casting method. Typically, 100 μL of 1 M copper(II) chloride dihydrate solution (CuCl2⋅2H2O, S.d. Fine-Chem. Ltd) was added to 10 mL of 6% aqueous solution of PVA (Carl Roth, Germany, Mw = 31,000 g/mol), under stirring at 450 rpm and 25 °C, to reach a final metal concentration of approximately 10−2 M. Subsequently, 250 μL of 0.15 M methanolic solution of gallic acid (GA, Oxford Laboratory Reagent, India) was added with continuous stirring. The color of the reacting solution was changed rapidly (within 3 min) to reddish-brown and the reaction was continued under stirring for additional 30 min to ensure completion. The PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite solution was cast onto a Petri dish and left to dry at ambient conditions. The control films of PVA and PVA/GA were prepared in the same way for the sake of comparison. The polymeric films were stripped and collected as free-standing films."
3,Swelling and gel fraction determination,"2.2 Swelling and gel fraction determination The PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite films were cut into small pieces and weighed (W0). The film pieces were then immersed in deionized water for different time periods (from 5 to 100 min) at 25 °C. The swollen films were taken out from water and weighed again (W1) after wiping off the excess water on the surface using a bloating paper. The swelling percentage of the composite films was determined by employing the following relation (Dilshad et al., 2019): (1) Swelling % = 100 × ( W 1 − W o / W o ) Thereafter, the films were placed in an oven (at 40 °C) until a constant weight was obtained (W2). The gel (%) was then determined using the following relation: (2) Gel % = 100 × ( W 2 / W o )"
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The UV/visible absorption spectra in the spectral range 200–1000 nm were recorded using a Jasco V-630 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. To determine the crystalline structure of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was recorded using a Schimadzu 6000 (Japan) diffractometer. The nickel filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation was used in a range of 5–80° at 40 kV, step size = 0.02° and a step time = 5 s/step. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were taken to examine the size and shape of the prepared nanocomposite using a JEOL-JEM-1011 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The TEM images were obtained by dissolving the nanocomposite film in 50% aqueous DMSO at 60 °C and dropping an aliquot on a carbon-coated copper grid. The atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis was carried out (in tapping mode) using a Nanosurf AG, Switzerland instrument. Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer of the type Jasco FT/IR 6100 was employed to demonstrate the structural properties of the PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were used to illustrate the thermal stability of the nanocomposite using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Seiko, EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 6300) instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1."
5,Catalytic performance of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film,"2.4 Catalytic performance of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film 2.4.1 Catalytic oxidative degradation of dyes with H2O2; Fenton-like reaction The synthesized PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite was used as a catalyst in Fenton-like reaction for the oxidative degradation of methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG) at ambient temperature (25 °C). 3 mL of the reacting solution was prepared from 2.7 mL of 0.5 mM MB (8 × 10−2 mM of MG), 0.3 mL of H2O2 (final concentration 0.5 M). Thereafter, 0.05 g of the nanocatalyst film was immersed into the reacting solution and the degradation process was monitored by a UV/vis spectrophotometer during the reaction. 2.4.2 Catalytic reductive degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and reactive red (RR) dye The reductive degradation of 4-NP and RR with NaBH4 was catalyzed using PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film. 3.1 mL of the reacting solution was prepared from 2.7 mL of 0.08 mM 4-NP (or 0.75 × 10−2 mM of RR), and 0.4 mL of NaBH4 (final concentration of 2 mM). Thereafter, 0.03 g of the nanocatalyst film was immersed into the reacting solution and the degradation process was monitored by a UV/vis spectrophotometer during the reaction. The kinetics of these catalytic reactions can be defined by the following relation: (3) ln ( C t /C o ) = − k app t where Ct and Co are concentration of the organic pollutant at time t, and 0, respectively. kapp is the rate constant, and t is the reaction time."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural analysis,"3.1 Structural analysis One of the most important characteristics of transition metals is their ability to form colored compounds due to the change of their oxidation states. This enabled the tracking of the changes that occurred as a result of the interaction of Cu2+ ions with PVA and GA by the naked eye. The blue color of CuCl2 remained unchanged after addition to the PVA solution, even after several days i.e. PVA is unable to alter the oxidation state of the Cu2+ ions. Upon the addition of GA solution, the reacting solution (PVA/CuCl2) showed a remarkable color change from blue to reddish-brown. The color of Cu2O nanoparticles varied between yellow, brown, and red according to their size as well as the preparation pathway (Wang et al., 2015). The UV/vis spectra further confirmed the above visual observations. Fig. 1 a displayed the UV/vis spectra of PVA/CuCl2 before and after the addition of GA. It could be seen that PVA/CuCl2 solution displayed a broad and weak absorption peak centered at 790 nm which is attributed to the electronic d–d transitions of the Cu2+ species (Pestryakov et al., 2004). After the addition of GA, the UV/vis spectrum showed an absorption peak at 430 nm which is the characteristic for Cu2O particles (Bai et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2006). The XRD pattern was used to confirm the formation of Cu2O nanoparticles within PVA matrix. The XRD patterns of naked PVA and PVA/Cu2O films were displayed in Fig. 1b. The XRD of naked PVA is dominated with broad and diffused halo centered at 2θ = 22° which indicates the semi-crystalline structure of the PVA matrix (Eisa et al., 2017). The XRD pattern of PVA/Cu2O shows three new diffraction peaks in addition to the already existing ones of the naked PVA. The three diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 29, 36, and 43° which corresponded to the crystalline planes (110), (111), and (200), respectively. These XRD peaks are well matched with JCPDS No. 05–0667 of the cubic Cu2O crystalline structure (Su et al., 2019). The reduced intensity, and disappearance of some XRD peaks (such as those at 2θ = 61, 73, and 77°) were attributed to the presence of PVA chains which masks the presence of Cu2O nanoparticles, peak broadening due to nano-size nature, and/or the low concentration of the Cu2O nanoparticles (De Silva et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Yeniova Erpek et al., 2016). The crystalline size of Cu2O nanoparticles can be determined from the broadening of the XRD peaks using the Debye-Scherrer formula (Seoudi et al., 2012): (4) D = 0.9 λ / β cos θ where ‘D’ is crystallite diameter, ‘λ’ is the X-ray wavelength (=1.545 Å), ‘β’ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians, and ‘θ’ is the angle of diffraction peak. The crystalline size of Cu2O nanoparticles was estimated to be ≈ 15 nm. Fig. 1c exhibited the FTIR spectra of PVA, PVA/GA, and PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite films. The –OH stretching vibration of the PVA chain at 3330 cm−1 (Eisa et al., 2017) became stronger and broader in PVA/GA and PVA/Cu2O samples. This suggested that the (-OH) groups of PVA may interact with the carboxylic (-OH) groups of GA through intra- and intermolecular H-bonding which is responsible for the broadening of the hydroxyl region. Thanyacharoen et al. attributed this phenomenon to the crosslinking reaction between PVA and GA (Thanyacharoen et al., 2018). The spectral range (1760-1500 cm−1) showed considerable structural changes. The naked PVA and PVA/GA samples displayed two peaks at 1712 and 1649 cm−1 which were assigned as the stretching vibrations of (CO) and (CC) of the PVA matrix (Eisa et al., 2017). For PVA/Cu2O sample, these two peaks were replaced with three IR peaks at 1692, 1653, and 1613 cm−1. This indicated that Cu2O nanoparticles were formed within the PVA matrix through a complexation reaction that could alter the energy of (CO) and (CC) bonds. The appearance of two new IR signals at 1555 and 1541 cm−1, upon the addition of GA to the PVA matrix, were attributed to the stretching vibration of (CC) of the aromatic ring (Luzi et al., 2019). These two IR bands appeared in PVA/Cu2O without considerable change. Meanwhile, the characteristic IR peak of the Cu2O at 623 cm−1 cannot be detected. This might be attributed to the presence of thick PVA film which masked the Cu2O IR peak. The AFM imaging was used to examine the surface morphology of the as-prepared PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film. The obtained image showed that the Cu2O nanoparticles were mainly quasi-spherical in shape without observable agglomerations (Fig. 2 a). This was attributed to the role of PVA as a dispersing and capping agent that significantly stabilized the prepared Cu2O nanoparticles. The Cu2O nanoparticles seemed to be well distributed throughout the PVA film. The TEM image of Cu2O nanoparticles, reduced by GA and stabilized by PVA, was displayed in Fig. 2b. The results revealed that the nanoparticles had spherical shapes. Fig. 2b (inset) showed the respective particle-size distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles which is determined by measuring the sizes of certain amounts of them. The size distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles was varied from 10 to 25 nm, in that, 91% of the nanoparticles were 10–19 nm in sizes whereas about 8% were 22–25 nm i.e. most of Cu2O nanoparticles had the same size whereas very few particles had size above 20 nm. The obtained nanoparticles were not highly monodispersed but appeared to be free from aggregations and/or agglomerations as concluded from AFM image. The particle size of Cu2O nanoparticles determined from the TEM analysis is nearly consistent with that calculated from XRD pattern. The thermal stability of PVA, PVA/GA, and PVA/Cu2O films was studied through the TGA technique. Fig. 2c displayed the thermal degradation characteristic of the investigated films. It could be seen that the thermal degradation showed two different stages. The first stage, occurred from 25 to 180 °C, with 15, 13, and 10% weight loss for PVA, PVA/GA, and PVA/Cu2O, respectively. This weight loss was attributed to the evaporation of bonded water. The major decomposition step occurred during the heating from 200 to 650 °C, where 80, 72, and 59% weight loss was observed for PVA, PVA/GA, and PVA/Cu2O, respectively. The melting point of PVA is ≈ 220–245 °C). The heating of PVA above 200 °C led to the cleavage of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, elimination of the side groups, and decomposition of the molecular structure of the PVA chains. Finally, the weight loss of polymeric films was terminated leaving a residue of 19, 25, and 38% for PVA, PVA/GA, and PVA/Cu2O, respectively. The higher residue weight of PVA/Cu2O was due to the presence of Cu2O which is highly stable in this heating range. The thermal degradation rate of PVA is faster than that of PVA/GA on heating from 25 to 245 °C. This might be attributed to the bonding (crosslinking) between the PVA chains and the aromatic polyphenol GA. This improved the thermal stability of PVA because the inserted aromatic rings are more thermally stable than the (-OH) groups on PVA chains. As a result, the elimination of (-OH) groups was resisted during thermal degradation(Chuysinuan et al., 2018). It could be concluded that the GA acted as a crosslinking agent for the PVA matrix (Yoon et al., 2017). The thermal degradation rate of PVA/GA is slower than that of PVA/Cu2O on heating from 25 to 245 °C. This might be attributed to the surface interactions between PVA and Cu2O nanoparticles which enhance the heat distribution through the polymer chains and accelerating the degradation rate of loosely bonded water and volatile components (Ali et al., 2019). However, on heating from 245 to 800 °C, the degradation rate of PVA/GA is faster than that of PVA/Cu2O. This could be understood in terms of forming hydrogen and/or covalent bonds between PVA and Cu2O nanoparticles i.e. increasing the adhesion between polymeric chains and nanoparticle surface leading to improvement of the thermal stability(Bikiaris, 2011). The FTIR data indicated the presence of (CC) of the GA within the polymeric matrix. Also, the TGA data showed the enhanced thermal stability of PVA/GA and PVA/Cu2O as compared with the naked PVA. Hence, the two techniques gave evident signs for the crosslinking of the PVA matrix. The straightforward method to confirm and measure the crosslinking degree is by the swelling of the PVA within distilled water. Fig. 2d showed the calculated swelling ratio% and gel% of PVA/Cu2O film as functions of immersion time. It should be noted that the naked PVA was completely dissolved in water after 15 min. The swelling ratio% increased markedly within the first 30 min of the immersion reaching 460% and then it leveled off without a considerable increase. The molecular structure of PVA is rich with (-OH) groups that facilitate the water sorption within the dehydrated PVA/Cu2O film (Rynkowska et al., 2019). When PVA/Cu2O film is in contact with water, the water molecules interact with the (-OH) groups of PVA and diffuses into the polymeric film which swells until equilibrium is attained. The gel% did not show a considerable decrease for more than 2 h after the beginning of immersion. After 60 min, the gel% decreased by 1.5% i.e. the PVA/Cu2O film has good stability against dissolution in water after 100 min of immersion. The insolubility of the PVA/Cu2O film was attributed to the induced crosslinking through H-bonding between PVA and GA."
8,The mechanism of in situ growth of Cu2O within PVA using GA,"3.2 The mechanism of in situ growth of Cu2O within PVA using GA In the proposed reaction, water-soluble PVA was mixed with an aqueous solution of CuCl2 displaying pale blue color. The pale blue colored-solution of PVA/Cu2+ was retained without considerable change even after several days, indicating that the PVA cannot act as a reducing agent for Cu2+ ions with its free hydroxyl groups. After the addition of GA, the solution of PVA/Cu2+ changed its color rabidly to a reddish-brown indicating the in-situ formation of Cu2O nanoparticles. GA is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound obtained from a diverse variety of plants and fruits such as green tea, oak bark, nuts, catechin derivatives, and red wine (Luzi et al., 2019). GA, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, has one carboxyl group and three hydroxyl groups. GA is suggested to have high reducing power due to the presence of the three hydroxyl groups as well as the ability of straightforward copolymerization via the carboxyl group (van Lith and Ameer, 2016). The biological origin, reducing potential, and copolymerization ability give the GA the key role in the fabrication of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite. Firstly, GA acts as a reducing agent converting Cu2+ into Cu1+. It had been reported that GA reacted with Cu2+ ions via redox reaction where Cu2+ was reduced to Cu1+ whereas GA was oxidized to semiquinone and then to quinone (Luo et al., 2013; Severino et al., 2011). Secondly, GA acts as a crosslinking agent for the PVA matrix thereby the carboxyl groups of GA reacted with the hydroxyl group of PVA to form a rigid polymeric framework. The FTIR, TGA, and swelling analysis indicated that bi-functional GA effectively crosslinked PVA matrix. This leads to three main advantages; (1) the conversion of PVA into a solubility-resistant matrix, (2) fixing the Cu2O nanoparticles inside the polymeric matrix, and (3) GA acid is cheap, abundant, naturally occurring and non-toxic reagent replacing the traditional reducing, capping, and crosslinking agents i.e. it fulfills the requirements of green and sustainable development. Consequently, the solubility resistance of PVA/Cu2O, as well as tight fixation of the Cu2O nanoparticles within PVA chains, initiate the use of the PVA/Cu2O film in catalytic degradation of organic water pollutants."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.3 Catalytic activity 3.3.1 The catalytic oxidation of MB on PVA/Cu2O in the presence of H2O2; Fenton-like reaction The decolorization of MB through catalytic oxidation is routinely monitored by following the decreasing intensity of the peak at 665 (π–π∗ electronic transitions) using UV/vis spectroscopy (Zayed et al., 2015). To understand the catalytic oxidation of MB using (PVA/Cu2O+H2O2) system, this reaction was surveyed once in the absence of a catalyst (PVA/Cu2O) and once in absence of oxidizing agent (H2O2) (Fig. S2). It was observed that no major change in the color of MB was observed unless both PVA/Cu2O and H2O2 were added to the dye solution. Fig. 3 a displayed a regular decay in the intensity of the peak at 655 nm of the dye with time. The color was completely transformed from blue to colorless in 35 min, indicating the completion of the catalytic reaction. Hence, Cu2O nanoparticles are efficient catalyst for the oxidation of MB based on their nano size and larger surface area. The decreased intensity of the peak at 655 nm is directly related to the concentration decrease of MB i.e. the catalytic oxidation reaction follows a 1st order model in the presence of a large excess concentration of H2O2. Fig. 3a (inset) showed the relation of ln(At/A0) vs the reaction time of the catalytic oxidation. It was noted that an induction period (bout 6–10 min) was required before the oxidation process was initiated. The heterogeneous catalytic reactions mostly exhibit an induction period before initiation i.e. time is needed to activate the catalytic reaction after all the reactants are brought in contact together. Different factors can affect the induction period: the competition between the reactants and dissolved oxygen, reactant diffusion and adsorption to the catalyst surface, and injection of electrons from reducing/oxidizing agent to the catalyst surface (Li et al., 2015). Herein, the induction period was consistent with that required for the beginning of swelling (see Fig. 2d). Hence, it could be concluded that the induction time is required for the swelling of PVA matrix to allow the diffusion and adsorption of the reactants (MB and H2O2) onto the surface of Cu2O nanoparticles. To confirm this assumption, the PVA/Cu2O film was soaked first within distilled water for 20 min to allow swelling of PVA and then it used in the catalytic process. It was observed that the decolorization of MB was started immediately after immersion of PVA/Cu2O film within the reacting solution. Hence, the pre-swelled PVA/Cu2O film was used in all subsequent catalytic tests. The effect of different PVA/Cu2O dosages (from 0.01 to 0.05 g) on the reaction rate was determined at (pH = 3.5, [MB] = 8 mg/L, and [H2O2] = 0.5M) (Fig. 3b). The calculated values of the apparent pseudo 1st order rate constant (kapp) are listed in Table 1 . The catalytic oxidation rate of MB increased significantly with the increase in the PVA/Cu2O dosage. This was ascribed to the availability of more reactive sites (larger surface area) of Cu2O where the reactants (MB and H2O2) were adsorbed and the electron transfer was occurred (Khan et al., 2020) i.e. the excess catalyst accelerated the generation of active hydroxyl radicals (HO•) which are responsible for the oxidation of MB (Sun et al., 2018). Based on these findings, the 0.05 g dosage of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite was selected for the subsequent catalytic test. The effect of varying the concentration of MB (0.25–1.25 mM) on the kapp was evaluated at (pH = 3.5, PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.05 g, and [H2O2] = 0.5 M) and displayed in Fig. 3c. It was found that the value of kapp increased from 2.35 × 10−3 to 3.05 × 10−3 sec−1 with an increasing concentration of MB from 0.25 to 0.75 mM and then it decreased to 1.78 × 10−3 sec−1 with the further increase of MB concentration to 1.25 mM (Table 1). As the concentration of MB increased, there was an increased probability of collision between reactants (MB and H2O2) which in turn accelerated the catalytic oxidation reaction (Javaid and Qazi, 2019). On the further increase of MB concentration, most of the active sites of Cu2O surface were occupied by the MB species preventing and/or minimizing the generation of sufficient (HO•) radicals. This reduced the rate of catalytic oxidation process(Singh et al., 2017). The Fenton reaction is a pH-dependent process where the pH value regulates the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The catalytic oxidation of dyes using Fenton and/or Fenton-like pathway is favored in an acidic medium (Duarte and Madeira, 2010; Fernandes et al., 2018). The effect of varying the pH value in kapp of the catalytic oxidation of MB at (PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.05 g, [MB] = 0.75 mM, and [H2O2] = 0.5 M) was shown in Fig. 3d. Table 1 showed that the decreasing of the pH value from 10 to 6 did not significantly affect the value of kapp which was changed from 1.03 × 10−3 to 1.18 × 10−3 sec−1. In a basic medium, H2O2 may decompose to oxygen and H2O losing its oxidation ability (Liu et al., 2011). The decreasing of the pH value to 3.0 resulted in a sharp increase in the kapp (to 3.85 × 10−3 sec−1), and MB decolorization was achieved within 19 min. This was attributed to the abundance generation of HO• radicals in the acidic solution. The further drop in the pH value to 2.0, led to the remarked slowdown of the catalytic process (Sun et al., 2018). At lower pH values (highly acidic solutions), the concentration of H+ ions is present in excess. Therefore, the generated HO• radicals can react with H+ ions to form water leading to a decrease in HO• concentration and the depression of MB oxidation reaction (Zhang et al., 2013). Consequently, pH = 3 had been proved to be more suitable for the catalytic oxidation of MB using PVA/Cu2O. For commercial and industrial applications, the ease of catalyst separation from the reacting medium as well as the reuse in several cycles is of critical importance in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, the physical status of PVA/Cu2O catalyst (free-standing film) enabled the easy separation of the catalyst by forceps, skipping the traditional separation methods i.e. no need for filtration, centrifugation, precipitation by pH-shift, and magnetic separation (Eisa et al., 2019). At the end of the catalytic oxidation cycle, the PVA/Cu2O catalyst was recovered by forceps and rinsed with distilled water. The PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite was recycled up to five consecutive cycles. As given in Fig. 3e, the catalytic performance of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite at (PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.05 g, [MB] = 0.75 mM, pH = 3 and [H2O2] = 0.5 M), recycled up to five consecutive cycles, was evaluated. It was observed that after the 5th cycle, the PVA/Cu2O catalyst showed high stability through the successive catalytic cycles retaining 85% and 96% of its initial activity and conversion, respectively. The amount of Cu leached out within the reacting solution was determined using the atomic absorption spectrometer. The obtained results showed that no Cu species could be detected within the reacting solution. This result proved that the crosslinked PVA structure could strongly hold the Cu2O oxide nanoparticles within its matrix. Furthermore, the XRD pattern (Fig. S3) revealed that the crystalline structure of PVA/Cu2O was preserved after the recycle test. Also, the TEM image (Fig. S4a) showed that the size increased slightly after the fifth catalytic cycle. The growth of the particle size could be recognized as follow; when the aqueous solution diffused within the PVA matrix, the polymer swelled and the chains diverged from each other. This could give the chance to the Cu nanoparticles to aggregate at a very close range to form slightly bigger nanoparticles. The increased size implies the lower surface area of the catalyst. This could clarify the slight decrease in kapp of the recycled PVA/Cu2O catalyst after five repetitions. 3.3.2 The catalytic oxidation of MG via Fenton-like reaction The catalytic activity of the PVA/Cu2O as a Fenton-like reagent was further confirmed in catalytic oxidation of the MG dye. Fig. 3f displayed the time-evolution of the UV/vis spectra of the catalytic oxidation of MG by H2O2 using PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film as a catalyst. The UV/vis spectrum of MG displayed two absorption peaks at 425 and 617 nm which were attributed to n–π∗ electronic transitions (Mohammad et al., 2019). The intensity of the absorption peak at 617 nm continuously faded exhausting about 23 min to vanish completely. This was consistent with the color change of MG from green to colorless indicating the end of the catalytic reaction. The kapp = 2.57 × 10−3 s−1 at (PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.05 g, [MG] = 0.08 mM, pH = 3 and [H2O2] = 0.5 M). 3.3.3 The activity of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP To further broaden the performance of the prepared PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film in the catalytic processes, its catalytic activity was tested in the reduction process of 4-NP as a model reaction (Li et al., 2020). Visually, the addition of NaBH4 to the colorless 4-NP solution resulted in yellow colored solution of 4-nitrophenolate ions (Eisa et al., 2018). Several days later, the 4-nitrophenolate ions solution maintained its yellow color without considerable change as detected by UV/vis spectrometer i.e. the catalytic reduction did not proceed in the absence of a catalyst. Kinetically, there is a high barrier between the reduction potential of H3BO3/BH4 (Eo = −1.33 V) and that of NP/4-AP (Eo = −0.76 V) (Eisa et al., 2019). Immersing of PVA/Cu2O within the reacting solution (4-NP+NaBH4), the catalytic reduction started directly which could be observed by the continuous vanishing of yellow color. Regarding Fig. 4 a, the decaying of 400 nm-peak of 4-nitrophenolate ion was synchronized with the appearance and growth of a new absorption peak at 300 nm, the characteristic peak of 4-AP. The very large excess of NaBH4 concentration as compared with that of 4-NP, ([NaBH4]/[4-NP]≈25), make it possible to consider the catalytic reaction is following the 1st order model depending on the 4-NP concentration. Fig. 4b and Table 2 showed that by increasing the PVA/Cu2O dosage, the kapp of catalytic reduction increased as well. The catalytic experiment was performed at (pH = 8, [4-NP] = 0.08 mM, and [NaBH4] = 2 mM). The reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP up to 99% attained in just 23, 15, and 6 min using PVA/Cu2O dosage of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 g, respectively. The enhanced catalytic rate was attributed to the increased number of Cu2O nanoparticles, with the surplus surface area available for the adsorption of the reactants, which accelerate the electron-relay between BH4 − and 4-NP. Fig. 4c displayed the dependence of kapp on the concentration of 4-NP at (pH = 8, PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.03 g, and [NaBH4] = 2 mM). The kapp value decreased from 2.56 × 10−3 to 6.27 × 10−3 sec−1 with the increasing concentration of 4-NP from 0.04 to 0.16 mM (Table 2). The effect of pH value on the Kapp was displayed in Fig. 4d at (PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.03 g, [4-NP] = 0.04 mM and [NaBH4] = 2 mM) and the calculated Kapp values were tabulated in Table 2. It could be observed that the kapp values exhibit two stages depending on the pH value. The kapp value increased markedly from 2.15 × 10−3 to 7.5 × 10−3 sec−1 with increasing the pH value from 6 to 8.5. On the further increase of the pH value to 10, the kapp value decreased markedly to 5.15 × 10−3 sec−1. The stability of NaBH4 in aqueous solution is increased in the highly basic medium and the deprotonation probability of the (–OH) moiety of 4-NP is reduced. The PVA/Cu2O catalyst was recycled ten times in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP using NaBH4 at (PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.03 g, [4-NP] = 0.04 mM, pH = 8.5, and [NaBH4] = 2 mM). Fig. 4e showed that the PVA/Cu2O catalyst exhibited efficient conversion% of 4-AP (≈97%) in the tenth run whereas the catalytic activity decreased slightly from 100% to 96.5% with no Cu leaching as detected using atomic absorption. The stability of PVA/Cu2O film was recognized by collecting the XRD and TEM after tenth catalytic cycles (Figs. S3 and S4b). The XRD displayed nearly the same XRD profile with little distortion in PVA peak. The PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite displayed considerable reusability and stability in catalytic reduction reactions. 3.3.4 The degradation of RR via catalytic reduction using PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film The catalytic performance of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film was also evaluated in the reduction of RR dye using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The catalytic reduction was followed using UV/vis spectrometry (Fig. 4f) i.e. the catalytic degradation of RR was evaluated by recording the time-decay of the absorption peak at 509 nm. The reduction of RR dye was found to proceed only in the presence of PVA/Cu2O and NaBH4 together. The reaction was carried out at (pH = 8.5, PVA/Cu2O dosage = 0.03 g, [RR] = 0.0075 mM, and [NaBH4] = 2 mM) and the pseudo 1st order kinetics governed this catalytic reaction. The degradation rate exhausted 10 min for complete decolorization of RR with kapp = 6.23 × 10−3 sec−1. Table 3 summarized the previously reported kapp for the oxidative and catalytic degradation of MB, MG, 4-NP, and RR using Cu-based catalysts. The kapp in the present study was not the superior one but in range with most of the reported values. However, the significance of the investigated catalyst could be recognized as follow: the engineering of a convenient and efficient recovery process is the cornerstone in the development of new catalysts. Filtration, centrifugation, precipitation through pH changing, and magnetic separation are the common recycling methods of the catalysts listed in Table 3. However, these methods seem to be unsuitable in real applications in terms of complicated steps and consuming time and energy. The PVA/Cu2O catalyst was prepared as a free-standing film which enabled the efficient recovery/reuse for several cycles through easy-handling i.e. the recycling of the catalyst is a built-in character of the PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite. Also, the synthesis of PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film passed through a simple pathway using cheap and eco-friendly precursors without the need for harsh chemicals (surfactant and organic solvents). The simple, cheap, clean production and the efficient recycling of the PVA/Cu2O catalyst will benefit the catalytic process in such a way that it minimizes the environmental risks, improving human health conditions, and making it more suitable for the real applications."
10,Conclusions,"A toxicant-free and environmentally benign route, for the production of crosslinked PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite, was described. In this route, a naturally occurring gallic acid was employed as a potent reducing, capping agent for the preparation of Cu2O nanoparticles, and crosslinker for the PVA matrix. Using GA avoids the need for hazard crosslinkers such as widely used glutaraldehyde. The size of the produced Cu2O nanoparticles is in the range of 10–19 nm. The PVA/Cu2O nanocomposite film showed both catalytic oxidation and reduction for MB, MG, 4-NP, and RR. After optimization of catalyst dosage, substrate concentration, and pH value, the calculated rate constants for the oxidation of MB and MG are 3.85 × 10−3 and 2.57 × 10−3 sec−1, respectively, whereas those for the reduction of 4-NP and RR are 7.5 × 10−3 and 6.23 × 10−3 sec−1, respectively. The recycling of free-standing film-based material is more applicable, as no filtration, precipitation, centrifugation, etc. are required. The PVA/Cu2O film could be reused several times without significant loss of the catalytic activity. This study describes a general approach towards the clean and economic production of a wide category of polymer/metal oxide (metal) nanoparticles. This will minimize/prevent the pollution emission rather than treating it after production."
