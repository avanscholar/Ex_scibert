0,Introduction,"Sustainable development has been put forward to overcome the current energy and environmental problems resulting from the excessive consumption of fossil fuels; fuel cell technique, especially the direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFC) that are fed with the liquid alcohol fuels, is drawing great attention because of the clean energy transformation from chemical energy to the electrical power [1–3]. Moreover, the sustainable production of alcohol fuels from biomass or carbon dioxide reduction is highly appreciated. While the energy transformation from chemical energy to electrical energy in the fuel cell technology is not as easy as the simple combustion reactions, and an efficient catalyst is required to complete the electrochemical oxidation of alcohol fuels [4–6]. Pt-based nanomaterials are naturally selected catalysts for direct alcohol fuel cells as they have a strong capability to cleave the C–H bonds. However, some serious problems are still faced on such kind of catalyst including the slow kinetics, high cost, and severe poisoning effect from CO-like intermediates during the catalytic process [7,8]. To overcome these challenges, attention has been directed to develop novel and efficient composite catalysts. The most serious problem is that carbon monoxide-like species produced during the alcohol oxidation will strongly adsorb on the Pt sites, leading to rapid catalytic activity loss [9,10]. Up to now, the efficient catalysts with the high ability for anti-poisoning in alcohol fuel oxidation are still rare besides the traditional PtRu and PtSn catalyst systems [11–13]; it is still a fundamental challenge to find an alternative catalyst for fuel cell reactions. Oxophilic materials, which are regarded as good candidates for accelerating water dissociation, can provide the necessary oxygen-containing species for the oxidation of the CO-based intermediate at relatively low potentials and they are, based on the bifunctional catalytic mechanism, generally employed to construct the ideal catalysts [14,15]. Among various oxophilic materials, PtCu alloy was suggested as a promising catalyst for methanol oxidation based on the theoretical screen by density functional theory calculation [16]. Copper (Cu) not only has abundant reserves and relatively low cost but also has excellent catalytic activity promotion in the PtCu alloy resulting from the bifunctional and/or ligand effects [17–19]. Some strategies have been adopted to optimize the catalytic performance of PtCu for alcohol fuel oxidation [20]. Specifically, PtCu alloy nanoframes exhibit superior activity and durability to catalyze methanol oxidation reaction than the commercial carbon-supported Pt catalysts [21]. Transition metal carbides have been used as catalysts in (de)hydrogenation and isomerization of hydrocarbons because of their Pt-like properties [22]. They are also valid catalyst promoters of Pt for an alcohol oxidation reaction owing to their efficient synergistic effect [23,24]. Moreover, metal carbides were reported to possess much higher tolerance capability towards some typical noble metal-poisoning species such as sulfur or carbon oxides [25,26]. Among them, molybdenum carbide is of particular interest because of its high stability, metallic property and conductivity. For example, Pt/Mo2C supported on carbon black shows a superior activity for methanol electro-oxidation compared to that of Pt supported on carbon [27]. The efficient and strong interaction between Pt and Mo2C is found to largely enhance the catalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation compared with that of Pt/C [22,28,29]. However, it is still very challenging to construct such an efficiently synergistic catalyst because the multi-component interaction depends on the fabrication approaches, specific structure and exposure of active sites. Inspired by the above-mentioned motivations, the efficient synergism of Pt, Cu and Mo2C would be a nice system for oxidation of alcohol fuels because of several reasons noted below. Firstly, the synergistic effects of Pt and Cu can effectively adjust the d-band center of Pt via electronic effect. Secondly, the strong interaction between Pt and Mo2C could stabilize Pt nanoparticles and tailor their electronic states to change the adsorption property of different reaction species. Finally, by integrating the above-mentioned advantages, the efficient synergism of Pt, Cu and Mo2C would be hopeful to weaken the adsorption energy of CO-like intermediates for maintaining high catalytic performance for alcohol fuel oxidation. Herein, an efficient ternary synergistic catalyst system of Pt–Cu–Mo2C deriving from a polyoxometalate-based metal-organic framework (NENU-5) is fabricated by combining thermal annealing with galvanic replacement approach for alcohol fuel oxidation. The atomic ratio of Pt and Cu in the system is adjusted by galvanic replacement reaction of Cu on Mo2C and Pt precursors with different concentrations, and an optimal catalyst of Pt–Cu–Mo2C shows the best catalytic activity and stability for methanol and ethanol oxidation as well as CO-tolerance ability. The catalytic promotion mechanism of Pt–Cu–Mo2C is probed by comparing with Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C catalysts using physical and electrochemical techniques, and the high performance can be attributed to the strong electronic effect and good anti-CO poisoning capability resulted from the combined role of different functionalities of Cu and Mo2C in the catalyst system. Specifically, the highest CO-tolerance ability is demonstrated by the lowest CO-oxidation peak at 0.451 V, and as high as 74.55 and 86.81% of the initial current density is maintained, respectively, after a 1000-cycle stability test towards methanol and ethanol oxidation. The current study demonstrates a more efficient synergism of Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalysts for energy-relevant oxidation of alcohol fuels in DAFCs compared with the traditional bimetallic systems."
1,Result and discussion,
2,Structural and morphological analysis,"2.1 Structural and morphological analysis To realize the efficient synergistic effect among Pt, Cu and Mo2C, Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalyst was fabricated using a simple approach as schematically shown in Fig. 1 a, which includes the Cu–Mo2C fabrication from NENU-5, followed by thermal annealing and galvanic replacement reaction with Pt4+ ion precursors. The compositions of Pt and Cu were adjusted by using different concentration of Pt4+ ions to fulfill the galvanic replacement reaction with the Cu in the Cu–Mo2C, i.e., 0.3, 0.45, 0.6 and 1.2 mg mL−1 of H2PtCl6 solution, and the obtained catalysts are labeled as Pt–Cu–Mo2C-x (x represents 1, 2, 3, 4). The Cu–Mo2C obtained from the NENU-5 can be confirmed by the XRD analysis, where the characteristic peaks can be assigned to the hexagonal structure of Mo2C and the cubic structure of Cu, respectively (Fig. S1). After the galvanic replacement reaction between Pt precursors and Cu for the formation of Pt–Cu–Mo2C, a broad peak is found in the XRD pattern probably due to the surface coverage of Pt nanoparticles that have strong peaks but close positions overlapping with the Cu (Fig. 1b). The characteristic peaks attributed to the face-centered cubic structure of Pt become more evident by increasing the amount of Pt in the catalyst systems; specifically, three typical diffraction peaks at ca. 39.76°, 46.24°, and 67.45° are indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystalline planes of Pt, respectively [30,31]. The low concentration of Pt is not efficient to form well-structured Pt crystals, as shown in the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 sample, which has very weak diffraction peaks and poor Pt crystallinity. The XRD patterns of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 become distinct enough to identify the crystal phase. The crystal size of the samples with well-defined Pt structure was calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the (220) peak, and it was calculated to be 4.68 nm, 5.08 nm and 5.63 nm for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4, respectively. The slight increase in crystal size might be due to the easy nucleation of Pt when high H2PtCl6 concentration is used for the galvanic replacement reaction between Pt4+ ions and Cu. The surface morphology of the samples was firstly observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The NENU-5 has a polyhedron shape and a relatively smooth surface as reported elsewhere [32] (Fig. 2a and S2a). While after thermal annealing in N2 atmosphere, the collapse of the NENU-5 particles is observed due to the decomposition of organic ligands and the formation of Cu and Mo2C from the consumption of the carbon in the material [32]; the produced Cu–Mo2C support has a rough structure with several particles formed on their surface (Fig. 2b and S2b). It is interesting to find that the morphology of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 that has the optimal catalytic performance for alcohol fuel oxidation exhibits a grape-like structure with some spherical particles formed on their surface (Fig. 2c and S2c). The morphology of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst was further characterized by the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The dense but ultrafine nanoparticles are visible in the TEM images (Fig. 2 d), and the average particle size is ca. 5.03 nm (Fig. S3), which is close to the particle size calculated from the XRD patterns. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2e), the lattice distances of 0.226, 0.208 and 0.236 nm are indicated that can be attributed to Pt (111), Cu (111), and Mo2C (002) planes, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Pt–Cu–Mo2C was prepared by the galvanic replacement approach between Cu and the Pt4+ precursors in the solution, where the Cu deposited on Mo2C substrates instead of free Cu particles was used as the sacrificial template to reduce the Pt4+ precursors. In this strategy, the Cu domains may not be uniform in size and position in the hybrid system due to the lack of effective control on the hydrothermal process. In this regard, the uniform occurrence of galvanic replacement between Cu and the Pt4+ precursors cannot be guaranteed. For the Cu domains with small size and exposure to the Pt4+ ions, the complete replacement leads to Pt domains, while the Cu domains not accessible to Pt4+ ions will be maintained. Of course, Pt–Cu nanoalloys will definitely be formed for partial replacement between the Cu domains with appropriate sizes and Pt4+ ions. Therefore, to be prudent, we used Pt–Cu–Mo2C to indicate the complicated system obtained in this study. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) demonstrates the presence of Pt, Cu and Mo (Fig. 2f), and the contents of Pt, Cu and Mo are measured to be 20.25 at%, 59.41 at% and 2.73 at%, respectively. The ratio of Pt/Cu is 1:2.93, close to the value obtained by ICP-AES analysis (1:3.17), and consistent with the nominal results. The relevant elements of Pt, C, Cu and Mo are found to be uniformly distributed on the surface in the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 2g–k)."
3,Methanol electrooxidation,"2.2 Methanol electrooxidation All catalysts were firstly evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the background of 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. S4). The typical polycrystal Pt characteristic profile is observed for all catalysts with the typical hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks, double layer range and Pt oxidation/reduction peaks. The electrode was then assessed for methanol oxidation by cyclic voltammograms at scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 3 a). Obviously, the catalytic ability of the samples is influenced by the content of Pt in the system. The sample of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 shows the lowest activity for methanol oxidation (19.10 mA cm−2) because of the low Pt amount in the catalyst, and the performance is gradually increased by with the increase of Pt in the system and the best performance is achieved on the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 electrode (80.31 mA cm−2). Afterwards, the peak current becomes inferior for the electrode of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 (57.54 mA cm−2), and with a further increase of the Pt content in the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 sample, the catalytic activity is largely reduced with the peak current density of only 25.70 mA cm−2, due to the particle agglomeration on the surface, which weakens the surface multicomponent synergism. Specifically, the peak current density of the forward scan for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 80.31 mA cm−2, much higher than that of other electrodes; it also shows a much lower onset potential for methanol oxidation compared to other electrodes (Table S1). Judged by the high peak current density and low onset potential, Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst thus has the optimal composition for the catalytic reaction. The catalytic stability in a steady-state was revealed by the chronoamperometry (CA) technique at 0.6 V (Fig. 3b). The initial sharp drop of the current density within 300 s can be correlated to the double layer discharge, and then the gradually current decay is caused by the Pt active site poisoning from the toxicity intermediates produced during methanol oxidation [33]. After 3600 s, the final current density is 24.58 mA cm−2 for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, and it is 7.7 mA cm−2, 16.51 mA cm−2, 0.93 mA cm−2 for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4, Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1, respectively. The catalytic stability can be expressed by normalizing the final current density to the initial current density, and this value is 63.25% for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, much higher than that of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 (59.46%), Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 (62.68%) and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 (11.81%). Thus, the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation. The catalytic kinetics can be probed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the methanol oxidization controlled by kinetics at the potential of 0.4 V was set for the impedance test (Fig. 3c). Generally, the charge transfer ability can be roughly estimated by the diameter of a semicircle or arc, and the smaller value indicates the faster charge transfer ability. It is evident that Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance. The details of the parameter can be obtained by fitting the Nyquist plot and the results are shown in Table S2. The uncompensated solution resistance of all electrodes is 7.9 Ω, indicating a similar configuration of the electrode system. The charge transfer resistance of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 540 Ω, the smallest among all catalysts. This kinetics trend can also be supported by the Tafel slope, which is a convenient way to evaluate the catalytic kinetics. The Tafel slope of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 77 mV dec−1, much lower than that of other catalysts (Fig. 3d). The smaller Tafel slope indicates improved catalytic kinetics for methanol oxidation. If the first C–H bond splitting of CH3OH molecule is considered as the rate-determining step, the Tafel slope is about 120 mV dec−1, while if it involves the water activation step as the rate-determining step, the value will be 60 mV dec−1 [34]. Herein, the Tafel slope of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst is close to 60 mV dec−1, indicating the oxygen-containing species generated from the oxophilic assistant component mainly influence the key step. In light of the significance of dynamic stability for application, an accelerated stability test for methanol oxidation was done by recording 1000 CV cycles at 150 mV s−1. It is observed that the peak current density is gradually reduced with the increase of the scanning numbers for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 electrode (Fig. 3e, and Fig. S5 for the rest samples). The gradually reduced performance is attributed to the accumulation of poisoning intermediates on the electrode surface. After the 1000-cycle test, the peak current density for all the samples is reduced. The Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst still retains the highest performance, e.g. 74.55% of the initial current density, higher than that of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3, while largely reduced catalytic stability is found for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 electrodes (Fig. 3f). The less or more content of the Pt in the system is thus not favorable for the performance, and the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 exhibits the highest catalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation because of the appropriate component synergism."
4,Ethanol electrooxidation,"2.3 Ethanol electrooxidation Ethanol that can be generated from renewable resources has been considered as a promising fuel for the direct alcohol fuel cells. An efficient catalyst for extracting electrical energy from ethanol is also highly desired. The above-proposed catalysts have also been studied for ethanol oxidation. As shown in the stable CV curves, all catalysts show similar profiles, and the peak current density in the forward direction is used to describe the catalytic ability. Similar cases to the above-mentioned results for methanol oxidation are found, and the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 have a relatively high catalytic performance for ethanol oxidation, while the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 have very low activity (Fig. 4 a). The peak current density for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 44.70 mA cm−2, which is much larger than that of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 (11.94 mA cm−2), Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 (30.50 mA cm−2) and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 (12.53 mA cm−2). The charge transfer resistance is also probed by EIS at 0.4 V for ethanol oxidation. As seen from Fig. 4b, the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst has the smallest diameter for the semi-circle, indicating its lowest resistance for the charge transfer. The impedance plot is fitted by an equivalent circuit and the details for the uncompensated solution resistance and charge transfer resistance are listed in Table S3. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope is compared and the values for all catalysts are found to be in the range of 136–146 mV dec−1 (Fig. S6); these values indicate the kinetics of ethanol oxidation reaction is dominated by the adsorption of hydroxyl species on the Pt electrode [35]. The higher Tafel slope value than that of methanol oxidation also indicates that the oxidation of ethanol is more difficult and the generation of more oxygen-containing species is required for the oxidation process. The catalytic stability for ethanol oxidation was studied by CA at 0.6 V and the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst still shows the highest catalytic current and stability (Fig. 4c). For example, after 3600 s test, the final current density is still as high as 9.46 mA cm−2 for Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, about 6.7 times, 1.2 times and 3.9 times higher than that of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 (1.41 mA cm−2), Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 (7.83 mA cm−2) and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 (2.41 mA cm−2), respectively. Moreover, about 60% of the initial current is retained after the CA test, much higher than that of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 (31%), Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 (57%) and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 (44%). The dynamic stability test by running 1000 CV cycles is also investigated for all catalysts (Fig. S7) and the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-1 can keep 62.05% of the initial current density. The Pt–Cu–Mo2C-3 and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-4 are much better with the values of 81.06% and 80.13%, while the highest value is still observed for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 of 86.81% (Fig. 4d). Thus, the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 has the best catalytic performance for ethanol electrooxidation."
5,Promotion mechanism study,"2.4 Promotion mechanism study In order to further explore the electro-catalytic performance of Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalyst, Pt–Cu, Pt–Mo2C and a commercial Pt/C catalyst were compared to study the synergistic effect for alcohol fuel oxidation. The best catalytic performance is still found on the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst for methanol oxidation, as evaluated by the peak current density (Fig. 5 a). To be specific, the peak current density of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 80.31 mA cm−2, higher than that of Pt–Cu catalyst (62.58 mA cm−2), Pt–Mo2C catalyst (48.82 mA cm−2) and Pt/C (23.61 mA cm−2). It is true that, compared with the Pt/C catalyst, the Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C exhibit much better catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the bi-component system but they are inferior to the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst with ternary components. Tafel slope and EIS were employed to compare the kinetics (Fig. S8a and S8b). The efficient kinetics and rapid charge transfer capability are obtained on the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst compared with the Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C (Table S4 for the EIS fitting). The steady-state catalytic stability evaluated by chronoamperometry (CA) at 0.6 V was compared for all samples (Fig. S9). As expected, the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 exhibits much higher current density for methanol oxidation during the whole test period, and after 3600 s, the final current density of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 24.9 mA cm−2, which is about 1.7 times of the Pt–Cu (14.4 mA cm−2), 2.4 times of the Pt–Mo2C (10.2 mA cm−2) and 3.5 times of the Pt/C catalysts (7.1 mA cm−2). By normalizing the final current density to the initial value of 300 s, about 63.25% of the current is maintained for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst, much higher than that for the Pt–Cu (56.5%) and the Pt–Mo2C (53.4%), indicating the significant stability of the ternary components for methanol oxidation. The dynamic stability was also evaluated in the accelerated stability test by recording 1000 CV cycles at 150 mV s−1, as done in the above-mentioned approach (Fig. 5b). The performance decay for Pt/C is most serious, and more than 50% of the current is lost after 1000 cycles; while the bimetallic component of Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C could keep more than 60% of the initial peak current density. The Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 still possesses the best ability to maintain the performance, and as high as 75% of the initial value is observed after 1000 cycles. Actually, the catalytic stability is influenced by the poisoning effect of the intermediates adsorbed on the Pt active sites during the continuous test, and the better CO-tolerance, the better catalytic stability (vide supra). A similar trend is also found for all catalysts in catalyzing ethanol oxidation. The highest peak current density is demonstrated on the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst (Fig. S10a). Rapid charge transfer ability is also confirmed on the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst by EIS study (Fig. S10b and Table S5), so does the efficient kinetics reflected by Tafel slope (Fig. S10c). The high catalytic stability for ethanol oxidation is confirmed by the steady-state CA test and the dynamic stability test for 1000 CV cycles (Fig. S10d, S11 and S12). Therefore, the efficient ternary synergism for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst is observed for alcohol fuel oxidation compared with the Pt–Cu, Pt–Mo2C and Pt/C catalysts. It is well known that the oxidation of alcohol fuels is influenced by the poisoning intermediates generated during the oxidation process, and the poisoning species can be mimicked by CO with the help of the CO-stripping technique. Herein, in order to probe the synergistic effect of Pt, Cu and Mo2C, we probed their anti-poisoning capability by CO stripping technique (Fig. 5c). Typically, the onset potential and peak potential of pre-adsorbed CO oxidation are important indicators to compare the CO-tolerance ability. The lower the potential for CO oxidation, the easier for the CO oxidation, and the higher the anti-poisoning ability of the catalyst. It is evident that the Pt/C has the highest onset potential and peak potential for CO oxidation (Table S6), thus the worst catalytic performance. According to the bi-functional catalytic mechanism, the generation of oxygen-containing species for oxidizing CO-species by Pt oxidation requires high potentials [33]. While for the bi-components of the Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C, the oxidation ability for CO oxidation is largely improved, as indicated by the lower onset potential and peak potential (Table S6), because the oxygen-containing species are easily generated by the oxophilic component of Cu and Mo2C at lower potentials. As expected, the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 has the lowest potential for CO oxidation, and the peak potential is 0.451 V, about 26, 35 and 117 mV lower than that of Pt–Cu, Pt–Mo2C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. It is interesting to find that the peak potential and profile of Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C for CO oxidation are quite different, indicating their different capability for CO oxidation. The Pt–Cu could oxidize the adsorbed CO at a relatively narrow potential range from 0.401 to 0.617 V; the peak potential of 0.477 V is more negative compared with Pt–Mo2C (0.486V). The Pt–Mo2C can oxidize CO in a wide potential range from 0.385 to 0.738 V and the onset potential for CO oxidation of 0.385 V is more negative compared to that of Pt–Cu (0.401V). The difference might be interpreted by the different generation mechanisms for oxygen-containing species; the Mo2C as an efficient water splitting catalyst could active water at low potentials, thus it has a lower onset potential for CO oxidation [36]. The adsorbed CO on Pt surface can diffuse to the neighboring Mo sites, at which water dissociation is favored and the oxygenated species can form Mo–OH at very low potentials and react with CO to form CO2 [25]. The Mo-based species act only as a promoter for the oxidation of CO and do not have the capability to absorb CO itself [25]. While for Pt–Cu catalyst, the onset potential is determined by the oxygen-containing species generated from Cu oxidation. The Cu component can be oxidized to form oxygenated species such as OHads and such oxygenated species on Cu sites further oxidize to remove the COads on Pt sites, and this substantially enhances the catalytic performance [18]. The COads intermediate species can be shifted from Pt sites to the close Cu sites by forming COads/Cu due to the favorable adsorption ability of CO on Cu nanoparticles, thus the presence of Cu atoms can reduce the adsorption of poisoning intermediates on the Pt, and promote the full activation of hydroxyl radicals and oxidation of intermediates to form CO2 on Pt during electro-oxidation [37]. Therefore, Pt–Cu and Pt have a similar profile but the onset and peak potentials of Pt–Cu shift to the negative direction because of the synergistic effect induced by Pt and Cu in their alloys. Judged by the lowest onset and peak potentials for CO oxidation, an efficient synergistic effect among Pt, Cu and Mo2C is suggested in the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalyst. For example, the onset potential of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 0.383 V, close to that of 0.385 V for Pt–Mo2C, and the peak potential is 0.451 V, close to that of 0.477 V for Pt–Cu catalyst; the largely improved anti-CO poisoning capability could be due to the co-action of Mo2C and Cu oxophilic components. The profile of Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is close to that of Pt–Cu catalyst probably due to the high contents of Cu in the system (vide supra). A similar performance decay trend in the dynamic stability test could also support that the high catalytic performance is mainly determined by Pt–Cu in the system (Fig. 5b). The performance decay is more serious on Pt–Cu after 800 cycles, while Pt–Mo2C has more mild performance lost after 600 cycles, therefore, the combined advantages of Cu and Mo2C in the system endow the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 with more robust for the oxidation of alcohol fuels. In order to compare the catalytic efficiency of different catalysts, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) was calculated based on the CO-stripping profiles (Table S6), which is 60.5, 57.4, 51.5 and 50.1 m2 gPt −1 for the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, Pt–Cu, Pt–Mo2C and Pt/C, respectively. The ECSAs represent the active sites exposed for an electrochemical reaction, and the specific activity can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the active site by normalizing the raw current to the ECSAs. The maximum specific activity of the Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 is 1.65 mA cm−2 for methanol oxidation, about 1.2, 1.4 and 2.9 times higher than that of the Pt–Cu (1.36 mA cm−2), Pt–Mo2C (1.18 mA cm−2) and Pt/C (0.56 mA cm−2) (Fig. S13a). Similar results are also found for these catalysts in ethanol oxidation (Fig. S13b). Compared with the Pt–Cu, Pt–Mo2C and Pt/C catalysts, Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 also has the highest mass activity in methanol and ethanol oxidation, as shown in Fig. S13c and d. Besides the above-mentioned ligand effect resulting from the oxophilic components in the catalyst, the electronic effect is also welcome for performance improvement. Based on the d-band center theory, the position of the d-band center relative to the Fermi level directly reflects the adsorption energy and activation barrier in catalytic reactions [38]. The higher position of the d-band center relative to the Fermi level indicates more vacant in the antibonding states, thus a stronger bond between the adsorbate and the metal surface will result in a series poisoning issue and low performance. The core-level binding energy of the catalysts is probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to reveal the electronic effect. All binding energies in the current work are calibrated by the main peak of C–C sp2 bond at 284.6 eV in the C 1s spectrum (Fig. S14a). There is no obvious difference for the spectral profile of Cu 2p by comparing those of Pt–Cu and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 catalysts (Fig. S14b), and the spectrum of Cu 2p has two components and each can be deconvoluted into metallic and oxidized Cu2+ accompanied by the satellite peaks [39]. The high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra were compared with Pt–Mo2C and Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2 (Fig. S14c), and the profile and binding energies are consistent with the reports elsewhere [40]. Because of different chemical environmental conditions, the core-level binding energy of Pt 4f varies evidently although it has a similar profile of two doublets from the spin-orbital splitting of the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 (Fig. 5d). Each band could be deconvoluted into the chemical state of metallic Pt and Pt2+ (Table S7) [33]. The electronic effect could be indicated by comparing the binding energies to those of the Pt/C catalyst. Taking the metallic state of Pt 4f7/2 for example, the binding energies of Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C are both at 71.4 eV, which shift to lower values compared with that of the Pt/C catalyst (71.8 eV). A binding energy located at 71.6 eV is found for the Pt in Pt–Cu–Mo2C-2, a negative shift of 0.2 eV is observed with respect to that of Pt/C. The negative shifts of the Pt binding energies are not same probably because of the balanced multi-components interaction [41]. It is well recognized that the shift of Pt binding energy to lower value could modify the electronic structure and reduce the d-band center of Pt atoms associated with the Fermi level, resulting in weakened adsorption of toxic intermediates on Pt active sites during the alcohols fuel oxidation [37]. Density functional theory (DFT) also suggests the high anti-CO poisoning capability is attributed to the adjusted d band location and optimized binding energies of OHad and COad on the surface of Pt–Cu alloy, which decrease the coverage of COad intermediate during the alcohol fuel oxidation [42]. Moreover, Pt anchored over the Mo2C surface yields the lowest Gibbs free energy of active H adsorption, which is good at the water activation [43]. Therefore, combined with the above ligand effect resulting from the different oxophilic functionalities and the balanced electronic effect, that is no doubt that the Pt–Cu–Mo2C has the most negative onset and peak oxidation potential for the oxidation of CO poisoning species, as demonstrated in the above CO-stripping results, thereby the Pt–Cu–Mo2C exhibits the best catalytic ability for the oxidation of alcohol fuels."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated an efficient synergistic system of ternary Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalyst for the oxidation of alcohol fuels, which was successfully fabricated from a polyoxometalate-based metal-organic framework assisted by thermal annealing and galvanic replacement approach. This catalyst system is found to exhibit a high catalytic ability for the oxidation of alcohol fuels in the acidic electrolyte due to the balanced interaction of the oxophilic components, e.g. electronic and ligand effect. The optimized Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalyst shows much higher catalytic activity and better stability for the oxidation of alcohol fuels compared with the binary Pt–Cu and Pt–Mo2C catalyst systems. Specifically, the peak current density of Pt–Cu–Mo2C is 80.31 mA cm−2 for methanol oxidation with a nearly 3.5-fold enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst; the highest anti-CO poisoning ability is demonstrated by the lowest CO-oxidation peak potential and as high as 75–80% of current is maintained after a 1000-cycle dynamical stability test in the oxidation of alcohol fuels. Because of high activity, improved stability, facile kinetics and strong anti-poisoning ability, the ternary Pt–Cu–Mo2C catalyst system will be a significant anode catalyst platform for direct alcohol fuel cells compared with the traditional binary catalysts."
