0,Introduction,"The construction of the carbonyl compounds is one of the vital topics in organic chemistry, which has been intensively researched to this day [1–3]. Especially, great efforts have been devoted for the efficient synthesis of ketones, which are considered as one of the most basic but extremely important carbonyl structures [4–6]. Theoretically, the direct hydration of alkynes that adding H2O to the C≡C bonds followed by the keto-enol tautomerism is an ideal way to provide ketones for its merits such as high atom-economy, green & sustainability and easy operability. Therefore, numerous catalytic systems have been developed for this strategy [7–9]. Among them, the classical Hg(II) salts/H2SO4 system used to be a milestone that performed good catalytic activity for this hydration [10,11]. However, the employment of toxic mercury and corrosive acid blocked its further applications in modern green and sustainable society. Over the past several decades, alternative systems containing Cu [12–14], Ag [15–20], Zn [21–23], Au [24–40], Fe [41–43], Co [44–47], Ru [48–50], Pd [51–53], Pt [54], In [55,56], Sn [57,58], Hf [59]salts, etc. have been established and remarkable progress has been achieved for the conversion of most alkynes. However, for a series of specific alkynes that contain hydroxyl groups, namely propargyl alcohols, seldom systems were reported to show general and excellent catalytic activity. This might be attributed to the side reactions known as Meyer-Schuster and Rupe rearrangements which would inevitably occur under the acidic circumstances required by the most abovementioned systems [60,61]. Probably for this reason, the traditional Hg(II) salts/H2SO4 system developed 100 years ago is still one of the most general tools for the hydration of propargyl alcohols even nowadays [62–64]. From another perspective, the hydration of propargyl alcohols is a reaction of great significance and high-value since the obtained products, α-hydroxy ketones, are a series of important organics which have been widely applied in biological, pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry [65–67]. As a consequence, it is urgently desirable for the investigations on this specific hydration process without toxic catalytic materials and unfavorable rearrangements. Very recently, a CO2-promoted hydration process of propargyl alcohols and H2O quickly emerged and attracted attentions from the researchers, in which CO2 was firstly cyclized with the propargyl alcohols and then released through the in-situ hydrolysis of the corresponding products (Table 1 ) [68–71]. Particularly, both of the cyclization and hydrolysis could be accomplished in basic circumstance, so the rearrangements occurred under the acidic conditions would be effectively restrained. Thus, this indirect hydration process might be a potential substituted strategy for the traditional direct hydration method in the cases of propargyl alcohols. However, until now only a few catalytic systems were reported for this process (Table 1), which could be divided into two series: the systems of metal salts/organic bases (1 and 2, Table 1) and the systems containing ionic liquids (ILs) (3 and 4, Table 1). Generally, the first series were appealing since the employed materials were commercially-available and easily-accessible, while they were suffered from the disadvantages of high metal loading and usage of additional ligands or volatile solvents [68,69]. In the other series, Liu et al designed and synthesized several task-specific ILs for this reaction, which successfully avoided the usage of volatile solvents, additives or even metal salts [70]. However, these ILs were not commercially-available and the corresponding catalytic systems still required high catalytic amount, elevated CO2 pressure and prolonged reaction time to reach high yields for most substrates. Based on this, our group combined these two strategies together and developed the “metal salt + IL” catalytic systems, which successfully inherited the merits from both sides. One representative work was the AgOAc combined with a carboxylic IL, which employed ppm level of Ag loading while exhibited excellent catalytic activity, recyclability, green and sustainability [71]. However, during this research, we noticed the catalytic performance of this Ag system would be significantly restrained even by the sunlight, which largely limited its practical applications. Moreover, the usage of relatively rare and sensitive silver salts would also increase the cost for the production of desire products. Comparing with the rare and sensitive Ag compounds, Cu salts exhibited more stable, economic and greener properties which exactly offset the current problems that the Ag-catalyzed system faced. However, due to the inherent characteristics, Cu salts generally behaved much lower activity than the Ag ones, which led to their less reports on the target hydration reaction. By far, the only example was a Cu2O/1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) system, in which the Cu loading was up to 40 mol% with strong base DBU and volatile CH3CN employed [69]. Consequently, utilization of green and economical Cu salts to make highly efficient catalytic system was still urgently desirable for the CO2-promoted hydration of propargyl alcohols. Herein, the economical and stable CuSO4·5H2O was combined with a commercially available and easily accessible 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4C1im][OAc]) IL for the catalysis of CO2-promoted hydration of propargyl alcohols under low CO2 pressure (0.2–1 bar) without any additives or traditional volatile solvents. Notably, this system inherited the advantages of both metal salts and ILs, which simultaneously behaved excellent catalytic activity, recyclability and sustainability. Particularly, a new record of turnover number (TON) was achieved by this system."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Unless otherwise noted, commercially available Cu salts, ILs and starting materials including propargyl alcohols were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Aladdin, TCI, Alfa, Macklin in China and used as received. The DBU-based ILs and [N4444][OAc] were synthesized according to the reported procedures [72,73]. The CO2 (99.999%) and the mimetic flue gas (20 vol% of CO2 and 80 vol% of N2) used for purging and catalysis were supplied by Wuhan Xiangyun Industry and Trade Co., Ltd."
3,General analytic methods,"2.2 General analytic methods With regard to the related analysis and characterization, NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD (AscendTM 500 MHz) spectrometer. Peak frequencies were referenced versus the solvent peaks for 1H NMR (CDCl3, 7.28 ppm; DMSO‑d 6, 2.53 ppm) and for 13C NMR (CDCl3, 77.0 ppm; DMSO‑d 6, 39.9 ppm) respectively. Multiplicity abbreviations: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet. The coupling constants, J, were reported in Hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were taken on a Bruker Daltonics micro TOF-QII instrument (ESI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was taken on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were obtained by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) at 40 kV, 40 mA equipped with a Cu Kα irradiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å, scan rate of 0.05°·s−1). The SEM spectrum was obtained by a AG Gemini SEM 300 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The TEM spectrum was obtained by Tecnai G2 F30 (FEI, USA)."
4,General procedures for the synthesis of α-hydroxy ketones,"2.3 General procedures for the synthesis of α-hydroxy ketones The CO2-promoted hydration experiments were performed in the 15 mL Schlenk tubes. CuSO4·5H2O, [C4C1im][OAc], propargyl alcohols and H2O were first added following their required amounts. Then the system was continuously purged with CO2 or mimetic flue gas for 3 times and the mixture was stirred at 100 °C under 1 bar pressure. As the reaction completed, the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (5 × 10 mL) and the upper layers were collected and dried over MgSO4. Then the solid agent was removed through filtration and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum to obtain the raw product, which could be further purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (v/v, 100:1–20:1) as the eluent. When the recyclability of the catalytic system was investigated, the lower colored layer was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 6 h to totally remove the residual reactants, products and H2O. Then the recycled system could be reemployed in the next round directly."
5,Results and discussions,"Firstly, the catalytic systems utilized for the CO2-promoted hydration were studied based on the substrate of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (1a), as shown in Table 2 . Initially, the blank experiment was carried out which indicated that the reaction couldn’t proceed without catalysis (entry 1). Moreover, no desired product was detected when the copper salt was individually used (entry 2). In the case that only IL of [C2C1im][OAc] catalyzed this hydration, a poor yield of 16% was obtained (entry 3). Finally, absence of CO2 also led to a failure of the reaction (entry 4). To our delight, when Cu salts, ILs and CO2 were introduced into the reaction together, desired product 2a could be smoothly obtained (entry 5). Based on this result, the influences of ILs on the catalytic activity were firstly investigated using Cu(OAc)2 to constitute the catalytic systems (entries 5–14). Firstly, the comparison on the anions of the ILs was performed. The screening results showed that only the basic [Im], [MIm], [HCOO], [OAc], [CH3(CH2)2COO] and [CH3(CH2)8COO] gave the considerable activity (entries 5, 7–14). Moreover, in the series of carboxylic anions, the length of the alkyl chains would affect the catalytic activity. The short [HCOO] or long [CH3(CH2)8COO] gave significant decrease on yields while moderate [OAc] and [CH3(CH2)2COO] behaved similarly high activity (entries 7, 12–14). On the other hand, the cations showed a catalytic order of [C4C1im]≈[ C2C1im] > [DBUH] > [N4444] when the anion was fixed as [OAc] (entries 5, 7, 8, 11), indicating that imidazole cations were more favourable for the reaction. After comprehensive comparison, [C4C1im][OAc] was selected as the optimal choice due to its high catalytic activity as well as commercial availability. Afterwards, various copper salts including anhydrous salts of CuCl2, CuBr2, CuSO4, Cu(OAc)2, Cu(OTf)2, CuI, CuOAc, Cu2S, CuBr, CuCl (entries 15–24) and hydrate salts of CuCl2·2H2O, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, CuSO4·5H2O (entries 25–27) were screened in sequence with the optimal [C4C1im][OAc]. To our delight, most of them behaved excellent activity with the yields of 80%-90%. The only case of 50% obtained by CuO was probably due to its poor solubility in the reaction system (entry 19). Moreover, it was worth noting that the water crystalized in Cu salts didn’t affect the catalytic performance (entries 25–27 vs. 7, 15, 17). Generally, the Cu salt hydrates were much more accessible, stable and cheaper than the anhydrous Cu and Ag salts. Therefore, these results were quite beneficial for reducing the cost and increasing the stability of the catalytic system. After evaluations of the catalytic activity, economy, stability and operability, CuSO4·5H2O was eventually selected as the optimal metal salt. Hence, the combination of CuSO4·5H2O and [C4C1im][OAc] was considered as the optimal catalytic system for the hydration reaction. Having identified the optimal catalytic system as well as its reaction conditions (Part 1, supporting information), we further investigated the substrate scope of this CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system (Table 3 ). Satisfactorily, with the catalysis of 0.25 mol% of CuSO4·5H2O and 1 equiv. of [C4C1im][OAc] under 0.1 MPa of CO2, various propargyl alcohols could be smoothly converted into the desired α-hydroxy ketones in moderate to excellent yields, including terminal and internal ones bearing different alkyl, cycloalkyl, vinyl, heterocyclic or aryl substituent groups. It is worth noting that 0.25 mol% is the lowest metal loading ever reported among the metal-catalyzed systems, although a theoretically less active Cu salt was employed herein. In this aspect, this CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system indeed reached our original intention that establishing a highly efficient catalytic system based on the green, economical and stable Cu salts. Additionally, a mimetic flue gas (containing 20 vol% of CO2 and 80 vol% of N2) was employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system under low CO2 partial pressure. Compared with the data collected in high-purity CO2, slightly decreased but acceptable yields could be obtained in this mimetic flue gas by tuning the Cu loading to 0.5 mol% with an extended reaction time (1a and 1f as examples). Notably, this is the first report that the CO2-promoted hydration of propargyl alcohols could be catalyzed under low CO2 partial pressure. Specifically, the investigation results in Table 3 further indicated that the structures of the propargyl alcohols influenced their reactivity in the reaction processes. Generally, higher yields were easily obtained in the cases of substrates bearing less sterically hindered groups (1a-1d). In contrast, the internal propargyl alcohol 1 h and terminal propargyl alcohols with phenyl groups (1 g) required longer reaction time to obtain the relatively high yields. Particularly, it was worth noting that the olefin-functionalized propargyl alcohols (1i and 1j) could be smoothly converted into the corresponding products in comparable yields, indicating the functional group compatibility of this catalytic system and its potential for further application such as polymerization. Furthermore, a satisfactory yield was also reached in the gram-scale experiment based on 1a, which suggested the possible utilization of this catalytic system in the large-scale production of α-hydroxy ketones. Besides the catalytic activity, recyclability and reusability were also considered as important factors in evaluating the practical value of the catalytic systems. Therefore, the following recycling experiment was subsequently performed based on the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 1a, this catalytic system was continuously recycled and reused for 6 times. To our delight, all the recycle rounds steadily gave yields more than 85% in the overall evaluation (Fig. 1 a). Moreover, this system also exhibited considerable recyclability under flue gas atmosphere (Part.4, supporting information). Furthermore, we continued to explore the turnover number (TON) of this catalytic system. In this investigation, excess amounts of 1a and H2O were introduced and the reaction was conducted until the yield no longer increased. Once finished, the desired α-hydroxy ketone was obtained in the yield of 47% with the catalysis of only 40 ppm of Cu loading. Moreover, an unprecedented TON of 11,700 was reached, which was considered as a new record for this reaction (Fig. 1b). After the explorations for its catalytic features, we continued to evaluate the economy of this CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system, which was considered as significant progress compared with our previous reported Ag-catalyzed system. Generally, the real-time prices of the bulky chemical commodities were frequently fluctuated along with the economic or mercantile factors. Therefore, the costs of the catalytic systems could be approximatively evaluated by the relatively constant prices of the common chemical reagents in representative global companies. As an example, the prices of the components in CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system and our previous reported AgOAc/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate system from Sigma-Aldrich (China) were listed in Table 4 . Generally, for the conversion of propargyl alcohols in the same amount, these two systems employed equal moles of metal salts and ILs. However, the price of AgOAc per mmol was approximately 30 times than CuSO4·5H2O. Similarly, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate was also more expensive than [C4C1im][OAc]. This comparison approximatively indicated the economic superiority of CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system. Additionally, the price of CuSO4·5H2O hydrate was only 20% of the anhydrous CuSO4, confirming the advantage of the hydrates salts. Having identified the catalytic activity, recyclability and economy of the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system, we further investigated its catalytic mechanism. It has been reported that the CO2-promoted hydration of propargyl alcohols was probably a tandem reaction, which consisted of cyclization of propargyl alcohols with CO2 and in-situ hydrolysis of the corresponding carbonates generated in the first step [68–71] (Table 1). In order to explore whether the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system followed this mechanism, two control experiments were performed as below. In the first one, CO2 was introduced into a mixture of 1a and CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system, which was allowed to react under its optimal conditions except the addition of H2O. After 12 h, the characteristic peaks of the intermediate α-alkylidene carbonates were successfully observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of this reaction mixture (Fig. 2 a). In the second experiment, pure α-alkylidene carbonates were added with two equivalents of H2O and catalyzed by the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system under the same conditions except the addition of CO2. After 12 h, the final α-hydroxy ketone was also successfully obtained (Fig. 2b). These results indicated that the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] catalyzed CO2-promoted hydration of propargyl alcohols followed the tandem reaction mechanism. Based on the abovementioned tandem mechanism, the key factor that initiated the overall catalysis was subsequently explored. It has been reported that the activation of the hydroxy groups of the propargyl alcohols was the first key step in the catalytic cycle [71,74,75]. Therefore, the component that could accomplish this step was investigated as below. In the 1H NMR spectrum of pure 1a, a sharp and clear peak at δ = 5.30 ppm could be observed, which represented the signal of the unactivated hydroxyl proton in the propargyl alcohol (Fig. 3 a). Once the effective activators such as the reported DBU were added[68], that peak would become broad and shifted, indicating its activated state (Fig. 3b). Based on this, two components of the catalytic system were respectively studied. Obviously, when pure 1a was mixed with 0.25 mol% of CuSO4·5H2O, the characteristic peak didn’t show obvious transformation (Fig. 3c), indicating this CuSO4·5H2O couldn’t accomplish the activation of hydroxyl protons. However, once 1a was mixed with [C4C1im][OAc], this peak became broad and shifted to δ = 6.11 (Fig. 3d), suggesting this activation was successfully realized in this mixture. These results revealed that [C4C1im][OAc] was the key component that accomplished the activation of the hydroxyl groups. Having identified the key activated function of the IL, we then explored the other component in the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system. In the beginning of the reaction, Cu2+ was the initially added metal component. However, it might not be the only existence mode of the versatile Cu compounds. Particularly, Cu2+ was reported as an active catalyst for the coupling reaction of alkynes to produce 1,3-diynes[76–79]. In this coupling catalysis, Cu(II) would be reduced to Cu(I) after the reduction elimination process is implemented[80]. Considering propargyl alcohols are a series of OH-functionalized alkynes, they might also react with the CuSO4·5H2O in the hydration process, following the coupling mechanism and generate Cu(I) species. In order to confirm this hypothesis, propargyl alcohol 1a was mixed with CuSO4·5H2O in [C4C1im][OAc] and the mixture was allowed to stir at 100 °C. Subsequently, the resultant product was directly analyzed by 13C NMR. In the spectrum, the signals of the corresponding 1,3-diyne was clearly observed, especially the characteristic peak of the terminal carbon, which shifted from 70.1 ppm to 84.3 ppm (Fig. 4 a). This result indicated the coupling reaction could occur in the IL circumstance of [C4C1im][OAc]. According to the coupling mechanism, the generation of 1,3-diyne would be accompanied by the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I)[80]. Therefore, XPS analysis was performed to explore the valence states of Cu after this coupling reaction occurred. Indeed, the result showed clear signals of Cu(I), confirming its existence in this process. More explorations for the Cu species were supplied in Part 5 of the supporting information. Subsequently, we further investigated the possible existing forms of the Cu species. According to the previous reports, the imidazole acetate ILs are actually not absolutely inert, especially when they are heated[81,82]. This character brings about many advantages especially when they are employed as catalysts. For example, they might generate free N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and coordinate with the metal catalysts, giving the new highly active NHC-metal complexes[83,84]. For the hydration reaction being studied, the catalytic components contained metal salts and the reaction needed heat, which had in principle met the conditions for the generation of NHC-metal complexes. In order to explore whether these complexes indeed existed in this hydration, a model reaction based on 1a was performed under its optimal conditions. Once the reaction finished, the resultant mixture was directly sampled for HRMS. From the spectrum, a signal that represented a bis-NHC-Cu complex was clearly observed (Fig. 5 ). This result confirmed that the NHC-Cu complexes indeed existed in the corresponding hydration process being studied. Based on the abovementioned researches, one probable mechanism of the CO2-promoted hydration catalyzed by the CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system was speculated (Scheme 1 ). In the first step of cyclization, the basic [OAc] anions in [C4C1im][OAc] activate the CO2 [71,85,86] as well as the hydroxyl groups in propargyl alcohols 1 by the formation of hydrogen bonds, inducing the negative oxygens to attack the positive carbon centers of CO2 molecules (TS). Once the C-O bonds are generated, CO2 is successfully introduced into the organic framework and the negative charge will migrate to the terminal oxygen, which will continue to attack the triple bond activated by the Cu species (I). Finally, the intramolecular cyclization occurs and the protons are given back to the cyclic carbonates (II), generating the key α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates III. In the second step of hydrolysis, carbonates III are hydrolyzed in situ with the catalysis of the basic [OAc] anions and give intermediates IV. Eventually, intermediates IV are rapidly converted into the desired ketones 2 via the keto-enol tautomerization and release one equivalent of CO2 at the same time."
6,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a green and efficient CuSO4·5H2O/[C4C1im][OAc] system was developed for the CO2-promoted hydration of diverse propargyl alcohols under 1 bar of CO2 or mimetic flue gas (20 vol% of CO2). Notably, although a theoretically less active Cu salt was employed herein, this system reached the lowest metal loading ever reported. Moreover, it is the first Cu catalytic system which could be recyclable and reused for at least 6 times with yields higher than 85%. Particularly, a new record of TON (11700) for the target reaction was achieved. In the mechanism study, the acetate IL was proved to be the key factor that activated the propargyl alcohols. Moreover, it was favorable for the generation of a bis-NHC-Cu complex which had been detected during the reaction process."
