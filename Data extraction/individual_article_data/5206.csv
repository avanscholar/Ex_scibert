0,Introduction,"Developing low-cost, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts [1–3] for chemical transformations in energy has attracted great attention due to the worldwide continuously growing energy demands and impending climate change [4,5]. These challenges necessitate the development of clean operating electrochemical energy conversion processes by coupling to renewable electricity [6,7]. An example [8–11] of a power-to-gas process is to split water into hydrogen gas (related to hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) by using electrical power from a rechargeable metal-air battery (related to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER) [12,13]. Electrocatalysts play a key role in these electrochemical reactions because they improve the efficiency and selectivity of the energy transformation involved [14]. The current spectrum of catalysts utilized for these fundamental electrochemical reactions are platinum (Pt) for ORR and HER and iridium (Ir) for applications in OER [15,16]. However, the high cost and limited reserve of these precious metal-based catalysts have precluded the renewable energy technologies from commercialization. To reduce the usage or even to eliminate the precious metal-based catalysts, considerable efforts have been made to develop non-noble metal catalysts for ORR, OER, or HER. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) transition metal (such as Fe, Co, and Ni) sulfides, selenides, nitrides, carbides, phosphides, borides, oxides, hydro(oxy)oxides, and their alloys or complexes have been demonstrated as promising ORR, OER, or HER catalysts [17,18]. So far, however, most of the nonprecious metal catalysts still remain too expensive for large-scale applications or their catalytic activities are still too low when compared with noble metal catalysts [19]. On the other hand, catalysts for different reactions (e.g., ORR, OER, or HER) are usually active and stable at different pH values, which makes the development of integrated energy systems for practical application difficult, if not impossible [20]. Both the ORR and OER under alkaline conditions are thermodynamically more favorable and kinetically less demanding than those under acidic conditions, while HER is more favorable in acidic conditions than alkaline conditions. This dissimilarity poses a problem to the design of an efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst when HER is coupled with ORR/OER in the integrative power-to-gas system, which involves a rechargeable metal-air battery and an overall water splitting process under alkaline conditions. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-cost, durable and efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts to promote the ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously under the same pH environment [21–23]. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), formed by the assembly of metal ions/clusters with electron-donating organic ligands, are very appealing precursors for constructing nanostructured metal (oxide)/carbon and their nanocomposites by taking advantage of the unique thermal behavior and chemical reactivity [24,25]. Thus far, cobalt-based catalysts have been intensively investigated as OER catalysts because of their enhanced conductivity and abundant electrochemically active sites. For instance, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) [26] derived material demonstrated promising OER catalytic activities in alkaline media due to its efficient exposure of catalytic active sites and free diffusion of O2 and electrolyte. Nevertheless, M-N-C catalysts derived from ZIF-67 still have mediocre activity for the ORR, which remains to be undesirable when used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in zinc-air batteries [27,28]. On the other hand, transition metal sulfide (with metal such as Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for HER. That is to say, ZIF-67 and transition metal sulfides can be combined to complement each other's defects and then, through the synergistic effect of both, enhance electrocatalytic activity in ORR, OER and HER to serve as a trifunctional catalyst for zinc-air batteries and overall water splitting, that is, the power-to-gas process [29,30]. Along with the intensive research efforts in developing nonprecious metal catalysts, the metal sulfide nanoparticles (NPs)@MOFs composites were discovered and have received enormous interest in recent years as they possess combined advantages of low cost, high efficient, long lifetime, and multifunctionality [31,32]. Rational design of metal sulfide nanoparticles (NPs)@MOFs composites with multicomponent active centers can in principle lead to multifunctional catalysts for the ORR, OER, and HER [32,33]. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to design and synthesis of a ZIF-67 derived nickel cobalt oxysulfide (referred to as NiCoOS) hollow polyhedron as a highly active trifunctional electrocatalyst for the zinc-air batteries and overall water splitting. The double-metal oxysulfide-based catalyst has special polyhedron morphology, and exhibits excellent trifunctional catalytic performance for ORR, OER and HER."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials synthesis,"2.1 Materials synthesis 2.1.1 Synthesis of ZIF-67 nanocrystals ZIF-67 was prepared according to a reported method. Specifically, 249.0 mg (1.0 mmol) cobalt nitrate hexahydrate or 328.0 mg (4.0 mmol) 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 25.0 mL methanol. These two solutions were then mixed followed by 24 h incubation at room temperature. The resulting ZIF-67 single nanocrystals were collected by several rinse-centrifugation cycles and vacuum-dried overnight. 2.1.2 Synthesis of NiCoO2 hollow polyhedron 40 mg of ZIF-67 and 80 mg of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were added into a round bottom flask with 40 mL of ethanol under a vigorous stirring for 10 min. Subsequently, the mixed solution was heated to 90 °C for 30 min with stirring at the same speed. During the process, the colour of solution was changed into light green from purple. Then, the light green product was collected by centrifugation and washed by ethanol for three times followed by vacuum drying over night, which was named as Ni/ZIF-67. Then the Ni/ZIF-67 powder was heated up to 600 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under N2 atmosphere, with the heating rate of 5 °C min−1. At last, the black powder was collected, and the sample was named as NiCoO2. 2.1.3 Synthesis of NiCoOS hollow polyhedron To obtain pure NiCoOS hollow polyhedron, 20 mg the prepared Ni/ZIF-67 polyhedron and 40 mg Thioacetamide (TAA) were added into 16 mL ethanol under a vigorous stirring for 10 min. And then the solution was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, heated at 90 °C for 60 min, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. After that, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed by ethanol for three times and then dried at 40 °C under vacuum for 8 h to obtain a powder. Then the powder was heated up to 600 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under N2 atmosphere, with the heating rate of 5 °C·min−1. At last, the black powder was collected, and the final catalyst was named as NiCoOS."
3,Physical characterizations,"2.2 Physical characterizations The morphology, particle size and microstructure of the prepared catalyst were analyzed with a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and JEOL-100CX high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) at 150 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses were performed using a Hitachi aberration-corrected STEM HD- 2700 C. An electron probe diameter of 1.3 Å with a convergence angle of 28 mrad was used. The STEM-EELS 2D mapping and EELS line scans were collected with a pixel time of 0.02 s using a Gatan Enfina-ER detector. XPS measurements were carried out by a Thermal Scientific K-Alpha XPS spectrometer. The pore structure was investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements on a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments QuadraSorb SI4) and a Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was used to obtain pore size distribution."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell. The electrocatalytic performances for oxygen reduction (ORR), evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions were measured by a rotating disk electrode in a three-electrode cell at standard temperature and pressure conditions. A glassy carbon disk (GC; 4 mm in diameter) coated with catalyst used as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a graphite rod was reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The glassy carbon disk was cleaned with double distilled water (DD water) and dried at room temperature prior to use. The working thin film electrode was prepared as follows: 2 mg of catalyst and 15 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution were added into 485 μL isopropyl alcohol, and the mixture was treated 10 min with ultrasonication to form uniform dispersion. A measured volume (10 μL) of this mixture was dropped by a micropipette onto the top surface of the GC electrode. The apparent surface area of the GC electrode was 0.1256 cm2. All the measurements were carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution, where O2 or N2 gas was purged for 30 min before ORR, OER or HER measurements, respectively. Galvanostatic discharge and charge cycling of the zinc-air batteries was performed through a recurrent galvanostatic pulse method at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with 40 min per cycle. These galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were recorded using a LAND battery testing station (CT2001A) at room temperature. The electrolyte used was 6 M KOH filled with 0.2 M ZnCl2 to ensure reversible zinc electrochemical reactions at the anode."
5,Results and discussion,"To prepare the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron dodecahedron catalyst, an ZIF-67 polyhedron was successfully synthesized through a one-step self-assembled process, and explored as the template for NiCoOS hollow polyhedron electrocatalyst. The schematic illustration of the formation process of NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst is shown in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the template ZIF-67 was synthesized with the presence of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 2-Methylimidazole. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal dodecahedral structured ZIF-67 solid particles with an average size of 500 nm (Supplementary Fig. S1a-c). The relative intensity and peak positions in the XRD patterns in Fig. S2 further confirm the successful synthesis of ZIF-67. Then, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was used as Ni source and added into the system and the Ni/ZIF-67 was formed under heating 90 °C in the water bath for 30 min. SEM and TEM images (Supplementary Fig. S1d-f) show that the ZIF-67 solid particles with smooth surfaces were converted to hollow polyhedral particles with rough surfaces evolved from loosely packed nanoflakes. The last step features a combined solvothermal reaction at 90 °C for 30 min and calcination at 600 °C for 2 h to convert Ni/ZIF-67 to NiCoOS. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result indicates the presence of CoNiO2 (JCPDS No.10–0188) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Morphologically, the SEM images (Fig. 1b,c) of the obtained NiCoOS particles showed a similar dodecahedral structure to that of Ni/ZIF-67 particles. TEM image (Fig. 1d) further confirms the polyhedral NiCoOS particles are hollow with the outer surface covered by densely packed nanoflakes with porous structure (Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, the interplanar spacings of the 0.210, 0.244 and 0.284 nm can be assigned to (200), (111) and (311) planes of CoNiO2, which is consistent with the XRD result. To further understand the structure of the hollow NiCoOS nanocages, scanning TEM-EDX characterization was conducted to gain elemental composition and distribution information. Fig. 2. shows that the Co, Ni, N, S, O and C elements are uniformly distributed and overlap in the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst, indicating the successful incorporation of Ni and S into the hollow polyhedral structure. It is also evident from the EDX mapping that the polyhedron catalyst has a thin shell with a thickness of around 20 nm. The average atomic ratio of Ni/Co/O/S in the particle was calculated to be 1:2:1:4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to obtain detailed information about the elemental character of the as-prepared NiCoOS samples. The surface survey XPS spectrum of the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst in Fig. 3a indicates that the existence of C, N, O, S, Ni and Co. The high-resolution spectrum in the Co 2p region (Fig. 3b) shows a spin-orbit doublet and two satellite peaks (referred to as Sat.). The peaks at 796.7 and 781.1 eV correspond to Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. Similarly, the Ni 2p region in Fig. 3c features a spin-orbit doublet at 854.0 and 872.6 eV for Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively, along with two shakeup satellites. In the S 2p spectra (Fig. 3d), the peak at 163.2 eV can be assigned to the metal sulfide (Ni-S and Co-S bonding), while the peak at 169.7 eV is attributed to sulfur oxides at the surface of the catalyst. In order to study the electrocatalytic performance of the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were initially carried out in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell in an O2- or N2- saturated 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. As shown in Fig. 4a, a significant characteristic oxygen reduction peak at 0.62 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for NiCoS and NiCoO2 hollow polyhedron catalysts observed in the O2-saturated KOH electrolyte compared to the voltammetry measured in the N2-saturated electrolyte. And NiCoOS exhibits a better electrocatalytic activity with higher peak electric current density than NiCoO2. As shown in Fig. 4b, the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron exhibits excellent ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.88 V and a half-wave potential of 0.79 V. These values are better than those of the NiCoO2 and ZIF-67 catalysts, although are inferior than those of the Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S5a). The ORR kinetics of NiCoS hollow polyhedron catalyst was also investigated according to the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves measured at different rotational rates from 400 to 2025 rpm (Fig. 4c). The K–L plots (Fig. 4d) of the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst over 0.2–0.6 V indicate 4-electron reduction pathways based on the estimated electron transfer number of 3.9 per O2 molecule. Fig. 4e,f and Fig. S5b,c show OER, HER polarization curves using different catalyst of NiCoOS hollow polyhedron(Ⅰ), NiCoO2 (Ⅱ) and ZIF-67(Ⅲ), where the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron exhibits better performance over the other two catalysts. The oxidation peak of the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst at around 1.5 V (vs. RHE) could be ascribed to the S-facilitated pseudocapacitive reaction (NiCoOS + OH− → NiCoOS(OH)+e−) that generates intermediate sulfates upon exposure to KOH electrolyte during the anodic polarization. The OER onset potential is around 1.62 V and the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 470 mV. Furthermore, the polarization curve of HER shows decent HER catalytic activity for the NiCoOS catalyst, with an onset potential of about 0.25 V. The corresponding overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is about 300 mV, which is lower than those of the control samples. These results reveal that partial S substitution in the NiCoOS catalyst facilitates its catalytic activity for the ORR, OER and HER. Fig. 4g-i show the stability test for ORR, OER, and HER, respectively. Moreover, the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst exhibits better stabilities towards the ORR, OER and HER, respectively, without significant losses in activity after 800 cycles of CV test in 0.1 M KOH solutions. The superior trifunctional electrocatalytic activities of the NiCoOS catalyst for ORR, OER and HER, prompt us to construct an integrated power-to-hydrogen electrochemical device consisting of a rechargeable zinc-air battery-powered water-splitting cell. Considering the decent ORR and OER catalytic activities of the NiCoOS catalyst, we fabricated a zinc-air battery using NiCoOS for the air cathode. Fig. 5a displays discharge and charge polarization curves of the rechargeable zinc-air battery using the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron electrodes. The battery can deliver a relatively high current density of 20 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.0 V and a high peak power density of 90 mW cm−2. Moreover, the NiCoOS battery can stably cycled over 170 h without visible voltage losses under glavanostatic charge-discharge cycling at 5 mA cm −2(Fig. 5b), indicative of the excellent stability and robustness of the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron catalyst electrode. Fig. 5c display that a water-splitting device using two NiCoOS-coated carbon cloth electrodes can be powered by two zinc–air batteries in series and appreciable hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles are sustainably produced in two separate electrodes, respectively (Fig. 5d-e and supporting video). The water electrolyzer can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a relatively low overpotential of 1.52 V (Fig. 5f). Moreover, under the potential of 1.52 V, the electrolyzer can maintain superior stability over 15 h without voltage drop (Fig. 5g).

6,Conclusion,"In summary, NiCoOS hollow polyhedron electrocatalysts were successfully designed and synthesized by sulfurizing the ZIF-67 that serve as the template. The obtained catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity for ORR and OER in alkaline medium, and outstanding durability owing to their unique surface structures. In addition, the catalysts also exhibit outstanding catalytic performance and good stability for HER. The results suggest that the NiCoOS hollow polyhedron electrocatalyst can be a low-cost, efficient trifunctional catalyst for direct use in the zinc-air battery-powered electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen gas production."
