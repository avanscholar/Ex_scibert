0,Introduction,"Fuel cells, which exhibit lots of merits such as high energy efficiency and low pollution, have been regarded as an environment-friendly energy [1,2]. However, how to supply H2 to the fuel cells is still a remaining problem. Employment of tanks with ready-made high pressure H2 seems feasible, but it will greatly increase the cost and the danger induced by H2 leak. To solve this problem, onboard supply of H2 is proposed via catalytic reforming routes using H2-containing materials as reactants, such as alkanes, alcohols and ethers [3–5]. The efficiency for hydrogen production onboard from reforming processes is crucial to the application and commercialization of hydrogen-based fuel cells. Steam reforming (SR) has been proved to be a potential route for H2 production due to its high H2 yield and good product quality. By now, many kinds of H2-containing raw materials have been employed for hydrogen production through SR routes, such as ethanol, methanol and DME. Among them, ethanol SR needs relatively high temperature and may produce CH4 or coke. Methanol SR (MSR) can operate at lower temperature, giving high-quality products; however, the toxicity of methanol limits its application. Compared with methanol or ethanol, DME is a better candidate for hydrogen production via SR process since it has higher H/C ratio and no toxicity. In addition, DME molecule has no C–C bond, which can greatly inhibit the formation of coke during DME reforming [6]. DME SR contains two successive reactions including DME hydrolysis to methanol and the subsequent methanol SR (MSR) to H2 and CO2 [7]. An important side reaction is the reverse water gas shift reaction (r-WGS), which takes place over MSR catalysts [8]. Some other side reactions, such as decomposition of DME and methanol, may also occur during DME SR process [8], as shown below. DME SR (1) (CH3)2O + 3H2O → 6H2 + 2CO2 ΔH Ө = 135 kJ mol−1 DME hydrolysis (2) (CH3)2O + H2O → 2CH3OHΔH Ө = 37 kJ mol−1 Methanol SR (3) CH3OH + H2O → 3H2 + CO2 ΔH Ө = 49 kJ mol−1 r-WGS (4) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2OΔH Ө = 41 kJ mol−1 DME decomposition (5) CH3OCH3 → CH4 + CO + H2 ΔH Ө = −1 kJ mol−1 Methanol decomposition (6) CH3OH → 2H2 +COΔH Ө = 91 kJ mol−1 Solid acids, especially heteropoly acid, zeolite and alumina, are often used for the hydrolysis of DME to methanol [9–11], while metallic catalysts such as Cu-based ones [7,12,13] or Zn-based ones [14–16] are employed for MSR. Although Cu-containing catalysts are highly active for MSR, they exhibit low thermal stability and unsatisfactory durability due to the easy agglomeration of copper species at high temperature. So, in recent years copper-free catalysts are getting more and more attention. It has been reported that Zn-based catalysts possess high CO2-selectivity and high catalytic stability in MSR reaction [14,15] and DME SR reaction [16]. However, compared with Cu-based catalysts, Zn-based catalysts usually run at relatively high temperature. In order to simultaneously increase the catalytic activity and decrease the reaction temperature, further modification of Zn-based catalysts is necessary. Since CeO2 possesses good redox property, high oxygen storage capacity and strong interaction with other components [17], in this work it was selected to partially substitute the Al in ZnO–Al2O3 oxides to prepare the ternary oxide catalysts ZnAlCe x . It is shown that this series of catalysts display remarkably improved catalytic performance for DME SR, especially the very low selectivity to CO. Several techniques were employed to characterize these catalysts, such as XRD, XANES, EXAFS, H2O-TPD, CH3OH-TPD and TPSR. Based upon the results of activity and multiple characterizations, the effect of CeO2 substitution on the catalytic performance and catalyst structures was revealed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Co-precipitation method was used for the preparation of ZnAlCeO oxides. Firstly, according to the contents of Zn, Al and Ce in the catalysts, a mixed solution of metal nitrates was prepared. Then, the mixed solution and aqueous ammonia were added dropwise into a stirred flask containing 100 mL deionized water. The pH was kept around 7.5 during the precipitation process. The precipitate was aged in the mother liquid at 70 °C for 2 h, and subsequently washed with 70 °C deionized water for 3 times. After drying at 120 °C overnight, the precipitate was calcinated at 500 °C for 4 h to form the ternary oxides ZnAlCe x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3, x represents the content of CeO2 by weight). In these oxides, the content of ZnO and the total content of CeO2 and Al2O3 were fixed at 40 wt% and 60 wt%, respectively. Before use, a mixture of ZnAlCe x and γ-Al2O3 with the weight ratio of 3:1 was mixed, pressed, crushed and sieved to 40–60 mesh."
3,Catalytic activity and stability measurements,"2.2 Catalytic activity and stability measurements The catalytic performance evaluation of the ZnAlCe x for DME SR was conducted in a conventional quartz tube reactor under atmospheric pressure. Each time, 500 mg sample was used. The mixed stream of 40 mL min−1 N2, 50 mL min−1 H2O (g) and 10 mL min−1 DME was purveyed to the catalyst bed. The analysis of reactants and products was performed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph. The DME conversion, H2 yield and C1 selectivity are used to evaluate the performance of these catalysts as described elsewhere [8,18]. The stability of the catalyst was evaluated by using a continuous start-off test, in which 14 h cyclic heating to 420 °C and cooling to RT in the DME SR feed stream was performed on the catalyst to observe the alteration of DME conversion."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization A Quantachrome QuadraSorb SI instrument was used to measure the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. The samples were evacuated at 300 °C for 6 h to remove the physisorbed substances. The BET method was used to calculate the specific surface area (S BET). Pore volume and average pore diameter of the samples were calculated by using BJH method. The crystalline phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D8 diffractometer (Bruker Company) using Cu Kα as radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The patterns were collected at 40 kV and 40 mA. The 2θ scanning range is 20–90° with a stepsize of 0.02°. CH3OH pulse adsorption, the temperature-programmed desorption of H2O (H2O-TPD) or CH3OH (CH3OH-TPD) as well as the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) were all conducted on the TP-5079 instrument equipped with a mass spectrometry (Hiden HPR20). The procedures are similar to those in literature [19]. For H2O-TPD experiments, 50 mg powder sample was first loaded into the quartz tube reactor and then heated to 400 °C for half an hour pretreatment in helium (50 mL min−1) so as to ensure a clean surface. After the catalyst bed cooled to 100 °C, pulses of deionized water (1.0 μL) (repeated 5 times with 1 min interval) were purveyed into the catalyst bed. To removal the gaseous water in reaction system, the sample cell was flushed with pure helium for another hour at 100 °C. Subsequently, the sample cell was heated to 600 °C (10 °C min−1) for water desorption. During CH3OH pulse adsorption and CH3OH-TPD, the catalyst (50 mg) pretreatment is the same as that for H2O-TPD. After the catalyst bed cooled to ambient temperature, pulses of CH3OH (1.0 μL) were injected into the catalyst bed repeatedly (30-min interval between each injection) until the signal of mass spectrometry for CH3OH was not changed any more. Finally, the sample was heated to 700 °C (10 °C min−1) for MeOH desorption. In TPSR experiments, the catalyst (50 mg) was first pretreated at 400 °C for 30 min, after the temperature was decreased to 100 °C, the pulse adsorption of deionized water (5 μL) was carried out; to remove the physisorbed and gaseous H2O, the catalyst bed was flushed with pure helium for 1 h; in the next, methanol (5 μL) was also injected for adsorption, after a similar helium flushing for 30 min, the sample was heated to 700 °C (10 °C min−1). No HCHO was detected during this period. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the catalysts were measured on the XAFS station in the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) using a Si(111) double-crystal as monochromator. The Zn K-edge spectra of ZnAlCe x , ZnO and ZnAl2O4 were collected at an average ring current of 200 mA in transmission mode. During measurements, zinc foil was used to calibrate the energy. The obtained spectra were back-subtracted and converted to k space. Then the Fourier transforming was performed on the k 3-weighted EXAFS data (k = 3–13 Å−1) using a Hanning window function to get the radial structure functions (RSFs)."
5,Results,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance 3.1.1 DME SR The catalytic performance of the catalysts for DME SR is shown in Fig. 1 . The content of Ce has a significant influence on the catalytic activity. The catalyst ZnAlCe0.2 exhibits the best activity for DME conversion. At 400 °C, the DME conversion over ZnAlCe0.2 is 90.1%, much higher than that of the catalyst without Ce. Arrhenius plots for DME SR over ZnAlCe0 and ZnAlCe0.2 are acquired from the rates of DME consumption over 50 mg ZnAlCe x catalysts between 360 °C and 440 °C, which are displayed in Fig. 2 . Rather good linearity is observed; from the slope of lines, apparent activation energies (E a) were determined, as shown in Table 1 . It is observed that doping of 20 wt% CeO2 into ZnAlCe x catalyst induces a substantial decrease in Ea (11.4 kJ mol−1 difference), which is in good agreement with the enhanced catalytic activity. Assuming that the MeOH chemisorption sites (estimated from the CH3OH pulse adsorption) were the active site for DME SR, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of the catalysts were calculated. As seen in Table 1, with the increase of Ce content from 0 to 20 wt%, the TOF increases from 0.013 to 0.034 s−1, indicating an obvious enhancement effect of Ce on DME SR. However, as the Ce amount increases from 20 to 30 wt%, DME conversion decreases, which is consistent with the increased Ea (from 184.1 to 186.2 kJ mol−1). The H2 yield versus reaction temperature is shown in Fig. 3 . It is found that the effect of Ce addition on H2 yield is similar to that on DME conversion; the catalyst containing 20 wt% CeO2 gives the highest H2 yield. During DME SR reaction, C1 species in the effluent gas were also monitored. No methanol was found above 350 °C, suggesting that the hydrolysis of DME to methanol may be the rate-determining step (RDS) for the whole DME SR reaction. Since the CH4 selectivity (<1%) is always very low and neglectable, CO2 and CO are regarded as the main C1 products during reaction. The correlation between CO selectivity and reaction temperature is depicted in Fig. 4 . Our previous work on Cu catalysts [18] has shown that Cu-based catalysts always exhibit high CO selectivity (∼20%) when DME reaches full conversion, but on ZnAlCe0 catalyst it is only ∼9%. After Ce addition, CO selectivity is further lowered, probably due to the improved oxidation performance of the catalysts containing Ce. 3.1.2 DME decomposition To further investigate the function of Ce addition, DME decomposition over ZnAlCe x in the absence of water was conducted, the results of which are shown in Fig. 5 . According to Eq. (5), DME decomposition reaction can generate the byproducts CH4 and CO, which are not expected. From Fig. 5, it is observed that the order of DME conversion in DME decomposition reaction for different catalysts is different from that in DME SR. As the content of CeO2 increases, the DME decomposition activity decreases dramatically. The DME conversion during its decomposition over ZnAlCe0 is as high as 21.4% at 400 °C, while it is only 3.2% over ZnAlCe0.3 at the same temperature. Generally, Al3+ in the ZnAlO catalysts is responsible for DME decomposition reaction [16]. Thus, the gradually decreased DME conversion may be attributed to the decreased content of Al2O3. During DME SR the very low CH4 selectivity (<1%) suggests that the decomposition of DME is neglectable, and that the existence of water may have restrained the DME decomposition."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization 3.2.1 Texture and XRD characterization The SBET and pore volume of ZnAlCe x samples are listed in Table 1. It is found that the partial substitution of Al by Ce decreases the S BET. The surface area of ZnAlCe0 is 158 m2 g−1, while it is only 80 m2 g−1 for ZnAlCe0.3. It is known that Al2O3 often possesses much higher surface area than CeO2; so, the gradually decreased surface area may be due to the reduction of Al2O3 content. The XRD patterns displayed in Fig. 6 indicate that all the ZnAlCe x samples exhibit a group of diffraction peaks at 36.3, 31.8, 34.4 and 62.9°, meaning the presence of zincite phase. The ZnAl2O4 phase is also observed for all the catalysts. Ce species in the ZnAlCe x mainly exist as cubic CeO2 phase. With the increase of Ce content the diffraction peaks for both ZnAl2O4 and ZnO gradually decreases; the former may be caused by the reduction of Al2O3 content, while the later may be due to the decline of ZnO crystallite size. 3.2.2 Zn K-edge XANES and RSFs In order to reveal the micro-structures of Zn species in the catalysts, Zn K-edge XANES and EXAFS characterizations were conducted. Fig. 7 (a) shows the XANES spectra of ZnO, ZnAl2O4 and ZnAlCe x samples. As reported in literature [20], the spectrum of pure ZnO exhibits a 1s → 4p absorption peak at about 9667 eV, while that of ZnAl2O4 shows the peaks at about 9663 and 9671 eV. For ZnAlCe x catalysts, all of the three peaks are observed, suggesting the co-existence of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 in the catalysts, which is supported by the XRD results. With the increase of Ce content, the peaks centered at 9663 and 9671 eV get weaker while the peak at about 9667 eV turns stronger, which implies that the content of ZnO increases, while that of ZnAl2O4 decreases. The RSFs of the catalysts derived from Zn K-edge EXAFS data are shown in Fig. 7(b). The peaks at 0.154 and 0.289 nm for ZnO are attributed to Zn–O and Zn–Zn coordination shells, while those for ZnAl2O4 appear at 0.154 nm (Zn–O) and 0.305 nm (Zn–Al/Zn–Zn), respectively. For the catalysts ZnAlCe x , the first peak (Zn–O) also appears at the same position, but the second one (0.298 nm) is observed between 0.289 and 0.305 nm, which suggests that the Zn in these catalysts should exist in a mixture state of ZnO and ZnAl2O4, as demonstrated by XRD and EXAFS results. However, compared with the reference compounds, the catalysts ZnAlCe x exhibit much weaker amplitude for the second coordination peaks, implying the much smaller crystallite size of Zn species in the catalysts. Additionally, by careful observation it can still be found that the Ce-containing catalysts also exhibit a little weaker amplitude for the second coordination peaks than ZnAlCe0 without Ce (see the inset in Fig. 7(b)). This result further demonstrates that the introduction of Ce to ZnAlO catalysts can effectively decrease the crystallite size of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 phases. 3.2.3 H2O-TPD The TPD spectra of the catalysts after water adsorption are presented in Fig. 8 (a). It is reported that water often adsorbs dissociatively on oxide surface, forming surface hydroxyl groups [21,22], as described in Eq. (7), where A site represents the metal ion, while B site stands for the oxygen ion. In the catalysts ZnAlCe x , surface Zn2+ ions and lattice oxygen ions may serve as site A and site B, respectively. Two desorption peaks are detected for all the catalysts. The first peak (∼210 °C) could be assigned to the desorption of adsorbed H2O in molecular state, while the second peak appearing at high temperature (above 470 °C) may correspond to the desorption of the water produced from the interaction of surface –OH groups. As the content of Ce increases, both of the two desorption peaks decrease, meaning that the doping of Ce inhibits H2O adsorption to some extent, probably due to the decreased S BET of ZnAlCe x catalysts. However, the presence of Ce seems favorable to H2 desorption. From the H2O-TPD profiles shown in Fig. 8(b), it is seen that the Ce-containing catalysts exhibit lower H2 desorption temperature. On the surface of oxides, the hydrogen desorption often takes place via the interaction of surface hydroxyl groups, as illustrated in Eq. (8) [23]. The addition of Ce may facilitate the decomposition of surface –OH species. (7) H2O + A + B ↔ HO(A) + H(B) (A: metal ion; B: surface O) (8) 2Zn2+–O(H)–Zn2+ ↔ 2Zn2+–O–Zn2+ + H2 (9) CH3OH + (A) + (B) ↔ CH3O(A) + H(B) (A: metal ion; B: surface O) 3.2.4 CH3OH pulse adsorption and CH3OH-TPD To further understand the interaction between CH3OH and ZnAlCe x catalysts, CH3OH pulse adsorption and CH3OH-TPD were conducted, the results of which are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 9 . Similar to water adsorption on ZnAlCe x , the profile of methanol adsorption may be described as Eq. (9). As the Ce content increases from 5 wt% to 20 wt%, the catalysts exhibit increasing CH3OH adsorption capacity, suggesting that the doped CeO2 can strongly interact with methanol; however, as it is further increased from 20 wt% to 30 wt%, the CH3OH adsorption capacity obviously drops from 0.260 to 0.178 mmol g−1, probably due to the agglomeration of CeO2 and the decrease of SBET of the sample (from 111 to 80 m2 g−1). As seen from Fig. 9, the methanol desorption occurs at ∼100 °C over all the catalysts. This desorption feature is similar to that on ZnO [24]. Except for CH3OH, other products such as H2O, H2, CO and CO2 were also monitored. Two H2O desorption peaks centered at 200–250 °C and 600–700 °C are detected. Considering that the positions of these two desorption peaks are very similar to that of H2O desorption during H2O-TPD, the first peak is attributed to the desorption of water molecule formed during methanol adsorption, while the second one may correspond to the water from the interaction of surface –OH groups. With the increase of Ce content, the H2 desorption peak shifts to lower temperature and gets sharper, which also indicate that the existence of Ce is favorable to the desorption of H2. It is worth noting that nearly no CO signal is detected for all the catalysts, similar to the CH3OH-TPD of Au/CeO2 catalysts [25]. So, it is deduced that the CO formed during DME SR process (as shown in Section 3.1.1) may be produced from other CO-related reactions. In order to further understand the interaction between CH3OH and catalyst surface, TPSR characterization was also carried out, as elucidated in next section. 3.2.5 TPSR characterization The TPSR profiles for the co-adsorption of H2O and CH3OH on the selected catalysts ZnAlCe0 and ZnAlCe0.2 are shown in Fig. 10 (a) and (b), respectively. After water adsorption, the CH3OH pulse adsorption was carried out. It is found that during CH3OH injection, H2O can be detected in the effluent gas (not shown), which means that methanol may compete the adsorption sites with water molecule, causing the desorption of some adsorbed H2O, similar to the situation for H-ZSM-5 [26]. Fig. 10(a) depicts the TPSR results of ZnAlCe0 catalysts. It can be seen that the main desorption products are methanol and water before 219 °C. Further increase of the temperature would cause the simultaneous formation of H2 and CO2. When the temperature is increased to 390 °C, no H2 is detected, instead, H2O is found in the effluent gas. The TPSR profiles of ZnAlCe0.2 are shown in Fig. 10(b). It is found that although the Ce addition to ZnAlO catalyst inhibits the adsorption/desorption of H2O, the peaks of H2 and CO2 get much stronger. Moreover, the temperature for the peaks of H2 and CO2 desorption becomes lower (from 330 to 302 °C). These results can be logically correlated with the DME SR activity of Ce-containing catalysts."
8,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability The stability of the catalysts is rather important for practical application. So, start-off stability test was performed on the catalyst ZnAlCe0.2, in which 14 h cyclic heating to 420 °C and cooling to RT in the DME SR feed stream was performed. The results shown in Fig. 11 indicate that this catalyst possesses very high stability. During the start-off test, as the temperature is increased to 420 °C the activity is almost recovered to the initial level without obvious change. In a summary, the catalyst ZnAlCe0.2 possesses not only high catalytic activity including high DME conversion and high CO2 selectivity but also high stability, which makes it promising for practical hydrogen production via DME SR."
9,Discussion,
10,"Physicochemical properties, methanol-TPD and reaction mechanism","4.1 Physicochemical properties, methanol-TPD and reaction mechanism The mixed ZnAlCe x and Al2O3 has been proved to be highly active for DME SR reaction. The introduction of Ce to ZnAlO oxide decreases the Al content in the catalyst, leading to the decrease of S BET; the larger Ce content, the smaller specific surface area. Meanwhile, with the decrease of Al content in the substituted samples the amount of spinel ZnAl2O4 decreases, making more zinc exist in the form of ZnO as demonstrated by XRD (Fig. 6), XANES (Fig. 7(a)). The existence of Ce also decreases the crystallite size of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 as elucidated by the results of XRD (Fig. 6) and RSFs from EXAFS (Fig. 7(b)). The promotional effect of Ce on the dispersion of zinc species has also been revealed in CeO2–ZnO binary oxide systems [27,28]. Between ceria and zinc oxide there may exist interaction. However, no peak shift is observed for ZnO and CeO2 phases in the XRD patterns (Fig. 6), which suggests that no detectable solid solution or complex oxides are formed. It is known that XRD can only detect the bulk phases, the small amounts of interaction phases at the interface of CeO2 and ZnO is hard to be detected by XRD. It is proposed that the addition of Ce to ZnO could cause the formation of interstitial Zn x Ce4+ 1−2x Ce3+ 2x O2 solid solution on ZnO matrix [27–29]. In this work, the interstitial Zn x Ce4+ 1−2x Ce3+ 2x O2 solid solution may be also formed at the boundary region due to the substitution of some Ce4+ (0.087 nm) by smaller Zn2+ (0.074 nm). During methanol-TPD, the simultaneous release of H2 and CO2 rather than H2 and CO was observed, indicating that the oxidation of methanol on ZnAlCe x is the major pathway while the direct decomposition of methanol to CO and H2 is not the dominant one. It is reported that during methanol-TPD over dehydroxylated ZnO (pretreated with pure He at 825 K), only a small CO2 peak was observed, and the decomposition of methanol to CO and H2 is the main reaction [24]. However, in this work, the ZnAlCe x catalysts contain a significant amount of Al2O3, which possesses lots of surface –OH groups. According to literature [30], even after vacuum degassing at 400 °C it is hard to remove the –OH groups over Al2O3 surface, especially the isolated and some associated hydroxyl groups. Thus, it is believed that there is abundance of surface hydroxyl groups on ZnAlCe x catalysts before methanol adsorption. When the pulse of methanol was introduced to the catalyst bed, methanol could be dissociatively adsorbed on the active site. With the increase of the temperature of catalyst bed, the adsorbed methanol may react with hydroxyl groups to form CO2 and H2, as shown in Eq. (10). (10) CH 3 OH + − OH ( A ) → CO 2 + 5 2 H 2 + A The MSR mechanisms on Cu-based catalysts have been extensively investigated and discussed in literature [31,32]. It is assumed that two kinds of active sites are necessary for MSR reaction, the active site A (metal ions) is responsible for the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates such as CH3O and the active site B (lattice oxygen ions) is responsible for hydrogen extraction from the above-mentioned intermediates [31]. It is know that the key steps of methanol synthesis reaction are the H2 dissociative adsorption on Cu particles, and the following transfer of atomic H to the oxide surface by spillover [23]. So, the MSR reaction on Cu-based catalysts may be accomplished by the spillover of atomic H onto the Cu sites and the subsequent formation of H2 through the combination of atomic H. As to the MSR reaction mechanism over Zn-based catalysts, the Zn2+–O–Zn2+ linkages should be responsible for H2 formation based on the H2O-TPD results. The reaction mechanism of MSR over Zn-based catalysts could be described as Eqs. (7)–(14) and Scheme 1 . Methanol generated by DME hydrolysis may be adsorbed dissociatively onto the active site A and B, then the CH3O(A) species dehydrogenate to form adsorbed HCHO, followed by a nucleophilic attack of H2O to produce adsorbed HCOOH, which can decompose to H2 and CO2. The TPSR results (Fig. 10) have demonstrated that H2 and CO2 always desorb simultaneously, indicating that the intermediate formed by methanol dehydrogenation should react quickly to generate H2 and CO2; as a result, their desorption temperatures are always close to each other. Based upon the above discussion, the methanol dehydrogenation (Eq. (11)) is believed to be the rate-determining step (RDS), similar to the situation for MSR reaction over Cu-based catalysts reported in literature [32]. (11) CH3O(A) + H(B) ↔ CH2O(A) + H2 + (B) (12) CH2O(A) + HO(A) + (B) ↔ HCOOH(A) + H(B) + (A) (13) H(B) + H(B) ↔ H2 + 2(B) (14) HCOOH(A) ↔ CO2 + H2 + (A)"
11,Activity and selectivity correlation,"4.2 Activity and selectivity correlation The activity results (Fig. 1) have shown that over Ce-substituted samples the DME conversion is increased with Ce content increasing up to 20 wt%. It is found that during H2O-TPD the H2 desorption temperature is decreased with Ce content increasing up to 20 wt%. In addition, the H2 desorption peak for Ce-containing catalysts is sharper as seen in CH3OH-TPD profiles (Fig. 9). The function of Ce may be related to the capability of Ce–O bonds for the production of H δ− and H δ+ species [23,33]. With the increase of Ce content, the CO2 desorption peaks shift to lower temperatures, indicating that the addition of Ce also facilitates the desorption of CO2. According to the reaction mechanism, the active site A is occupied by the oxygen-containing species such as CH3O, HCOOH and CO2. The desorption of CO2 could release the active site A, enhancing the re-adsorption of methanol on the active site and thus promoting the reaction. On the basis of these results, it is deduced that the higher activity of Ce-substituted catalysts could be attributed to their better H2 desorption capability and better CO2 desorption capability. According to the discussion of physicochemical properties, the introduction of Ce into ZnAlO may facilitate the formation of interstitial Zn x Ce4+ 1−2x Ce3+ 2x O2 solid solution at the boundary of CeO2 and Zn species. The formed interstitial Zn x Ce4+ 1−2x Ce3+ 2x O2 solid solution contains abundance of Ce4+–O–Zn2+ linkages. As discussed in the reaction mechanism, hydrogen extraction from methanol or other intermediates is conducted on the lattice oxygen ions, such as the oxygen in Zn2+–O–Zn2+ linkage of the ZnAlCe0 catalyst and in the Ce4+–O–Zn2+ linkage of the Ce-containing catalysts. During MSR process, the Ce4+–O–Zn2+ linkage is believed to be more active than the Zn2+–O–Zn2+ linkage for the extraction of H atom from CH3OH molecule to form Ce4+–O(H)–Zn2+ or Zn2+–O(H)–Zn2+ species. It means that the presence of Ce may improve the MSR activity by enhancing the rate-determining step. Higher Ce content than 20 wt% would bring a detrimental influence on the adsorption of H2O and methanol (Table 1) due to the significant decrease of specific surface area (from 111 to 80 m2 g−1). Through calculation, it is found that with Ce content increasing from 0 to 30 wt%, the TOF increases from 0.013 to 0.035 s−1. This is consistent with the CH3OH-TPD results, which indicate that the H2 desorption temperature decreases from 323 to 296 °C with Ce content increasing from 0 to 30 wt%. The apparent activation energy Ea (Table 1) of the ZnAlCe x catalysts for DME SR is in the range of 184.1–195.5 kJ mol−1, which is a little higher than that (150–160 kJ mol−1) for Cu-based catalysts [18,33]. For MSR over Zn-based catalyst, much higher apparent activation energy (∼144 kJ mol−1) was also found [14], as compared with that (76.9–85.7 kJ mol−1) for Cu-based catalyst [31]. In this work, the presence of 20% Ce in ZnAlCe x catalysts can decrease the activation energy from 195.5 kJ mol−1 to 184.1 kJ mol−1, suggesting the alteration of active sites or reaction pathways, e.g., the appearance of Ce4+–O–Zn2+ linkages. In a summary, the introduction of Ce (≤20 wt%) to ZnAlO catalysts can facilitate the dehydrogenation of methanol, decreasing the activation energy and increasing the TOF of DME SR; as a result, the catalytic activity including DME conversion and H2 yield is improved. From CO/CO2 selectivity profiles displayed in Fig. 4(a) and (b), we can see that the CO2 selectivity is much higher than that for the byproduct CO. It is reported that DME SR reaction over Cu-based catalysts is accomplished by MSR reaction, followed by the r-WGS reaction, which is the main source of CO [7,34]. In this work, the CO concentrations in the products are much lower than the equilibrium concentration. Thus, CO may be not formed through methanol decomposition, probably via the r-WGS reaction. This deduction is strongly supported by the TPSR results, in which nearly no CO was detected in the effluent gas. After Ce addition CO selectivity is lowered but CO2 selectivity is increased, indicating the enhanced formation of CO2 rather than CO, which is also evidenced by the results of CH3OH-TPD (Fig. 9), namely, the desorption peak of CO2 becomes sharper when Ce is doped into the Zn-based catalyst. The Ce addition is favorable to the redox property of the catalysts, which accounts for the enhanced CO2 formation during DME SR [17]."
12,Conclusion,"The as-prepared mixed oxide catalysts ZnAlCe x with Al partially substituted by Ce possess rather high catalytic activity for DME SR to produce H2. The DME conversion, H2 yield, CO selectivity and the stability of the ZnAlCe x catalysts are largely dependent on Ce content. The optimized content of Ce in ZnAlCe x is 20 wt%. XRD and EXAFS results reveal that the introduction of Ce to ZnAlO oxide not only inhibits the transformation of ZnO to spinel ZnAl2O4, but also enhances the dispersion of Zn species. H2O-TPD and CH3OH-TPD results reveal that the partial substitution of Al by Ce can facilitate the generation of H2 and CO2, which is highly related to the better catalytic performance of Ce-containing catalysts for DME SR. The methanol dehydrogenation is identified to be the rate-determining step of MSR over Zn-based catalysts. The decrease of apparent activation energy (E a) induced by the Ce addition suggests the formation of new reaction sites such as the Ce4+–O–Zn2+ linkages at the oxides interface."
