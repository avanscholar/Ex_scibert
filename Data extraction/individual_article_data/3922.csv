0,Introduction,"The natural affinity of silver reagents for halogens (halogenophilicity) is often exploited in substitution reactions of organohalides [1–3] and in transmetallation reactions [4–6]. In addition, silver triflate is commonly utilized in both coordination and organometallic chemistry to abstract halogens from metal halides in synthetic applications and for in situ metal “activation” in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions [7,8]. Until recently, it has generally been accepted that the silver halide salt (AgX ; X = halogen) precipitates from the reaction as an innocent by-product when used for in situ applications. With numerous studies involving direct Ag-mediated organic reactions, including those with non-halogenated substrates, such as heterocyclization [9], oxidative dehydrodimerization of aromatic compounds [10,11], and olefin isomerization [12]/dimerization [13], it is surprising that the potential reactivity of AgOTf was often overlooked in its in situ applications. Only recently have reports surfaced that highlight the potential of generating a strong Brønsted Acid (triflic acid; HOTf) from AgOTf [14,15] and other metal triflates [16,17,18]. Indeed, several reaction systems that claim to be catalyzed by Lewis acidic metals can be effectively performed with simple Brønsted Acids [18]. These reports have established new insights that brings into question the role of AgOTf in purported AgOTf-mediated processes that mirror Brønsted acid catalyzed mechanisms including inter/intramolecular hydro-alkoxylation [19–23] and -amination reactions [7,8,24,25]. During our recent examination of a ruthenium(II) complex [(BPA)RuBr(PPh3)2; BPA = bis(pyrazolyl)acetate] [26] for use in Oppenauer alcohol oxidation catalysis [27,28], aided by silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (aka silver triflate, AgOTf, {OTf = -O3SCF3}) for in situ activation (Fig. 1 ), only dehydration and vinyl hydrovinylation coupling products were observed. After exhaustive control experiments, it was determined that the ruthenium complex played no part in the observed reactivity, but instead AgOTf was solely responsible. Herein, we describe observed conditions that promote the generation of triflic acid from AgOTf and report yet another account where this “hidden” Brønsted acid catalyzes unexpected reactions. In this account, the acid catalyzes dehydration of benzylic alcohols, dimerization of styrene, and electrophilic aromatic substitution."
1,Materials and methods,
2,General,2.1 General All commercially available chemicals were purchased and used as received without further purifications. All reactions were performed in air unless otherwise noted. The ampoules of dioxane‑d 8 were used as received and broken immediately before conducting each NMR scale experiment. Larger scaled reactions were stirred at 900 RPM due to the poor solubility of AgOTf in dioxane. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum-100 FTIR as thin-films on NaBr plates or ATR methods. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECS300 FT 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. All 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra are referenced against residual proton signals (1H NMR) and chemical shifts are recorded in ppm (δ). Coupling constants (JHH values) are reported in Hz. Gas chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) samples were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 7890 GC system using an Agilent 191015-44 column and mass spectra were recorded on a 5975C VL MSD quadruple mass spectrometry system with a Triple-Axis detector. All GC–MS samples were introduced via split injection with a two-minute hold time at 80 °C and a temperature ramp of 15 °C/minute over a range of 50–250 °C. Column chromatography purifications were performed using silica gel Sorbent Technology 40–63 μm. X-ray diffraction measurements were made on a Rigaku XtaLAB mini diffractometer. Experimental details are provided in the Supporting Information. Reported yields were determined by 1H NMR using internal standards (either mesitylene or ortho-dinitrobenzene) that was added to the crude mixture post-reaction.
3,Syntheses,"2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 Reaction of 1-phenylethanol with AgOTf 1-Phenylethanol (3.8 µL, 0.32 mmol) and dioxane (6.25 mL) were added to a pressure tube. AgOTf (0.25 g, 0.96 mmol) was then added to the vessel and capped. The reaction was heated at 90 °C and stirred at 900 rpm for 4 days. The reaction was filtered, filtrate collected and then reduced to dryness with heat under vacuum. The dried residue was extracted with pentane and filtered through a column of Celite. All solvent was removed to afford an oily residue. Mesitylene (5.0 µL, 3.59•10-2 mmol) was added as an internal standard and the yield of 2 was calculated by 1H NMR (64%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 1.49 (d, 3H, CHCH3 , 3 J HH = 7 Hz), 3.63 (m, 1H, CHCH3) 6.41 (m, 2H, HC = CH), 7.09–7.40 (m, 10H, Ar-H) [29]. In reactions with mesitylene added as an internal standard, 2-(1-phenylethyl)mesitylene (4) was also isolated (10%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 1.63 (d, 3H, CHCH 3, 3 J HH = 7 Hz), 2.09 (bs, 6H, o-Mes-(CH 3)2), 2.25 (s, 3H, p-Mes-CH 3), 4.62 (q, 1H, CHCH3, 3 J HH = 7 Hz), 6.81 (s, 2H, Mes), 7.15 (d, 2H, o-Ph, 3 J HH = 7 Hz), 7.20–7.29 (m, 3H, o-Ph, overlapping residual CDCl3) [30]. 2.2.2 Degassed reactions of 1-phenylethanol and 1-phenylpropanol with AgOTf in light and dark In general, the degassed reactions were performed as described in the reaction of 1-phenylethanol with AgOTf in the previous section (2.2.1) except the dioxane solution was degassed by bubbling dinitrogen through the solution at 0 °C for 15 min. The septum was quickly replaced with a Teflon cap with rubber o-ring. Light reactions were left uncovered and exposed to ambient light, while dark reactions were covered with aluminum foil. In light reactions, 1-phenylethanol and a small quantity of 2 (6%) was identified by GC–MS and 1H NMR. In dark reactions, 1-phenylethanol, styrene, and oxy-bis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene (3) as a mixture of meso and racemates compounds were detected by GC–MS (GC retention time: 5.415, 4.409, 8.008 min, respectively). The identification of the compounds were affirmed with 1H NMR by literature comparison [31] and yields determined by comparisons of integrals against an internal standard of mesitylene: Styrene (3%), 1-Phenylethanol (34%), Meso-3 (14%), Racemate-3 (13%). Please refer to Supporting Information for spectrum (Fig. S2). 2.2.3 Oxygenated reactions of 1-phenylethanol and 1-phenylpropanol with AgOTf in light and dark The reactions were performed as described in the previous section (2.2.1) except the pressure tube was equipped with a rubber septum and O2 was bubbled into the solution at 0 °C for 15 min. The septum was quickly replaced with a Teflon cap with a rubber O-ring under a stream of O2. Light reactions were left uncovered and exposed to ambient light, while dark reactions were covered with aluminum foil. After 48 h, the sample was analyzed by GC–MS. 1-Phenylethanol, styrene, and 2 were detected by GC–MS in both dark and light reactions. With 1-phenylpropanol, 1-phenylpropene (5.106 retention time) is the major product (89%) (determined to be by GC–MS). 2.2.4 NMR scale reactions of various alcohols with AgOTf In general, the respective alcohol and three equivalents of AgOTf were added to an NMR tube and covered with dioxane‑d 8 (0.5 mL). The samples were heated at 90 °C and monitored by 1H NMR with spectra recorded at the 1- and 4-hour mark, then every 24 h for five days. Yields were determined 1H NMR spectroscopy using a mesitylene internal standard. 2.2.4.1 NMR scale reaction of 1-phenylpropanol with AgOTf 1-Phenylpropanol (10 μL, 0.0734 mmol) and AgOTf (87 mg, 0.22 mmol) were used. The 1H NMR showed complete conversion to (E)-1-phenyl-1-propene (89%). 1H NMR (dioxane‑d 8, 300 MHz) δ: 7.83 (dd, 3H, CC(H)CH 3, 3 J HH = 6 Hz, 4 J HH = 1.5 Hz) 6.23 (dq, 1H, CC(H)(CH3), 3 J HH = 16.4 Hz, 3 J HH = 6.4 Hz), 6.37 (dd, 1H, CC(H)(Ph), 3 J HH = 16.4 Hz, 4 J HH = 1.5 Hz), 7.05–7.34 (m, 5H, Ar). 2.2.4.2 NMR scale reaction of 2-methyl-phenylpropanol with AgOTf 2-Methyl-phenylpropanol (3 μL, 0.019 mmol) and silver triflate (15 mg, 0.058 mmols) were used. The 1H NMR showed essentially complete conversion to 2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propene (92%). 1H NMR (dioxane‑d 8, 300 MHz) δ: 1.81 (d, 3H, CH3, 4 J HH < 1), 1.86 (d, 3H, CH 3, 4 J HH < 1), 6.25 (bs, 1H, CC–H), 7.06–7.18 (m, 3H, o,p-Ar), 7.20–7.30 (m, 2H, m-Ar) [32]. 2.2.4.3 NMR scale reaction of 1-phenyl-1-butanol with AgOTf 1-Phenyl-1-butanol (3 μL, 0.019 mmol) and silver triflate (15 mg, 0.058 mmols) were used. The 1H NMR showed essentially complete conversion to 1-phenyl-1-butene (94%). 1HNMR (dioxane‑d 8, 300 MHz): 1.06 (t, 3H, CH3, 3 J HH = 7hz), 2.02 (m, 2H, CH2), 6.17–6.31 (m, 1H, =CHCH2), 6.35 (d, 1H, =CHPh, 3 J HH = 16 Hz), 7.06–7.35 (m, 5H, Ar-H) [33]. 2.2.4.4 NMR scale reaction of 3-phenyl-1-propanol with AgOTf 3-Phenyl-1-propanol (10 µL, 0.0734 mmol) was reacted with three equivalences of silver triflate (56 mg, 0.226 mmol) in dioxane at 90 °C for 48 h. GC-Mass spectrometry data showed only starting material. 2.2.5 Reaction of 1-phenylethanol with AgOTf in the presence of TEMPO 1-Phenylethanol (1.57 μL. 0.013 mmols), silver triflate (10 mg, 0.039 mmols), and TEMPO (6 mg, 0.039 mmols) were combined in an NMR tube and covered with dioxane‑d 8. An initial 1H NMR spectrum was recorded and the tube was heated at 90˚C for 1 h. No reaction was observed after 1 h. The reaction was monitored every 24 h for four days. No changes to the spectrum were noted after four days of reactivity. 2.2.6 Control experiments conducted with triflic acid 2.2.6.1 Reaction of 1-phenylethanol with triflic acid (HOTf) 1-Phenylethanol (193 μL, 1.62 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (6.25 mL) and added into a pressure tube. Triflic acid (1 μL, 0.011 mmol) was added to the vessel and sealed. The reaction is heated at 90 °C and stirred at 900 rpm for 4 days. The contents of the reaction were transferred to a round bottom flask and all solvent is removed. Mesitylene (5.0 µL, 3.59•10-2 mmol) was added to the round bottom flask and the percent yield of 2 was determined by 1H NMR (67%). 2.2.6.2 Reaction of styrene with triflic acid (HOTf) Styrene (0.55 mL, 4.8 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (25 mL) and added to a pressure tube. Triflic acid (10 μL, 0.32 mmol) was added to the tube via syringe through a rubber septum. The reaction was stirred at 90 °C for 4 days. The solution was decanted from precipitate and extracted with diethyl ether and water (3X). The ether extracts were combined and dried with magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered through Celite and all solvent was removed in vacuo. Mesitylene (10 μL, 0.0718 mmol) was added to the residue and 1H NMR was recorded. The 1H NMR spectrum showed the formation of 2 (34%). 2.2.6.3 Reaction of styrene and 1-phenylethanol with triflic acid (HOTf) 1-Phenylethanol (193 μL, 1.6 mmol), styrene (36.6 μL, 0.32 mmol) were added to pressure tube and dissolved with dioxane (6.25 mL). Triflic acid (10 μL, 0.32 mmol) was added to the reaction by syringe. The reaction was stirred 90 °C for four days. All solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and mesitylene (5 μL, 0.035 mmol) was added to the residue. A 1H NMR spectrum was recorded which showed only 2 (64% yield by 1H NMR) with no evidence of 3."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Dehydration and vinyl hydrovinylation reactions,"3.1 Dehydration and vinyl hydrovinylation reactions Reaction of 1-phenylethanol with AgOTf in dioxane at 90˚C affords styrene (1) and (E)-1,3-diphenyl-1-butene (2) as major products after 48 h (determined by GC–MS and 1H NMR) (Eq. (1)). The final reaction mixture becomes brown in color with copious amounts of silver metal (See Supporting Information Figure S11 for a picture) deposited in the vessel. Compound 2 is isolated by removal of solvent followed by extraction with pentane (64%). The remaining brown residue was analyzed by GC–MS and determined to be a mixture of oxidized/polymerized dioxane products. The silver metal and the oxidized products suggests a redox reaction (vide infra). Notably, no products were identified by either GC–MS or 1H NMR spectroscopy in room temperature reactions. (1) Monitoring the reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed initial formation of styrene due to dehydration after 1 h, showing diagnostic olefinic resonances at 5.18 ppm (d), 5.73 ppm (d), 6.71 ppm (dd). Commercially available styrene was added to the reaction to confirm the formation of styrene. The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed resonances at 3.66 ppm (1H) as a doublet-of-quartets and a doublet (3H) at 1.48 ppm that were assigned to the methine and methyl groups, respectively, while the downfield multiplets at 6.41 ppm (determined from the gCOSY spectrum) and 7.00–7.50 ppm were assigned to the olefinic and aromatic resonances, respectively. These distinctive resonances compare well with a previously reported spectrum of 2 [29] These data are consistent with a Brønsted acid promoted reaction pathway involving dehydration of 1-phenylethanol to form styrene followed by self-vinyl hydrovinylation of styrene to produce 2 [34]. While the dehydration of 1-phenylethanol was shown to be catalytic as a function of AgOTf, only scant production of 2 was observed when a stoichiometric equivalent of AgOTf was used. Only when excess AgOTf (3–10 equivalents) is used was 2 formed in detectable quantity (1H NMR). Indeed, monitoring the reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the rate of formation of 2 is directly proportional to AgOTf concentration (Supporting Information Figure S9). Moreover, the rate of decay for styrene was inversely proportional to the formation of 2 (Fig. 2 ). This supports the self-vinyl hydrovinylation of styrene. Moreover, 2 is also formed directly from styrene when reacted with AgOTf, further supporting this previous assertion. While styrene depletion follows first order kinetics (See Supporting Information Figure S10), the formation of 2 fits neither first or second order kinetics, suggesting a more complicated mechanism is involved, for which we have not thoroughly studied. Since selective styrene dimerization has been studied using triflic acid [34], it was surmised that triflic acid may be a plausible strong Brønsted acid promoting these reactions in this study. To test this hypothesis, 1-phenylethanol was reacted with one equivalent of triflic acid and monitored by 1H NMR to test if this reaction paralleled that of AgOTf. As expected, dehydration ensues to form styrene, albeit more expeditiously, within 15 min and a new resonance at 6.41 ppm appears (Supporting Information Figure S4) within 24 h representing the nascent formation of 2. No evidence of styrene polymerization was identified (determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and GC–MS), which is expected at higher temperatures [34]. Styrene is completely consumed after 5 days of reactivity. This affirms the role of triflic acid in these reactions. In addition, reaction of styrene with triflic acid also produces 2 over several days. It has been reported that triflic acid is generated from copper(II) triflate [Cu(OTf)2] via reduction to copper(I) triflate [17]. The depositing of silver metal in these studies hint at a similar mechanism for the generation of triflic acid from AgOTf. With the well-known photoreactive properties of silver reagents, it was anticipated that the formation of the triflic acid could be attenuated or promoted by either the presence or absence of oxygen and/or light. To examine this possibility, 1-phenylethanol was reacted with three equivalents of AgOTf in tandem reactions in deoxygenated solvent: one exposed to light and another covered (absent of light) (Scheme 1 ). Unlike reactions performed in air and light, where the starting alcohol is consumed after 48 h of reactivity, both reactions in this case exhibited incomplete reactivity, comprised of considerable starting alcohol. Only small quantities (6% yield) of 2 are formed in degassed reactions that were exposed to light and none were formed in dark reactions (determined by 1H NMR and GC–MS). In contrast, covered, dark reactions showed formation of oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl)dibenzene (3) (Scheme 1) as a racemic mixture (18%) and meso (14%) products, as well as unreacted alcohol (34%). These compounds were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy using their well-resolve quartet resonances for the methane protons. The starting alcohol showed a resonance a 4.9 ppm, the meso compound at 4.5 ppm, and the racemates at 4.3 ppm (See Supporting Information S2). The formation of 3 could likely proceed through either an acid catalyzed [35] or Ag-mediated olefin hydroalkoxylation [16]. In control studies, excess 1-phenylethanol (10 equivalences) was reacted with one equivalent of styrene in the presence of a catalytic amount of triflic acid; however, only 2 was formed with no detection of 3. This suggests the dehydration of 1-phenylethanol and self-vinyl hydrovinylation is much more expedient as compared to ether formation under acid catalyzed conditions and supports the assertion that 3 is likely afforded by an Ag-mediated pathway. These anaerobic studies conducted in light and dark shed some light on the formation of triflic acid from silver triflate. It should be noted that silver triflate is both light- and air-sensitive, but little is known of the identity of the decomposition products. Notably, Carpentier et al. showed that the reduction of Cu(II)OTf2 to generate Cu(I)OTf and concomitant HOTf was initiated by dicyclopentadiene through olefin dehydrogenation via a radical pathway and that in situ generation of triflic acid may occur when metal triflates are in the presence of hydrogen donors [17]. In our studies, an olefin is only present after dehydration, thus it is likely that the decomposition of silver triflate is initiated by hydrogen donation from 1-phenylethanol or dioxane. This minute quantity of triflic likely catalyzes the dehydration of 1-phenylethanol to produce styrene, which can be used to generate additional triflic acid through olefin dehydrogenation. These data suggest that while only a minor amount of acid is required to catalyze the dehydration event; the concentration of acid must be considerable to allow vinyl hydrovinylation to proceed. The lack of complete reactivity under anaerobic conditions suggests oxygen plays an active role in the decomposition of AgOTf and by proxy the formation of the strong Brønsted acid. We are not sure of the role of oxygen in these reactions, but believe the formation of the Brønsted acid is likely radical-initiated. To test this assertion, 1-phenylethanol was reacted with AgOTf in the presence of the radical trap reagent 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperdinyloxy (TEMPO) [36]. Consistent with a radical-promoted mechanism, neither 2 nor styrene are observed after four days of heating at 90˚C. The well-known use of TEMPO as an oxidation reagent could likely prevent the reduction of Ag+, thus thwarting acid formation [37]. As expected, no silver metal was observed in these reactions (vide supra)."
6,Electrophilic aromatic substitutions,"3.2 Electrophilic aromatic substitutions Several internal standards were evaluated for kinetic studies based on their gas-chromatograph retention times and inertness to the reaction conditions. It was ultimately found that the use of internal standards were impractical for these studies due to their electrophilic aromatic substitution reactivity. When mesitylene was used, 2-(1-phenylethyl)mesitylene (4) was produced in small quantity (10%) (Eq. (2)). This phenomenon further supports the generation of a strong Brønsted acid from AgOTf. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 reveals a doublet at 1.6 ppm for the CH3 group and a quartet at 4.62 ppm for the methine group. Two singlet resonances at 2.09 ppm (6H) and 2.25 ppm (3H) were assigned to the methyl groups at the ortho and para positions of the mesitylene ring. The aromatic resonances of the mesitylene ring appear more upfield (6.81 ppm, s, 2H) than the phenyl resonances of 4. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 agrees with that previously reported [30]. Reaction of a 1:1 M equivalence of styrene and mesitylene in the presence of triflic acid also produces 4, as well as, di- and tri- substituted products. (2)"
7,Substrate Scope,"3.3 Substrate Scope Several alcohols were screened to gauge the scope of the dehydration and vinyl hydrovinylation reactions. A list of alcohols and the results of these reactions are shown in Table 1 . In all cases benzylic alcohols are dehydrated to the corresponding Zaitsev selective alkene as major products (determined by 1H NMR) with no evidence for vinyl hydrovinylation. Primary alcohols showed no evidence of dehydration and secondary alcohols (isopropanol) dehydrated very slowly (weeks are required to detect any dehydrated product). 1-Phenyl-1-propanol was expected to dehydrate more rapidly under E1 reaction conditions as compared to 1-phenylethanol because of the production of a more stable olefin, but its ability to undergo self-vinyl hydrovinylation was unknown. 1-Phenyl-1-propanol was reacted with AgOTf at 90 °C for 48 h in tandem reactions (one in degassed dioxane‑d 8 and another with O2) to test if the absence or presence of O2 had an effect on its reactivity (Scheme 2 ). The degassed reactions showed no signs of dehydration, while the O2 reaction showed completed dehydration to form 1-phenylpropene. No products of vinyl hydrovinylation was observed for either the degassed or oxygen enriched reactions."
8,Single X-ray crystallography study of [Ag(Dioxane)6] [-OTf],"After the reactions cooled to room temperature, large quantities of colorless crystals formed suitable for single crystal X-ray analysis, which revealed a structure with the formula [Ag(dioxane)6][OTf]. A similar structure with a perchlorate anion was reported by Prosen et al. in 1956 [38,39]. Prosen reported that [Ag(dioxane)6][ClO4] was quite hygroscopic and the silver metal was easily reduced even in the absence of light. Obviously in the current study the addition of light would promote the reduction of silver and concomitant oxidation of the dioxane solvent. The structure of [Ag(dioxane)6][OTf] reveals a central Ag+ atom in pseudo-octahedral geometry surrounded by six dioxane molecules (Fig. 3 ). The -OTf anion is well separated from the Ag+ ion in the outer coordination sphere. The average Ag − O bond distance is 2.5 Å, with the longest and shortest bond distances being the Ag(1) − O(2) and Ag(1) − O(1) bond, 2.524(3) Å and 2.461(2) Å, respectively. These are similar to those reported for the perchlorate congener [38]. The methods and fullset single of X-ray data is available in Supporting Information."
9,Summary and conclusion,"Silver triflate is commonly utilized in organometallic chemistry to activate the metal for metal-mediated processes; however, those reactions that may also be catalyzed by Brønsted acid have come under some scrutiny due to potential “hidden acid” generation via silver triflate degradation. We have shown here three examples (alcohol dehydration, vinyl hydrovinylation, and electrophilic aromatic substitution) where degraded silver triflate can catalyze these reactions. While it has been postulated in previous reports that a strong Brønsted acid is formed from the degradation of silver triflate, to our knowledge, no one has examined the conditions that promote this process. The results of this study suggest light, heat, and oxygen play important roles in its degradation. Note: The authors declare no competing financial interest"
