0,Introduction,"Significant progress has recently been achieved in lignocellulosic feedstock fermentation technologies and novel C1 chemistry (e.g., syngas, CO2 and CH4 conversions) to give low-molecular alcohol products [1–3]. These oxygenates, such as methanol and bio-ethanol, are commercially abundant and readily available. Thus, developing new catalytic routes for their direct and selective conversions into value-added chemicals or drop-in fuels is highly desirable. Allylic alcohols are widely applied precursors for high-value structural motifs found in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, agrochemicals and polymers [4–7]. Their laboratory-scale production relies on epoxide rearrangement [8] and the alkylation of unsaturated aldehydes [9], catalyzed by organometallic reagents or strong bases. Typically industrial manufacture of allylic alcohols, employing multi-steps by hydrocarbons oxidation to form alkylene oxides, allyl chlorides or carboxylated compounds, followed by isomerization using Lithium phosphate catalysts or the alkaline saponification process [10], has since suffered from increasing environmental and atom economic concerns (Scheme 1 a). Selective C-H bond functionalization of readily available alcohols (e.g., low-molecular alcohols) has recently drawn intensive research interests for more sustainable chemistry [11,12]. In this context, borrowing hydrogen (BH), also called “hydrogen autotransfer”, is emerging as a superior strategy for C-X (X = C, N) bonds construction [13]. Based on BH mechanism, the dehydrogenated H atoms from alcohols are generally transferred back into carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling intermediates (step 3 in Scheme 1b) for the final generation of saturated higher alcohols [11,13]. Conceptually, if the hydrogenation process can be controlled by proceeding on C = O bonds rather than C = C bonds, unsaturated alcohols are selectively produced. Such a catalytic allylic alcohols synthesis strategy might be feasible when we combine alcohol dehydrogenative coupling with selective hydrogen transfer process, liberating hydrogen and water as the only byproducts (Scheme 1c). To enable such tandem catalytic reactions, a multifunctional catalyst is thus necessary. Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, using H2 or alcohols as reducing reagents, can be catalyzed by various metal oxides [14,15] or transition metal supported catalysts [16]. Generally, the hydrogenation of C = C bonds in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable than that on C = O bonds [17]. As a consequence, selective production of α,β-unsaturated alcohols from α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds remains highly challenging. Recently, the direct liberation of H2 in dehydrogenative coupling reactions without using sacrificial H-acceptors (e.g., air and O2) has been intensively explored to synthesize varieties of unsaturated nitriles [18], amides [19], imines [20], aldmines [21] and heterocyclic products [22–24]. However, these advanced synthesis procedures mainly feature homogeneous transition metal based complexes of Ru, Ir, Mn. Although methanol is regarded as substitutable alkylation reagent or green energy carrier, its activation (ΔH = 84 kJ mol-1 vs. 68 kJ mol-1 of ethanol dehydrogenation energy) is actually not easy [25]. C = C bonds formation in alcohol coupling reactions by using methanol has also limited been explored. We previously reported the selective cross C-C coupling of primary alcohols (e.g., bio-ethanol, n-propanol) with methanol in aqueous phase via BH strategy [26,27]. Transition metal sites are active for the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycle (step 1 and 3, Scheme 1b) during the hydrogen transfer process. Saturated methylated alcohols are mostly produced with H2O as the byproduct. Despite transition metal catalysts such as Ru [28,29], Rh [30], Pt [31], and Ir [26,27,32], recent advances on employing (mixed)metal oxides (MgO, MgAlO, CuMgAlO, MgO-SiO2, ZnZrO) [33–37], zeolites [38], hydroxyapatites (HAP) [39,40] have addressed the great promise of interfacial acid-base catalysis for alcohol transformations. Hence, the purpose of shifting dehydrogenative alcohol couplings to produce allylic alcohols is appealing when metal oxide catalysts can be rationally designed. Furthermore, it is critical to perform such dehydrogenative coupling reactions without stoichiometric oxidants [41]. This work reports a controlled dehydrogenative α-methylenation (DM) of bio-alcohols with methanol for the continuous production of allylic alcohols over well-defined mixed oxide catalyst, liberating hydrogen and water as the only byproducts. Facile prepared ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (molar ratio of Mg/Zr = 4/1) mixed oxide shows high selectivity (83%∼92%) to allylic alcohols at 275 °C without additive oxidants. A series of characterizations have demonstrated that key to this success is the balancing control of strength distribution and surface concentration of Lewis acid-basic pair on mixed oxide. High selectivity of allylic alcohols is attributed to the synergic effect of each elementary step that involved within tandem alcohol coupling reactions, which is intensively investigated by control experiments and kinetic studies."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mixed oxide ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx was synthesized by a one-pot ZIF-8 assisted hydrothermal assembly-pyrolysis method. Typically, 2-methylimidazole (>99 wt%, 4 equivalents with respect to Zn2+) and MgO were dissolved and dispersed in a given amount of H2O under vigorous stirring for 10 min. Clear methanol solution containing a calculated amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added under 30 °C. After that, the obtained solution was slowly mixed with Zr(OPr)4-ethanol solution (cal. 40 mL, the molar ratio of Mg/Zr was 4/1) followed by continuous stirring for 2 h. The mixture was refluxed under 60 °C for 5 h and the solvents were removed using rotary evaporation to get a white solid material. The obtained material was then heated and calcined at a ramp of 1 °C min-1 from room temperature to 600 °C under N2 for 2 h. Light brown solid material ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx was finally obtained. Note that the synthetic molar ratio of Zn/Zr for the oxides prepared in this work is kept constant as 0.066/1. Synthetic details for other kinds of metal oxide catalysts prepared in this work are presented in the Supplementary material. Cu supported oxide catalyst with 0.1 wt% metal loading (denoted as 0.1%Cu/ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx) was prepared by impregnating as-synthesized ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx with aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. In detail, Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution was prepared by adding of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0076 g, 0.03 mmol) into 30 mL H2O. ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (2.0 g) was added into the prepared solution, followed by vigorous stirring at room temperature for 4 h. The mixture then evaporated to remove solvents and dried overnight at 105 °C. Finally, the obtained material was calcined at the rate of 2 °C min-1 to 600 °C under N2 for 2 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on Bruker D8 advance in the scanning range of 20∼80°. Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) was used as the X-ray source. The in situ XRD analysis of prepared oxides with increasing temperatures (25∼600 °C) were carried out in a ceramic X-ray reactor under N2 atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on Hitachi H-7650 and FEI Tecnai G20 electron microscope, which were operated at 120 kV and 200 kV, respectively. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis were carried out on Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of oxide catalysts were measured on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. Typically, 100 mg of sample was firstly degassed at 350 °C for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2) prior to nitrogen adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on Thermo Escalab 250XI using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) line source. All the obtained binding energies were calibrated using C1 s peak at 284.8 eV as the reference. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. About 100 mg of each sample was pretreated in U-shaped quartz tube with a He flow (30 cm3 min-1) at 400 °C for 2 h, after which the temperature was cooled down to 60 °C. The sample was then maintained at this temperature for 2 h in 10 vol.% of CO2/He mixture, followed by purging with pure He for 2 h to get a stable baseline. The TPD curves were recorded from 60 °C to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C min-1 using equipped Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements were also conducted on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument using the same pretreatment and analysis procedure as that of CO2-TPD except that 10 vol.% NH3/Ar and pure Ar were used as the adsorption gas mixture and purging gas. Pyridine adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Pyridine-FTIR) were collected on Thermo Scientific Nicolet iN 10 IR Microscope. Typically, each sample (5∼10 mg) was tableted to self-supported wafer and held standing in a specially-designed vitreous IR-adsorption cell with CaF2 windows. The sample was pretreated at 450 °C (heating rate is 10 °C min-1) under vacuum (ca. 10-6 mbar) for 1 h to remove any impurities. After cooling down to room temperature, the background spectra was collected with frequency ranging from 400 to 4000 cm-1. Then the pyridine adsorption was performed at 60 °C for 1 h followed by desorption under vacuum at 150 °C for 1 h to eliminate physically or weakly adsorbed pyridine. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine was collected and then subtracted with activated sample background. Each spectrum was recorded at a resolution of 4 cm-1 with 32 scans. For quantification of Brønsted sites (1560-1530 cm-1) and Lewis acid sites (1460-1435 cm-1), the molar extinction coefficients of 0.73 cm μmol-1 and 0.96 cm μmol-1 was used respectively. The content of Mg, Zr and Zn for ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx and 4Mg1ZrZnOx-n samples were detected by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on an Agilent 7700ce instrument. Weighted sample was firstly digested in hydrochloric and nitric acids mixture (3/1, v/v) by microwave digestion. After that, the obtained mixture was diluted into constant volume with deionized water and finally ICP analyzed."
4,Catalyst evaluation and products analysis,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation and products analysis The dehydrogenative α-methylenation (DM) of alcohols with methanol was operated in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor at 275 °C and 0.3 MPa using N2 as carrier gas. A calculated amount of catalyst was loaded into the reactor (i.d. 10 mm) and pretreated at 400 °C with N2 (40 cm3 min-1) for 1 h. Otherwise specially noted, n-propanol/methanol mixture (3 wt% of n-propanol) was used as the reactant. The solution was fed into reaction system using high-pressure liquid pump (Series II, USA) and gasified in an evaporator at 110 °C before flowing through catalyst bed. The condensed liquid solution collected from the gas-liquid separator was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu 2010 plus) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) detector and a Rtx-Wax column (30 m ×0.25 μm ×0.32 mm). The temperature program for products separation is as following: the oven temperature was initially held at 50 °C for 1 min followed by raising to 240 °C with a ramp of 20 °C min-1 and kept for another 1 min. The gaseous products was collected and analyzed using GC (Shimadzu 2010 plus) equipped with two chromatographic columns (GDX-502 packed column, molecular sieves 5A column) using Thermal Conductivity Detectors (TCD) under He flow (carrier gas, 45 cm3 min-1). The GDX-502 packed column (3 m ×3 mm) was used to detect CO2 at 60 °C while the molecular sieves 5A column (i.d. 3 mm) was used to analyze H2, CO, CH4, etc. in outlet gas mixtures at 100 °C. Carbon Balance (CB) was calculated based on the carbon content in the detected reactants and products. The CB value for each catalytic run is more than 96%, suggesting the good applicability of analysis method. n-Propanol conversion (XPrOH) and product selectivity (S i ) were calculated as following equations, respectively: XPrOH=(molPrOH-in-molPrOH-out)/molPrOH-in ×100%, where molPrOH-in is the mole content of n-propanol before reaction, molPrOH-out is the mole content of n-propanol after reaction; S i =(mol i )/(molProducts) ×100%, where mol i represents the mole of product i, molProducts is the total mole of all products. The selectivity for the hydrogen transfer of unsaturated aldehyde (coupling intermediate) was calculated as following: SS-H =(molMAA)/(molMAA+mol i -BuOH+mol i -BuO) ×100%, where molMAA is the mole number of methylallyl alcohol (selective-hydrogenated product), mol i -BuOH is the mole number of isobutanol (fully-hydrogenated product) and mol i -BuO is the mole of isobutanal (unselective-hydrogenated product). Indeed, isobutanal was not detected in the collected organic solution because of the high hydrogen transfer selectivity of our prepared oxide catalyst."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst structural and surface acid/basic properties,"3.1 Catalyst structural and surface acid/basic properties To identify a well-defined oxide catalyst for allylic alcohols synthesis, MgO was primarily selected because of its tunable surface acid/basic properties after metal atom modifications [33,42–44]. The typical synthesis procedure for ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is illustrated in Fig. 1 a (details in the Experimental section). Zr(OPr)4 was introduced as Zr precursor onto MgO by gradual hydrolysis. Under methanol/water solvent, Zn based zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) was in situ formed and assembled with Mg-Zr composites. After refluxing, the collected mixture was calcined to obtain the ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. XRD patterns in Fig. S1 show the formation of Mg(OH)2 during hydrothermal treatment and Mg(OH)2 could decompose into MgO after calcination. Cubic periclase MgO (JCPDS 87-0651) and MgxZr1-xOy phase (2θ = 30.4°, 35.4°, 50.7°, 60.5°, 63.4°) are detected on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (Fig. 2 i). The latter phase is formed by the introduction of Mg2+ into ZrO2 crystal lattice [45,46]. The substitution of Zr4+ with Mg2+ can create oxygen vacancies [47], which in turn make MgxZr1-xOy have tetragonal structure the same with ZrO2. Higher calcination temperature (600 °C) is beneficial for the formation of MgxZr1-xOy phase with good crystallinity. No obvious ZnO diffraction peaks is indicative of its high dispersion or relatively lower synthetic loading on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. Despite of the MgxZr1-xOy and MgO phase, Mg(OH)2 is observed on 4Mg1ZrZnOx-n-600 (Fig. 2e) prepared by using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O rather ZIF-8. Mg(OH)2 should be formed by exposure with water during storage and analysis under atmosphere condition. This hydration process is more common for pure MgO or MgO-based oxide with lower heteroatom loading, such as MgZnOx (Fig. 2c). It thus seems reasonable that using in situ formed ZIF-8 as Zn precursor can avoid aggregation of ZrO2, resulting in high dispersion of MgxZr1-xOy phase on MgO support. Besides, physically grinding prepared mixed oxide (4Mg1ZrZnOx-Phys) displays poor proximity, evidenced by the observation of MgO, MgxZr1-xOy, ZrO2 and ZnO phase from XRD pattern in Fig. 2h. The BET surface areas of prepared oxides are calculated to be ∼56 m2 g-1 (Table S1) after ZrO2 and ZnO modification on MgO (35 m2 g-1). Pore size calculations using adsorption branch based on BJH method present large pore size distribution between 31-38 nm, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structures (Fig. S2). TEM and HRTEM images show sheet-like morphologies of MgO and high crystalline structure after modifications (Figs. 1b, c and S3e). Meanwhile, the HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDX mapping images demonstrate Zr, Zn and O are homogeneously dispersed on MgO nanosheet (Figs. 1d, e and S4). Surface elemental compositions of prepared metal oxides were analyzed by XPS. Nitrogen together with carbon (possibly N-doped carbon species) originated from the pyrolysis of ZIF-8 polyhedrons during ZnO formation. Surface content of nitrogen and carbon was observed to change with metal contents, the latter of which were determined by Mg/Zr ratios during synthesis (Table S2). High resolution Zr 3d XPS shifts to higher binding energy (BE) and has peak intensity increased when increasing loading of Zr species (Fig. 3 a). It seems that the formation of MgxZr1-xOy is limited when adding excess amount of Zr precursor. Above typical description of ZnO/3.3Mg1ZrOx suggests a different structural property than other two samples in Fig. 3a, apparently the presence of another Zr species (aggregated ZrO2). Besides, Zn 2p3/2 peak of ZnO/3.3Mg1ZrOx has 1.1 eV of BE higher than that of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx and ZnO/5Mg1ZrOx as a result of the interaction of electronegative Zn2+ species with surface ZrO2 (Fig. 3b). We further compared the Zn 2p3/2 XPS binding energy of the oxide catalysts prepared by different methods. In particular, Zn 2p3/2 splitting peak of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx has mainly 1.0 eV of BE lower shift than that of MgZnOx and ZrZnOx. This finding suggests the more preferential interaction of Zn2+ species with as-formed surface MgxZr1-xOy than individually with MgO or ZrO2 (Fig. S5). Surface atomic ratio of Mg/Zr on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is determined to be 87/1, which is almost similar to that (71/1) of ZnO/5Mg1ZrOx but much higher than that (3.63/1) of ZnO/3.3Mg1ZrOx (Table S2). The lower Mg/Zr ratio further verifies the presence of aggregated ZrO2 particles with larger loading amount on ZnO/3.3Mg1ZrOx. More importantly, metal oxide (4Mg1ZrZnOx-n) prepared without ZIF-8 also shows lower surface Mg/Zr ratio (15.2/1), indicating that such ZIF-8 assisted synthetic strategy plays important role in metal oxide high dispersion. However, ICP-MS measurements suggest no obvious difference on the bulk composition of Mg, Zr, and Zn for ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx and 4Mg1ZrZnOx-n (Table S2). The Mg/Zr atomic ratio for the detected two samples were calculated to be 4.3, which is slightly higher than the synthetic value 4.0. While the loading of Zn was observed to be 7.5 % lower than the synthetic loading (1.2 wt%). The BE of O 1s XPS for 4Mg1ZrOx locates at 529.8 eV and 531.5 eV (Fig. S5), representing the lattice oxygen (O2-) and oxygen vacancy defects, respectively [47–49]. Compared with 4Mg1ZrOx, lower BE of O 1s XPS is observed on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. This confirms that ZnO could enhance the strength of surface basic sites [50]. We therefore have prepared ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx oxide having identified structures described as following: ZnO modified MgxZr1-xOy phase, the latter is formed by Zr4+ substitution with MgO nanosheets and the surface oxide species are highly dispersed. CO2- and NH3-TPD together with IR-pyridine were conducted to determine the nature, strength and concentrations of surface acid-basic sites on different oxides. CO2-TPD profiles in Fig. S6 suggest the strong basic sites (isolated O2-) on MgO are largely neutralized after acid ZrO2 addition (from 0.46 to 0.07 mmol g-1). ZnO contains strong Lewis acid-basic pair and has basic strength stronger than ZrO2 but weaker than MgO (Figs. 3d and S7). The formation of surface layered MgxZr1-xOy is responsible for the mostly weakened Lewis acidity (derived from surface Mg2+) of MgO. As a result, moderate-strong acid-basic pair is formed on 4Mg1ZrOx (NH3-TPD in Fig. S8). The corresponding IR-pyridine spectroscopies are shown in Fig. 3c. Both Lewis acid sites (L sites, 1601 cm-1, 1580 cm-1, 1485 cm-1 and 1439 cm-1) and Brønsted acid sites (B sites, 1540 cm-1) are existed on 4Mg1ZrOx [34]. The B sites are assigned to surface hydroxyl groups (OH) closely associated with as-formed MgxZr1-xOy or ZrO2 nanoparticles on MgO [51]. B sites concentration of 4Mg1ZrOx can be largely suppressed by adding ZnO, which is supported by the obviously decreased adsorption peak at 1540 cm-1, in good line with the earlier report as well [34]. Quantitative IR-pyridine analysis shows that the molar ratio of Lewis/Brønsted acid sites (L/B) increases from 2.4 for 4Mg1ZrOx to 10.3 for ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (Table S1). B sites concentration of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is determined to be 0.7 μmol g-1, which is significantly lower than that of 4Mg1ZrOx (3.8 μmol g-1). Meanwhile, the strength and overall concentration of L sites on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx also decrease with ZnO addition. These observations are verified by the comparative NH3-TPD profile of ZnO, ZrO2 and ZrZnOx in Fig. S9. Particularly, the total acid sites concentration of ZrZnOx is calculated to be 0.35 mmol g-1, which is mainly 1.5 times lower than that (0.61 mmol g-1) of ZrO2 due to ZnO integration. Thus, ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx with moderate-strong Lewis acid-basic pair (denoted as ZnO/MgxZr1-xOy) on its surface is successfully obtained."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic behaviors of prepared oxides for the DM reaction of n-propanol with methanol are shown in Fig. 4 . Noted that excess amount of methanol favors the formation of MAA product. The detected amount of n-propanal produced from n-propanol dehydrogenation step increased with the increasing of n-propanol concentration (i.e. 5 wt%, 7 wt%) at the expense of MAA selectivity. After the optimization of reaction conditions, over 90% selectivity of methallyl alcohol (MAA) and 12% of n-propanol conversion are achieved on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. MAA with a selectivity of 67.3% is obtained on MgO at 300 °C together with other minor products, such as ethers (dimethyl ether, methyl propyl ether), n-propanal (PrO) and isobutanol (i-BuOH). The relatively lower activity of MgO (2.3% conversion) should be derived from its strong Lewis basic sites (isolated surface O2-) and acid sites (Mg2+), which are detrimental to the dissociative adsorption of alcohol molecules [35]. 4Mg1ZrOx exhibits ethers (>60.2% selectivity) as the main products because of the OH groups (B sites) on its surface [28]. The high selectivity of PrO (87%) on ZnO is due to its Lewis acid-basic property when activating alcohols [52]. However, the activity of ZnO is lower as with ∼2.0% n-propanol conversion. Improved n-propanol conversion (4.5%) and selectivity of methacrolein (MA, 7.9%) and PrO (19.4%) are observed on MgZnOx. According to CO2-, NH3-TPD and pyridine-IR studies, ZnO could passivate the strong Lewis acid and basic sites on MgO. Consequently, the reaction rate in terms of n-propanol conversion on MgZnOx is mainly an order of magnitude higher than that of monometallic MgO. These findings surely reveal the significant difference in reaction pathways over the oxides having different interfacial acid-basic properties. Obviously also, such developed DM reactions of alcohol with methanol require balanced rate of each elemental reaction to achieve high selectivity to allylic alcohols. For comparison, reference catalysts including ZIF-8/4Mg1ZrOx and UIO-66/MgZnOx are synthesized by introducing ZIF-8 and Zr-based organic framework (UIO-66) onto 4Mg1ZrOx and MgZnOx (details in Supplementary material). The strength and concentration of acid and basic sites are found to differentiate with preparation methods (Fig. 3d). Catalytic results over both catalysts show improvements of n-propanol conversion, while the selectivities to MAA (nearly 60%) are all inferior to that of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (Fig. 4). Even lower MAA selectivity (35%) is obtained on 4Mg1ZrZnOx-Phys, the physically grinding prepared catalyst having poor atoms-proximity. In addition, as observed from TPD measurements (Fig. 3d), ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx has higher amount of moderate-strong base sites while smaller density of acid sites than 4Mg1ZrZnOx-n (synthesized without ZIF-8 rather Zn(NO3)2 as ZnO precursor). The slightly higher base density on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is likely attributed to the presence of C, N species, which have a little amount (less than 1.0 wt% based on ICP-MS analysis) on catalyst surface (Table S2). As a result, ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx exhibits higher selectivity to MAA with lower amount of produced ethers and PrO than on 4Mg1ZrZnOx-n (Fig. 4). Hence, certain amount of balanced interfacial Lewis acid-basic pair (ZnO/MgxZr1-xOy) with moderate-strong strength is supposed to be beneficial for allylic alcohols selective synthesis. In gas flow, hydrogen (0.25 vol.% with respect to total N2 flow) was detected together with a trace amount of CO2 (0.05 vol.%). Kibby et al. [53] and Tsuchida et al. [54] have proposed the E 1cB mechanism for alcohol dehydrogenation, in which the hydrogen adatoms derived from α-H abstraction of surface alkoxides on basic active sites could combine to H2. In our case, H2 likely generates from n-propanol dehydrogenation and hydrogen transfer process, which is discussed in the following section. To explore the origin of CO2, we collected the in situ-DRIFTS of methanol in the temperature range from 50 °C to 400 °C after methanol adsorption saturation (Fig. 5 ). ∼1030 cm-1 band represents the adsorption of un-dissociated methanol. The adsorption bands at 1600 cm-1 and 1374 cm-1, characteristic of νs(OCO) and νas(OCO) of surface formate species are typically formed. The oxidation of linear methoxy groups by surface oxidant (e.g., vacancy) was reported to generate formate species, which could decompose into CO2 with temperature increasing [55]. Besides, the peak at 1048 and 1153 cm-1 on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is corresponded to the bridging (tridentate) methoxy group and linear (on-top) methoxy group, respectively. Bridging methoxy groups are responsible for ether formation [55]. Interestingly, great extent reduce of intensities of both bridging and linear methoxy groups are observed on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx when compared with 4Mg1ZrOx at high temperatures. This finding in turn explains the lower selectivity to ethers on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (Fig. 4). Furthermore, as detected, methoxy species on both MgO and ZrO2 have higher coverage and stability than that on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (Fig. S10). Thus, oxides with stronger interaction with surface intermediates, such as methoxy or propoxy groups (if n-propanol coexists with methanol), will have remarkably lower catalytic activity (e.g., MgO)."
8,Mechanistic insights and reaction pathways,"3.3 Mechanistic insights and reaction pathways To further understand each elemental step, kinetic studies were intensively performed over ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. The apparent activation energy (Ea ) for n-propanol dehydrogenation, aldol condensation of formaldehyde with n-propanal and the selective hydrogenation of MA is 44.5, 10.5, 17.8 kJ mol-1, respectively (Fig. S11–S15). Ho et al. [56] demonstrated in ethanol coupling mechanistic studies that a crotonaldehyde/ethanol feed could increase n-butanol production rate, showing that hydrogen transfer can proceed directly via Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. In our study, the hydrogenation of MA with H2 exhibits mainly no activity (Fig. S16). This finding provides the evidence that H2 most probably generated from alcohol dehydrogenation is not active H-donor for selective hydrogenation of MA. Interestingly, the hydrogenation of MA using methanol as the reducing reagent, for instance, tends to produce MAA with selectivity as high as 98%. It confirms that MA selective hydrogenation is mostly an intermolecular hybride transfer process, also called the MPV-type hydrogen transfer (MPV-HT). The synergy effect of Lewis acid-basic pair on oxides was necessary for MPV-HT reaction of carbonyl compounds [15]. Poisoning tests were carried out to verify above suggestion. We initially fed CO2 with N2 through fixed bed reactor to poison the basic sites of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. No catalytic influence was observed on DM reaction of n-propanol at 275 °C. This is due to the moderate-strong strength of basic sites, having maximum desorption temperature at 270 °C (CO2-TPD, Fig. S6). Then liquid-phase MPV-HT reactions of MA with isopropanol (one of the commonly studied reducing reagents) were performed. MA conversion sharply decreases by 45% when surface basic sites are poisoned by formic acid. However, the reactivity after adding pyridine (interacts with Lewis acid sites) remains unchanged (Fig. 6 a), which should be related to the weaker strength of Lewis acid sites on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx [14]. The catalytic results for gas-phase MPV-HT reaction of MA with methanol over different oxides are presented in Table S3. All the investigated monometallic oxide, containing either strong Lewis acid-basic sites (ZnO) or weak Brønsted sites (ZrO2) shows inferior selective hydrogen transfer performance. Given ZnO modified MgxZr1-xOy is the mostly detected phase with high dispersion on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx, the synergism of Lewis acid-basic pair is critical for reaction pathways control, and thus high selectivity to allylic alcohols is achieved. The initial dehydrogenation of primary alcohols has been reported to be rate-limiting step for C-C coupling reactions [57]. We performed a control experiment by feeding methanol with n-propanal, the intermediate of n-propanol dehydrogenation. Corresponding catalytic results are shown in Fig. 6b. Both hydrogen transfer and aldol condensation reactions are enhanced, strongly indicating alcohol dehydrogenation is a slow step. The increased reaction rates are attributed to the formation of formaldehyde via MPV-HT process between n-propanal and methanol. Formaldehyde then undergoes aldol condensation with n-propanal followed by hydrogen transfer to afford MA, MAA and i-BuOH. It is generally accepted that alcohol dehydrogenation pathway involves sequential O-H bond cleavage to alkoxide, the followed C-H bond cleavage forming carbonyl compounds and the final combination of H atoms to H2. In this work, except for the adsorbed methoxy species, no bands corresponding to formaldehyde are detected from in situ-DRIFTS analysis (Figs. 5, S10), the low dehydrogenation rate should be limited by C-H bond cleavage of alkoxides, especially methoxy species [58]. Although ZnO can activate alcohol molecules, the intrinsically moderate strength of ZnO/MgxZr1-xOy might be the origin of rate-limited alcohol dehydrogenation [59]. To compare the reactivity of aldol condensation and hydrogen transfer over ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx, the MPV-HT reactions of isobutyraldehyde with methanol at 230 °C and 1.2 h-1 were firstly tested. Isobutyraldehyde was selected as hydrogen acceptor because it has no α-H in carbon backbone to condense with formaldehyde, the more active electrophile [60]. High i-BuOH yield was obtained without any C-C coupling products (Fig. S17). Note that kinetic studies have demonstrated the lower activation energy of aldehyde aldol condensation than that of hydrogen transfer. However, as shown in Fig. 6b for the reaction of n-propanal with methanol (Ea =29.9 kJ mol-1), n-propanol formation rates (grey column) are slightly higher than that of aldol condensation products (MA, MAA, i-BuOH, stacked column). Besides, the rates of above two reaction pathways are invariant with n-propanal partial pressure (1.8-3.6 kPa). We therefore proposed that aldol condensation is possibly limited by accessible formaldehyde, owning to the competition with hydrogen transfer reaction on similar active sites. Above hypothesis is confirmed by co-feeding formaldehyde (FA, 1.5 wt%) with methanol/n-propanal mixture. The major product is MA (aldol condensation product, selectivity >99%) rather than MAA even in the extreme excess of methanol (Fig. 6b). Clearly aldol condensation is the more favored and competitive step than hydrogen transfer process on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx. While the hydrogen transfer processes involved within both methanol dehydrogenation and selective hydrogenation of MA are indispensable for allylic alcohols synthesis. Transition metal sites and high temperatures are often required to facilitate alcohol dehydrogenation activity [57,61]. One can see from Fig. 7 , n-propanol conversion is improved (from 12% at 275 °C to 17% at 300 °C) with increasing reaction temperature at the expense of MAA selectivity (from 90% to 83%). Cu nanoparticles (0.1 wt% immobilization amount) were further introduced as the active dehydrogenation/hydrogenation sites onto ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx (0.1%Cu/ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx). Catalytic result shows that 0.1%Cu/ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx is capable of obtaining 26% of n-propanol conversion with only 18.3% MAA selectivity at 275 °C, resulting in i-BuOH (fully hydrogenated product of MA, 57.2% selectivity in Fig. 7) as the main product. Although high n-propanol dehydrogenation activity is achieved, the performance of selective hydrogen transfer onto C = O bonds rather than C = C bonds tends to be undistinguishable in the presence of Cu. Based on the above findings, we proposed the possible reaction pathways for alcohol dehydrogenative coupling reactions (Scheme 2 ). Methanol dehydrogenation is the initial but rate-decisive step, limited by C-H bonds cleavage of methoxy group. n-Propanol can dehydrogenate into n-propanal catalyzed by ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx, even though the activity needs to be further improved. To our delight, the MPV-HT of n-propanal with methanol can promote methanol dehydrogenation to formaldehyde (step I in Scheme 2). Formaldehyde then undergoes aldol condensation (C-C bonds formation) with n-propanal followed by fast dehydration step to form unsaturated aldehyde intermediate and H2O (step II in Scheme 2). The final MPV-HT step on unsaturated aldehyde intermediate by involving n-propanol as H-donor assists the selective generation of allylic alcohols (step III in Scheme 2). The recombination of H-adatoms generated directly from n-propanol (the more active alcohol than methanol) and/or indirectly from methanol (MPV-HT reaction with n-propanal) is the possible origin of liberated H2. All these steps are catalytically controlled by the synergic effect of interfacial ZnO/MgxZr1-xOy active sites on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx."
9,Application specificity of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx for allylic alcohols synthesis,"3.4 Application specificity of ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx for allylic alcohols synthesis As shown in Table 1 , various alcohols including linear, cyclic aliphatic alcohols and phenylethanol can be dehydrogenative α-methylenated into allylic alcohols with good activity, stability (time on stream for 200 h, Fig. 8 ) and versatility. The substitution positions of OH group have a significant influence on product distributions. Secondary alcohols (2° alcohols, entries 6-8, Table 1) in terms of linear and cyclic alcohols show lower selectivity to mono-methylenation products (selectivity to di-methylenation products reach up to over 50% for the investigated alcohols). These results are related to the higher dehydrogenation activity or the more than one α-H positions in 2° alcohols. Besides, the reaction of benzylic alcohols, phenylethanol as an example can afford allylic alcohol with 87% selectivity (entry 9, Table 1). Notably, terminal alcohol substrates (1° alcohols) all exhibit high selectivity (83-92%) to corresponding allylic alcohols (entries 1-5, Table 1). In view of that low-molecular alcohols such as bio-ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol are readily available substrates from lignocellulosic feedstock, we believe the developed allylic alcohols synthesis strategy could enrich the application fields of biomass-derived platform compounds."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, controlled dehydrogenative α-methylenation of alcohols with methanol has been developed for the selective production of allylic alcohols, one class of high-value intermediates and versatile commodities. It is demonstrated that highly dispersed MgxZr1-xOy phase on ZnO/4Mg1ZrOx oxide exhibit moderate-strong acid-basic strength while its Brønsted acid sites can be passivated by further ZnO integration. The obtained interfacial Lewis acid-basic pair (ZnO/MgxZr1-xOy) is the active site for dehydrogenative alcohol coupling and selective hydrogen transfer process. Our findings highlight the rational design of balanced Lewis acid-basic pair for tandem catalytic transformations of renewable oxygenates into fine chemicals."
