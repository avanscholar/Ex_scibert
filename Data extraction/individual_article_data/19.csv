0,Introduction,"Efficiently utilizing energy from sunlight to produce useful chemicals is one promising and clean approach to address current energy crisis and environment pollution.[1–3] Photocatalytic water splitting has been widely studied to convert light to hydrogen gas.[4–6] Previously, in order to overcome the slowly water oxidization process, methanol was often used as hole sacrificial agent to improve the solar energy utilization efficiency.[7–9] While recently alcohols were also found to be potential as alkylation agents via transforming aldehydes process to prepare valuable medical intermediates and deuterium-labelled drugs.[10–12] Hence, researches for constructing efficient photocatalysts, revealing the relationship between structure and performance of photocatalysts for alcohol oxidation as well as design of photo-triggered valuable atom-economic reactions has been one of the hottest topics. Polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with a moderate bandgap of 2.7 eV can be facile prepared and served as heterogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis, water splitting, CO2 reduction and electrocatalysis. [7,13–19] The adjustable band structure made CN accessible to adsorb most portion of sunlight and able to produce key intermediates to catalytic reductive or oxidative reactions including oxidation of alcohols.[20–24] Recent researches focused on the fine preparation of porous carbon nitride with nanostructures to fulfill alcohols oxidation with or without oxygen atmosphere.[25–28] While strategies of utilization of hydrogen atoms generated during the transform process from alcohols to corresponding aldehydes under irradiation were rarely reported. Hence, further study the photocatalytic oxidation process of alcohols to aldehydes as well as developing efficient photocatalysts and atom-economic strategies of utilization hydrogen atoms from the alcohols to produce valuable chemicals may make great significance for photocatalysis area. [29,30] Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, is widely used as an eco-friendly oxidant for bleaching, organic synthesis and water treatment.[31–33] With an annual production over 5 million tons, greener synthesis methods are also highly in demand to replace the high energy consumption anthraquinone process. Considering the photocatalytic process have been proved to produce key mediates such as superoxide radicals [34], hydroxyl radicals [35] and single oxygen [36] under mild conditions, it is possible to design photocatalysts with fine band structure to realize alcohol oxidation as well as H2O2 production [26]. Herein, we prepared carbon nitride with sufficient cyanide groups to photocatalytic oxidation of kinds of alcohols as well as produce H2O2 with high yield. Cheap ammonium sulfate was optimized as porogen and contributed to the formation of cyanide groups which may further change the band structure and enhance the charge separation. The as-obtained carbon nitride samples with porogens showed enhanced photocatalytic activities for alcohols oxidation and H2O2 production compared with bulk samples. The relationship between different alcohols and H2O2 production efficiency was also carefully studied."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cyanamide (Aladdin, 98 %), ammonium sulfate (Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99%), ammonium carbonate (Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99%), ammonium chloride (Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99%), acetonitrile (HPLC, Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99.9%), ethanol (Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99.8%), benzyl alcohol (Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd, 99%) and other alcohols were used as received."
3,Preparation of carbon nitride with porogens,"2.2 Preparation of carbon nitride with porogens 1 g cyanamide and 0.26 g ammonium sulfate (mol ratio 12:1) were dissolved in 3 mL deionized water. After sonication for 10 min, the solution was transferred in a crucible with a cover and then heated at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 2.3 °C min−1 in air. Then the light-yellow carbon nitride was obtained (totally 0.51 g) and named as CN-S. For preparing CN-C or CN-Cl samples, ammonium carbonate or ammonium chloride was served as porogens respectively. Bulk carbon nitride sample was prepared with pure cyanamide."
4,Photocatalytic performance,"2.3 Photocatalytic performance Typically, 20 mg of catalyst, alcohol (0.1 mmol) and 5 mL solvent were mixed in a 30 mL sealed quartz bottle and saturated with oxygen gas. Then the suspensions were irradiated under a 20 W LED lamp (420 nm). The products were analyzed with an GC–MS System (Agilent Technologies, G7036A) using toluene as external standard. The amount of H2O2 was quantified by iodometry [14]. Typically, 3 mL reaction solution for certain time was collected filtrated with a 0.22 μm Millipore filter to remove photocatalyst. Then mixed with 1 mL of 0.1 M potassium hydrogen phthalate aqueous solution and 1 mL of 0.4 M potassium iodide (KI) aqueous solution. After 30 min, the above solution was analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy, then the amount of H2O2 was estimated according to the absorbance at 350 nm."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and physical properties,"3.1 Synthesis and physical properties It is obvious that gas release during the porogens decomposition as well as the thermal condensation of carbon nitride may lead to porous structure. As Fig. 1 and Figure S1 reflected, SEM and TEM results illustrated that CN-S showed relatively porous structure compared with other samples, while bulk sample showed condensed structure. The as-obtained CN-S, CN-C, CN-Cl samples showed relatively high BET surface areas as Fig. 2 a and Figure S2 reflected. The selected porogens can decomposition completely during the thermal process which facilitated the following purification process compared with hard-template synthesis method and finally induced nearly more than three times larger surface areas for CN-S compared with that of bulk sample. The introduction of different porogens didn’t change the very nature of carbon nitrides, the outlook (Figure S3), XPS C1s spectra (Fig. 2b) and N1s spectra (Figure S4) kept almost the same with that of bulk sample. Only slightly shift to low binding energy was observed which may due to the incompletely condensation with gas release from porogen decomposition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2c) further illustrated that the typical peak around 27.3° and 13.1° can be clearly seen from all samples. These results indicated that the interplanar stacking distance and planar ordering nature of the polymeric carbon nitride structure were well reserved. [7,37] While slight changes can also be observed from the XRD patterns, samples with porogens especially CN-S showed enhanced peaks around 21.8° and 35.1° compared with bulk sample which may due to minor changes of the repeated unites. [38] Further FT-IR spectra revealed that the introduction of porogens may induce more functional groups on the backbone of carbon nitride. The enhancement of 2180 cm−1 for samples with porogens especially for CN-S directly proved the existence of cyanide groups. [38] Solid 13C NMR (Figure S5) also revealed the existence of cyanide groups as the peak around 123 ppm can be clearly seen. This is reasonable that cyanamide with cyanide group, as the precursor of carbon nitride, can trigger the polymerization under high temperature, while the introduced porogens may also decompose to release large amount of gas which may lead to the incomplete condensation of carbon nitride and herein residual cyanide groups remained after the preparation process. The band structures of all samples were then carefully studied to value their potential for photocatalysis. UV–vis adsorption (Fig. 3 a) and calculated band gaps (Figure S6) showed little difference, most samples possessed band gaps around 2.75 eV. While Mott Schottky plots (inset Fig. 3a) revealed relatively different band edges for all samples and CN-S showed the most reductive conductive band edge (Fig. 3b). Considering as-obtained carbon nitride samples with redox power that can reduce oxygen to superoxide radicals (redox potential about −0.33 eV [39,40]) and oxidize benzyl alcohol to corresponding aldehyde (redox potential about 0.76 eV [41,42])."
7,Photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols,"3.2 Photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols We then conducted photocatalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation to value the catalytic activities of different carbon nitride samples. All CN samples prepared with porogens exhibited higher catalytic activities compared with that of bulk sample and CN-S showed the best ability to oxidize the benzyl alcohol within 4 h irradiation (Table S1). Solvents were also screened and the catalytic activity of CN-S in acetonitrile performed the best. Note that, without irradiation there is no catalytic activity which illustrated the photo-triggered nature for the reaction within the optimized system. CN-S can selectively photocatalyze benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high yield (91%) within 8 h. This performance of CN-S sample is competitive compared with that of the reported state-of-the-art carbon nitride-based photocatalysts (Table S2). The scope of alcohols with different functional groups for CN-S sample were also carefully investigated (Table 1). Benzyl alcohols with electron-donating (–OCH3 and –CH3) functional groups showed relatively high yield (greater than95%) compared with alcohols bonded with electron-withdrawing (–F, –NO2) functional groups (86–96%). This phenomenon is also seen in previous literatures. [21,25,41] The steric effect of functional groups was also studied. The para, meta and ortho isomers of methoxybenzyl alcohols can all be catalytic oxidized with high yields (1a-1c) and slightly weak reactivity for meta-methoxybenzyl alcohol compared with other substrates. Alcohols with halides groups were also be well oxidized to corresponding aldehydes without elimination of halides. The heterocyclic alcohols such as 2-thiophenemethanol (1o) and 2-pyridinemethanol (1n) were both converted to corresponding aldehydes with high yields which directly illustrated the resistant advantage of CN-S sample against “poisoning” by N or S atoms. [41–43] Aromatic alcohol with long chain (1 m) and fatty alcohols (1p, 1r) here can also be successfully oxidized to corresponding aldehydes although suffered low yields. All the above results illustrated the high photocatalytic activity and functional-group tolerance of CN-S sample for aerobic alcohol oxidization."
8,Charge separation abilities,"3.3 Charge separation abilities The reusability of CN-S sample was also repeated for 5 cycles, and the photocatalytic activity for oxidizing benzyl alcohol was quite stable even after 5 cycles (Figure S7a). The TEM image (Figure S8) and XRD patterns (Figure S9) of photocatalysts after reaction also illustrated the stability of as-obtained CN-S samples. To further reveal the reasons why CN-S showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for aerobic alcohol oxidization compared with that of bulk sample, more characterizations were conducted. EPR results (Fig. 4 a) revealed that single resonance peak at a g value of 2.003 appeared within two samples while CN-S exhibited higher intensity compared with that of bulk sample which is due to the relatively rich unpaired electrons of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms within the conjugated aromatic ring. Considering the previously XPS and FT-IR results, the introduction of porogens may lead to incompletely condensation and herein contributed to the formation of unpaired carbon atoms and cyanide groups. The successful introduction of cyanide groups to adjust the photocatalytic activities of carbon nitride was also recently reported [38]. Two detailed molecular constitutes, that is distinguishable melem units and its incomplete condensed form with cyanide groups, were constructed to prepare carbon nitride to reveal the special functions of cyanide groups. The fundamental roles of each unit were clearly clarified and unit with cyanide groups was proven to be efficient for charge separation. This conclusion is in accordance to our fluorescence spectra (PL) results (Fig. 4b). CN-S sample with sufficient cyanide groups exhibited much lower fluorescence intensity which directly illustrated the much better charge separation efficiency. Also, the enhanced charge separation may strengthen the photocurrent of CN-S compared with that of bulk sample (Fig. 4c)."
9,Photocatalytic production of H2O2,"3.4 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 The introduction of units with cyanide groups can enhance the charge separation efficiency as well as oxygen molecule adsorption which mainly contributed to the excellent performance of CN-S for aerobic alcohol oxidation. Further electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results (Fig. 4d) help us to reveal the possible mechanism of aerobic alcohol oxidation on CN-S sample. The obvious signals of CN-S in methanol solution under light irradiation for 5 min belong to DMPO- O2 •- product [26] which illustrated the oxygen molecule participated alcohol oxidation process. Considering the success of trapping key superoxide radicals during alcohol oxidation process, we further focused the production combined hydrogen atoms from alcohols during the formation of aldehydes. We then used iodometry method to quantify the possible produced H2O2. It is interesting that the production rate of H2O2 can be accelerated via combining the oxidization of benzyl alcohols with different functional groups (Fig. 4e). The production rate of H2O2 was nearly 19 times larger for CN-S sample when combining para-methoxybenzyl alcohol (201.45 μmol h−1 g−1) compared with that without alcohols (11.29 μmol h−1 g−1). Both the performance curve of H2O2 on optimized CN-S for different reaction time (Figure S10) and the catalytic activities for 5 cycles (Figure S7b) showed quite stability for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Meanwhile different benzyl alcohols may also affect the production rate of H2O2 a lot, the trend was quite in accordance with oxidation trend of alcohols, benzyl alcohols with electron-donating functional groups may better facilitated the H2O2 production than alcohols with electron-withdrawn functional groups. These results were reasonable since facilitated oxidation of alcohols may faster the production of hydrogen species eliminated from alcohols and combination with superoxide radicals to form H2O2. Besides the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2O2 production was also measured, the AQY values (Table S3) at 400 nm and 420 nm were 18.48 and 14.27 respectively, while the value at 475 nm decreased greatly to 2.78, this variation tendency is quite similar to the UV/Vis light absorption spectra (Fig. 3a)."
10,Proposed mechanism for utilization of electrons and holes,"3.5 Proposed mechanism for utilization of electrons and holes To reveal the possible mechanism in our photocatlytic system, different scavengers [34,44] were used to trap certain active species. Sodium sulphite, catalase, benzoquinone (BQ), silver nitrate and 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) were utilized to quench hole (h+), H2O2, superoxide free radicals (O2 •-), electron (e−) and all radicals, respectively. Adding catalase and silver nitrate only slightly decreased the photocatalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation on CN-S sample, while quenching holes, superoxide free radicals and all radicals showed strong inhibitory effect (Fig. 5 ). These results suggested that the photogenerated holes played key roles to oxidize the alcohol, superoxide free radicals with oxidation activity can facilitate the dehydrogenation process of alcohols to aldehydes greatly. Note that XPS element analysis (Figure S11) revealed that CN-S and bulk samples contain almost the same content of oxygen molecules which indicated that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CN-S compared with bulk sample showed no relationship with doped oxygen elements. Elemental analysis results (Table S4) showed that the C/N ratios of carbon nitride prepared with porogens were almost the same with that of bulk carbon nitride. Herein, on the optimized CN-S sample, photogenerated holes can oxidize the alcohols to form corresponding aldehydes via dehydrogenation process. On the other hand, photogenerated electrons can reduce oxygen molecules to superoxide free radicals, then combining with hydrogen species removed from alcohol molecules to form H2O2. The hydrogen borrowing process triggered by superoxide free radicals may also facilitate the hole oxidation process as Fig. 4f reflected."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully fabricated carbon nitride with sufficient cyanide groups via simple calcination process with ammonium sulfate. The decomposition of ammonium sulfate may lead to the incomplete condensation of carbon nitride and remain cyanide groups. Units with cyanide groups help to improve the charge separation efficiency and more reductive conduction band edge which further enhanced the aerobic alcohol oxidation and H2O2 production. Combining with optimized benzyl alcohols, the H2O2 production can be enhanced nearly 19 times larger. These results may enable facile access to a wide range of fabrication of high-efficient photocatalysts and fine design of photocatalytic tandem reactions."
