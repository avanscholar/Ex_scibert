0,Introduction,"Recent advances in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) have driven much interest in the area of vehicle, residential and portable power supplies. For a small sized fuel cell system for portable applications efficient, light and safe hydrogen carriers are needed since the direct use of hydrogen in the form of a compressed vessel or a metal hydride could increase the total system volume or weight. As a result, much attention has been made to convert readily available fuels to hydrogen. The conversion of commercial fuels like hydrocarbon and alcohol to hydrogen can be achieved by catalytic chemical reactions such as steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming [1,2]. In general alcohol fuels like methanol and ethanol are more reactive than hydrocarbon fuels for steam reforming and are thus converted to hydrogen at lower temperature ranges than the cases of hydrocarbon reforming which occurs above 700°C. This study focuses on the ethanol steam reforming over an transition metal catalyst in a multi-layered reformer for portable fuel cell system applications, since it can be easily converted to hydrogen by steam reforming and be renewably produced from biomass [3]. Among catalysts active for steam reforming, precious metals such as Rh, Rt, Pd, and Ru are known to be active for ethanol steam reforming, but they require relatively high reaction temperatures above 600°C [4–8,11–13]. The high reaction temperature would increase the reactor volume due to an additional insulation and result in the increase of CO levels in the product stream due to the reverse water gas shift reaction being favored. Thus, in this study Co/ZnO catalyst was chosen for ethanol steam reforming, because it is one of the most active transition metal oxide for the reaction [9,10]. The catalytic activity was measured at wide temperature ranges from 400 to 600°C and at atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed reactor for steam reforming using a model feed liquid of ethanol aqueous solution. The effect of space velocity on the catalytic performance was also examined with varying catalyst loadings and feed flow rates. This study also includes the possible use of Co/ZnO catalyst in the multi-layered compact reformer for portable fuel cell system."
1,Experimental,"Catalysts were prepared by the coprecipitation method. An aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 6H2O(99%, Aldrich), Co(NO3)2 6H2O (99%, Aldrich) was precipitated by the addition of a Na2CO3 (99%, Aldrich) solution at 50°C under continuous stirring. After aging at 50°C for 1.5h, the resulting precipitate was filtered out. The cake collected from the precipitate was dried at 120°C overnight and calcined under air flow at 500°C for 5h, which was then palletized under a pressure of 3.0 × 108 Pa to give uniform 1.0mm pellets. The elemental analysis on the catalyst sample made by ICP-AES is listed in Table 1 . The active phase in the catalyst was examined using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, measured at the 3C-1 beamline in Pohang Accelerator Laboratory with a 2.5 GeV ring energy and a 200 mA ring current. The fresh sample was pretreated in H2 flow at 450°C and transferred to an aluminum cell with Kapton windows. The spent sample was taken from the reactor, washed with hexane, and then pretreated in He flow at 340°C without exposure to air and similarly transferred to an aluminum cell. For the EXAFS analysis comparisons were made with Co foil. Catalytic studies of ethanol steam reforming were carried out at atmospheric pressure with varying temperatures from 400 to 600°C in a conventional fixed bed reactor (SUS304, 8mm internal diameter). The feed liquid was prepared by mixing 20% ethanol (Aldrich, 99.99%) and 80% distilled water by volume, and was delivered to the reactor by a liquid pump (LabAlliance Series1) through a vaporizer heated to 400°C. The catalytic performance was measured at every 50°C step up to 600°C. Quantities of catalysts loaded in the reactor and flow rates of feed liquid were varied corresponding to gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) of 10,000–120,000h−1. Gas product compositions were determined with a gas analyzer (Emerson, NGA2000), equipped with water chiller, and the data were collected at 10 s intervals. The ethanol steam reformer adopts a multi-layered structure integrated with cross-flowing heat exchanger unit and stacks of element reaction layers of catalytic steam reforming and catalytic combustion as shown in Fig. 1 . The heat exchanger unit consists of two different types of patterned plates with mirror image, which have 38 channels each 58mm long, 1mm wide and 0.6mm deep. The steam reforming layer has S-shape channel of 24mm long, 1.5mm wide and 4mm deep, where the Co/ZnO catalyst pellets were loaded. The combustion layer was filled with commercial Pt/Al2O3 (1.0% Pt, Aldrich) catalyst pellets. The experimental apparatus for the reformer consists of feed sections for steam reforming and catalytic combustion, reaction section in the integrated reactor, and the analysis section with a gas analyzer. The feed of ethanol and water mixture into the reactor for steam reforming was performed by a liquid pump(LabAlliance Series1) and ethanol and air into the reactor for combustion was supplied by a liquid pump and mass flow controller. The reactor was packed by insulation for thermal isolation. The steam reforming reaction was conducted in the temperature ranges of 400–600°C in the basis of reformer side end-plate and the temperature was controlled by varying ethanol feeding into the combustor. The product stream was separated using a cold trap maintained and the flow rate of dry reformed gas was measured by a wet gas meter (Kawasaki). The composition of dry reformed gas was analyzed by a gas analyzer (Emerson, NGA2000)."
2,Results and discussion,"The ethanol steam reforming is an endothermic reaction which generates at most 6 mol of hydrogen per a mole of reacted ethanol and can occur either through dehydrogenation or dehydration pathway [1]. The dehydrogenation pathway leads to a formation of acetaldehyde as a primary product and the following reactions of decarbonylation and coupling form methane and ethane, respectively (Fig. 2 ). The dehydration pathway undergoes a formation of ethylene which reacts with water to produce H2 at lower temperature. The formation of ethylene could often lead to a coke formation on the active center of the catalyst particularly under lack of water in feed stream. It is thus desirable to maintain a suitable steam to carbon ratio in the feed stream during the reaction. The Co/ZnO was successfully synthesized by a coprecipitation method, and was applied for the ethanol steam reforming. In order to determine operating conditions of the reformer the effect of reaction temperature and space velocity on the catalytic performance was examined. Fig. 3 shows the ethanol conversion and the product concentration for the ethanol steam reforming as a function of reaction temperature for the range of 450–550°C at a space velocity of 12,980h−1 and a steam to carbon ratio of 6.0 over the Co/ZnO catalyst. The ethanol conversion was initially below 40% and increased to 95% upon an increase of reaction temperature from 400 to 450°C. Above 450°C, the catalyst showed high and stable activities with the product concentrations of 72–73% H2, 22–25% CO2, 1–5% CO, and 1% CH4. This indicates that the reaction on the Co/ZnO undergoes mainly dehydration pathways without the formation of aliphatic compounds, i.e. methane and ethane. The effect of space velocity on the catalytic performance was investigated as shown in Fig. 4 , which included the H2 effluent rate and the product concentration as a function of space velocity for the range of 10,000–120,000h−1 at a reaction temperature of 450°C and a steam to carbon ratio of 6.0 over the Co/ZnO catalyst. The H2 effluent rate was linearly increased with maintaining the ethanol conversion over 95% within the gas hourly space velocity of 70,000h−1. The product concentrations for H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 were 72–73%, 22–25%, 1–3%, and 1%, respectively. The high catalytic activity of the Co/ZnO at a moderately low reaction temperature of 450°C for the steam reforming brings about major advantages in designing a compact reformer. For example, lower reaction temperature enables to consume less fuel for heating, enhance the thermal durability of the reactor, and reduce the insulation volume. To better characterize the Co/ZnO and elucidate the possible active phase involved in the steam reforming reaction, both the fresh and spent Co/ZnO samples were analyzed by EXAFS spectroscopy, and the resulting Fourier transformed Co K-edge EXAFS spectra are shown in Fig. 5 . The fresh Co/ZnO sample displays one distinct peak, whose position corresponds to the Co–Co distances in bulk Co foil (12 Co–Co: R 0.2506nm). This demonstrates the formation of the Co on the ZnO support. The spectrum of the spent Co/ZnO sample is similar in comparison with that of the fresh sample, showing a slight diminution in the intensity of the Co–Co peak. It is likely the Co phase maintains during reaction. Thus, the active catalyst is probably Co phase. We have thus demonstrated that the cobalt metal on zinc oxide (Co/ZnO) is a promising reforming catalyst and is able to effectively convert ethanol into hydrogen. Reducing the volume of reformer is of much interest particularly for the application in portable fuel cell systems. Since the multi-layered reactor is specialized for better heat and mass transfer rate, it ensures the compact sizing of the reformer. In this regard, the multi-layered reactor has driven much attention as an alterative to the conventional tubular type reactor. Fig. 6 exhibits the performance of the reformer, which includes temperature profiles, product distribution, and H2 production rate as a function of time on stream. The temperature of the combustion layer reached at 500°C in 10min after the catalytic combustion of ethanol started, and became steady at 550°C. During the run the temperature difference between reforming and combustion layers maintained less than 50°C. The hydrogen production rate was stabilized within 2min after the reaction began at 12min. The reformer exhibited good and stable performance with a hydrogen production rate of 5.0 L/min at around 500°C. Table 2 summarizes the performance of the reformer. The product concentrations for H2, CO2, and CO were 73.5, 22.9, and 2.5%, respectively. The hydrogen flow rate of 5.0 L/min corresponds to a PEMFC stack power level of 540W, which demonstrates that the multi-layered reformer can be a feasible solution to generate hydrogen from ethanol for a compact portable system."
3,Conclusions,"The catalytic activity of Co/ZnO catalyst was tested for ethanol steam reforming to produce hydrogen. The catalyst had high activity with an ethanol conversion over 95% and a H2 concentration of 72% at a moderately low temperature of 450°C. Results on product concentrations at low temperatures of 450°C confirm a good and stable performance of Co/ZnO catalyst with H2, CO2, CO and CH4 of 72, 22–25, 2–3, and 1%, respectively. The catalyst was loaded into a multi-layered reformer made of stainless steel, which expectedly gave a good performance with a hydrogen production rate of 5.0 L/min at a moderately low temperature of 500°C. It is concluded that the novel Co/ZnO catalysts exhibit high stability and catalytic activity for ethanol steam reforming at a low temperature below 500°C and can be readily adopted onto the compact reformer for the compact portable fuel cell system."
