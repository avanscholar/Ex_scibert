0,Introduction,"At present, biodiesel is conventionally produced from the transesterification method. Although this process is effective for the commercial biodiesel production, the low quality of biodiesel is still one of the major barriers for improvement [1]. As compared with diesel fuel, the inferior fuel properties of biodiesel include the relatively low oxidation stability, poor cold flow properties, low energy content, and poor thermal stability [35]. Consequently, the advanced production processes and the improvement of existing processes are necessary to overcome these issues. The simple and effective method that emerged recently is the addition of co-reactive solvent (long-chain alcohols) in the production system. For example, as reported in our previous work [2], the addition of isopropanol in the ethanol-based biodiesel production could significantly upgrade the cold flow properties of biodiesel product. Isopropyl ester was the cold flow modifier in this case. However, some fuel properties such as oxidation stability and thermal stability were not significantly improved due to the high content of polyunsaturated compounds contained in biodiesel. The double-bond in unsaturated components of biodiesel can be removed by a 2-step process, as a combination of biodiesel production and hydrotreating process, yielding a product so-called hydrogenated biodiesel or H-FAME. In this method, biodiesel is produced via transesterification followed by reacting with hydrogen (partial hydrogenation reaction) to eliminate the unsaturated bond(s) on biodiesel esters. The oxidation stability, thermal stability, and other properties were improved [3]. For this method, moderate reaction temperatures (80–140 °C) and pressures (0.1–0.5 MPa) are commonly applied. For instance, as reported in the work of Chen et al. [4], hydrogenation reaction at 80°C and 0.5 MPa over Pd/SBA-15 was used to enhance the quality of biodiesel. The polyunsaturated FAME was significantly transformed into saturated FAME, leading to the improvement of oxidation stability (> 50 h). Based on the literature, supported non-noble metal catalysts such as Ni, Mo, and Cu provided high catalytic activity for partial hydrogenation process [5]. However, these catalysts require extreme operating conditions [6]. Another problem of these catalysts is the presence of trans-FAME (trans-isomers) in the product, reducing the fuel quality of hydrogenated oil [7,8]. The supported noble metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, and Rh) were recently reported for higher catalytic activity, milder operating conditions, and lower yield of trans-FAME [8]. Among these catalysts, Rh-based catalysts were demonstrated the highest catalytic activity for the conversion of polyunsaturated methyl esters to monounsaturated/saturated methyl esters [33][9]. Good catalytic activity for facilitating the isomerization of trans-isomers to cis-isomer was also reported [10], offering a great potential for hydrogenation process. Although the improvement of fuel quality (based on the conventional biodiesel) was provided by this method, further refinements were still necessary in order to achieve the fuel properties comparable to that of petroleum diesel. Hydroprocessing has recently been introduced as one of the promising processes to produce high-quality bio-based liquid fuel, with similar properties to that of petroleum diesel. In this technique, hydrogen and triglycerides are the raw materials fed into the catalytic reaction system, producing unsaturated and oxygen-free product with superior fuel quality compared to H-FAME and conventional biodiesel [32]. The desired product (commonly called bio-hydrogenated biodiesel: BHD or green diesel) in this method consisted of long-chain alkanes, short- and branched-chain alkanes [11]. During the process, multiple reactions are involved including hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, decabonylation, decarboxylation, isomerization, and hydrocracking. The catalytic activity and selectivity of catalyst are the major parameters affecting the desired products as well as the operating conditions. Note that, the reaction temperature (> 280 °C) and pressure (> 5 MPa) are normally used [12]. Several effecient catalysts have been reported for the hydroprocessing of triglycerides. Metal-based Al2O3 catalysts (such as Pt/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and Ni/Al2O3) have been extensively investigated with numerous achievements in hydroprocessing processes [13]. For example, in the work of Liu et al. [14] who applied NiMo/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst for BHD production, 82.1% of BHD yield was obtained at the hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa and the reaction temperature of 350°C. This was owing to the multi-function of this catalyst. The addition of metals (NiMo) promoted the hydrogenation and deoxygenation, while the isomerization/cracking were catalyzed by solid acid catalyst (SiO2- Al2O3). Note that, high acidity of the catalyst was required to promote the deoxygenation reaction [15]. Among many types of material, zeolite-based catalysts are generally associated with high acidity and high BET surface area [16]. The high yield for BHD production was reported with the use Pt/HZSM-5 and Pd/HZSM-5 catalysts. As a member of platinum group metals, rhodium (Rh) is also considered as one of the potential catalysts in terms of catalyst activity and selectivity for H-FAME application. This catalyst has not been applied for the production of BHD, particularly, Rh/HZSM-5. Unfortunately, these catalysts are rather expensive [17]. Hence, optimization of the reaction performance and the stability of catalyst are of great importance for the economic viability of the overall process. This work was one of the pioneering researche to explore the use of Rh/HZSM-5 as a novel catalyst for hydroprocessing of palm oil into BHD. The investigation was performed in a mini fixed-bed reactor. The operating parameters affecting the BHD yield were analyzed including the reaction temperature, pressure, hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio, and weight hourly space velocity. The properties of BHD product such as viscosity, density, cold flow property, and oxidation stability were measured and compared to the those obtained from different processes as reported in the literature. The reactor performance was also evaluated and compared."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Palm oil from Morakot Industries Public Company Limited was used in this work. The physical properties of this material were reported in our previous work [2]. The catalyst was Rhodium supported on HZSM-5 (5 wt%), which was purchased from Riogen Inc. High purity hydrogen (99.995%) and ultra-high purity helium (99.999% and air zero were used to study the composition of bio-fuel by GC analysis. The 40 mg/L alkane standard solution (C8-C20) in hexane purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used as the GC standard. Cyclohexane (GC grade) was used as solvent for sample preparation."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The catalyst used in this current study was 5% rhodium supported on HZSM-5, which was previously examined for various surface properties such as morphology of catalyst surface as well as specific surface properties and metal dispersion. Detailed description of catalyst characterization was reported by Bangjang et al. [18]. The specific surface area, pore size, and metal dispersion were 341.4 m2/g, 29.79 Å, and 24.05%, respectively."
4,Reaction system,"2.3 Reaction system In this work, the hydro-processing was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. The reactor was a stainless-steel tube (4.6 mm I.D. and 5 mm in length) that was placed horizontally in a tubular furnace as shown in Fig. 1 . Approximately 0.05 g of Rh/HZSM-5 was packed inside the reactor and was sandwiched between glass-wool at both ends. The exit-end of the reactor was connected to a back-pressure regulator to maintain the pressure of the system. Prior to the reaction testing, the reactor was heated at 330 °C under hydrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 70 mL/min for 1.5 h. After that flow rate of hydrogen and the reactor temperature were changed to the desired value. Then a stream of palm oil was introduced via an HPLC pump to mix with the stream of hydrogen at a T-connector, where the liquid input stream was at right angle to the hydrogen input stream. A stream of gas-liquid mixture leaving the T-connector entered the reactor where chemical transformation took place over the catalyst packed inside the reactor. The product stream passed through the back-pressure regulator and was separated into gas and liquid products (aqueous and organic phases). The organic phase was collected for GC analysis. The reaction performance of our process was discussed based on the following parameters. (1) Conversion of palm oil ( % ) = ( 1 − ( Mass of palm oil unreacted Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) ) × 100 (2) Organic liquid yield ( % ) = ( Mass of liquid ( organic phase ) produced Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) × 100 (3) Aqueous liquid yield ( % ) = ( Mass of liquid ( aqueous phase ) produced Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) × 100 (4) Mass of gas phase = Mass of starting palm oil − Mass of liquid phase (5) Gas yield ( % ) = ( Mass of gas produced Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) × 100 (6) BHD yield ( % ) = ( Mass of BHD ( C 8 − C 18 ) produced Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) × 100 (7) Productivity ( k g product / k g cat × h ) = ( Mass of BHD ( C 8 − C 18 ) produced Mass of starting palm oil ( triglycerides ) ) × 100 (8) WHSV ( h − 1 ) = ( Mass flow rate of palm oil Catalyst amount )"
5,GC analysis,"2.4 GC analysis Each sample was dissolved in cyclohexane at the volume ratio of 1:10. Then 200 µL of the diluted solution was mixed with 800 µl of cyclohexane. The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC CP-3800, DB-1 column) equipped with flam-ionization detector (FID). The injection port and the detector were operated at 350 °C. The initial oven temperature was at 40 °C, where it was held for 2 min followed by heating at the rate of 20 °C/min to 350 °C and held for 5 min. The analysis results were used to determine the conversion of palm oil and the yield of BHD."
6,Properties of biofuel,"2.5 Properties of biofuel The viscosity of liquid product collected was determined by Ostwald viscometer (ISO 3104) at 40 °C. The density was measured by pycnometer at 20 °C. The heating value of BHD was measured by using a bomb calorimeter (PARR 1261). An open cup method according to ASTM D93 was used to determine the flash point of BHD. The pour point was measured in a test tube, where it was held at a horizontal position for 5 s. The temperature at which the fuel totally ceased flow was observed for every 3 °C decrement. The oxidation stability of BHD was measured by the modified Rancimat method (EN15751). An amount of 3 g of sample was tested at a constant temperature of 110 °C, and the air passed through the sample at a rate of 10 L/h. After that, the products of oxidation reaction were transferred into distilled water. The change of conductivity of water was observed via a conductivity electrode. The history plot of conductivity was analyzed to obtain the inductive period, where the conductivity increased rapidly. For the simulated distillation analysis, the distillation curve was determined by a GC equipped with Zebron ZB-1XT Simdist capillary column (15 m × 0.53 mm × 0.25 µm). The temperature program was set at 40 °C for 1 min before ramping at a rate of 10 °C/min to 370 °C, where it was held for 5 min. The injector and FID detector were maintained at 370 °C. The injection volume was 1 µL (splitless)."
7,Results and discussions,"The conversion of palm oil into BHD via a one-step hydro-processing over Rh/HZSM-5 in a continuous mini fixed-bed reactor was tested under various operating conditions to optimize the production capacity. The effects of reaction temperature, pressure, palm oil-to-catalyst ratio, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio were investigated based on the ""one-factor-at-a-time"" approach. The stability of catalyst was demonstrated, and the production performance was compared with the literature data."
8,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.1 Effect of reaction temperature Reaction temperature is one of the most important parameters that strongly affects the catalytic activity for hydro-processing of vegetable oil (Bezergianni et al., 2009). In our system, when the reaction temperature was below 310 °C, we observed that the reaction product turned into wax at room temperature, suggesting the presence of raw material and free fatty acids [19] and that the conversion process should be operated at higher temperatures. Moreover, cracking of vegetable oils is commonly reported in the range of 380–525 °C [20,21]. For example, a bare conversion (< 5%) was obtained when the temperature of 375 °C was used for the hydroprocessing of palm oil [22]. Hence, we firstly varied the reaction temperature from 400 to 500 °C, while the pressure, amount of catalyst, flow rate of hydrogen, and flow rate of palm oil were constant at 34 bar, 0.05 g, 35 mL/min, and 0.04 mL/min, respectively. The liquid product consisted of organic phase and aqueous phase (see Fig. 1). The organic phase consisted of hydrocarbon-based components, while the aqueous phase was mostly water. The target product in our work was straight-chain and branched hydrocarbon compounds in the range of C8 to C18. The impurities of our BHD product included free fatty acids and mono-, di, and triglycerides. The aqueous phase and gaseous products were the by-products of this process. Fig. 2 shows the chromatograms of the organic phase product obtained from hydro-processing of palm oil over Rh/HZSM-5 at different temperatures (400, 450, and 500 °C), collected at the time-on-stream of 300 min. The history of organic product yield and conversion of palm oil is presented in Fig. 3 . After 3 h of operation, the system was relatively stable, suggesting a steady-state of the reaction system. Despite the nearly complete conversion of palm oil for all cases, it was evident that the reaction temperature strongly affected the distribution of hydrocarbon products due to the cleavage of C=C and C-O bonds at high temperatures [23]. At 400 °C, there was a significant portion of products with relatively larger molecular weights and no aqueous product was observed. Although the yield of liquid organic phase was 88.3% (see Fig. 5a), the product consisted mostly of non-BHD products, such as free fatty acids (particularly palmitic and stearic acids), mono-, di, and triglycerides (see Fig. 2). The hydrogenation of C=C of the unsaturated triglycerides into saturated triglycerides, followed by the hydrogenolysis of C-O of the saturated triglycerides into the smaller compounds resulted in free fatty acids and propane [24]. It was conceivable that the temperature was not high enough to promote the the hydrogenation of fatty acids and decarbonylation of alcohols into the BHD products [25]. Increasing the reaction temperature to 450 °C resulted in a substantial decrease in the non-BHD products while increasing the portion of hydrocarbon products below C15 (see Fig. 2). This was due to the enhanced hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation. Moreover, the triglyceride compounds were hardly detected at this temperature, indicating the complete conversion of palm oil. Although the BHD yield was increased as expected, some intermediate compounds were still observed, suggesting that a higher temperature was required to covert the intermediate compounds to the desired products. This trend continued for further increasing the reaction temperature to 500 °C as relatively higher peaks of C18 were observed, indicating that cracking reactions were markedly promoted. This was in line with the results in Fig. 3 that shows a significant decline in the yield of liquid product. In other words, more gas product was produced owing to the intensified cracking reactions. Moreover, the presence of aqueous product was clearly observed, suggesting that more fatty acids were transformed into straight-chain paraffins (C15–C18) via deoxygenation reaction. Fig. 4 shows that the yield of C8 - C18 approached steady-state at around 300 min. The yield of BHD at 500 °C was highest despite the decline in liquid yield. The average yield of C8 - C18 at 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C was 31.29%, 39.50%, and 44.26%, respectively. Therefore, the temperature of 500 °C was selected to further study the effect of process variables."
9,Effect of pressure,"3.2 Effect of pressure Hydrogen pressure is another important parameter affecting the performance of hydroprocessing of vegetable oil or triglycerides [24]. This is because hydrogen pressure is directly related to the transfer of hydrogen from gas onto the catalyst surface [26]. The higher the hydrogen pressure, the more adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surface. Increasing hydrogen pressure promotes hydrodeoxygenation, while the opposite favors decarboxylation [27]. The hydrogen pressure between 25 and 150 bar was commonly used in BHD production [21]. For this set of experiments, the low hydrogen pressure was investigated by varying from 7 to 34 bar while the flow rates of palm oil and hydrogen were 0.04 mL/min and 35 mL/min, respectively. The reaction temperature was kept constant at 500 °C. As shown in Fig. 5 , the hydrogen pressure slightly affected the results in terms of organic liquid product yield throughout the entire range of 7–34 bar. Note that the conversion of palm oil was nearly complete for all experiments studied. The small increase in the organic yield was observed when the hydrogen pressure was increased. It means that our proposed process was effective for the conversion of triglycerides into liquid products via deoxygenation process under the low requirement of pressure (<35 bar). When analyzed via GC-FID, it was found that increasing the hydrogen pressure from 7 to 34 bar enhanced the yield of C8–C18 fairly from 33.7% to 44.3% (see Fig. 6 ). This was due to the shifting of product distribution particularly for the fraction of product that was larger than C18 into the range of C8 - C18. Hence, the hydrogen pressure of 34 bar was applied for subsequent experiments."
10,Effect of palm oil flow rate,"3.3 Effect of palm oil flow rate Due to the cost of catalyst, it is important to minimize the amount of catalyst and to maximize the throughput of the process. In this set of experiments, the flow rate of palm oil was varied between 0.01 and 0.04 mL/min while keeping the amount of catalyst constant at 0.05 g. The flow rate of hydrogen and reaction temperature were fixed at 35.0 mL/min and 500 °C, respectively. This corresponds to the ratio of palm oil-to-catalyst ratio (or weight hourly space velocity, WHSV) and the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio in the range of 10.0–43.7 h−1 and 74:1 to 323:1 (see Eq. (8)), respectively. Note that, the WHSV was calculated based on the work of Yang et al. [28]. Fig. 7 shows that the conversion of palm oil was complete. At low WHSV of 10.0 h−1 or high hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio (323:1), the reaction product was mainly hydrocarbon gas due to the extent of cracking reactions. This was caused by the excess hydrogen concentration and the relatively longer residence time compared to that of other experimental conditions with higher flow rate of palm oil. Increasing the WHSV to 21.0 h−1 markedly increased the liquid yield to 55% (see Fig. 7b) as the residence time was shortened and the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio was decreased. The side reactions (such as methanation reaction) were avoided to a certain extent[24]. Increasing WHSV to 43.7 h−1 (corresponding to the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 74:1) resulted in a slight increase of liquid yield. Note that further increasing the WHSV caused a pressure build-up exceeding 60 bar in the system. This problem was commonly found for mini fixed-bed reactors [45] SV of 43.7 h−1 was used to further study the effect of hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio on the reaction performance. The comparison of C8 - C18 yield obtained at different WHSVs is presented in Fig. 8 . At WHSV = 43.7 h−1, the maximum liquid organic yield of 60.1% and the maximum yield of C8 - C18 of 44.26% were obtained. In our process, the high WHSV (low hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio) was preferable to prevent further side reactions of BHD product into undesired products. In addition, the WSHV of 43.7 h−1 was relatively high when compared to that of the other processes as reported in the literature. For example, in the work of Patil and Vaidya [23] who synthesized BHD from jatropha oil using hydrotalcite-like compound containing ruthenium, the conversion and yield of about 35% and 30% were achieved at the WHSV of 4 h−1."
11,Effect of hydrogen flow rate,"3.4 Effect of hydrogen flow rate Generally, hydro-processing of palm oil requires a plenty amount of hydrogen to efficiently react with palm oil as well as to eliminate water and to prevent carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, depending on the type of catalyst applied [27,29,30]. The amount of hydrogen used also affects the operating cost of BHD production. Hence, in this work, the effect of hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio was investigated by adjusting the flow rate of hydrogen while holding a constant flow rate of palm oil at 0.04 mL/min. Other reaction parameters including reaction temperature and pressure were kept constant at 500 °C and 34 bar, respectively. In this case, the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio was varied in the range of 36.6:1–220.9:1. As shown in Fig. 9 , despite the shortened residence time in the reactor, full conversion of palm oil was achieved for the entire span of hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio investigated. The fraction of liquid yield decreased significantly from 60.3% to 40.2% with increasing the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio from 36.6 to 220.9 mol H2/mol (corresponding to the flow rate of hydrogen of 17.5 and 105.0 mL/min). It was conceivable that the increase in molar ratio between hydrogen and palm oil enhanced hydro-processing, especially cracking reactions. The extent to which the cracking was promoted resulted in a significantly reduced portion of the liquid organic yield especially at the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 220.9 mol H2/mol. This led to a marked increase in the fraction of gas product as observed in Fig. 9. In line with previous results, Fig. 10 shows that the yield of C8–C18 decreased with increasing hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio. The maximum yield of BHD was 51% at the hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6 mol H2/mol, corresponding to the productivity of BHD of 21.2 Kgproduct/Kgcat-h. Therefore, in this work, the optimal operating conditions for the conversion of palm oil to BHD in a fixed bed reactor using Rh/HZSM-5 as catalyst were at 500 °C, flow rate of palm oil of 0.04 mL/min, hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6 mol H2/mol, and the pressure of 34 bar."
12,Stability of catalyst,"3.5 Stability of catalyst Since HZSM-5 was used as catalyst support for this application. One might be suspicious about the catalyst lifetime for the production of BHD, which involved cracking reactions. We performed a reaction testing at the optimal operating conditions (500 °C, 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV = 43.7 h−1, and the molar ratio between hydrogen and palm oil of 36.6:1) over the extended length of time (24 h) for the continuous experiment in order to observe the stability of catalyst in terms of the conversion of palm oil and the yield of BHD. Results are shown in Fig. 11 . In average, the liquid yield of 59.4% (93.4% of liquid fraction was organic phase) and the yield of gas product of 40.6% were obtained. Apparently, with full conversion of palm oil throughout the experiment, the catalyst exhibited high stability for at least 10 h of time-on-stream. After 300 min, the average yield and the productivity of C8 - C18 were 51.13% and 21.2 Kgproduct/Kgcat•hr, respectively."
13,Comparison with non-catalytic process,"3.6 Comparison with non-catalytic process The reaction testing was also extended for the case of empty reactor (blank). Fig. 12 shows the %yield of C8–C18 obtained without the presence of catalyst in the reactor during 10 h of time-on-stream. Despite the comparable liquid yield, the average yield of 38.0% and the productivity of 16.2 kgproduct/kgcat•h were significantly lower than that obtained by using Rh/HZSM-5 as catalyst (yield of 51.13% and productivity of 21.2 kgproduct/kgcat⋅h) under the same operating conditions (reaction temperature of 500 °C, pressure of 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV of 43.7 h−1, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6:1). This result suggested that the distribution of hydrocarbon product obtained from thermal processing and that with the use of catalyst might be significantly different. The chromatograms as presented in Fig. 13 indicates that the main product from the blank test was C17. This also caused the sample to solidify as wax at room temperature. On the other hand, for the case of Rh/HZSM-5 catalyst, the distribution of hydrocarbons appeared different from the case of blank test. The main product was C12 - C15 and the sample was stable as liquid at room temperature. Simulated distillation analysis (ASTM D2887) was used to obtain the boiling range distribution of samples. Fig. 14 shows that the use of HZSM-5 yielded a similar profile compared to that of the blank test, suggesting that the product from thermal cracking contained significant portion of high-boiling point components. Almost 80% of the sample was above the boiling point of 350 °C. In line with the previously discussed GC-chromatogram, the distillation curve drastically shifted to the right for the case of hydrotreating over Rh/HZSM-5. The fraction of high boiling point (over 350 °C) was reduced to approximately 2.6%."
14,Product properties,"3.7 Product properties The reaction product obtained at the optimal conditions (reaction temperature of 500 °C, pressure of 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV of 43.7 h−1, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6:1) was studied for various properties including density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, acid value, and oxidation stability. Results were compared with the commercially available B-20 and B100-FAME in Thailand, and also the US and European standards as summarized in Table 1 . Note that, B-20 is a mixture of diesel and biodiesel at the ratio of 80:20. Most fuel properties of our product were well within the recommended range according to the standards except for the acid value. This suggested that the product should be blended with diesel at a certain proportion in order to keep the acid value of the blend below 0.5 mg KOH/g. The properties of our liquid fuel were also compared with the literature for biodiesel obtained from the conventional process (transesterification of palm oil and methanol) and biodiesel from the modified process (transesterification of palm oil with reactive co-solvent). Our fuel properties such as cold flow properties and oxidation stability were apparently improved, confirming the effective implementation of our production technique."
15,Reaction performance,"3.8 Reaction performance The reaction performance at the optimal operating conditions was compared with other processes as reported in the literature. Table 2 summarizes the reaction conditions of each system for converting various vegetable oils into liquid fuels. The performance comparison was based on the productivity term (kgproduct/kgcat•h) as well as the requirements of operating conditions. As observed from the results, catalytic thermal cracking process required high reaction temperature (> 400 °C) to obtain the liquid fuels. The zeolite (HZSM-5) exhibited great catalytic performance to convert vegetable oil to liquid fuel; however, the relatively low productivity (1.15 kgproduct/kgcat•h) was the disadvantage of this method. The yield of organic liquid product (OLP) of 90.1% was achieved via the combination of 3 processing steps including thermal cracking, alkylation and hydrogenation. Although the remarkably high OLP yield was achieved, the complex processes were difficult to implement. Hence, hydrogenation is conceivably the most favorable process. For this technique, the reaction temperature between 280 and 425 °C were used along with the pressure in the range of 0.1 to 5 MPa. High OLP yields were obtained with the use of various types of catalyst (mostly zeolites). The long residence time and low productivity were obviously the challenges of this method. In our work, with the use of highly active catalyst in the form of Rh/HZSM-5, the considerably high productivity was achieved (21.2 kgproduct/kgcat•h). The extremely short residence time (< 1 min) and the significant decrease in the use of hydrogen were the highlights of our work, which could help minimize the production cost [31]. However, the relatively low selectivity and the required reaction temperature (500°C), which was slightly higher than that of other systems, were the trade-offs. Therefore, this would be an alternative method that is effective for producing diesel substitute from palm oil in one step."
16,Conclusion,"High-throughput production of bio-hydrogenated diesel via a one-step hydro-processing in a continuous mini fixed-bed reactor has been demonstrated. The catalyst was Rh/HZSM-5 packed in a tubular reactor. The operating conditions including reaction temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio were optimized based on the reaction performance using one-factor-at-a-time approach. At the optimal conditions (500 °C, 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV of 43.7 h−1, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6:1), the yield and productivity of C8–C18 of 51.13% and 21.2 kgproduct/kgcat⋅h were achieved. This productivity was substantially higher compared to the literature data of other systems."
