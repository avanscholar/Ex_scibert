0,Introduction,"The nonrenewable sources of energy that comes from fossil fuel causes a negative effect on the environment such as greenhouse gas emissions, raising in the temperature and air pollution problems. Therefore, it is a must to replace these sources of energy with a renewable one such as hydrogen, wind and solar energy to have a more ecofriendly energy source. Photolysis and photocatalysis have applications in wastewater treatment (Abid et al. 2019) and hydrogen production from water splitting (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019a) Photocatalytic water splitting using ammonium sulfite as sacrificial agent to produce hydrogen is one step in a thermochemical cycle for overall water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is produced at high temperature while other chemicals such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide are recycled. There are many closed thermochemical cycles of this class, one of them is (1a) S O 2 ( g ) + 2 N H 3 g + H 2 O I → N H 4 2 S O 3 a q c h e m i c a l a b s o r p t i o n , 25 ° C (1b) N H 4 2 S O 3 a q + H 2 O I → N H 4 2 S O 4 a q + H 2 g s o l a r p h o t o c a t a l y t i c , < 80 ° C (1c) N H 4 2 S O 4 s + Z n O s → 2 N H 3 g + Z n S O 4 s + H 2 O g s o l a r t h e r m a l , 500 ° C (1d) Z n S O 4 s → S O 2 g + Z n O s + 1 2 O 2 g s o l a r t h e r m a l , 1000 ° C Studies on other cycles that include ammonia could be found in references (T-Raissi et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006a,b, 2011; Littlefield et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2014; Kalyva et al., 2015; Kalyva et al 2017a,b, Vagia et al., 2017; Muradov et al., 2015) There is also the original Westinghouse cycle or HyS cycle that does not include ammonia (Brecher et al., 1977; Carty et al., 1977; Corgnale and Summers, 2011). A recent review on thermochemical cycles is presented by Safari and Dincer 2020. We can run Eq. (1b) by photolysis under UV radiation (Huang et al., 2006a) or using a photocatalyst under visible light radiation (Huang et al., 2006b). CdS is the most investigated photocatalyst usually with some additives. In this reaction ammonium sulfite is called hole scavenger or sacrificial agent since it is converted to ammonium sulfate. Sabaté et al., 1990 obtained the kinetics of the reaction in the form of Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetics (LH) with CdS as photocatalyst and the ions of sulfides, sulfites and thiosulfates as sacrificial agents. The effect of pH and temperature on the reaction are studied. Markovskaya et al. (2015) obtained the kinetics of the reaction in LH form using CuS/Cd0.3 Zn0.7S and NixCd0.3Zn0.7S1+x as photocatalyst and Na2S/Ne2SO3 as sacrificial agents. Tambago and de Leon (2015) obtained the kinetics for the reaction in LH form using CdZnS photocatalyst and Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents. Karimi Estahbanati et al. (2019a) presented a general kinetic model based on LH kinetics. A reaction mechanism and a kinetic model were proposed to predict the rate of hydrogen production, which is a function of light intensity, catalyst loading, substrate concentration, and time. Karimi Estahbanati et al. (2019b), proposed a kinetic study of the effects of pH on the photocatalytic hydrogen production from alcohols. Different alcohols were selected to be used such as methanol, glycerol and ethanol under different values of the pH that varies from 2 to 12. They studied the effect of the used alcohol and the operation pH on the production rate of hydrogen. Moreover, the validity of the proposed model was judged according to the comparison between hydrogen produced experimentally and the model’s predicted hydrogen produced. The experimental data showed a good fit with the model. They claimed that, the optimum pH to increase the amount of the hydrogen produced is about 8. Huang et al. (2006a), designates an innovative UV driven photolysis hydrogen generation process without using any semiconductor photocatalyst to generate hydrogen from solutions of ammonium sulfite (NH4)2SO3. They made a sequence of experiments in order to study the kinetics of the reaction along with finding the optimum reaction parameters in the photoreactor, via an HPLC they determined the concentrations of the ions of sulfite (SO3 2-), sulfate (SO4 2-) along with the dithionate (S2O6 2-) present in the photoreactor. They concluded that, under the irradiance of the ultraviolet light, the ions of the sulfite SO3 2- could be oxidized photochemically into SO4 2-. According to their work, they indicate that, there are two pathways of the photolysis of the ammonium sulfite. The first route is a direct oxidation of SO3 2- into SO4 2- and the second route is oxidation of the SO3 2- ions to S2O6 2- and those ions are then converted into SO4 2-. They reported that, the first stated pathway is considered and noticed to be the dominant reaction route than the second route. They also, found that, changing the pH of the solution of the ammonium sulfite (NH4)2SO3 has a high significance with respect to the rate of hydrogen generation. They stated that, the pH range that is from 7.8 to 8.0 was noticed to be the optimal value of pH as it has the highest hydrogen generation rate. They elaborated that within this range, the ions of both SO3 2- along with HSO3 - ions exist at almost equal number of moles which reduces the potential energy that is needed in order to oxidize the SO3 2- ions. They also studied the effect of the reaction temperature on the amount of the hydrogen produced in their experiment of the photolysis of the ammonium sulfate solution (NH4)2SO3. They found that, the highest amount of hydrogen produced was when the temperature of the reaction was in the range of 35 °C to 50 °C. Yet, any additional rise of the temperature to a degree that is higher than 75 °C results in a slight reduction in the rate of the produced amount of hydrogen in comparison with the rate of hydrogen that is generated at 50 °C. They suggested that, there are two possible reasons for this observation, the first one is the dependency of the temperature on the pH of the solution and the other one is that, at higher temperature the absorption is enhanced through the photo reactor vessel along with the glass. Vagia et al. 2017 developed new photo thermo chemical hybrid system of sulfur ammonia. In their experiment the splitting of water mechanism was done by using a solar beam that uses a quantum UV along with the infrared thermal beams in the step of oxygen generation. They used ZnS along with CdS as a photo catalyst as they have a small band gap energy and the used sacrificial agent was ammonium sulfite. They studied the effect of the amount of the catalyst used, the light irradiance intensity along with the effect of changing the temperature of the reaction on the amount of the produced hydrogen using XRD, TEM and SEM. They claimed that their output from this study can enhance the performance of the photo reactor design. Song et al. (2012), studied the photocatalytic rection of the desulfurization of flue gas in order to limit the sulfur dioxide emissions that resulted from the fossil fuel combustion. They stated that; by using the technology of the photocatalytic, it is possible to achieve hydrogen evolution generation from water as well as solving the issue of sulfur dioxide emissions that resulted from the fossil fuel combustion. To do so, they loaded the cadmium sulfide with platinum as a photocatalyst in order to model the photocatalyst desulfurization of the flue gas. They detected the main factors that directly influence the hydrogen generation rate as well as the oxidation reaction of the ammonium sulfite. Implementing the photocatalysis technology, they were able to reach their target through eliminating the sulfur dioxide emission problem. They found that, the photocatalysis activity of the catalyst used in order to make the hydrogen generation and the oxidation of the ammonia sulfite was noticed to highly depend on the concentration of the (NH4)2SO3. Maximum hydrogen production is obtained from 1.25 M solution. They also found that, the photocatalysis activity of the catalyst used in order to make the hydrogen generation and the oxidation of the ammonia sulfite was noticed to be highly dependent on the amount of Pt loaded on CdS catalyst. They also found that, the photocatalysis activity of the catalyst used in order to make the hydrogen generation and the oxidation of the ammonia sulfite was noticed to highly depend on the amount of Pt loaded on the Pt coating method. Literature survey indicates that most of the previous kinetics studies were carried out for system containing sodium sulfite. The kinetics for ammonium sulfite solution was not obtained. In this paper we study the kinetics for photolysis and photocatalytic reaction of ammonium sulfite solution to give hydrogen and ammonium sulfate. The kinetic model for the photocatalytic reaction is based on the model presented by Karimi Estahbanati et al. (2019a) The main reaction taking place is (2) ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 3 ( a q ) + H 2 O ↔ C d S , S u n l i g h t ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 4 ( a q ) + H 2 ( g ) This is done by comparing the proposed kinetics to an experimental work already accomplished from literature. The first step was to get real data suitable for our case. This step was followed by validating the resulted kinetics by modeling a MATLAB code that can predict the rate of hydrogen evolution based on the obtained kinetics and the input data such as the substrate concentration. Finally, comparing the results with an actual work done experimentally. The same previous procedure was followed to obtain the kinetics of the photolysis of ammonium sulfite with water under solar radiation to produce hydrogen. The effect of pH on the amount of the hydrogen generated was investigated in this case."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Photolysis,"2.1 Photolysis Hydrogen production rate is affected by the pH of the reactant solution. Thus, it is important to decide an optimal pH range to maximize the hydrogen production rate. A simulation based on MATLAB, for real experiment data obtained from literature (Huang et al., 2006a), was done to get the parameters of Eq. (3) that shows the relation between the rate of hydrogen formation and the pH of the solution. for a reacting solution of volume V, (3) d H 2 d t = r H 2 ∗ V 1500 = K 1 ∗ p H 2 1 + K 2 ∗ p H ∗ V 1500 m l H 2 / m i n Using MATLAB, the code Model 1 was established to solve for the missing parameters in Eq. (3) using the data from reference (Huang et al., 2006a). The parameters in the reaction rate Eq. (3) were obtained by performing a fit of the full experimental data presented in Fig. 1 . This was achieved by using a MATLAB code based on a least square fit routine “lsqcurvefit” that solved the ordinary differential Eq. (3) with respect to time with an “ode45” function. The resulted data of the designed code (Model 1) are represented in Fig. 1. In this graph, the dashed lines show the data of the experimental work while the solid lines show the data estimated by the code. The K values obtained using Model 1 are presented in Table 1 . Consequently, the final equation then will be as shown in Table 2 : (4) r H 2 = 0.3926 ∗ p H 2 1 + 2.3184 ∗ p H Verification of the obtained kinetics: To evaluate the validity of the obtained K values, these values were tested if they give the same results as experimentally done work. It is compared to a work done by Huang et al. (2006a) where a kinetic study took place for an 0.0432 M ammonium sulfite solution, subjected to UV light, at of 50 °C and the volume of the solution was 1500 mL. Initially some ammonium sulfate is present in the solution and its pH is about 7.9. In order to establish a code that estimates the rate of hydrogen produced while showing the change in the pH, another equation is required. The dissociation equilibria equation, proposed by Hannemann et al.,1996 for ammonia and sulfur dioxide and their relevant chemical kinetics is used as follows: Considering the simultaneous uptake of NH3, and SO2 the electroneutrality equation, reads (5) H + + N H 4 + = O H - + H S O 3 - + 2 S O 3 2 - + HSO 4 - + 2 SO 4 2 - Considering the equilibria relations, this becomes (6) H + - k w H + = S I V K H S O 3 - H + + 2 K H S O 3 - K S O 3 2 - H + 2 + K H S O 3 - H + + K H S O 3 - K S O 3 2 - + S V I H + + 2 K S O 4 2 - H + + K S O 4 2 - - N I I I K N H 4 + H + K N H 4 + H + + k w Dissociation equilibria equation for ammonia and sulfur dioxide and their relevant chemical kinetics proposed by Hannemann et al.1996 is k w = 1.008 ∗ 10 - 14 exp 6719 1 298 - 1 T m o l e 2 l i t e r - 2 K S O 4 - - = 0.012 exp 2825.35 1 T - 1 298 m o l e l i t e r - 1 K H S O 3 - = 10 8531 / T - 4.74 m o l e l i t e r - 1 K S O 3 2 - = 10 621.91 / T - 9.278 m o l e l i t e r - 1 K N H 4 + = 1.709 ∗ 10 - 5 exp 4355.2 1 298 - 1 T m o l e l i t e r - 1 The concentrations of S (IV), S(VI) and N(III) were calculated as shown in Table 2: By establishing code (Model 1) that solves one differential equation and one algebraic (Eqs. (3) and (4) and Eq. (6)), Fig. 2 was obtained where it shows the theoretical amount of hydrogen produced x(1) according to the obtained kinetics of Eq. (4) and Eq. (6). Eq. (6) evaluated at 50 °C becomes; (7) H + - 5.772 ∗ 10 - 14 H + - 0.04061 - x ( 1 ) 22400 7.96 ∗ 10 - 3 H + + 27.96 ∗ 10 - 3 ∗ 4.444 ∗ 10 - 8 H + 2 + 7.96 ∗ 1 10 - 3 H + + 7.96 ∗ 10 - 3 ∗ 4.444 ∗ 10 - 8 - 0.00144 + x ( 1 ) 22400 H + + 2 ∗ 0.002 H + + 0.002 + 0.04205 ∗ 2 20 ∗ 10 - 7 H + 20 ∗ 10 - 7 H + + 5.772 ∗ 10 - 14 = 0 The kinetic curve for hydrogen production from photolysis of 0.0432 M ammonium sulfite solution is shown in Fig. 2. The drop in pH due to the formation of ammonium sulfate occurs after the end of the reaction. This indicates a possible time delay in obtaining the results for pH of the solution. Estimated results show the general trend of the experimental result. However, the model followed the same trend of the experimental results. The reaction mechanism is as follows. Ammonium sulfite is first oxidized to ammonium dithionate and ammonium hydroxide and thus becomes more alkaline. The dithionate is then oxidized to sulfate and the solution becomes more acidic. 2 N H 4 2 S O 3 + 2 H 2 O → N H 4 2 S 2 O 6 + 2 N H 4 O H + H 2 N H 4 2 S 2 O 6 + 2 N H 4 O H → 2 N H 4 2 S O 4 + H 2 No data about dithionate dissociation constant was found in the literature. So, we assumed that the pH remains constant during the first reaction. The drop in pH due to sulfate formation takes place late in the experiment. Thus, we assumed that the reaction mechanism is 4 N H 4 2 S O 3 + 6 H 2 O → N H 4 2 S 2 O 6 2 + 6 N H 4 O H + 3 H 2 N H 4 2 S 2 O 6 2 + 6 N H 4 O H → 4 N H 4 2 S O 4 + H 2 + 2 H 2 O This means that most of hydrogen evolves when the reaction medium is alkaline. Fig. 2 shows that the pH goes down after the end of hydrogen production. This indicates the possibility in the delay in the experimental reading of the pH. In fact in a similar experiment for the oxidation of sodium sulfite (Huang et al 2010)), the drop in pH occurred before the end of reaction."
3,Photocatalysis,"2.2 Photocatalysis The fitting of the intrinsic kinetic parameters for Eq. (8) is assessed to the set of experimental data in Table 3 using MATLAB code Model 2.Table 4 . (8) d H 2 d t = r H 2 ∗ V 300 = k 1 C a t k 2 I k s s u b 1 + k 4 ∗ s u b 2 ∗ V 300 m m o l H 2 / g c a t a l y s t To further evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model, the validity of Eq. (8) was checked as follows. A proposed model 2 that depends on the obtained k value was established. The results of this model were compared with the results of an experimental work done obtained from literature. By establishing model 2 that solves for the differential equation (Eq. (8)) hydrogen production rate was obtained. The results using model 2 was compared to the hydrogen production rate from the experimental work done by Vagia et al. 2017 for a solution volume of 300 mL and done at temperature of 25 °C for a 1 M molar concentration of ammonium sulfite. RC1 represents data presented in Table 3 for a photocatalyst loading of 2.3 % and a light intensity 1000 W/m2 (given a unit value I = 1). RC2 = 0.88 RC1 for a photocatalyst loading of 0.35 % and I = 1. RC3 = 0.12 RC1 for light intensity I = 0.2, RC4 = 0.92 RC1 for a change in the substrate concentration of 2 M ammonium sulfite solution. Song et al 2012 found that maximum hydrogen production is obtained from 1.25 M ammonium sulfite solution while Huang et al 2011 found that maximum hydrogen production occurs at 1.5 M. To account for the decrease in hydrogen production we estimated that at 2 M, hydrogen production drops to 0.92 of its value at 1 M. Verification of the obtained kinetics: Fig. 3 shows the estimated hydrogen production rate obtained using Model 2. By solving for Eq. (8) on MATLAB using Model 2 and the k values were obtained as follows: Using the k values obtained by model 2, Eq. (9) was obtained. (9) r H 2 = 0.3102 C a t 0.0679 I 1.2383 s u b ( 1 + 0.9092 × sub ) 2 where (10) Sub = m o l a r i t y - 0.002 H 2 In Fig. 3, the points on the graph represent the experimental data while the solid lines represent the estimated values of hydrogen production rate by the proposed model, R2 = 0.9989. Fig. 3 shows a good fitting for the estimated results obtained using the kinetics generated by model 2 with the experimental data. Fig. 4 shows a good fitting for the estimated results obtained using the kinetics generated by code with the experimental data presented in reference Vagia et al 2017."
4,Conclusions,"This research aims to develop a MATLAB code to get the intrinsic kinetic parameters needed for the design of a photoreactor. The effect of pH on the amount of the hydrogen generated is investigated on the photolysis of ammonium sulfite solution and is shown by Eq. (3). For the photocatalysis reaction of ammonium sulfite and water in the presence of cadmium sulfide as a catalyst under solar radiation is evaluated and the obtained kinetic equation (Eq. (8)) is validated against experimental results… To sum up, the resulted kinetic parameters obtained using MATLAB can be used to scale up or design a photolytic and photocatalytic photoreactors."
