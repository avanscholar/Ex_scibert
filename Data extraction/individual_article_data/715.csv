0,Introduction,"‘Hydrogen Economy’ has gathered enough attention of researchers towards sustainable development [1–3]. However, even after extensive research, safe-storage and cost-effective transportation of hydrogen gas is still a matter of concern [4]. Alternatively, one would look for liquids/materials with high-hydrogen content that could be easily transported so that hydrogen can be liberated from them when and where it is required. Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) [5–8] have emerged as potential candidates to solve the problem as formic acid [9,10], alcohols (e.g., 2-Propanol) [11–13] are widely popular as sacrificial hydrogen donors. Conversely, the use of methanol as LOHC is somewhat limited, and sporadic reports were documented in the literature, albeit it has a very high H/C ratio [14]. Due to high hydrogen content (12.5% w/w hydrogen), low-cost and abundant production from coal and natural gas, methanol is an economical and ideal candidate as fuel in the future [15]. It is liquid at ambient temperature, easy to handle and safe to transport. Methanol can be blended with organic solvents as well and thus, highly compatible with already established diesel oil and gasoline-based infrastructure [16]. Use of methanol in fuel cell could help to generate electricity directly, that requires no C–C bond cleavage to generate hydrogen. Methanol can also be generated by reductive hydrogenative recycling of excess atmospheric CO2 and thus, help mankind to fight climate change as well. Therefore, 'Methanol Economy' offers one of the safest sources of hydrogen for future with a low-cost feedstock. However, removing hydrogen from methanol is a high-energy process (63.7 kJ/mol) [17], and there are not many catalytic systems known that effectively dehydrogenate methanol without producing any greenhouse gas. In this regard, several heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for the dehydrogenation of methanol. However, the requirement of high-pressure and high- temperature conditions are unavoidable [18–22]. Although, transfer hydrogenation (TH) is one of the most fundamental transformations, hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds encountered several strategies to meet academic and industrial application’s goals [23]. In this aspect, TH has proved to be the best choice over direct hydrogenation using hydrogen pressure in the presence of a catalyst or conventional stoichiometric reducing agents [24]. The direct transfer of hydrogen from LOHC offers the following benefits: a) avoids special equipment for pressure handling and hazardous hydrogen gas with high pressure, b) safe and practical approach, c) avoids stoichiometric amounts of toxic reducing agents, d) availability of a wide range of inexpensive sacrificial donors in adequate amounts. Lately, TH has employed the use of other LOHC’s, and it is even extended to asymmetric transformations now both in academia and in industry [25–27]. In contrast to tremendous efforts made globally for efficient transfer hydrogenation using other LOHCs (HCO2H, i PrOH, etc), the use of methanol as transfer hydrogenating reagent is limited. Although limited, over the last few decades, several efficient homogeneous catalysts of nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium and manganese have been reported using methanol as a sacrificial hydrogen donor for the direct addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated organic substrates such as α,β-unsaturated enones, alkynes, alkenes, ketones, aldehydes and imines [49–59]. In this review, we summarize various homogeneous catalytic systems based on transition metals that can dehydrogenate hydrogen from methanol without any hydrogen acceptor, followed by the transfer of the plugged hydrogen from methanol to various unsaturated substrates. It is essential to mention that the use of methanol as a C1 source for methylation/formylation of various carbo- and heteronucleophiles (N,O, etc.) is beyond the scope of this review."
1,Dehydrogenation of methanol,
2,Noble metal-catalysts,"2.1 Noble metal-catalysts In 1987, David J. Cole-Hamilton and co-workers made an essential contribution towards methanol dehydrogenation and reported an example of homogeneous [Rh(2,2′-bpy)2]Cl catalyzed dehydrogenation of methanol [28]. Though the report mainly focuses on ethanol, 2-Propanol, and higher alcohols as hydrogen source, they established a seminal example of hydrogen generation from methanol as well using 2,2′-bipyridine as ligand under thermal conditions for the first time. Initial TON of 7 h−1 was observed at 120 °C under basic conditions. The authors proposed the mechanism as shown in Scheme 1 . Initially, cationic Rh(I) binds to in situ-generated ethoxide under basic conditions that then undergoes β-hydride elimination to form rhodium-hydride species, followed by protonation then, subsequent release of hydrogen molecule. The entire catalytic cycle is reversible, and the forward reaction proceeds through the insertion of CO2 between Rh and hydride, hydrogen addition leading Rh(III)-formyl species that subsequently liberate acetaldehyde upon reductive elimination. However, the reaction can also be reversible where cationic Rh(I) undergoes oxidative addition, followed by protonation leading to dihydride species that subsequently liberate the hydrogen molecule. Nucleophilic attack of hydroxide ion on carbonyl carbon coordinated to Rh(I) is followed by the liberation of CO2 to regenerate the Rh-H species. In the subsequent year, same group reported well-defined Ru complex, [RuH2(N2)(PPh3)3] Cat 1 for the catalytic generation of hydrogen from methanol at 150 °C in the presence of sodium hydroxide [29]. However, the methodology was developed for evolution of hydrogen from higher alcohols and showed best results with ethane-1,2-diol. As depicted in Scheme 2 , the 16-electron active catalyst 1-i was generated in situ by the loss of labile N2 molecule, followed by coordination of methoxide and subsequent β-hydride elimination to generate anionic trihydridoruthenium species 1-iii with the loss of formaldehyde. The anionic species then abstract proton from another molecule of methanol, followed by the facile release of one equivalent hydrogen from 1-iv to regenerate the active catalyst. A similar ruthenium-catalyzed homogeneous dehydrogenation of methanol was reported in 1985 by Saito and co-workers [30]. The well-defined [Ru(OAc)(Cl)(PEtPh2)3] Cat 2 was prepared as shown in Scheme 3 starting from [Ru(OAc)(Cl)]2 and (PEtPPh2) under ambient temperature. The resultant Ru(II) complex shown in Scheme 3a could efficiently dehydrogenate methanol into methyl formate with TON of 34 over 90 h. As shown in Scheme 4 , the proposed reaction mechanism proceeds through initial coordination of methanol through ligand exchange (κ2-acetate to η1-acetate) followed by acetic acid’s liberation leading to 16e− Ru(II) intermediate 2-ii. The in situ-formed intermediate 2-ii further undergoes β-hydride elimination and subsequent protonation to regenerate Cat 2 with the production of hydrogen and formaldehyde [31]. The catalytic system’s efficiency was enhanced on addition of free acetic acid as it helps to protonate the metal-hydride intermediate, followed by evolution of hydrogen but on further addition, activity got suppressed. The authors reported the best TOF (h−1) of 0.96 when they used a 2:1 ratio of [AcOH]/[Ru]. However, the catalyst got deactivated gradually with the replacement of bidentate ‘OAc’ ligand with ‘CO’ and ‘H’. The rate of evolution of hydrogen gas progressively decreased when the concentration of paraformaldehyde increased in the reaction mixture. Subsequently, paraformaldehyde is decomposed into CO-Ru-H complex (Cat 3, Scheme 3b) as white crystals, and that is an inactive catalyst under standard conditions. In 1991, Saito and Fujii reported ligand-free methanol dehydrogenation with moderate rates using a catalytic amount of ruthenium trichloride hydrate [32]. An initial TON of 1.68 h−1 observed at 79 °C with RuCl3·3H2O in degassed methanol in the presence of an excess amount of sodium methoxide (20 wt%). The addition of a small amount of sodium hydroxide or silver tetrafluoroborate aids in the removal of Cl− that further improved the activity by enhanced coordination of methoxide to metal and thus, pushed the reaction in the forward direction. However, when a high concentration of sodium methoxide was used, the addition of AgBF4 showed an insignificant effect on the rate of hydrogen evolution. CH 3 OH + NaOH → HCOONa + 2 H 2 2 HCHO + NaOH → HCOONa + CH 3 OH HCOOCH 3 + NaOH → HCOONa + CH 3 OH A trace amount of dimethoxymethane and a major amount of sodium formate were detected, indicating incomplete dehydrogenation of methanol, while no formaldehyde was observed. The metallic mercury test was in accordance with the homogeneous nature of the ruthenium catalyst. The work discussed thus far underlines initial reports with essential contributions to methanol dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, they suffered from low activity, and limited reactivity with low TON as only one molecule of hydrogen could be generated per molecule of methanol. Further, it is more likely to generate carbon monoxide and methane at high temperature that contaminates the desired pure hydrogen gas, so the developed methodologies seem to be unsuitable with the proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. However, such systems create a wide range of prospects to unlock the potential to generate hydrogen from methanol without any CO contaminations. In 2013, Beller group reported that use of water along with methanol opens a new decomposition pathway for methanol and can generate hydrogen at fairly mild temperature (<100 °C) and ambient pressure [33]. As shown in Scheme 5 , in a stepwise manner, methanol dehydrogenation will take place. The in situ-formed formaldehyde observed after the removal of the first molecule of hydrogen via metal-hydride formation, is further exposed to water-assisted nucleophilic attack in the presence of a base to produce formic acid and a second molecule of hydrogen. Subsequent dehydrogenation of formic acid generates carbon dioxide and third molecule of hydrogen. Dehydrogenation of formic acid is a long-known and extensively investigated process [34]. CH 3 OH + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + CO 2 Δ r G m θ = 9.0 KJ mol - 1 CH 3 OH → HCHO + H 2 Δ r G m θ = 63.7 KJ mol - 1 HCHO + H 2 O → HCO 2 H + H 2 Δ r G m θ = - 21.7 KJ mol - 1 HCO 2 H → CO 2 + H 2 Δ r G m θ = - 33.0 KJ mol - 1 The overall methanol reforming process is mildly endothermic with an initial dehydrogenation of methanol which is an uphill process, followed by exothermic easier dehydrogenation of formaldehyde and formic acid to CO2 and hydrogen [17]. The authors reported that methanol steam reformation using homogeneous ruthenium complex Cat 4 with aliphatic PNP pincer type ligand (metal–ligand cooperativity) can generate three molecules of hydrogen from one molecule of methanol at modestly elevated temperature (89 °C) as shown in Scheme 6 . Under optimal conditions, 4.18 µmol of Cat 4 (21 p.p.m) and 8.0 M KOH in 4:1 mixture of MeOH/H2O achieved a turnover frequency of 754 h−1 after one hour at 89 °C. An excellent TOF = 4700 h−1 was achieved using [RuHCl(CO)(HN(C2H4PiPr2)2)] (1.58 μmol) as catalyst and KOH (8 M) with neat methanol (10 mL) at 95 °C. The catalyst was quite stable and showed an overall TON > 350,000 over 23 days. Based on the preliminary experiments, the author proposed a mechanism as shown in Scheme 7 , wherein the ruthenium pincer complex Cat 4 undergo base-assisted activation to give amido ruthenium (II) complex 4-i, followed by methanol dehydrogenation in an outer-sphere concerted manner with the release of first hydrogen molecule to generate gem-diol(ate) species 4-iii stabilized by the solvent-cage. With the liberation of the second hydrogen molecule, the species could either regenerate the active catalyst 4-i or lead to ruthenium-formate complex 4-v. The formate complex then released the third hydrogen molecule from the dihydride species 4-vi after CO2 liberation. Considerable CO2 gas detection established that formate dehydrogenation is faster than methanol dehydrogenation. A 3:1 ratio of H2:CO2 was demonstrated by a long-term experiment with lower base loading i.e., NaOH (0.1 M) in 4:1 MeOH/H2O (10 mL) at 72 °C. However, to get pure hydrogen without CO2 contamination, base loading could be increased to convert free carbon dioxide into carbonate. Contamination due to CH4 and CO was less than 10 ppm. The authors detected formate and carbonate by NMR analysis proving that formate is an intermediate in base-catalysed aqueous-phase methanol reforming, while formaldehyde and bicarbonate were not observed. However, the methodology demands high base loading because base is essential to convert the catalyst into its catalytically active form and for the reaction to stay active, strongly basic conditions are unavoidable. Moreover, methanol conversion was low, with approximately 30% hydrogen yield [39]. In 2014, Xinzheng Yang performed a DFT study to gain mechanistic insights into efficient generation of hydrogen and CO2 from aqueous-methanol using aliphatic PNP-pincer ruthenium complex Cat 4 [35]. The mechanism could be broadly classified into three interrelated stages of methanol, formaldehyde and formate dehydrogenation as shown in Scheme 5. Scheme 8 showed the plausible catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of methanol, after transfer of hydroxy proton of methanol to ligand nitrogen, C–H bond cleavage of methoxy leads to ruthenium-hydride species 4-iv via transition state (TS2,3 ) which is 10.5 kcal/mol higher than 4-ii. The dihydride complex 4-vi then undergo methanol/water assisted hydrogen production (4-vi → TS6,7 21.7 kcal/mol) via ƞ2-dihydrogen coordinated intermediate 4-vii instead of less-favourable direct proton transfer from ligand to metal (4-vi → TS4,5 29.5 kcal/mol). Formaldehyde released in Scheme 8 immediately reacts with hydroxide to form slightly more stable gem-diol-(ate) H2COOH− anion (stable in protic solvent environment), as no traces of formaldehyde was detected. Scheme 9 depicts the formation of formic acid with the release of second molecule of hydrogen. With the water splitting on coordinatively unsaturated amido complex 4-i (4-i → TS1,9 4.8 kcal/mol), hydroxide ion is replaced by H2COOH− to form complex 4-iii via a cationic intermediate 4-xii. H2COOH− then undergo most facile C–H bond cleavage to transfer the methylene hydride to Ru (4-i → TS11,12 14.3 kcal/mol) and leads to formation of formic acid. While Ming Lei and co-workers proposed a pathway that adopts outer-sphere anionic mechanism without the involvement of water and leads to formate formation, supported by the experimental observation of initial decrease in OH− concentration [36]. Scheme 10 proposed by Yang showed dehydrogenation of formic acid to CO2 and third molecule of hydrogen. Complex 4-i reacts with formic acid immediately to form more stable intermediate 4-v, followed by transfer of formate hydride in complex 4-xiv to metal (4-v → TS14,15 23.0 kcal/mol) along with release of CO2. Thus, a complete catalytic cycle involve release of three molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of CO2, proceeding via same self-promoted mechanism with methanol/water assisted hydrogen release from trans-(HPNP)Ru(H)2CO 4-vi. In 2015, Ming Lei and co-workers also performed DFT analysis of Ruthenium catalysed hydrogen production from aqueous-phase methanol under mild conditions [36]. Lei stated that methanol and formaldehyde dehydrogenation could follow outer-sphere mechanism while formate dehydrogenation involve a competitive inner-sphere and outer-sphere mechanism. The highest energy barrier for stage I and stage II were calculated as 23.8 kcal/mol while for stage III, it is 30.1 kcal/mol. The free-energy barrier for methanol-assisted hydrogen release step was calculated as 12.5 kcal/mol and CO2 release being the rate-determining step of stage III have an energy barrier of 28.6 kcal/mol. In 2016, Beller and co-workers further studied the mechanism with experimental and spectroscopic evidence supported aptly by theoretical investigation for hydrogen generation from aqueous-methanol under basic conditions using ruthenium catalyst [37]. Highly reactive amido complex 4-i (shown in Scheme 8) was prepared and isolated after HCl elimination under high pH condition (Dcb mechanism) as yellow, air-sensitive complex and characterised with X-ray crystallography with a Y-shaped distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. Various spectroscopy data was collected which are consistent with the formation of Ru-methoxide species 4-ii stabilised by intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the N–H backbone and intermolecular hydrogen bonding with excess methanol. Scheme 11 proposed by Beller and co-workers depicts the plausible ionic inner-sphere pathway for C–H bond cleavage to give metal-dihydride complex 4-vi. It states that both O (complex 4-ii) and C–H atom (complex 4-ii', less stable) can coordinate with metal with an overall energy barrier of 11.40 kcal/mol for dehydrogenation of methanol, that agree with Yang and Lei. Formation of gaseous formaldehyde was considered as the driving force for the dehydrogenation of methanol. Dehydrogenation of gem-diolate is highly favourable as C–H atom coordination was predicted to be more stable by 3.47 kcal/mol than O coordination with a C–H bond dissociation barrier of only 0.58 kcal/mol, which is quite lower as calculated by Yang (14.3 kcal/mol) and Lei (5.2 kcal/mol), but supported by the experimental observation of no spectroscopical detection of formaldehyde and gem-diolate. While in formate dehydrogenation stage, O coordination is more stable (supported by Yang as well) and C–H bond dissociation energy is 13.09 kcal/mol, thus dehydrogenation of formic acid being least facile. Presence of base not only helps in activation of complex but also promotes the C–H coordination over O coordination to metal. Thus, the inner sphere C–H bond cleavage do not involve ligand cooperation i.e. no participation of ‘NH’ proton of ligand. Solvent-mediated hydrogen release from complex 4-vi was analysed with an energy barrier of 13.7 kcal/mol, that was consistent with the reports of Yang and Lei. Thus, a complete catalytic cycle was proposed involving anionic species as shown in Scheme 12 for aqueous-methanol reforming under basic condition. When experiments were performed with prepared complexes having N-methylated ligands to probe ligand-cooperativity, they showed an activity with a rate only 2.4 times lower than non-methylated ligand system, supporting the theoretical calculations predicting no cooperative role of ligand. In 2013, Grützmacher group independently reported methanol dehydrogenation at neutral pH by homogeneous host-guest type ruthenium complex [38]. X-ray crystal structure of [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)] (Fig. 1 ) reveals that the 16-electron Ru(II) complex has ‘non-innocent cooperative ligand’ character and these chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand can intramolecularly store up to 2 equivalent of hydrogen molecule reversibly. The author demonstrated the efficient hydrogen generation from the methanol-water-THF mixture using 0.5 mol% of Cat 5 under mild conditions. The operative reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 13 enlightened the hydrogen storing ability of redox- and chemically-active metal-diazadiene-olefin ligand (metal-ligand cooperativity). The anionic ruthenium complex Cat 5 interacted with water molecule to form highly reactive neutral species 5-i with the evolution of one hydrogen molecule. Next, the ruthenium complex is added to methanol’s hydroxy moiety to form methoxide complex with Ru-N–H bond (5-ii). Subsequent heterolytic addition of methanol’s activated C–H bond to trop2dad backbone generated amino-imido Ru(0) complex 5-iii with formaldehyde liberation. The in situ-generated Ru(0) 5-iii further reacts with another molecule of methanol similarly to form Ru-diamino complex 5-v. The complex then released hydrogen from the ligand system in the presence of base and heat to continue the catalytic cycle. Preliminary mechanistic investigations supported the fact that formic acid acts as an intermediate and pure formic acid in dioxane solution acts as a hydrogen donor under established reaction conditions. Delightfully, no CO impurities were noticed. In 2014, Milstein and co-workers reported homogeneous Ru(II)-catalyzed hydrogen production from the methanol–water mixture at mild temperature (<100 °C) [39]. Efficient hydrogen generation was achieved using 0.05 mol% of Ru(II) pincer complex (Cat 6, Scheme 14 a) in the presence of 2 equivalent of NaOH in MeOH/H2O/Toluene (0.4/1/0.5 mL) solution. The authors proposed that base is required to activate catalyst and convert methanol to formic acid. The proposed formic acid adduct with complex was isolated and spectroscopically characterized alongwith X-ray crystallography. The fast decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen and CO2 was also studied successfully under stoichiometric amount of base. A significant benefit of this approach was that the catalyst could be reused, after an easy recovery (without purification or isolation), it showed undiminished catalytic activity, and an overall TON of 29,000 achieved over a period of approximately one month. The author further demonstrated 82% conversion of methanol with the recycled catalyst in the presence of KOH after 9 days. In continuation, Beller group reported in 2014, an alternative strategy wherein a bi-catalytic system of Ru-MACHO-BH (Cat 7) and [Ru(H)2(dppe)2] (Cat 8) (Scheme 14b) work in a synergistic manner to generate hydrogen from aqueous methanol under base-free conditions [40]. The effective bi-catalytic system showed hydrogen evolution with the decomposition of formic acid as well when excess formic acid is added to the reaction mixture externally. However, the catalyst showed low activity when employed individually. [RuH(BH4)(CO)(HN(C2H4PPh2)2)] and [Ru(H)2(dppe)2] in 1:1 ratio (5 μmol each) showed an average TOF of 93 h−1 throughout for 7 h in MeOH/H2O/triglyme (9/1/4 mL) solution at 93 °C. This novel approach demands low catalyst loading and works under neutral conditions as Ru-MACHO-BH acts as catalytically active species with no need for further activation by the base. Further, mechanistic investigations proved that no ligand exchange takes place among the two catalysts. Low CO contamination and TON > 4200 (with 1400 mL of total gas volume) supported the methodology as a step towards a source of energy for fuel cells. In 2015, Yamaguchi and co-workers developed an elegant iridium-bipyridonate complex for hydrogen production from methanol-water solution under mild conditions (<100 °C) [41]. The isolated water-soluble anionic iridium complex Cat 9 (Scheme 14c) could generate hydrogen under relatively mild basic conditions. Experiment with formic acid–water solution in presence of Cat 9 confirmed the quantitative generation of hydrogen gas from formic acid as well. The author proposed the plausible mechanism as shown in Scheme 15 based on the experimental observation and stoichiometric studies. The reaction mechanism initiate by the coordination of methanol to the anionic iridium bipyridonate complex Cat 9 to form methoxy complex 9-i. The methoxy intermediate underwent β-hydride elimination to generate hydrido-iridium complex 9-ii. Upon protonation of the anionic hydrido-iridium intermediate with methanol, it forms the neutral complex 9-iii. The complex then liberates the hydrogen molecule, and the subsequent attack of hydroxide to 16e− iridium complex brings the active catalyst for the next catalytic cycle. Through a long-term experiment, the author demonstrates a continuous generation of hydrogen from methanol/water/NaOH with TON as high as 10,510 for 150 h. In 2016, Reek and co-workers established a Ruthenium-carbonyl complex with salen-type ligand active in aqueous-methanol dehydrogenation and proceeds via inner-sphere mechanism (Scheme 16 a) [42]. The carbonyl complex was not the inactive species; rather the carbonyl ligand (derived from methanol) undergo attack by base/water to form formate. When treated under strongly basic conditions Ru(II) complex Cat 10 showed a TOF of 55 h−1 in 25% dioxane/75% methanol:water (9:1) solution at reflux temperature. Gas chromatography confirmed the presence of three equivalent of hydrogen gas, formate, and carbonate, while no free CO was detected. In 2017, Zhou and co-workers demonstrated [Cp*Rh(NH3)(H2O)2]3+ catalyzed aqueous phase methanol-reforming under mild reaction conditions [43]. TOF of 83.2 h−1 was achieved in methanol: water solution (3:1) at 70 ℃ without using any base. However, the activity could be increased using slightly acidic conditions as the lability of water ligand promotes the catalysis. Acidic conditions avoid corrosive situations, unlike strongly alkaline medium, thus makes the methodology more compatible with application in fuel cells. Gas chromatography confirmed the presence of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas, without any carbon monoxide contamination. In 2017, Beller group reported an iridium-pincer complex Cat 11 for aqueous phase methanol-reforming at reflux temperature under mild basic condition (Scheme 16b) [44]. Unlike other reports, the iridium complex showed a peculiar nature of high activity at low base loading and high stability under strongly basic conditions. The authors proposed the formation of iridium dihydride carbonyl species shown in Scheme 16b (supported by MS) under weakly basic conditions responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst and diminished activity. However, the catalyst showed higher activity as compared to what was observed at high base loading. Also, in the absence of base, no hydrogen gas evolution was noticed. Very recently, Zhou highlighted the potential of methanol dehydrogenation using 6-hydroxypicolinic acid ligand as shown in Scheme 16c. The well-defined Ir(III) complex Cat 12 showed a TOF of 377 h−1 at 78 °C using 1.58 mM concentration of weak base Na2CO3 [45]. Kinetics experiments proved that the breaking of C–H bond of methanol is the rate-determining step, which is then transferred to iridium catalyst. A 3:1 ratio of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas was noticed with no carbon monoxide contamination."
3,Non-noble-metal catalyst,"2.2 Non-noble-metal catalyst In 2013, Beller group reported the first non-noble metal-catalyzed reformation of aqueous-phase methanol under mild conditions [46]. Cheap and earth-abundant iron metal with non-innocent PNP pincer ligand, [FeH(BH4)(CO)(HN(C2H4PiPr2)2)] (4.18 μmol, 19p.p.m) Cat 13 showed an excellent TON1h of 702 and TONmax of 6270 over 43 h at 91 °C under strongly basic condition (Scheme 17 ). The catalyst was stable and generated hydrogen for 5 days in the presence of an excess amount of ligand. The reaction mechanism is similar to the one proposed in Scheme 7, wherein the iron pincer catalyst Cat 13 underwent base-assisted activation, followed by methanol dehydrogenation to give dihydride species, which thus released the hydrogen molecule. A 2.3:1 ratio of H2/CO2 was noticed in the absence of base and complete decomposition of methanol was further supported by the evolution of CO2 gas on the addition of HCl in the reaction mixture. NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of formate (expected intermediate) and carbonate (CO2 released from formate decomposition). However, the catalyst was less active with low methanol conversion than earlier reported noble-metal ruthenium catalysts. Nevertheless, this is one of the first examples of the earth-abundant 3d-transition metals for methanol dehydrogenation. In 2015, Holthausen and co-workers reported a TON of approximate 51,000 which is highest among all the homogeneous non-noble metal catalysts for methanol dehydrogenation that does not require any base [47]. In the presence of water, the iron-pincer complex Cat 14 shown in Scheme 18 with co-catalyst LiBF4 (Lewis acid), was able to dehydrogenate methanol completely. With a catalyst loading of 0.01 mol%, and Lewis acid, a yield of > 99% and a TON of 30,000 achieved. The author described that the presence of Lewis acid helped in the generation of catalytically active species by promoting the Fe-formate complex’s decarboxylation. Milder reaction conditions and low co-catalyst loading are the benefits of base-free Lewis acid assisted methodology. A 3:1 ratio of H2:CO2 also achieved with low CO contamination (<0.1%). In continuation of their work on dehydrogenation of methanol, in 2016, Beller group reported the first example of manganese-pincer complex catalyzed aqueous methanol reformation at mild temperature [48]. The well-defined Mn-PNP complex Cat 15 showed a TON of about 20,000 with a stability of more than a month (Scheme 19 ). Dehydrogenation of formic acid was also studied in presence of Cat 15 that afforded a TON of 283 over a period of 5 h. Formate was also detected in the reaction mixture. However, the catalytic system was light-sensitive and required high base loading. In this section, several reports have been discussed so far, and it is noteworthy that in general, they employ multidentate ligands with three or more coordination sites that will prevent the decomposition of formaldehyde into carbon monoxide and instead helps in water and base assisted conversion of formaldehyde into formate with the generation of one additional molecule of hydrogen. In a broader context, phosphine ligands emerged as popular ligands for efficient methanol dehydrogenation. However, one could see a vast potential in discovering and designing cost-effective phosphine free ligands effective in methanol dehydrogenation."
4,Transfer Hydrogenation (TH) using methanol as LOHC,"The work discussed in the above section underlines the potential of methanol dehydrogenation to generate hydrogen gas, but it can have a promising impact with its application in transfer hydrogenation. Transfer hydrogenation is one of the broad research areas in organic transformations, and to date, the use of secondary alcohols, higher primary alcohols, and formic acid/triethylamine are widely reported as sacrificial donors in the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates. However, the use of methanol as a hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated organic substrates is relatively new and is being explored by researchers over the past decades. We herein summarize the reports that illustrate safer and practical methods for the efficient transfer hydrogenation of various substrates with methanol as a hydrogen source and serves as a guide for its potential future applications."
5,Transfer hydrogenation of alkynes,"3.1 Transfer hydrogenation of alkynes In 1999, Tani and co-workers disclosed a novel approach for transfer hydrogenation of aromatic alkynes and alkenes using soluble hydrido(methoxy)iridium(III) complex with methanol as a hydrogen source [49]. 2 mol% of [{IrCl(H)(diphosphine)}2(μ-OMe)2(μ-Cl)]Cl [diphosphine = (R)-BINAP] Cat 16 efficiently furnished the hydrogenated product of alkyne 1 in a methanol/toluene (1:1) solution at a mild temperature of 80 °C after 18 h (Scheme 20 ). The catalyst selectively produces trans-alkene 2a via syn-hydrogen addition, followed by rapid isomerization of cis-alkene to trans-alkene. The authors also observed the over-hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene into 1,2-diphenylethane 3. The method was further extended for the hydrogenation of acetophenone but a poor yield of 32% was observed. The authors showed the plausible mechanism shown in Scheme 21 for transfer hydrogenation of alkynes in which methoxy-iridium complex in its monomeric form (active catalyst 16-i) undergo β-hydride elimination with loss of formaldehyde to form the unsaturated iridium-dihydride species 16-ii. After coordination with alkyne and subsequent hydride insertion, the iridium-vinyl complex 16-iv then released the product 2 and iridium(I) species 16-v, which regenerate the active catalyst 16-i by oxidative addition with methanol. A Deuterium-labelling experiment using CD3OD-toluene confirmed 100% deuterium incorporation in the olefin. The formation of methyl formate was also reported using GC analysis. In 2009, Garcia and co-workers demonstrated stereoselective transfer hydrogenation of aromatic alkynes 4 using inexpensive catalyst precursor [(dippe)Ni(H)]2 at 180 °C (Scheme 22b) [50]. The authors revealed that [(P-P)Ni(η2-C,C-alkyne)] (P-P = 1,2-bis(diisopropylphophinoethane, dippe) Cat 17 prefers the formation of trans-alkene in presence of methanol as hydrogen source with 1-chloro-4-(phenyl-ethynyl)benzene as an exception (Scheme 22 a). {(P-P)Ni(η2-C,C-alkene)] Cat 18 was isolated and well-characterized by X-ray crystal structure that showed the preferred formation of trans-alkene. While the manuscript was in preparation, Rueping and co-workers demonstrated a chemoselective semi-transfer hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under base-metal catalyst i.e., well-defined manganese pincer complex Cat 19 as shown in Scheme 23 [51]. The methodology is stereoselective towards the formation of (Z)-alkene and gave high yields. A 97% yield of Z-stilbene was isolated with a 97:3 Z/E ratio in a 6 mmol scale reaction. A broad scope of alkyne was shown, including electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl ring. Alkynes containing heterocyclic ring were also tolerated under the reaction conditions, but the terminal alkynes seem inactive. Deuterium incorporation of 94% at olefinic position confirmed the Z-selectivity of the methodology. No effect was observed when mercury was added in the reaction mixture. As shown in Scheme 24 , the authors proposed the reaction mechanism initiated with the base-catalyzed catalyst-activation to form 19-i, followed by manganese-methoxide complex formation (19-iii) that releases formaldehyde to give metal-hydride species (19-iv). The CO ligand will then be substituted by alkyne 6, followed by its insertion into metal-hydride bond and subsequent release of desired Z-alkene 7 to regenerate the active catalyst."
6,Transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes Recently, Xiao and co-workers developed a rhodium complex Cat 20 for efficient and chemo-selective transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes 8 into primary alcohols 9 under mild conditions (Scheme 25 ) [52]. Moreover, the catalyst was moisture stable, procedure does not require an inert atmosphere, and it afforded high yields with a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. Investigations regarding tolerance to substrate variations increased the potency of the methodology. No effect of substitution on the aromatic ring was noticed and the catalytic system tolerated a wide range of functional groups such as halide, nitro, acetyl, etc. Heterocyclic ketones were also viable substrates under the established conditions. As discussed earlier proposed pathways for transfer hydrogenation using methanol as hydrogen donor, the mechanism started with the formation of rhodium methoxide species 20-i in the presence of a base, subsequent β-hydride elimination followed by hydride transfer to aldehyde substrate gave the alkoxide complex 20-iv. Subsequent protonation of alkoxy intermediate liberated the desired alcohol 9 and regenerated the active catalyst 20-i (Scheme 26 )."
7,"Transfer hydrogenation of ketones, imines, and activated olefins","3.3 Transfer hydrogenation of ketones, imines, and activated olefins In 1967, Itatani group reported homogeneously catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of Methyl Linoleate to its monoene state using a mixture of tin(II) chloride and dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) or a mixture of tin(II) chloride with dichlorobis(triphenylarsine)platinum(II) [53]. The reaction proceeds via initial migration of a double bond to its conjugated system, followed by hydrogenation in benzene-methanol solution under the nitrogen atmosphere with methanol acting as the hydrogen donor. In 1973, Fukuzumi and co-workers proposed transfer hydrogenation of cycloheptene with methanol as a hydrogen source using Hydridotetrakis(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I) complex at 80 °C although the report mainly highlighted the ability of 2-Propanol to act as the hydrogen source [54]. In 1984, Maitlis and Smith reported one of the seminal examples of transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds like ketones and activated olefins using methanol as hydrogen-source by soluble complexes of Rh and Ru [55]. Triphenylphosphine-ruthenium chloride complex, [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2] at 150 °C afforded hydrogenated products of aliphatic/aromatic ketones with moderate yields in pure methanol. Under the catalytic system, a TON of 65 throughout for 18 h achieved using 0.08 mmol of the complex [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2] and 0.25 mol of methanol at 150 °C (Table 1). The authors also detected the formation of methyl formate and dimethoxymethane as side products according to the following equations. 2 R 2 C = O + 2 CH 3 OH → 2 R 2 CHOH + CH 3 O 2 CH 2 CH 3 OH → CH 3 O 2 CH + 2 H 2 3 CH 3 OH → CH 3 OCH 2 OCH 3 + H 2 + H 2 O Dinuclear cationic complex, [(PPh3)2Ru(CO)(μ-H)(μ-Cl)2(CO)(PPh3)2] was isolated from the reaction mixture and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The methodology is particularly interesting because only trace amounts of gases like CO2, CO, and CH4 were detected. In 2012, García and co-workers further disclosed that a homogeneous Ni(0) catalyzed selective transfer hydrogenation of activated C = C bond in α-β unsaturated enone 10 to give saturated ketones with methanol reductant [56]. Transfer hydrogenation of such organic moieties is particularly important because this will enable synthetic chemists to functionalize conjugated systems. [{(dippe)Ni}n(η2-CαCβ-1,4-diene-3-one)] (n = 1, 2; enone = aromatic 1,4-pentadien-3-ones) with its electron-rich P-donor ligand and η2-coordination of double bond was fully characterized by X-ray crystal structure (Scheme 27 a). Although the work also emphasis on the alkylation of α,β-unsaturated enone to yield mono- and dimethylated ketones via heterogeneous pathway (methanol as alkylating agent) but the addition of mercury in the reaction mixture pushes the reaction towards the hydrogenated product. However, it operates under high-temperature (Scheme 27b). Crabtree and co-workers further exploited the concept of transfer hydrogenation using methanol as hydrogen source in 2015 [57]. Transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones and primary/secondary imines reported using homogenous iridium-bis(NHC) complex Cat 24 under microwave irradiation. Very low catalyst loading of Cat 24 provided a TON of 1680 over 15 h and TON of 8,000 throughout for 40 h with dry MeOH in the presence of 6.7 M KOH under reflux conditions. Benzophenone efficiently reduced to diphenylmethanol with 5 equiv. of KOH. Various symmetrical, and unsymmetrical benzophenones were reduced to the corresponding alcohols, although high product formation achieved when the electron-withdrawing group is at the p-position. However, the reduction of acetophenones to 1-phenylethanols showed a relatively low yield because of the competing alkylation at α-position. Under the established conditions, aldimine and ketimine were reduced, albeit in low yields (Scheme 28 ). To illustrate that there is a complete conversion of methanol, the authors captured carbon dioxide as carbonate. Impurities of CO also recorded less than 8 ppm. Another advantage of this work is that the reaction operates in air and does not require inert conditions. It is worth noticing that the dehydrogenation achieved without employing expensive Cp* or phosphine ligands and a simple Ir-NHC complex with cheap and stabilizing CO ligands executed the process. However, the catalytic system was compatible with a narrow scope of carbonyl compounds/imines and showed low yields even at high-temperature. Inspired by Yamaguchi’s work [38], in 2020, Feng Li and co-workers reported base-free transfer hydrogenation of ketones and imines with methanol by iridium-bipyridonate catalyst (Cat 9) [58]. An efficient conversion was achieved under mild reaction conditions and the developed method showed excellent compatibility with functional groups such as nitro, cyano, halides, ester (Scheme 29 ). As discussed by Yamaguchi in Scheme 15, after the formation of neutral Ir-hydride species 9-iii with protonated bipyridonate ligand, simultaneous transfer of both the protons took place to C = O/C = N bond as shown in Scheme 30 , followed by elimination of the desired product (alcohol/amine) to give unsaturated iridium species 9-iv, which can regenerate the catalyst. During the same time, Sundararaju and co-workers independently reported the efficient transfer hydrogenation of ketones via in situ-generated iridium-bipyridone system in the presence of a catalytic amount of base using methanol as the hydrogen source [59]. A broad scope of ketones was demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the reaction. Chemoselective transformations could be achieved while other reducible functional groups were present in the molecule, suggesting that the developed methodology will have practical applications in late-stage transfer hydrogenation of bioactive molecules (Scheme 31 )."
8,Concluding remarks and future perspective,"Homogeneous transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of methanol was achieved under mild reaction conditions, avoiding high-temperature and high-pressure requirements. Distinct approaches such as metal-ligand cooperativity, bi-catalytic systems, base-assisted in-situ catalyst activation, etc., were utilized to increase the yield and TON of dehydrogenation of methanol. The developed methodologies could be implemented in the transfer hydrogenation of various substrates including alkene, alkynes, ketones, aldehydes, imines etc., with methanol as a hydrogen source to illustrate the potency of the concept. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed to make the process more efficient and cost-effective. Shortcomings like limited substrate scope, high catalyst loading, strongly basic conditions, low yields, and low TONs should surpass a practical application. Development of new ligand systems, steps towards base-metal catalysis, methanol dehydrogenation using enzymes, or photo-induced transfer hydrogenation could be an alternate to the existing conventional transfer hydrogenation methods. It is anticipated that an efficient catalytic system could be developed for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions using methanol as a sustainable LOHC."
