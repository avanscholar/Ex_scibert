0,Introduction,"The direct catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (syngas, CO/H2) to higher alcohols (C2+ OH) is one of the most challenging and attractive projects in the field of C1 chemistry because the low yield, poor stability and no commercial process exist till now. The resultant C2+ OH can be applied as a clean alternative fuel, fuel additives and other intermediates for value-added chemicals such as medicine, cosmetic and polyester [1,2]. Currently, two types of heterogeneous catalysts are used for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from syngas [3]: noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts. The noble metal catalysts, mainly Rh-based catalyst [4–6], exhibit high activity and selectivity of ethanol and other C2+ oxygenates due to its ability to catalyze both CO insertion and dissociation but Rh metal is too expensive for commercial application. Among these non-noble metal catalysts [7–9], Cu-based catalysts (e.g., alkalis promoted Cu-based, CuFe and CuCo catalysts) are regarded as the promising candidates for C2+ OH synthesis from syngas. However, to our best knowledge, CuFe or CuCo catalytic systems are not available due to the low C2+ OH selectivity and the poor stabilization with long-term run for pilot scale application. In addition, K or Cs is believed to play a key role to neutralize the acidity on catalysts surface and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T, such as Fe, Co, or Ni) elements are indispensable sites for CO dissociation and CC chain propagation in the HAS from syngas in those catalytic systems. The liquid products will mainly compose of methanol if alkalis and F-T elements are absent in Cu-based catalysts [10,11]. It is well known that the catalytic conversion of syngas to methanol over Cu/ZnO supported catalysts is an extremely efficient industrial process with the selectivity of over 99% [12,13]. And few studies focus on the ethanol/C2+ OH synthesis over much less expensive Cu-based catalysts without modified by the addition of alkalis or F-T elements. Nonetheless, in our previous researches, it is found that the syngas could be direct catalyzed to C2+ OH on CuZnAl catalysts without promoters by a complete liquid-phase method in slurry bed reactor [14]. Previous research indicated that a suitable amount of alkaline triethanolamine is favorable for HAS [15]. And it was found that the acidity/basicity of the solution has a significant influence on the hydrolysis of aluminum isopropylate (AIP) in catalyst preparation, which will further affect the formation of C2+ OH [16]. Lin et al. [17] studied the mixed alcohols synthesis over co-precipitated Cu-Fe catalysts which were prepared in a constant pH of 7–8. Heracleous et al. [9] prepared K-promoted CuZnAl catalysts and the pH of suspension was maintained at 6–7. Obviously, the pH value in catalyst preparation is a key parameter to design catalyst for HAS. However, since C2+ OH was an unexpected product over this kind of CuZnAl catalyst prepared by complete liquid-phase method, any systematic investigation to see the effect of pH value on the catalytic activity in HAS was not attempted yet. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the effect of pH value in catalyst preparation on the performance of HAS. Therefore, in the present work, the CuZnAl catalysts without promoters were prepared by a complete liquid-phase method for the syngas to C2+ OH. The effect of pH value in the process of catalyst preparation on performance of CuZnAl catalysts was investigated and characterized comprehensively by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."
1,Experimental part,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Four CuZnAl catalysts with Cu:Zn:Al molar ratios of 2:1:0.8 were prepared at different pH values by a complete liquid-phase method developed by our group [18]. Firstly, a certain amount of citric acid was dissolved in deionized water, then aluminum isopropoxide [(C3H7O)3Al] was added into the above solution and stirred at 323K for 3h. Next, the bath temperature was raised to 368K and kept for 0.5h. After that, a solution of Cu(II) and Zn(II) nitrates dissolved in 100mL glycol was added dropwise to the Al solution under vigorous stirring. During the preparation step, the pH value was varied from 7 to 10 with an interval of 1 using a aqueous solution of NH3·H2O. Finally, the resulting CuZnAl solution was stirred at 368K until a homogeneous sol was obtained. After aging for 10days, the sol was mixed with liquid paraffin and heated under N2 atmosphere from room temperature to 573K with a heating rate of 5K/min and maintained for 8h. As a result, a slurry catalyst was consequently obtained. For convenience, the prepared catalysts were abbreviated as P7, P8, P9 and P10, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Prior to characterization, the slurry catalyst was centrifuged, extracted by petroleum ether to remove the liquid paraffin that covered on the surface of the sample, then it was dried at room temperature to obtain the solid sample. XRD pattern was recorded to determine the crystalline phase composition of the sample using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation at 100mA and 40kV with a scanning rate of 8°min−1 in the range from 5° to 85°. H2-TPR experiment was carried out in a quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. 50mg of sample was pre-treated under He at 423K for 30min to remove physically adsorbed water, then a reductive gas (5% H2/Ar) was introduced at a flow rate of 30mL·min−1. The reactor temperature was augmented linearly from 323 to 773K with a heating rate of 10K·min−1 using a temperature-programmed controller. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the consumption of H2. NH3-TPD experiment was performed on the same apparatus as described above. 100mg of sample was placed and flushed initially with a He flow at 423K for 1.5h. After cooling to 323K, the sample was saturated with pure NH3 for 30min and flushed with He flow to remove all physical adsorbed molecules. After that, the sample was heated from 323 to 1073K at a rate of 10K·min−1. A mass spectrometer was used to detect the desorbed NH3. Nitrogen adsorption was conducted at 77K using a Micromeritics Quanta chrome instrument. Prior to the experiment, the sample was dehydrated in vacuum at 473K for 5h. The BET isotherm and BJH model were used to obtain specific surface area and pore volume, respectively. XPS experiment was conducted on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., UK) equipped with Al Kα radiation (hυ=1486.6eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (10−7 Pa). The binding energy was calibrated internally by an adventitious carbon deposit C (1s). TEM photograph was taken with a JEOL JEM-2999FMII apparatus. Sample was dispersed in ethanol and sonicated for 20min, and then deposited over a Formvar copper grid to be observed in the microscope."
4,Catalytic activity tests,"2.3 Catalytic activity tests The catalytic performance of the samples in carbon monoxide hydrogenation to C2+ OH was carried out in a continuous-flow, high-pressure, 500mL slurry bed reactor under continuous mechanical agitation. Prior to reaction, the catalysts were heated and reduced at 553K in 25% H2/N2 (75mL·min−1) for 8h at atmospheric pressure. After reduction, the C2+ OH synthesis was investigated in the temperature of 523K at 4.5MPa and an inlet flow rate of 150mL·min−1 (H2/CO=2, v/v). The steady state activity measurements were taken after at least 24h on the stream. The outlet gas (H2, CO, CH4 and CO2) and C1–C5 hydrocarbons were analyzed on line, while liquids were collected in a trap every 24h and analyzed offline. The analysis was performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using GDX-502 and TDX-01 columns, respectively. The carbon balance and mass balance were above 95%. CO conversion and products selectivity were calculated as follows: Conversion for CO % = CO in − Co out / CO in × 100 % Selectivity for A % = quantity of A / total quantity of products × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction,"3.1 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of different samples were exemplarily shown in Fig. 1 . It could be seen that all the samples shared similar structural characteristics, with Cu0 and weak ZnO being the dominant phases, revealing that pH values had little effect on the crystalline phases of samples. No Cu+ or Cu2+ was observed, which was due to the partial decomposition of liquid paraffin, then resultantly produced free carbon and finally reduced Cu2+ to Cu0 [14,15]. In addition, although the peaks of Al species could not be observed for all samples, it generally existed in AlOOH when the CuZnAl were prepared by a complete liquid-phase method according to our previous studies [15,16]. Interestingly, it could be found that the diffraction peaks of Cu0 became weaker with the increase of pH value, which meant that the crystallite size of CuZnAl samples was strongly affected by the pH value in catalyst preparation. In order to confirm the influence of pH value on the crystallite size of CuZnAl samples, the crystallite size of Cu0 was calculated by the strongest peaks of Cu0 (2θ=43.2°), using the Scherrer equation: D=Kλ/Bcosθ, where D referred to the crystallite size, K was the Scherrer constant and λ was the wavelength of X-ray, B was the FWHM of diffraction peaks of samples and θ was diffraction angle. As expected, the pH value in preparation step had a significant influence in the crystallite size of CuZnAl samples (Table 1 ). One could see that the Cu0 crystallite size of P7 and P8 samples were much bigger than that of P9 and P10 samples. As well known, copper species was regarded as a main active site in the alcohols synthesis from syngas [19,20]. Therefore, it was speculated that the pH value in the preparation step was one of the crucial factors to determine the size of Cu, and accordingly influenced the HAS. Jeong et al. [19] reported that Cu/ZnO catalyst with a small crystallite size of Cu showed an excellent catalytic performance in low temperature methanol synthesis from syngas. On the contrary, in our previous study, it was found that the bigger the crystallinity of Cu0 in catalysts, the higher the ethanol selectivity [21]. Thus, combined with the following activity, it was further confirmed that relatively larger crystallite size of Cu0 might favor to the HAS, while smaller Cu0 crystallite size was beneficial to the synthesis of methanol."
7,The reducibility of catalysts,"3.2 The reducibility of catalysts H2-TPR profiles of samples prepared at different pH value were shown in Fig. 2 . As observed, all of them had only one reduction peak that appeared at about 460–500K, which was ascribed to the reduction of Cu+ →Cu0 according to our previous studies [14,15]. It could be seen that the reducible Cu+ peak was obviously shifted to higher temperature, indicating that Cu+ could be reduced more difficult to Cu0 with the increase of pH value, which suggested that increasing pH value caused a strong interaction between Cu+ and other metallic elements. Moreover, the peak area increased continually with the increase of pH value, suggesting that the amount of reducible Cu+ increased with increasing pH value. These results might be probably due to that the different pH value would affect the hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide, and then would affect the interaction of Cu, Zn and Al species."
8,Nitrogen adsorption,"3.3 Nitrogen adsorption The textural properties of the samples prepared at different pH value before and after reaction were also listed in Table 1. It could be seen that specific surface area first increased and then gradually decreased, while the pore volume decreased continuously with the increase of pH value, and the maximum surface area was 48.1m2·g−1 for P8 sample. In addition, it could be found that the specific surface area and pore volume increased, whereas the pore diameter decreased after reaction for all samples, and a more pronounced effect was observed for the P8 sample, which was probably due to that the adsorbed liquid paraffin was removed from the pore of catalyst during the catalytic reaction, which was beneficial to improve the catalytic performance. This was a common characteristic for the samples prepared by the complete liquid-phase method [22]."
9,The surface acidity of CuZnAl catalysts,"3.4 The surface acidity of CuZnAl catalysts NH3-TPD experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of acid property on the surface of CuZnAl samples in this reaction. Fig. 3 showed the NH3 desorption profiles of different CuZnAl samples. As seen, all profiles could be deconvoluted into three peaks in the range of temperature, which could be classified to weakly (α peak), moderately (β peak), and strongly (γ peak) acid sites, respectively. The weakly acid sites were related to OH– groups occurring with NH3 through H-bond formation, moderately acid sites were ascribed to weak structural Brønsted acid sites and strongly acid sites were associated with strong structural Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites [23–25]. It could be seen that the peak temperature remained relatively constant independent of pH value, whereas the peak areas were significantly different depending on the pH value. The total number of acidity and the distribution of acid sites of all samples were summarized in Table 2 . It could found that the number of weak, strong acidity and total acidity increased, while the number of medium acidity decreased with the increase of pH value except for P10 sample. Jeong et al. [19] concluded that the strong acidity of Cu/ZnO-based catalysts played a key role in the low temperature methanol synthesis. Heracleous's studies indicated that decreasing acidity was beneficial to the C2+ OH synthesis from syngas [9,26]. However, in this study, the P8 sample with medium acidity exhibited the highest selectivity toward C2+ OH than others, which suggested that a suitable amount of acidity favored the formation of C2+ OH."
10,XPS characterization,"3.5 XPS characterization The CuZnAl samples prepared at different pH value were analyzed by XPS, and the binding energies (BE) of Cu2p3/2 Zn2p3/2 and Al2p bands were listed in Table 3 . For all samples, it could be seen that the Cu 2p3/2 XPS BE value were around at 931.0–932.5eV with no satellite peak existed at 943.7eV, indicating the absence of Cu2+ [27,28], which was consistent with XRD and TPR results. The Zn2p3/2 BE value located at 1021.0–1021.5eV could be assigned to ZnO [29]. The Al 2p BE value was around 73.3–73.8eV, corresponding to AlOH bonds, which was in agreement with Al in AlOOH [30]. In addition, it could be found that both the Cu2p3/2 and Al2p BE shifted to higher binding energies with the increase of pH value, suggesting that adjusting pH value in catalyst preparation would change the chemical surroundings of Cu and Al components, which might account for the increase of reducible Cu+ in the H2-TPR patterns. Surface compositions of the samples were also listed in Table 3. Compared with the nominal composition of the samples, it was clearly seen that the surface was considerably depleted of Cu, while Zn and Al enriched on the catalysts surface, similar results were also obtained previously by other researchers [31,32]."
11,TEM characterization,"3.6 TEM characterization The crystalline structure and surface morphology of different samples were observed by TEM analyses. As observed in Fig. 4 , the typical stacked Cu slabs characterized by black thread-like fringes were observed for P7 and P8 samples, while the particles were less oriented for P9 sample. And these black thread-like fringes were detected again on P10 sample, but the lengths and stacking number of Cu slabs decreased. These results illustrated that the size of Cu0 particle decreased overall with the increase of pH value. In addition, the d-spacing was calculated from P8 sample at about 0.21nm, which confirmed the Cu0 (111). Therefore, it was believed that both the surface morphology and the size of Cu0 particle in CuZnAl samples were strongly affected by the pH value, leading to different catalytic performance in HAS."
12,Catalytic performance,"3.7 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of different samples were studied and presented in Figs. 5 and 6 . As observed in Fig. 5(a), both CO conversion and the concentration of C2+ OH in total alcohol exhibited a volcano trend curve with the increase of pH value. Thus, it could be inferred that the difference catalytic performance depended on the pH value. As expected, the optimal CO conversion and the highest concentration of C2+ OH in total alcohol were obtained over P8 sample. In addition, the total alcohol (ROH) selectivity increased accompanying with the concentration of C2+ OH in total alcohol decreasing, which illustrated that methanol became the main product when increasing pH value, that is to say, increasing pH value would promote the formation of methanol. Moreover, it could be seen that the selectivity of CO2 and the concentration of C2+ OH in total alcohol followed the same variation trend. This probably might be due to the synthesis of C2+ OH often accompanied with the production of water, which would promote the water gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2). Combined with the aforementioned characterization analysis, the enhanced catalytic activity of P8 was due to its relatively larger Cu0 crystallite size as well as a suitable amount of acid sites. Moreover, it was thought that the thread-like fringes in shape structure of P7 and P8 samples was partially responsible for their higher catalytic performance. To see the concentration of each alcohol and hydrocarbon in total alcohols and hydrocarbons, the concentration of each alcohol and hydrocarbon were normalized. Fig. 6(a) and (b) showed the distribution of normalized alcohols and hydrocarbons on different samples, respectively. As seen, although there were no Fischer-Tropsch elements in the samples, it was also found that the distribution of alcohol and hydrocarbon products closed to the A-S-F distribution since the selectivity of each alcohol and hydrocarbon in the product decreased with the increase of carbon number, which was similar with traditional CuFe/CuCo-based catalysts. This result indicated that the HAS mainly formed through CO dissociation and insertion mechanism over this kind of Cu-based catalysts [33,34]."
13,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.8 Effect of reaction temperature Effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of HAS over Cu-based sample was investigated. For this target, P8 sample was chosen as a model sample. As shown in Fig. 7 , the ROH selectivity first increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. This was probably due to relative higher temperature would cause more amount of hydrocarbon. However, CO conversion, the concentration of ethanol and C2+ OH in total alcohol increased continuously with the increase of temperature, which illustrated that relatively higher temperature was beneficial to the formation of C2+ OH. This might probably be owing to higher temperature (>543K) facilitated the cleavage of CO bonds or possible equilibrium of methanol synthesis was reached at relatively higher temperature in the reaction system [15,17]."
14,Conclusions,"The pH value in catalyst preparation had a significant influence on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of CuZnAl catalysts for HAS. Increasing pH value reduced the crystallite size of Cu0, increased the amount of reducible Cu+, surface Cu content and total number of acid sites. It was concluded that relatively larger crystallite size of Cu0 as well as a suitable amount of acid sites were beneficial to the synthesis of C2+ OH. The optimal catalytic performance was obtained over P8 sample, with the highest concentration of C2+ OH in total alcohol reaching 44.5%. In addition, it was also found that increasing reaction temperature favored to the formation of C2+ OH. This paper illustrated that a suitable pH value was necessary in catalyst preparation for HAS over Cu-based catalysts without alkalis or F-T elements, larger or smaller pH value would promote the formation of methanol."
