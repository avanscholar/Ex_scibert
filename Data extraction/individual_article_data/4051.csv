0,Introduction,"With the increasing concern on greenhouse gas emission, global biodiesel production has greatly increased in the last ten years. In the U.S., biodiesel production also increased dramatically and is predicted to grow to approximately 912 million gallons in 2015 [1]. Glycerol, principal by-product in biodiesel production, has been overproduced because of this fast increase of biodiesel production, and today's market of glycerol has been saturated and the supply of glycerol is independent its demands [2]. Therefore, converting glycerol to value-added chemicals will open new markets for glycerol application and improve the sustainability of biodiesel production. Lactic acid (LA) and its derivatives such as alkyl lactate are being used in food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries [3,4]. With the increase in environmental concerns, LA and alkyl lactates has drawn great interest for being used as green solvents and building block for biodegradable plastics. Glycerol as starting material for LA production via chemical synthesis route has been intensively investigated in the past few years [5–9]. Kishida et al. reported 90% LA yield obtained in glycerol conversion with 1.25M NaOH at 300°C for 90min [5]. Shen et al. studied the effects of different alkali-metal hydroxides and alkaline-earth hydroxides on the glycerol conversion and LA production; they found that KOH and NaOH were more effective catalysts than others and LA could be yielded to 90% in hydrothermal conversion of glycerol at 300°C with KOH or NaOH as a catalyst [6]. To improve LA productivity, Ramirez-Lopez et al. investigated the conversion of high concentration (2.5–3.5M) of glycerol using NaOH as catalyst and achieved 84.5% LA yield when using a 2.5M glycerol concentration at the reaction condition of 280°C and 90min with a 1.1 NaOH/glycerol molar ratio [10]. However, strong alkali catalysts used in the previous reports resulted in high corrosiveness to reactors and problematic downstream separations. To reduce the negative effects of high alkalinity, Chen et al. developed a fed-batch process to convert glycerol to LA with NaOH and observed lowered corrosiveness to stainless steel reactors [11]. Although high glycerol conversion and LA yield were achieved in previous studies, it is worth noting that LA produced in the process was of low purity and existed in the form of lactate salt. Tedious processes such as esterification, hydrolyzation, and distillation to such produced LA will be required and gypsum will be produced to obtain high purity LA [12–15]. Therefore, from both an economic and environmental viewpoints, directly producing methyl lactate or ethyl lactate is preferred. Propylene glycol (PG) is also an important chemical served as functional fluid in antifreeze and lubricants, additive in foods, cosmetics and pharmaceutical product, and intermediate chemical in the production unsaturated polyester resins. Catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol to PG using metallic catalysts with pressurized hydrogen supply has been intensively investigated and progress has been made [16–21]. However, one major issue associated with this process is that an external hydrogen source is required. Several efforts have been made seeking an in situ hydrogen supply instead of an ex-situ hydrogen source, but the selectivity and yield of PG were low [22,23]. Calcium oxide (CaO) as a solid catalyst in biodiesel production has been reported [24–28]. In our previous study, CaO as a solid catalyst for LA production has been investigated and 40.8mol% LA yield with a glycerol conversion of 97.8mol% was achieved at optimal conditions [29,30]. Copper-based catalysts in PG production from glycerol has also been reported [31–33]. However, water was usually used as solvent to dilute the glycerol in previous studies for LA and PG production. However, in the biodiesel production, considerable amount of methanol remains with crude glycerol after separating the biodiesel. The separation of methanol, catalyst, and the purification of crude glycerol are costly. Directly using the mixture of glycerol, methanol, and catalyst from biodiesel production for value-added chemical production is desirable. Therefore, catalytic conversion of glycerol in alcohols should be evaluated. The major objective of this study was to investigate catalytic conversion of glycerol to value-added chemicals in methanol or ethanol solvent using mixed solid catalysts of CaO and CuO. Process conditions such as reaction time, catalyst and methanol loading amount were optimized. Integrated conversion of glycerol in alcohol media to alkyl lactate was also investigated. Direct use of industrial crude glycerol was further investigated in order to evaluate the effects of impurities on the glycerol conversion and product yield. Calcium oxide catalyst for both soybean oil transesterification with methanol to biodiesel and the subsequent crude glycerol conversion to methyl lactate were also investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Refined glycerol (99.5%) used as the starting material was first investigated in this study. CaO and CuO were used as solid catalysts. Before use, CaO was calcined at 910°C in a muffle furnace for 3h to remove Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 formed during the storage. Anhydrous methanol (99.99%) and ethanol (99.99%) were used as solvents and reactants in the conversion of glycerol. LA (90%), methyl lactate (>96%), ethyl lactate (>96%), and PG (>99.5%) were used as standard chemicals. All these chemicals, refined glycerol, and catalysts were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA). Carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice (> 99%) used in this study was purchased from a local supplier (Airgas, Knoxville, TN)."
3,Reaction procedure,"2.2 Reaction procedure The reactions were performed in batch tube reactors made of stainless steel (SS316). The volume of the tuber reactor is 2.72mL with the outside diameter (OD) of 9.53mm, the inside diameter (ID) of 7.04mm, and the length of 70.00mm. The process of glycerol conversion was carried out in a heated oil bath. Glycerol, catalysts, and alcohol with a pre-calculated molar ratio based on experimental design were well mixed and placed into the reactor. Before sealing the cap, the reactor was degassed by purging with nitrogen. Then the sealed reactor was immersed into the preheated oil bath for designated time lengths. After the reaction, the reactor was quenched in an ice-water bath immediately, and the product sample was collected for analyses."
4,Glycerol conversion to LA and PG using CaO and CuO in methanol,"2.3 Glycerol conversion to LA and PG using CaO and CuO in methanol The process conditions of glycerol conversion to LA and PG using solid catalysts in methanol were first investigated. According to our previous study, the optimum reaction temperature for glycerol conversion to LA (product existed in the form of calcium lactate) using CaO and CuO was 230°C without alcohol solvents [30,34]. Therefore, in this study, we fixed the reaction temperature at 230°C, and reaction time ranged from 60 to 300min was studied. To determine the effects of catalyst loading on the glycerol conversion and product production, different CaO loading (molar ratios of CaO to glycerol at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) and CuO loading (molar ratios of CuO to glycerol at 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) were investigated. The molar ratios of methanol to glycerol ranged from 3 to 6 were tested to evaluate the effects of methanol in glycerol conversion."
5,Alkyl lactate production from refined and crude glycerol,"2.4 Alkyl lactate production from refined and crude glycerol Because LA exists in the form of calcium lactate in the conversion of glycerol using CaO catalyst with methanol solvent, the tedious recovery of LA is still required, and gypsum (CaSO4) will be produced. To recover the LA and avoid the gypsum production, an integrated process for alkyl lactate production, which includes the glycerol conversion to calcium lactate and PG in methanol/ethanol solvent and calcium lactate transesterification with methanol/ethanol and carbon dioxide, was studied. The refined glycerol and two types of crude glycerol (Table 1 ) obtained from biodiesel industry were used as starting materials. The conversion of glycerol in methanol/ethanol solvent to calcium lactate and PG was conducted at the optimum condition obtained in Section 2.3 (230°C, 240min, CaO/glycerol=0.8, CuO/glycerol=0.2, and methanol/glycerol=5). The subsequent calcium lactate conversion to methyl or ethyl lactate was conducted at 180°C/240min or 220°C/240min, respectively, based on our previous study [34]. To reach the optimum condition, additional methanol or ethanol (molar ratio of methanol/ethanol to glycerol at 10) were added to the reactor before the transesterification of calcium lactate. In this study, dry ice was as the carbon dioxide source and the amount of dry ice added in the process was about 0.2g. The autogenous pressure of the process reached about 10MPa at the final reaction temperature."
6,Biodiesel and methyl lactate production,"2.5 Biodiesel and methyl lactate production Biodiesel production from soybean oil with methanol and subsequent glycerol conversion to methyl lactate were investigated. The reaction of biodiesel production was carried out at 65°C for 3h, with a molar ratio of methanol to oil at 12:1, 8wt.% CaO powder as catalyst based on oil weight, and 2.03wt.% water (based on methanol), which is the same as the method reported by Liu et al. [28]. After biodiesel production, the sample was centrifuged and the top layer containing biodiesel and a small amount of methanol was separated and collected. The remaining mixture consisting of methanol, glycerol, and CaO was collected for methyl lactate production. To determine the biodiesel yield, the methanol in the collected top layer was distilled off under vacuum, and the biodiesel was weighted."
7,Sample analysis,"2.6 Sample analysis The sample after reaction was washed out with deionized water (DI water), then centrifuged at relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 4070g for 5min. Clear liquid at the upper layer was collected, and pH value was adjusted to around 3 using 0.025M H2SO4 in order to convert the unconverted calcium lactate to LA. Then the sample was fed through an ion-exchange column packed with DOWEX 50WX8-400 resin (Sigma Aldrich) to remove metal ions. The samples after ion-exchange were analyzed on an HPLC equipped with a Shodex SH 1011 column (300×8mm), a refractive index (RI) detector (waters 410), and an Ultraviolet (UV) detector. The column temperature was set at 60°C, and the mobile phase used was 0.5mmol H2SO4 in DI water with a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The LA, glycerol, and PG were well identified by the RI detector, and the methyl/ethyl lactate was well identified by the UV detector at 210nm. External calibration was used to quantity each component in the products. Glycerol conversion, LA, methyl/ethyl lactate yield, and PG yield were calculated according to the following equations: (1) C glycerol mol % = n feed − n quantified n feed × 100 % where Cglycerol is glycerol conversion (mol%), nfeed is the moles of the starting glycerol, and nquantified is the remaining glycerol in the collected sample quantified by HPLC. (2) y product mol % = n product n feed × 100 % where yproduct is the yield of a specific product formed (LA, methyl/ethyl lactate or PG, mol%), nproduct is the moles of the specific product (LA, methyl/ethyl lactate or PG), and nfeed is the moles of the starting glycerol."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effects of reaction time,"3.1 Effects of reaction time The effects of reaction time on glycerol conversion and product yield are shown in Fig. 1 , indicating that glycerol conversion, LA yield, and PG yield increased with the increasing reaction time from 60 to 240min. At the reaction time of 60min, glycerol conversion achieved was about 22mol%, indicating that most glycerol was not converted. Due to the low glycerol conversion rate, LA yield and PG yield achieved were very low. However, when the reaction time was increased to 120min, the glycerol conversion, LA yield, and PG yield greatly increased to 74mol%, 38mol%, and 26mol%, respectively. When the reaction time was increased to 240min, the glycerol conversion, LA yield, and PG yield increased to 91mol%, 51mol%, and 32mol%, respectively. Further increasing the reaction time from 240min to 300min, the glycerol conversion and PG yield increased slightly but LA yield decreased; this decrease of LA yield might be due to the degradation of calcium lactate. In a previous study, the decomposition of calcium lactate was observed at the reaction temperature>280°C and 135min reaction time [29]. Although the reaction temperature in this study was lower than that in the previous report, the reaction time was much longer which might also result in the decomposition of calcium lactate. To minimize the LA decomposition and achieve high glycerol conversion and PG yield, the optimum reaction time was set at 240min."
10,Effects of CaO and CuO loading,"3.2 Effects of CaO and CuO loading Fig. 2 shows the effects of CaO loading on glycerol conversion and product yield. Previous study pointed out that CaO served as both catalyst and reactant in glycerol conversion to LA, and it was consumed with the reaction going on, low CaO loading could cause the decrease of glycerol conversion and, consequently, product yield [29]. Comparing with the previous study, this study used methanol as solvent and CuO as co-catalyst. The effects of CaO loading on glycerol conversion and product yield for this reaction system were unknown. Therefore, to determine the effects of CaO loading, molar ratios of CaO to glycerol from 0.4 to 1 were tested. The glycerol conversion achieved was >91mol% at all the different CaO loadings, indicating that the glycerol conversion can be at high level and was not significantly influenced by CaO loading in the investigated range. However, LA yield and PG yield were greatly influenced by CaO loading. LA yield increased with the increase of CaO loading, while PG yield decreased. At the lowest CaO-to-glycerol molar ratio, the dominant product was PG, and its yield achieved was about 45mol%; LA yield achieved at the same condition was only about 31mol%. When the CaO-to-glycerol molar ratio was increased to 0.8, the dominant product was calcium lactate and its yield achieved was about 51mol%; PG yield achieved at the same condition was about 31mol%. These results indicate that the high CaO loading favors the LA production because higher CaO loading would provide sufficient CaO to react with the produced LA, forming calcium lactate. Further increasing the CaO loading from 0.8 to 1 (molar ratio of CaO to glycerol), LA yield and PG yield were not changed significantly. Fig. 3 shows the effects of CuO loading on glycerol conversion and product yield. The lowest glycerol conversion at 61.8mol% was obtained when CuO-to-glycerol molar ratio was at 0.05. Increasing the molar ratio of CuO to glycerol to above 0.1, the glycerol conversion achieved was over 90mol%. These results indicate that high CuO loading promotes the glycerol conversion. PG yield first increased with the increase of CuO loading then decreased. The highest PG yield at ~37mol% was achieved when the CuO-to-glycerol molar ratio was at 0.1. LA yield increased with the increase of CuO loading, and the highest yield of 51mol% was achieved when the CuO-to-glycerol molar ratio was at 0.2. These results indicate that the increase of CuO loading also favors the LA production."
11,Effects of methanol loading,"3.3 Effects of methanol loading Fig. 4 shows the effects of methanol loading on glycerol conversion, and LA/PG yield. Glycerol conversion increased with the increase of methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio from 3 to 5. Further increasing the molar ratio to 6, the glycerol conversion significantly decreased. This decrease of glycerol conversion might be due to the limitation of mass transfer between the glycerol and the catalysts in a large amount of methanol. LA yield was not changed significantly when the methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio increased from 3 to 4. However, further increasing the molar ratio from 4 to 6, LA yield decreased greatly. PG yield increased with the increase of the methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio from 3 to 5, but it was decreased greatly when the methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio was further raised to 6. These results indicate that high methanol loading has negative effects on both glycerol conversion and product yield due to the mass transfer limitation. To achieve high LA yield and the total yield of products (LA and PG), the methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio at 5 is desirable."
12,Alkyl lactate production from refined and crude glycerol,"3.4 Alkyl lactate production from refined and crude glycerol Results for refined and crude glycerol conversion to methyl lactate by the integrated process are shown in Fig. 5 . Methyl lactate yield achieved using refined glycerol as starting material was about 45mol%. In addition to methyl lactate, about 17mol% LA (unconverted calcium lactate) yield and about 28mol% PG yield were achieved. The glycerol conversion and methyl lactate yield from CG1 were lower than those in the case of converting refined glycerol. Reaction using CG2 showed similar glycerol conversion and methyl lactate yield to those in the case of converting refined glycerol. The LA yields achieved from CG1 and CG2 were close to those in the case of converting refined glycerol; however, the PG yields were lower, possibly due to side reactions that partially consumed the produced PG during the long reaction time. From Table 1, it can be seen that the water content is about 7wt.% in CG1 and 13% in CG2, much higher than that in refined glycerol (no water was added in the conversion of refined glycerol). Soap content in CG1 is much higher than that in CG2. These impurities in crude glycerol, especially in CG1, caused the consumption or possible deactivation of CaO, resulting in the decrease of glycerol conversion and product yield. Conversion of refined and crude glycerol to ethyl lactate using the integrated process was also investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The ethyl lactate yield achieved using refined glycerol as starting material was about 45mol% with glycerol conversion of 98mol%. The conversion of crude glycerol CG1 showed similar glycerol conversion and ethyl lactate yield. In the case of CG2, glycerol conversion was similar, but ethyl lactate yield was slight higher than that in the case of converting refined glycerol. The LA yields from CG1 and CG2 were lower than those in the case of converting refined glycerol, but the PG yields from CG1 and CG2 were close to those in the case of converting refined glycerol. Comparing with methyl lactate production, the reaction temperature for ethyl lactate production was much higher (220°C for ethyl lactate production and 180°C for methyl lactate production). The high reaction temperature might change reaction kinetics, alleviating the negative effects of impurities in crude glycerol on glycerol conversion and ethyl lactate yield."
13,Biodiesel and methyl lactate production from soybean oil,"3.5 Biodiesel and methyl lactate production from soybean oil Results for biodiesel production from soybean oil and subsequent methyl lactate production using the mixture of crude glycerol, methanol, and CaO from biodiesel process are shown in Table 2 . The biodiesel yield and glycerol yield achieved were 88.3wt.% and 9.3wt.%, respectively. The content of glycerol and methanol in the mixture after removing biodiesel was about 32.3wt.% and 56.4wt.%, respectively, resulting in an ideal methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio of ~5. Therefore, no additional methanol was added into the mixture for subsequent glycerol conversion. Before conducting the reaction, a pre-calculated amount of CuO was added into the mixture to reach the CuO-to-glycerol molar ratio of 0.2. From Table 2, it can be seen that the glycerol conversion and PG yield achieved were similar to those in the case of converting refined glycerol. The methyl lactate yield achieved was about 54mol%, slightly higher than that in the case of converting refined glycerol, while LA yield achieved was lower than that in the case of converting refined glycerol. However, the total yield of methyl lactate and LA achieved was close to those in the case of converting refined glycerol. The similar glycerol conversion and product yield achieved for converting the mixture from biodiesel process might be due to the good mixing of reactants with catalysts. These results confirmed that the mixture of crude glycerol, CaO, and methanol from biodiesel production can be directly used as reactants to produce methyl lactate and PG without separating the catalyst of CaO, methanol and purifying crude glycerol."
14,Proposed reaction scheme,"3.6 Proposed reaction scheme The reaction mechanism of glycerol conversion to LA with alkali catalysts in aqueous phase has been investigated in previous studies [5,10]. Under alkali condition, glycerol is first converted to 2-hydroxypropenal via dehydration and dehydrogenation and eliminating a molecule of hydrogen and water. 2-Hydroxypropenal is further converted to pyruvaldehyde through keto-enol tautomerization, finally forming LA from pyruvaldehyde via benzilic acid rearrangement. Chen et al. has reported a reaction pathway of glycerol conversion to LA with a solid catalyst of CaO [29]. They pointed out that the reaction initiates with the conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde via glyceroxide ion and CaO catalyst plays an important role in advancing the formation of glyceroxide ion and promoting hydrogen abstraction. In this study, we used mixed catalysts of CaO and CuO and conducted the reaction at 230°C. CuO catalyst also plays an important role for triggering the initial reaction and lowering the reaction temperature. Previous report also proposed PG formation via in situ hydrogenation of 2-hydroxypropenal and pyruvaldehyde in the glycerol conversion to LA [29,30,34]. In this study, we observed over 30mol% PG yield at the optimum condition, which is much higher than previously reported [9,29]. Therefore, CuO promotes the in situ hydrogenation for PG formation. In addition, we used methanol or ethanol as solvent in this study. Partial alcohol reforming catalyzed by CuO might generate more hydrogen (in addition to glycerol dehydrogenation catalyzed by CaO), favoring the PG production, especially at low CaO loadings [22,35]. It is notable that the decrease of PG yield coincided with the increase of total yield of methyl lactate and LA in methyl lactate production, which could be explained by the possible reverse reaction of PG to 2-hydroxypropenal and pyruvaldehyde, diverting more of the intermediates to form calcium lactate and methyl lactate. Fig. 7 summarizes the proposed reaction scheme of glycerol conversion to LA, PG, and methyl lactate using mixed catalysts of CaO and CuO in methanol solvent."
15,Conclusions,"This study first investigated the glycerol conversion to LA, and PG using mixed solid catalysts of CaO and CuO in methanol solvent. Process conditions such as reaction time, catalyst loading, and methanol loading all have significant effects on both glycerol conversion and product yield. Increasing the CaO loading favors LA production. We also developed an integrated method to convert glycerol to alkyl lactate. The test of refined glycerol conversion with methanol showed ~45mol% yield of methyl lactate. Similar yield of ethyl lactate was also achieved when converting refined glycerol with ethanol. The evaluation of crude glycerol conversion indicated that water and other impurities in crude glycerol have negative effects on methyl lactate production but no significant effects on ethyl lactate production, which was conducted at a higher reaction temperature. Biodiesel production from soybean oil with methanol catalyzed by CaO and subsequent conversion of the mixture of glycerol, methanol, and CaO after separating biodiesel were also investigated. The results suggest that the mixture of glycerol, methanol, and CaO after separating biodiesel can directly serve as starting materials for the production of value-added chemicals without the purification of crude glycerol."
