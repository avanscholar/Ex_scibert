0,Introduction,"The increasing trend of global greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, has persuaded scientists, engineers, and policy makers to look for ways to slow or mitigate these emissions. Since most anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels, a major emphasis has been placed on the development of alternative energy sources. These sources include but are not limited to bioenergy, hydropower, wind energy, nuclear energy, and geothermal energy [1–6]. In parallel, given that the use of fossil energy will continue for many decades, researchers have developed carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage technologies, including approaches designed for emission mitigation at point sources [7–11] as well as negative emission technologies for CO2 removal from air (direct air capture, DAC) [12–16]. In recent years, a growing number of pilot-scale and commercial-scale CO2 capture plants are being developed [16–18]. While the scale of CO2 removal needed for climate change mitigation will require significant geological CO2 storage [19–21], the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals, such as liquid fuels, alcohols, olefins, and aromatics, has become a topic of interest for many researchers in the fields of catalysis, materials, and process design [22–25]. Approaches that utilize CO2 are needed to realize the vision of a future cyclic CO2 economy [26–28], as well as to incentivize CO2 capture in the short term. Aromatic hydrocarbons are known for their broad range of applications as solvents, gasoline-fuel additives, and precursors to value-added chemicals. Benzene, toluene, and xylene isomers (BTX) are the aromatics with the highest commercial demand and are among the most important organic chemical building blocks [29]. Benzene is a precursor to several value-added building blocks such as ethylbenzene, cumene, and cyclohexane [30]. Toluene is often used as a solvent or the starting material for the production of toluene diisocyanate; however, over 75% of toluene is used in disproportionation reactions to form benzene and xylenes [31]. Among the xylene isomers, p-xylene has the largest demand as it is a key feedstock for the production of terephthalic acid, which is a precursor for several poly(ester)s, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) [32,33]. With a global production rate of 100 million metric tons per year in 2010, the consumption rate of BTX has witnessed an increasing trend in recent years. For instance, the global production of p-xylene increased by 3 million metric tons in 2018 compared to its previous year [30,34,35]. Without any environmental policy implementations, the production rate of BTX is projected to increase to above 200 million metric tons per year by 2050 [34]. In the US, the BTX prices have been consistently within $2−3/gallon over the past five years, and as high as $5/gallon over the past seven years [36,37]. Currently, the majority of BTX is produced either by catalytic reforming of naphtha, primarily sourced from the distillation of crude oil or by pyrolysis gas via steam cracking [38]. Catalytic reforming involves a precious metal catalyst (typically platinum) supported on high surface area alumina or similar support that provides some degree of acidity. Reforming is a high-temperature, vapor-phase process that involves several reactions such as dehydrogenation, isomerization, aromatization, and hydrocracking. Yet the selectivity to aromatics can be as high as 70–80%. Pyrolysis of cracked naphtha can also result in BTX components. In either process, BTX must be separated and purified from other products using liquid solvents via liquid-liquid extraction or extractive distillation; these solvents include sulfolane, (di-, tri-, tetra-)ethylene glycol, dimethylformamide, and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone [38–40]. This approach further involves numerous upstream reactions and separations for processing crude oil into appropriate precursors for catalytic reforming. The US CO2 emissions from coal combustion in 2018 were 1260 million metric tons [41], which is equivalent to 29 trillion moles of carbon. For simplicity, assuming that the BTX mass is equal to toluene’s with the molar mass of 92 g mol−1 (midway between benzene 78 g mol−1 and xylene 106 g mol−1), the global production of BTX (100 million metric tons in 2010) is estimated at 7.6 trillion moles of carbon. Thus, if a new CO2-derived BTX technology were developed, and if all BTX were derived from CO2 produced from coal combustion, the U.S. emissions could fully supply the global market. Furthermore, since aromatics are thermodynamically stable chemicals, their persistent use and recycle without subsequent combustion represents a way to sequester carbon and displace the emission of 0.43 metric tons of CO2 per barrel of crude oil [42]. Hydrogen production from low CO2 emission technologies, such as renewable bio-oil processing, water splitting via electrolysis or photolysis, and steam methane reforming combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), is attracting increased attention due to its compatibility with the existing energy infrastructure and the high energy density of hydrogen on a mass basis as well as the wide range of applications in fuel and chemical technologies [43–45]. Since these low-emission H2 production technologies are less dependent on fossil fuels and, therefore, are minimally impacted by their price fluctuations, non-fossil hydrogen is considered a potentially more stable resource [46]. Thus, progress in clean hydrogen production provides enhanced motivations for developing negative emission and economically viable processes such as chemicals production via CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions [46]. The hydrogenation of CO2 to produce aromatics is a relatively new approach to CO2 valorization that has expanded in recent years. The main challenge in this reaction is to discover and develop pathways that can directly convert CO2 to aromatics. Because of the lack of a direct pathway with monofunctional catalysts, alternative pathways using multifunctional catalysts have been explored. Generally, CO2 is converted first to a value-added chemical via a highly selective catalyst, and then the chemical is further transformed into aromatics via zeolite catalysis. For instance, one can imagine application of CO2 methanation (methanation) over metals and then methane aromatization over Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, but the low efficiency in methane conversion and harsh reaction conditions cause low aromatics selectivity and severe catalyst deactivation. The other promising pathways involve CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons or methanol over metal or metal oxide catalysts, followed by their aromatization with H-ZSM-5 catalyst. While there have been a few studies on these pathways using separate catalyst beds, with each bed operating at a different operational condition [47,48], direct conversion of CO2 to aromatics over a single catalyst bed containing a multifunctional catalyst is also possible. This combined reaction offers a complex catalyst and reaction engineering challenge, with inherent thermodynamic, kinetic, and catalyst design constraints. Studies on the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics can be divided into two primary categories based on the intermediate products, i.e., one with olefins as intermediates using iron-based catalysts, and the other with methanol as an intermediate using metal oxides. Both categories form hybrid catalysts with zeolites, typically H-ZSM-5, to produce aromatics (Fig. 1 ). Although each individual reaction in this tandem reaction system has been studied in detail [22,25,49–51], the combination of the two can bring multiple new complexities to the system, including the need for different catalyst functionalities in a single bed, different thermodynamic and kinetic temperature-dependent behaviors, and the positive ΔG for the production of some of the main intermediate products. Therefore, there were very few studies on this topic before 2017 [52,53]. However, considering the development of commercial plants that can capture CO2 in large scales, progress made in clean H2 technologies, and recent improvements in the catalytic performance of this reaction, a growing number of studies are focusing on this area in the last few years. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature to date on various aspects of the CO2 aromatization reaction, including catalyst and reaction optimization, proposed mechanisms, thermodynamics studies, and progress made on kinetic modeling of the reaction. We also offer a discussion of the key issues, limitations, and present gaps that need to be addressed in optimizing the performance of this reaction."
1,Family of related reactions,
2,CO2 hydrogenation to methanol,"2.1 CO2 hydrogenation to methanol Methanol, as one of the largest-scale organic chemicals, can be industrially used as a solvent, fuel additive or as a feedstock for producing value-added chemicals and liquid fuels [54]. Olah and co-workers proposed a “Methanol economy” concept to describe a CO2-neutral society via hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [55–57]. In the past few decades, significant research has been devoted to thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol through heterogeneous catalysis. Progress has been made in the characterization and design of highly active and stable catalysts and developing micro-scale computational models for understanding catalyst structure-activity relationships and potential reaction mechanisms [58–61]. Hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is an exothermic reaction and results in a reduced number of molecules upon occurrence, so lower temperatures and higher pressures are thermodynamically favored for this reaction. Reaction temperatures and pressures around 200−320 °C and 5−10 MPa, respectively, are utilized for this reaction, due to kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Under these conditions, the reaction is equilibrium limited. However, this limitation may be overcome by novel reactor design and recycling the tail gas [24]. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts are well-known industrial catalysts for CO hydrogenation to methanol. The similarities between the mechanisms of syngas to methanol and CO2 to methanol reactions have spurred intensive studies on Cu-based catalysts for the latter reaction. Several reviews have covered various aspects of the CO2 to methanol reaction using these catalysts, such as operational conditions, catalyst and reactor design, active site investigations, and the reaction mechanisms [23,24,46,62]. The reaction temperature for Cu-based methanol synthesis catalysts is below 250 °C. Furthermore, while this process has already been commercialized using Cu-based catalysts [28], operational challenges in large-scale production remain, such as the limited stability of the catalyst because of aggregation of Cu caused by water and the competing reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Apart from the Cu-based catalysts, supported noble metal (Pd, Au, and Pt) catalysts have been employed for this reaction using different types of supports and preparation techniques [63–67]. Like Cu-based catalysts, these catalysts favor low-temperatures for CO2 conversion to methanol. The stability of some of these alternate catalysts, such as the Pd-based catalysts, is superior to that of the Cu-based catalysts. However, the high price of these noble metals is the biggest obstacle for commercialization purposes. More recently, Ni-Ga catalysts have been studied for this reaction. These catalysts are also active at temperatures below 250 °C and have shown promising methanol yields compared to the conventional CO2 to methanol catalysts. At higher temperatures (225−250 °C), the MeOH/CO selectivity ratio of this catalyst can be one order of magnitude larger compared to the Cu/ZnO catalyst [68,69]. Besides metallic catalysts, several groups have developed alternative binary oxides, such as ZnO-ZrO2, GaO-ZrO2, and In2O3-ZrO2, with excellent stability and sulfur tolerance for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [70–72]. However, due to the lower hydrogenation reactivity of these catalysts, their reaction temperatures are generally higher than those of the Cu-based catalysts (beyond 250 °C). The higher operational temperatures suggest that they show potential for being used in bifunctional catalysts in combination with various zeolites for the direct conversion of CO2 to olefins and liquid hydrocarbons."
3,Hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins,"2.2 Hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins Olefins are among the most critical chemical building blocks in the chemical industry due to their high reactivity and wide range of applications as intermediate chemicals. Many efforts have been devoted to the realization of the direct conversion of CO2 to olefins. According to reviews on conventional FT catalysts used for the conversion of CO2 to olefins, the Fe-based catalysts have shown the best olefins selectivity [73–77]. During this reaction, CO2 is initially converted to CO by the RWGS reaction on magnetite (Fe3O4), followed by hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons through FT synthesis on iron carbides. Zhang et al. conducted operando spectroscopic studies to confirm that Hägg iron-carbide (χ-Fe5C2) sites are beneficial for C2-C4 olefins formation, while cementite iron-carbide (θ-Fe3C) sites promote C5+ hydrocarbons formation [78]. Therefore, the ratio of iron oxides/iron carbides and their types are important to achieving high CO2 conversion and olefins selectivity. Although various types of supports, promoters, additives, and pretreatment conditions have been developed to modulate the structure and composition of Fe-based catalysts, the product selectivities are still limited by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution [22,79]. New reaction pathways and catalyst design strategies are needed for breaking the limitations of the ASF distribution. Two groups have recently reported bifunctional catalysts consisting of metal oxides (ZnCrOx, ZnO-ZrO2) and SAPO-34 zeolite for the catalytic conversion of syngas to lower olefins [80,81]. In these tandem catalysts, the metal oxides contain the active phase for CO and H2 activation, and zeolites provide the active sites for CC coupling. Precise control of the rate of CC bond formation through the shape-selective behavior of zeolites provided a promising lower olefins selectivity of around 80%, surpassing the prediction of the ASF model (58% for total C2-C4 hydrocarbons). This reaction coupling strategy represents an example of engineering alternate reaction pathways to break free from ASF limits. Therefore, a series of bifunctional catalysts composed of mixed oxides (ZnO-ZrO2, ZnGa2O4, In2O3-ZrO2, In2O3) and acid zeolites (SAPO-34) were developed for the hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins via the methanol intermediate [82–86]. An excellent lower olefins selectivity of 85–90% at ∼20% CO2 conversion was achieved, and the selectivity toward undesirable CH4 was below 5%. Compared to conventional non-hybrid FT catalysts, the space-time yield (STY) of these multifunctional catalysts is relatively low, and the CO selectivity is relatively high. Therefore, these catalysts could still benefit from further research to address these challenges."
4,Methanol or C2-C4 hydrocarbons aromatization,"2.3 Methanol or C2-C4 hydrocarbons aromatization H-ZSM-5 is an efficient catalyst for the conversion of a large variety of feedstocks, such as methanol, olefins, and paraffins, to aromatics. Generally, the aromatization reactions are conducted at high temperatures (>300 °C), considering the kinetic factors. Mechanistically, there are several key steps for the catalytic conversion of methanol or C2-C4 hydrocarbons to aromatics over H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 2 ) [87,88]. Upon the cyclization of the oligomerized higher olefin intermediates, aromatics are formed through the removal of hydrogen atoms via hydrogen transfer or dehydrogenation pathways; the hydrogen removal step is often confirmed to be the rate-limiting step. In the hydrogen transfer mechanism, stoichiometric amounts of olefins react with H species to keep the H/C ratio constant, leading to low aromatics selectivity (∼30% selectivity) [87]. The combination of all the steps from lower olefins to C6-C10 aromatics via hydrogen transfer over H-ZSM-5 catalysts is also known as the M2 forming process, to distinguish it from the conventional dehydrocyclization mechanism that almost exclusively forms benzene at high temperatures [89]. The dehydrogenative aromatization step is often activated by modifying the H-ZSM-5 with ZnO or Ga2O3, leading to enhanced selectivity to aromatics [90–92]. It has been demonstrated that the metal cations provide recombinative desorption of H species to deliver H2. The aromatics selectivity could reach up to 80% after modifying the H-ZSM-5 with metal oxides. Additionally, introducing co-feeds of CO or CO2 as hydrogen acceptors to react with H species promotes the aromatics selectivity further [93,94]. The biggest challenge in this reaction is known to be the deactivation of H-ZSM-5 through severe coke deposition. The poly(aromatic) compounds and amorphous carbon particles are too large to diffuse through the pores of H-ZSM-5, and can, therefore, cause the deactivation of the catalyst [95,96]. As a result, impeding the formation of these deactivation-inducing species is the key to improving the stability of the catalyst. Reducing the residence time of aromatic products by preparing mesoporous, nano-sized, or nano-sheet H-ZSM-5 catalysts is one strategy used thus far [97–99]. Additionally, it has been shown that changing the reaction atmosphere to H2 enhances the catalytic lifetime. More recently, it has been confirmed that the presence of high-pressure H2 suppresses the formation of polycyclic species in methanol-to-olefins reactions and improves the catalyst lifetime [100,101]; a similar effect is observed in the MTA reaction [94]. A summary of the catalytic and operational conditions for the reactions discussed above is shown in Table 1 . As mentioned earlier, in the CO2 aromatization reaction, CO2 conversion to methanol or olefins needs to be coupled with the corresponding aromatization reactions. However, there is a very narrow range of conditions that is common among the two coupling reactions. This results in a considerable limitation on the catalytic pathways that can be employed for each reaction. These limits and the available options are discussed in detail in the next sections."
5,Reaction thermodynamics,"Due to the nature of the CO2 aromatization reaction(s) that convert a C1 chemical to C6-C10+ chemical mixture, several parallel and series reactions and products are involved in its mechanism. Moreover, the multi-functionality of the catalysts provides the opportunity for multiple side-reactions in the system. Therefore, a thermodynamic analysis of the whole system as a single process provides less insight than the analysis of the main reactions separately. The following reactions (1–8) have been considered for the thermodynamic analysis of the system. Ethylene, ethane, and toluene are considered as representative products for olefins, paraffins, and aromatics, respectively. (1) CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) → C H 3 OH ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) (2) C H 3 OH g → 1 / 7 C 7 H 8 g + H 2 O g + 3 / 7 H 2 ( g ) (3) CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) → 1 / 2 C 2 H 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) (4) 1 / 2 C 2 H 4 ( g ) → 1 / 7 C 7 H 8 ( g ) + 3 / 7 H 2 O ( g ) (5) CO 2 ( g ) + 18 / 7 H 2 ( g ) → 1 / 7 C 7 H 8 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) (6) CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) → CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) (7) C 2 H 4 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) → C 2 H 6 ( g ) (8) CO 2 ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) → C H 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) A closer look at the Gibbs free energy changes of the above reactions provides some insight toward the limits for the CO2 aromatization reaction via the two reaction pathways. The coupling of the two catalyst functionalities (hydrogenation via metal oxides or Fe-based catalysts, and aromatization via H-ZSM-5) enhances the CO2 conversion due to the thermodynamic driving force imposed by the conversion of the intermediate species to more thermodynamically stable oligomers and aromatic products. As shown in Fig. 3 a, as temperature increases, unlike the methanol aromatization reaction (reaction 2), the overall exothermic methanol synthesis reaction (reaction 1) becomes more thermodynamically unfavorable. Similarly, the overall change in Gibbs free energy with temperature increases for the exothermic ethylene synthesis reaction (reaction 3); however, the ΔG for this reaction is relatively lower than that of methanol synthesis reaction and closer to the ΔG of the ethylene aromatization reaction (reaction 4). This indicates that if CO2 conversion to the intermediate compound is thermodynamically limited and its aromatization reaction is kinetically limited, but still fast, then thermodynamics will favor the olefin pathway, since the olefin production is less endothermic, and fast kinetics of olefin aromatization drive CO2 conversion to the right due to Le Chatelier's principle. Also, based on the Gibbs free energies obtained, the formation of methane, ethylene, ethane, and toluene are the only reactions occurring spontaneously at relevant reaction temperatures, a decreasing trend in relative energies, leading to more spontaneous reactions, is expected as the number of carbon atoms in the alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics increases [102]. Methane formation has a considerably lower ΔG value compared to all the other CO2 involved reactions. However, the formation of methane in aromatization studies is limited due to kinetic barriers and the absence of stoichiometric values of CO2/H2 for this reaction, i.e. 1/4, as opposed to a typical ratio of 1/3 used in CO2 aromatization studies. Among the main reactions that involve CO2 as the reactant at 4 MPa and H2/CO2 ratio of 3, the RWGS is the only reaction that becomes more favorable upon a temperature increase; other reactions have a decreasing equilibrium CO2 conversion as the reaction temperature increases (Fig. 3b). The CO2 equilibrium conversion at 300−360 °C is more than 90% for toluene formation. The fact that this value is far from experimentally observed CO2 conversion values indicates that the kinetics is the limiting factor for this reaction at the studied conditions. To better understand this effect, the thermodynamic equilibrium CO2 conversion and product selectivities were calculated considering a mix of chemicals presented in reactions 1–8 at different temperature ranges (250−400 °C), 4 MPa pressure, and H2/CO2 ratio of 3. Methane was the most thermodynamically dominant product due to its high stability, with its carbon selectivity being more than 99% in all cases. To further analyze the thermodynamic behavior of the reaction, a similar analysis was conducted in the absence of methane. This change resulted in having ethane as the thermodynamically favored chemical with >99% carbon selectivity at all temperatures. Removing the ethane from the system resulted in having >98% toluene as the thermodynamically dominant chemical at similar conditions. In all cases studied, the CO2 conversion stayed above 70%. The comparison of all these results with the experimental catalytic data below indicates that the reaction is far from thermodynamic equilibrium at the typically studied conditions. Moreover, the results indicate that selective aromatic formation requires kinetic limitations to avoid formation of light alkanes."
6,Catalyst design for CO2 aromatization,
7,Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts,"4.1 Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts Aromatics production through CO and olefins as intermediate products via Fe-based catalysts is the most common pathway studied for direct CO2 aromatization. It is accepted that the dominant mechanism for aromatics production through these types of intermediate products is the RWGS reaction followed by FT and M2 forming processes (Fig. 4 ) [89]. As mentioned in section 2, H-ZSM-5 is well-studied in the literature for its efficient performance in the M2 forming process due to its appropriate acidic properties; furthermore, its pore size and topology provide nearly ideal confinement for aromatics production. On the other hand, Fe-based catalysts are typically known for their activity for both RWGS and FT reactions. A summary of the notable results using Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 hybrid catalysts is presented in Table 2 . Kuei and co-workers were the first group to study this reaction [52]. They used two types of Fe catalysts, a commercial KOH-fused Fe catalyst, and a lab-synthesized unpromoted Fe catalyst. As shown in Table 2, using distinct operational conditions compared to the subsequent studies on this catalyst, they were able to obtain aromatics selectivity as high as 21% at 38% CO2 conversion using the KOH-fused Fe/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The selectivity toward aromatics in the case of unpromoted Fe/H-ZSM-5 catalyst did not exceed 3%, probably because of the higher acidity of the Fe catalyst in the absence of KOH in the unpromoted Fe. The higher acidity of this Fe catalyst led to the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins prior to the M2 process [89]. Paraffin production is known as one of the key dead-end pathways at relevant temperatures for the CO2 aromatization reaction (280−380 °C), competing with the olefin aromatization pathway, due to the negligible reactivity of alkanes for aromatization at this temperature range [103]. Similar to the study of Kuei et al. [52], most of the Fe-based catalysts on this topic are modified by an alkali metal, most typically sodium [48,104,106,108] or potassium [52,107,109]. The presence of alkali metals improves the reaction performance by enhancing the conversion of CO to olefins, therefore, pushing the RWGS reaction toward higher CO2 conversion. Xu and co-workers investigated this effect by studying CO2 conversion to olefins with Fe, Na-Fe, and Mn-Fe catalysts. They noticed that CO2 conversion and olefins selectivity improved significantly in the presence of Na, while CO and CH4 selectivities decreased by 50%, and paraffins selectivity decreased by 90% compared to the case of the Fe catalyst alone. A four-fold increase in olefins selectivity with Na addition was achieved; this increase was not observed upon the addition of a typical CO FT promoter such as Mn. This difference in performance, as explained in detail in the mechanism section (Section 5.1), was attributed to the role of Na atoms in donating electrons to the Fe-C bond to enhance the dissociation of CO and weaken the H2 adsorption [106]. On the other hand, metals that do not support electron donation, such as Mn, as confirmed by XPS studies, do not provide this effect. At 29% CO2 conversion at 300 °C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2400 ml gcat −1 h−1 an aromatics selectivity of 41% was obtained using a Na-Fe3O4/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [106]. Using potassium as the alkali metal and a higher range of WHSVs, reaction temperatures, and pressures, Ramirez et al. improved the aromatics formation rate for this reaction compared to Xu et al. by a factor of two, to 6.5 mmolCO2 gcatalyst −1 h−1; however, their aromatics selectivity was lower than the former case, 24% at 48% CO2 conversion [107]. Besides adding alkali metals, additional methods have been explored to enhance the conversion of CO2 with higher olefins production rates through improvement in the surface characteristics of the Fe-based catalysts. Cui et al. utilized Zn with Fe-based catalysts to improve catalyst reducibility [108]. The improved reducibility, as confirmed by H2-TPR studies, was obtained via the formation of smaller Fe-based crystals as a result of Zn addition [108,110]. Using this catalyst with H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio of 12.5), they reported the highest selectivity among Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts to date, with 70% aromatics selectivity and 41% CO2 conversion at 320 °C and 2 MPa. Another study by Halder and co-workers showed that Fe-based catalysts with copper nanoparticles would produce CO, methane, and methanol as the main products, with minimal benzene formation. This finding provides evidence that upon the addition of copper, the governing pathways for CO2 conversion shifted from hydrocarbons production to methane and methanol formation [111]. Wang and co-workers used a Na-doped Fe-based metal organic framework (Na-Fe-MOF) precursor to improve the olefin production step [48]. Pyrolyzed MOFs can provide a highly porous carbon matrix that encapsulates high loadings of Fe in a dispersed structure coated by layers of carbon. This well-dispersed structure leads to the formation of highly active and stable catalysts [48,112,113]. The physical mixture of 20–40 mesh (380−830 μm) particles of this Fe-based structure with H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio of 40) at 320 °C and 3 MPa provided 44% aromatics selectivity at 33% CO2 conversion. Wang et al. synthesized iron catalysts over a honey-comb structured graphene support (HSG) to improve the reduction and carburization of iron species and disperse active iron sites using its porous structure [75,109]. Combining this catalyst with an H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio of 25) in a dual bed structure resulted in 42% aromatics selectivity and a production rate of 40.5 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h−1. This catalyst provided stable performance over the course of 120 h on stream with minimal sintering and coking due to the porous environment provided by the HSG support [109,114,115]. As mentioned earlier, most of the Fe-based studies for CO2 aromatization include H-ZSM-5 catalyst for the M2 forming process of intermediate olefins. The use of Fe-based catalysts for FT reactions would typically result in an ASF distribution of the products [116]. The addition of zeolites to the Fe-based catalysts would increase the chain growth probability factor in the tandem material, with the hydrocarbon composition deviating from typical ASF distribution [104,107]. Using a zeolite with appropriate acidic properties, limiting pore aperture and pore topology can lead to the production of aromatics from those hydrocarbons [109,117]. Wang et al. tested different zeolites with a K-Fe catalyst for aromatics production and were able to obtain the best results with H-ZSM-5 and MCM-22 zeolites, both with Si/Al ratio of 25 and 10 MR pores, but slightly larger pore size for H-ZSM-5 [109]. The presence of H-ZSM-5 can also improve reaction performance through suppressing side-reactions. Different studies have shown that the coupling of olefination and aromatization reactions that occur in the presence of H-ZSM-5 suppresses the rate of methane formation and inhibits the production of oxygenates in the system [104,108,109]. On the other hand, several studies have shown that the addition of H-ZSM-5 to the Na-Fe and K-Fe catalysts suppresses the carburization of Fe to χ-Fe5C2, therefore decreasing the rate of CO FT and RWGS reactions, leading to a reduction in CO2 conversion and enhancement in CO selectivity [106–108]. Modification of H-ZSM-5 catalyst is another strategy used for improving aromatics selectivity. Alkaline treatment with NaOH has shown to provide improved aromatics selectivity by reducing the number of acid sites and decreasing the diffusion path length [48,108]. Cui et al. used this technique to adjust the number of Brønsted acid sites of H-ZSM-5 and found an optimum value of 294 μmol/g for the Brønsted acid density in their tandem catalyst [108]. In another example, non-acidic SiO2 coatings have been adopted to cover the acid sites on the external zeolite surface to reduce the probability of C6-C8 aromatics transalkylation and isomerization reactions to produce other aromatic compounds [106,108]. The results showed a significant improvement in the p-isomer selectivity among aromatic compounds due to the spatial limits for transalkylation and isomerization reactions inside the channels. Additionally, the reduced number of external acid sites suppressed the dimerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization of olefins into paraffins. Therefore, besides the increased selectivity of aromatics within the hydrocarbons (HCs, excluding CO), an increase in total olefins selectivity and a decrease in total paraffins selectivity were also observed [106]. The impact of operational conditions has been analyzed for CO2 aromatization over Fe-based catalysts and the results are summarized in Table 3 . An increase in temperature improves the rates of the RWGS and FT reactions; however, paraffins are favored over olefins in the CO FT reaction, and the rate of hydrocracking of HCs over H-ZSM-5 improves at higher temperatures. Therefore, there is an increasing trend in CO2 conversion and paraffins/aromatics ratio at elevated temperatures. The production rate of aromatics will have its optimum value in the temperature range of 300−340 °C and is not favored at extremely lower or higher temperatures, because a lower temperature is unfavorable to reaction kinetics, while a higher temperature would reduce the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of aromatics [48,106,107,109]. At higher pressures, the reaction is favored thermodynamically, and an increase in surface carbon concentration is observed, leading to an enhanced rate of χ-Fe5C2 formation. Therefore, higher CO2 conversion and aromatics selectivity are obtained upon a pressure increase. However, due to the enhanced surface hydrogen concentration at extremely high pressures, C–H bond activation in the hydrogen transfer and dehydrogenation steps over H-ZSM-5 limit the aromatics selectivity in favor of non-aromatic C5+ hydrocarbons [87,106,107,109]. An increase in the WHSV decreases the residence time of the feed in the reaction zone, leading to lower CO2 conversion, lower paraffins and aromatics selectivity, and higher CO and olefin selectivity. On the other hand, longer contact times (shorter WHSVs) are not desired due to the over-hydrocracking of the produced aromatics [48,106,108]. Finally, increasing the H2/CO2 ratio typically enhances the CO2 conversion due to the availability of more surface hydrogen atoms [104,108]. Besides operational conditions, several catalyst-related parameters for Fe-based tandem catalysts have been studied and optimized. The Si/Al ratio in the H-ZSM-5 catalyst adjusts the density of acid sites in the catalyst, with higher ratios providing fewer acid sites. This trend is confirmed via different characterization techniques such as NH3-TPD, Al MAS NMR and FT-IR. Ramirez et al. reported a linear relationship between the production rate of paraffins with that of aromatics at different Si/Al ratios, showing that the H-transfer reaction of olefins plays a crucial role in the production of both species [107]. While higher Si/Al ratios lower aromatic and paraffin selectivity due to the reduced hydrogen transfer rate, excess acid sites lowers the stability of the catalyst through a greater extent of coke formation [104,107,108]. Studies on the impact of the Fe-catalyst/H-ZSM-5 mass ratio in the tandem catalyst show that the optimum results are obtained in the range of 1/1 to 1/3. Higher H-ZSM-5 fractions minimize C1-C4 hydrocarbons selectivity; on the other hand, maximum aliphatic C5+ selectivity is obtained at the ratio of 1/5, suggesting that the rate of the oligomerization reaction may be faster than that of the aromatization reaction. Furthermore, the hydrocracking of aromatics could occur in the presence of an excess amount of H-ZSM-5 in the composite catalyst [48,109]. The impact of the proximity between the two catalytic phases or functionalities has also been reported in the literature. Among the potential combinations are powder mixing, dual-bed, and two reactor setups. The optimal result has been obtained using a dual-bed setup that provides an effective spatial arrangement of the active sites. Closer proximities lead to the poisoning of H-ZSM-5 acid sites with mobile Na and K base sites, and the occurrence of the hydrogenation of oligomerization products, which are formed on the H-ZSM-5 surface, over the Fe-based sites to paraffins. On the other hand, larger separation of the catalyst components may limit the reaction performance thermodynamically due to an excessive concentration of the intermediate products that are produced on the Fe-based catalyst surface such as CO and olefins. With more spacing between the two types of sites, these intermediate chemicals may not efficiently be transformed to aromatics after being produced [48,104,107–109]. Finally, stability studies over different catalysts show that Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 tandem catalysts are typically stable across a wide range of times on stream, being tested from 40 h to 1000 h to date. A slight increase in olefins selectivity and decrease in aromatics and light paraffins (C2-C4) selectivity were observed over 100 h on stream [108]. This suggests that Fe-based catalysts are active over extended runs, but the H-ZSM-5 slightly deactivates due to minor coke formation, with XRD and NMR results showing no changes in crystallinity or other obvious structural changes for both catalysts. The presence of H2O and CO2, two chemicals that are typically used for H-ZSM-5 regeneration, in this system may be a contributing factor in achieving enhanced stability in these catalysts [48,104,106–109]."
8,Metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts,"4.2 Metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts The aromatization of CO2 via methanol intermediates over metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts is another proposed pathway described in the literature. Methanol is primarily formed over the metal oxide catalyst and then diffuses to H-ZSM-5 acidic sites where it is converted to aromatics via the well-known methanol to aromatics (MTA) process (Fig. 5 ). As mentioned in previous sections, the mismatch between the operating conditions of CO2 conversion to methanol and MTA reactions is a key challenge in the catalyst and process designs seeking to utilize this pathway. Inui et al. were among the first groups to use separate continuous reactors to overcome this issue [118]. In their setup, methanol was first synthesized on a Pd-modified metal-metal oxide (Cu-ZnO-Cr2O3-Al2O3-Ga2O3) catalyst packed in a reactor at 170 °C and 8 MPa. Gaseous products from this reactor were directly introduced to a second reactor, packed with H-Ga-silicate at 300 °C and 1.5 MPa. While the final gasoline selectivity reached 47%, the aromatics selectivity was only around 13%. Later, an In2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was investigated for the conversion of CO2 to gasoline via methanol intermediate by Gao and co-workers [119], where the aromatic selectivity was 8%. Wang and co-workers reported the use of a core-shell oxides of Fe-Zn-Zr@H-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to gasoline. The core-component, Fe-Zn-Zr oxide, mainly comprised of ZnFe2O4 spinel and ZrO2, was responsible for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, while the shell, H-ZSM-5, provided the aromatization functionality. The aromatic content in gasoline could be tuned from 5% to 92% by controlling the density of the Brønsted acid sites and the shell thickness of H-ZSM-5; however, the aromatics selectivity among all products did not exceed 9% [110]. The same group designed a similar core–shell catalyst composed of Fe-Zn-Zr oxides and a set of three zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-β, and H–Y) and obtained a significant amount of isoalkanes with negligible selectivity toward aromatics [120]. Recently, several highly selective metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts were developed for the direct CO2 aromatization reaction via methanol intermediates. The metal oxides in these studies included ZnAlOx, ZnO-ZrO2 and Cr-based catalysts. The catalytic performance of these catalysts is summarized in Table 4 and discussed in the following paragraphs. Ni and co-workers reported a tandem catalyst consisting of ZnAlOx with a spinel structure and H-ZSM-5 for this reaction [121]. Incorporation of Al into ZnO formed a cubic gahnite phase and reduced the hydrogenation ability of the material compared to pure ZnO, as confirmed by H2-TPR experiments. The decrease in hydrogenation ability aided the aromatization of olefin intermediates instead of their over-hydrogenation to paraffins. At 320 °C, 3.0 MPa and H2/CO2 ratio of 3, the ZnAlOx/H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed 32% aromatic selectivity at 9% CO2 conversion. Similar to the RWGS-FT pathway and the syngas aromatization reaction [48,106,108,128], the aromatics selectivity decreased with increased space velocity. As evidence for the occurrence of the CO2-methanol-aromatics pathway, methanol and DME were observed as the main products over the ZnAlOx catalyst in the absence of zeolite. ZnO-ZrO2 binary oxide catalyst prepared via the homogeneous incorporation of Zn2+ into the lattice matrix of ZrO2 has been reported as another effective option for this reaction [71,129]. The efficient performance of ZnO-ZrO2 as a high-temperature methanol synthesis catalyst was previously reported in syngas conversion studies with different topologies of zeolite that adjust the selectivity toward lower olefins or aromatics [81,94]. In those experiments, the selectivity of lower olefins and aromatics excluding CO2 reached around 80% over the ZnO-ZrO2/SAPO-34 and ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, respectively. The ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst has also been used in CO2 to methanol reactions by Wang and co-workers, providing a 90% methanol selectivity at 10% CO2 conversion at 320 °C and with an H2/CO2 ratio of 3 [71]. Later, the same group extended their work by developing a ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst for the aromatization of CO2 [122]. When carried out at 320 °C, 4 MPa, and H2/CO2 ratio of 3, a 41% aromatic selectivity at 14% CO2 conversion was obtained. Zhang et al. were able to obtain similar results using a ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalyst at different operational conditions [123]. To increase the formation rate of aromatics, Zhou and co-workers prepared superfine ZnO-ZrO2 nanoparticles through a combined sol-gel protocol and supercritical drying method (ae-ZnO-ZrO2) [124]. They obtained metal oxide particles with the mean size as small as 4.8 nm. The ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst displayed 50.2% aromatic selectivity at a CO2 conversion of 16% at 340 °C, 4 MPa and H2/CO2 ratio of 3, providing a production rate of 6.2 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h−1. So far, this is the highest aromatics formation rate reported for CO2 aromatization via methanol intermediates. The Cr oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are the other CO2 aromatization metal oxide-based tandem catalysts with encouraging results, according to the literature. The parent Cr2O3 has been studied for CO2 conversion by Wang and co-workers [125]. The methanol/DME selectivity reached around 97% at 14% CO2 conversion over the Cr2O3 catalyst at 350 °C and 3 MPa. When combined with H-ZSM-5, 41% aromatics selectivity at 34% CO2 conversion was obtained under the equivalent condition and the aromatics production rate reached 1.8 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h−1. Later, the same group used the ion-exchanged Zn-ZSM-5@SiO2 instead of H-ZSM-5 combined with Cr2O3, leading to a slight increase in the aromatics selectivity to 46%, while the p-xylene selectivity improved by a factor of 4 due to the coverage of the external surface area by non-acidic SiO2 [126]. Using the ZnCrOx/Zn-ZSM-5 catalyst, Zhang et al. obtained an aromatics selectivity of 15% at 20% CO2 conversion and the aromatics production rate of 0.6 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h-1 at 320 °C, 5 MPa and H2/CO2 ratio of 3 [127]. It was found that introducing a very small amount of Zn (0.16 wt%) to H-ZSM-5 by ion exchange was beneficial to the formation of aromatics by modulating the number of Lewis acid sites. Aside from the targeted methanol, CO was the main byproduct observed in this approach, likely formed via the RWGS reaction over the metal oxide phase. The selectivity to CO is beyond 35% over most of the metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts reported to date [121–127]. Therefore, suppressing the CO formation to enhance the aromatics formation efficiency in CO2 hydrogenation is an important goal in future development of this chemistry. Because of the thermodynamic reversibility of the RWGS reaction, one way to inhibit the CO formation is co-feeding CO to intervene in the RWGS reaction. The effect of different concentrations of CO on CO selectivity, with the CO/(CO2+CO) ratio varying from 0 to 64%, has been investigated over ZnAlOx/H-ZSM-5. It was found that the CO selectivity decreased approximately linearly as the CO/(CO2+CO) ratio increased. The CO selectivity decreased from 57% in the absence of CO feed to 13% when the CO/(CO2+CO) ratio was 64%; however, the aromatics selectivity slightly reduced over this range of CO concentration [121]. In addition, it was reported that the CO selectivity over ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 decreased from 34% to 5% after co-feeding 8% CO [124]. A similar trend was found over the Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [125]. Moreover, in situ consumption of generated CO can also reduce the CO selectivity. For example, feeding a CO2/H2 ratio of 1/9 reduced the CO selectivity by a factor of two compared to that of CO2/H2 ratio of 1/3. The hydrogenation of the CO in the former case is enhanced in the presence of excess H2 and corresponds to this reduced CO selectivity. Further increasing this ratio to 15 showed a slight decrease in CO selectivity with a significant reduction in aromatics formation rate [121]. Although several studies have reported the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol or hydrocarbons [130–134], to the best of our knowledge, there are no detailed kinetic studies for direct aromatization of CO2 over the metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 tandem catalysts published to date. Some groups have studied the effect of experimental parameters such as the reaction temperature and WHSV on CO2 aromatization over metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. For instance, Zhou and co-workers reported an increase in CO2 conversion at higher reaction temperatures over the ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [124]. However, the higher temperature enhances CO and paraffins preferentially, resulting in a reduction in the aromatics selectivity. Therefore, an optimum temperature likely exists for achieving the highest aromatics formation rate. Moreover, in studies with varying WHSVs, it was found that the aromatics selectivity increased with a decrease in the WHSV. Similar trends have been observed by other groups [121,122,124]. The correlation between the discussed operational conditions in this section and the reaction performance is summarized in Table 5 . To better describe this complex reaction networks for CO2 aromatization in the future, detailed kinetic studies are needed. As discussed in the section for Fe-based catalysts, the acidic properties of H-ZSM-5, the main contributor to the MTA reaction, have a profound effect on the aromatization of the intermediates produced from CO2. The effect of zeolite Si/Al ratio on this reaction has been investigated in the literature for the range of 20–120 [125]. By reducing this ratio from 120 to 40, a consistent increase in aromatics selectivity was observed. This suggests that the Brønsted acid site is the key contributor to aromatics formation and that too low density of acid sites is not preferred for aromatics formation. However, further increasing the acid site density of the catalyst to a Si/Al ratio of 20 reduced the aromatics selectivity, indicating that the presence of excess acid sites may lead to the over-hydrogenation of olefin intermediates to paraffins under the employed high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere or their oligomerization to coke. Similar studies have confirmed this volcano behavior of the aromatics selectivity upon changing the Si/Al ratio [122,123], producing an optimal Si/Al ratio. In addition, it is shown that there is an inverse relation between the Si/Al ratio and the presence of intermediate formate species. Recently, Sápi and co-workers used in-situ DRIFTS studies to show that increasing the acid density of H-ZSM-5 via reducing the Si/Al ratio can enhance the decomposition of formate species to CO via CO bond breaking [135]. The proximity of active sites in bifunctional catalysts is known to be a key factor in the catalytic performance [136]. In several studies, the proximity between the metal oxide and H-ZSM-5 sites was controlled by different mixing methods, mainly summarized as the dual-bed mixing, granule mixing, and powder mixing. Unlike Fe-based catalysts, where close proximities of the Fe-based and zeolite active sites are not desired due to a poisoning effect by alkali promoters on zeolite acid sites, the aromatic selectivity increased with closer active site proximity for the metal oxide systems. In all of the studies on this factor, the closest proximity, the powder mixing method, provided the highest aromatics and lowest C5+ non-aromatics selectivity [121,122,124,125]. These findings clarified that the formation of aromatic products from CO2 requires a specific synergy between the metal oxide and H-ZSM-5 active sites. H-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown marked deactivation in MTA reactions due to severe coke deposition after 10 h on stream [91]. However, in several cases where the CO2-methanol-aromatics reactions were run for at least 100 h, no significant deactivation was reported using metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts [121–125]. From XRD and SEM characterization of the fresh and used ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, it was found that there was no agglomeration in the used ZnO-ZrO2 particles. This confirmed the intrinsic stability of ZnO-ZrO2 under the deployed reaction conditions [122]. Additionally, the TGA and N2-physisorption results indicated scarce coke formation in the used Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts [125]. As mentioned in Section 2, the high-pressure H2 as a reactant can suppress the formation of polycyclic aromatics, which are some of the main species causing the deactivation of H-ZSM-5 in MTA reactions. Many efforts have been devoted toward improving the BTX selectivity in the MTA process due to the extensive potential applications of these products. Since the micropore size of H-ZSM-5 is smaller than the size of higher aromatics (C9+), it is accepted that the higher aromatics are formed from the alkylation of BTX on the acid sites present on the outer surface of H-ZSM-5. Therefore, covering these sites is an efficient way to suppress the alkylation reaction (Fig. 6 a). This has been examined by designing core-shell H-ZSM-5@silicalite-1 (S-1) catalysts [137–139]. The S-1 shell can cover most of the outer surface acid sites of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst. When this catalyst was used in MTA reactions, the BTX yield was significantly enhanced. The same strategy has been employed in the conversion of CO2 to aromatics. Compared to Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5, the Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5@S-1 catalyst displayed a slight decrease in CO2 conversion and aromatics selectivity, while the BTX selectivity in aromatic products clearly increased from 13% to 44% (Fig. 6b) [125]. Another method used to cover the outer acid sites is by passivating the catalyst by chemical liquid deposition (CLD) using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) [140]. The BTX selectivity increased by a factor of two after CLD treatment of H-ZSM-5 in the syngas to aromatic reaction [94]. Finally, upon H-ZSM-5 modification with TEOS, Ni and co-workers found that the p-xylene content in xylene increased from 20% to 58% [121]."
9,Mechanistic studies,
10,CO2 to olefins,"5.1 CO2 to olefins The thermodynamic stability of CO2 and high kinetic barriers of CC coupling have drawn much research attention to the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion to C2+ hydrocarbons. As mentioned earlier, in CO2 aromatization using Fe-based catalysts, there is a consensus that the governing mechanism for this reaction involves the RWGS reaction followed by FT reaction for producing olefins on the Fe-based sites, and aromatization reactions on the H-ZSM-5 sites. DFT studies in agreement with experimental data suggest that CO2 may initially either form stable carbonate intermediates on oxidized Fe3O4 domains followed by successive hydrogenations, or chemisorb onto 3F5 sites on χ-Fe5C2 or 3F4 sites on θ-Fe3C and undergo direct dissociation [141]. The produced CO is then hydrogenated to olefins (mostly C2-C4) over χ-Fe5C2 reduced domains. [104,142,143]. The formed olefins diffuse to H-ZSM-5 acid sites to participate in a series of oligomerization, cyclization, hydrogen transfer, and isomerization reactions to produce aromatics [52,104,106,107]. This pathway is shown in more detail in Fig. 7 a and c. The active sites for RWGS-FT reactions are suggested to be different phases of iron oxide and iron carbide [144,145], with current assignments being Fe3O4 and χ-Fe5C2 at relevant CO2 aromatization reaction conditions. These two phases are produced through the reduction treatment of Fe2O3, as confirmed by TPR studies. The relative populations and arrangement of these two types of sites appear to be key factors in obtaining the minimum CO selectivity and maximum CO2 conversion [104,106,146]. While Fe catalysts contain active sites for both RWGS and FT reactions, the addition of alkali metals, such as Na and K, enhances the rate of the CO FT reaction. This is thought to occur for three main reasons. First, χ-Fe5C2 formation is enhanced in the presence of alkali metals, with the carbon present in the χ-Fe5C2 obtained from RWGS and Boudouard reactions [81,108,147–149]. It has been confirmed by in-situ XRD studies that Fe-based catalysts do not contain χ-Fe5C2 sites prior to the beginning of the reaction; upon the formation of Fe-C bonds through the adsorption of CO2 and CO on the surface of the iron oxides, χ-Fe5C2 is progressively formed during the course of the reaction. The presence of optimum amounts of Na improves the C*/H* ratio by inhibiting the adsorption of H2, promoting the dissociation of CO on the surface, and enhancing the bond strength of Fe-C in favor of the formation of olefins [106,146]. Second, the addition of Na to Fe enriches the surface with electrons and increases the basicity of the catalyst; therefore, the adsorption of Lewis base olefins is weakened on the catalyst surface. The reduced adsorption on Fe-based sites minimizes the chances of olefin hydrogenation toward paraffins [48,150]. Third, improving the rate of the CO FT reaction upon the addition of Na drives the reaction toward a higher rate of consumption of CO and CO2, therefore enhancing the conversion of CO2 [104,106,151]. The chain-growth mechanism for FT synthesis on Fe5C2 (001) was investigated at the DFT-level by Jiao et al, who suggested that, for syngas mixtures, CH and CCO are the most favorable initial intermediates, and CO is the chain initiator while the carbide mechanism accounts for the chain propagation. This is in agreement with the suggested mechanism in Fig. 7a, where the RWGS reaction occurs on Fe3O4, and the FT reaction is catalyzed via χ-Fe5C2 sites. Additionally, CCO and CCH, and CCCO and CCCH are the main C2 and C3 intermediates, respectively. Oxygen hydrogenation to water must be facilitated mainly through OH disproportionation rather than hydrogenation to maintain surface stability and reactivity [152]. However, the χ-Fe5C2 state under different operating conditions may vary substantially, from the pure unreactive carbide to the pristine metallic state, where CO readily dissociates, depending on the gas-phase species chemical potentials. A stable dynamic system must be established, in which CO adsorption replenishes the carbide vacancies generated from surface C hydrogenation and participates in further oligomerization chain reactions or methane formation reactions [153,154]. The carbide mechanism, where catalyst constituents directly participate in the chemical reaction and are successively recovered, can be portrayed as analogous to the Mars-van Krevelen or redox mechanism associated with oxidation reactions on metal oxides [155–157]. Performing 2D 13C-13C MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy experiments, Ramirez et al. determined that the H-ZSM-5 surface was overwhelmed by alkylated aromatics, polyaromatics, olefins, and paraffins, with some surface adsorbed methoxy, methanol, and dimethyl ether species. Therefore, they claimed that in parallel to the RWGS-FT mechanism, the produced CO from the RWGS reaction could diffuse through the pores of H-ZSM-5 to produce surface formate and methoxy species, and then transform into olefins. Their proposed pathway, deemed the CO incorporation pathway, is shown in Fig. 7b [107]."
11,CO2 to methanol,"5.2 CO2 to methanol As described in section 4, in the metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 systems, metal oxides provide the active sites for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. It is widely suggested that the surface oxygen vacancies of metal oxides are the active sites for the activation of CO2 [72,119,158,159]. Zhou et al. quantified the density of oxygen vacancies in ZnO-ZrO2 by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement and found a direct correlation between the methanol/DME formation rate and the density of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 8 a) [124]. Several other experimental and DFT studies have confirmed that the adsorption of CO2 from one of its oxygen atoms into these vacancies and the subsequent formation of a negatively-charged bent CO2 is the rate-limiting step for methanol formation [71,124,159–161]. Wang et al. employed XPS analysis to identify the oxygen vacancies in Cr2O3, and they found that the co-feeding of CO was beneficial for the regeneration of oxygen vacancies to improve the CO2 conversion [125]. Whether the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol occurs through the formate (HCOO*) or carboxyl (COOH*) surface species is still under debate [23,24]. The current consensus is that HCOO* is present as one of the intermediates. Several groups have observed surface formate species during CO2 hydrogenation over metal oxides using in situ FT-IR. For instance, Wang and co-workers used the steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA)-FTIR to verify the possible intermediate species over ZnO-ZrO2 [71]. After introducing the CO2/H2 mixture, HCOO* (2878, 1595, 1382 and 1353 cm−1) and H3CO* (2931, 2824, and 1046 cm−1) species were observed (Fig. 8b), reaching a steady-state surface concentration at 30 and 90 min, respectively (Fig. 8c). It can be inferred that the H3CO* species is formed from the consecutive hydrogenation of HCOO*. The HCOO* species are also observed over the ZnAlOx [121], Cr2O3 [125], and ZnCrOx [127] catalysts. After switching the CO2/H2 feed to CO2/D2, the intensity of HCOO* and H3CO* peaks decreased, whereas the intensity of peaks for DCOO* and D3CO* increased. Meanwhile, in-situ MS studies showed that there is an inverse correlation between the amount of d-substituted methanol species and that of non-isotopic labeled methanol (Fig. 8c). This suggests that the HCOO* and H3CO* species are likely intermediates of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over the ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst. DFT calculations for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over the (101) surface of the tetragonal ZnO-ZrO2 model oxide were conducted by the same group. The two main reaction pathways, the formate and the CO pathways, were evaluated through free energy diagrams at 593 K. It was found that the formation of COOH* via the CO pathway is activated with energy barriers greater than 0.5 eV and is less exothermic compared to that of the HCOO* route via the non-activated formate pathway. Furthermore, COOH* is less stable than HCOO*. Therefore, the formate pathway is hypothesized to be more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable than the CO pathway [162]. Based on these findings, a formate reaction pathway for the aromatization of CO2 over ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 was proposed (Fig. 8d) [124]. The formate species are generated from the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO2 on the surface oxygen vacancies and are consecutively hydrogenated to methanol. The produced methanol is then converted to aromatics via the MTA process. More detailed kinetic studies are needed to identify the rate-determining step(s) (RDS) in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over these metal oxides."
12,Aromatization reaction,"5.3 Aromatization reaction Previous operando spectroscopy and microscopy catalytic studies have shown that the metal oxide and metal carbide species that are present during the CO2 conversion to olefins and methanol show negligible activity toward aromatics production in the temperature range of 250−400 °C [78,103,163–165]. As mentioned earlier, metal oxides provide the active sites for methanol and CO generation, while iron carbide species tend to follow the FT mechanism for the production of non-aromatic hydrocarbons. On the other hand, H-ZSM-5 is known as the active catalyst for the aromatization reactions. The main steps in the aromatization pathway via H-ZSM-5 catalyst are shown in Fig. 7c and are discussed in previous sections. The aromatization reaction involves multiple steps starting from methanol or olefins, eventually producing cycloalkenes or alkenes, with a simplified pathway for the conversion of cycloalkene intermediates to aromatics, along with their hydrocracking side-reactions to light hydrocarbons, shown in Fig. 9 [48]. Wang et al. proposed this mechanism to explain how the synergistic effect between the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites leads to the formation of carbenium ions using strong Lewis acid sites, followed by their subsequent dehydrogenation via Brønsted acid sites [48]. The occurrence of this sequence of primary steps leads to the formation of cyclodialkenes primarily; the repeat of these steps results in cyclodialkene conversion to aromatics. Additionally, the hydrocracking of cylcoalkenes takes place over Brønsted acid sites, implying that the excess Brønsted acid sites are not beneficial to aromatic selectivity. The simultaneous increase in olefins selectivity and decrease in aromatics and light paraffins selectivity during extended CO2 aromatization runs over a Na-Fe/H-ZSM-5 catalyst suggest that the hydrogen produced during the aromatization process could be an additional source for olefins hydrogenation to paraffins [106]. Several groups have studied the aromatization mechanism by feeding intermediate products over the sole H-ZSM-5 or H-ZSM-5 hybrid catalysts under a flow of different diluent gases and comparing the obtained results [48,122,166]. Wang and co-workers conducted separate experiments to study the methanol conversion over Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5 at 2 MPa pressure of CO2 and N2. It was found that the aromatic selectivity under CO2 was remarkably higher than that under N2 (Fig. 10 a). However, this phenomenon was not observed with the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, where the presence of either N2 or CO2 resulted in reduced aromatics selectivity compared to the case of the tandem catalyst. They speculated that the CO2 adsorbed on the Cr2O3 could accelerate the removal of H species formed from the dehydrogenative aromatization to improve the selectivity to aromatics [122,126]. This observation shows that the coupling interaction between the two catalysts plays an essential role in obtaining enhanced aromatics selectivity from CO2. A similar trend, shown in Fig. 10b, was observed while feeding 1-hexene over the Na-Fe@C/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, where the tandem catalyst under CO2 showed significant improvement in aromatics selectivity compared to the cases with the zeolite catalyst alone and/or with N2 as the carrier gas. Similarly, CO2 plays a role as H acceptor to enhance 1-hexene conversion to aromatics over Na-Fe@C/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [48,126]. This hypothesis complies with other studies that have shown ethylene and propylene provide a lower aromatics selectivity over the tandem catalyst while using N2 as the diluent gas compared to the aromatization of the typical CO2-H2 feed mixture [108,109]. The mechanistic description of the series of alkylation and oligomerization reactions linked to the conversion of methanol and olefins to long-chain hydrocarbons by zeolite-type catalysts has long been a subject of investigation. Recent studies on the methanol-to-olefins route appear to have reached a consensus that the predominant mechanism consists of the so-called carbon-pool mechanism [167]. This mechanism has been described by Bjorgen et al. in terms of two cycles, one involving aromatics and ethylene, and another propylene and longer-chain olefins [168,169]. DFT-based studies have focused on investigating the initiation reaction for the methanol-to-olefins route [170]. Plessow et al. built a simple two-step DFT-based kinetic model that described the autocatalytic nature of the initiation process, where methanol is dehydrogenated to CO with formaldehyde as an intermediate [171]. As for the mechanism of ethylene conversion to long-chain hydrocarbons, the complexity arises from the wide range of different elementary reactions that may occur between most of the intermediate species: oligomerization, cracking, aromatization, de/protonation, alkylation, isomerization, among others [172,173]. Semi-empirical kinetic models for these complex systems have recently been accomplished by applying the single-event microkinetic modeling approach [174]. Kumar et al. [175] and Jin et al. [176] applied this approach to propose and fit a reduced model to the methanol-to-olefins and ethylene oligomerization reactions, respectively. Pre-exponential factors were determined by statistical thermodynamics and transition state theory, whereas enthalpies and activation energies were estimated from experimental data. First-principles microkinetic studies are sparse in the literature and typically describe a particular subset of the elementary reactions in the conversion of methanol and short-chain olefins to aromatics. In addition to the improper representation of zeolite confinement domains and other topological effects, the well-mixed assumption on which the mean-field approximation stands disregards diffusive processes that may become dominant in nanoporous materials. The lack of proper representation of transport behaviors could be addressed by resorting to kMC models. However, the computational complexity of kMC and the need for accurate transport parameters have largely restricted their use in reactive systems to metal catalysts whose lattice domains are more easily depictable under reaction conditions, whereas, in the case of nanomaterials, they have mainly been employed for diffusive transport studies [177,178]. Despite the limitations of the mean-field approximation, descriptor-based catalytic activity trend analyses have been conducted by Wang et al. for metal-substituted aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates, showing that for the propene methylation reaction, the ammonia binding energy, which is a measure of catalyst acidity, is a suitable descriptor for estimation of catalytic activity [179]. A subsequent study by the same group borrowed the ammonia adsorption energy as a descriptor to build general scaling relations for other alkene-methanol reactions and considerably reduced the amount of required effort in DFT-based kinetic parameter calculations [180]. Wispelaere et al. further built a DFT-based microkinetic model for the methylation of benzene with methanol and dimethyl-ether on H-ZSM-5, and compared the results with experimental data in the absence of diffusion limitations. They evaluated the model at different reaction conditions and inferred that the ratio between stepwise and concerted methylation pathway predominance is reaction-condition dependent [181]. Given the widespread use of DFT kinetic parameters in the construction of first-principles microkinetic models, Plessow et al. assessed the accuracy of DFT in predicting trends in acidic zeolites using PBED-D3 and BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functionals, and they compared their results with the highly accurate ab-initio DLPNO−CCSD(T) method [182]. Their tests included 65 reaction intermediates and 130 transition states related to the methanol-to-olefins reaction. The results showed a systematic error for total energy estimation for both methods, with a mean absolute error of around 5 kJ/mol for energies related to transition states. They ultimately concluded that DFT can be utilized for the prediction of total energies and associated trends for zeolite structures. While all of the Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 CO2 aromatization studies in the temperature range of 250−400 °C have supported the RWGS-FT-M2 pathway for the CO2 aromatization reaction, Wang et al. proposed a different mechanism for this reaction at relatively higher temperatures (400−520 °C) using an H-ZSM-5-free Fe nanocatalyst. They used in-situ GC–MS to analyze intermediate products and increased the reaction temperature step-wise to observe the changing trend in the intensity of each chemical. They suggested that the active mechanism for this reaction involves the formation of carbon suboxide (C3O2) and mesitylene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) as the main intermediate products. This mechanism, shown in Fig. 11 , starts by RWGS and Boudouard reactions, the latter one being thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures [147], followed by CO conversion to C2O and C3O2. The produced C3O2 is suggested to undergo several hydrogenation and oligomerization steps to produce mesitylene. Finally, mesitylene participates in a series of demethylation and methyl migration steps to produce C6-C8 aromatics with maximum intensities in the temperature range of 500−520 °C. HRTEM and XRD studies showed a polycrystalline core-shell catalyst structure, with surface body centered cubic (bcc) Fe nanoparticles oxidizing to Fe3O4 during the experiments. These shell Fe3O4 nanoparticles are proposed as the active sites in this mechanism and protect the core Fe nanoparticles against oxidation. Furthermore, XPS analysis showed that unlike other studies on this reaction, an insignificant intensity of Fe(0) was present on the surface of the catalyst [53,183]."
13,Conclusions and outlook,"With the development of CO2 capture technologies and enhanced ability for producing H2 from renewable energy sources, the utilization of waste CO2 via hydrogenation by heterogeneous catalysis has attracted increasing interest. Aromatization of CO2 via the combination of (i) a CO2 hydrogenation catalyst and (ii) an intermediate aromatization catalyst is a promising way to reduce CO2 emissions and produce aromatic compounds with high industrial demand. This review highlights the state-of-the-art in tandem catalysis for CO2 aromatization. Tandem catalysts used for CO2 conversion to aromatic compounds are divided into two categories: (a) Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalyst systems and (b) metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. In Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 systems, the Fe-based catalysts are responsible for catalytic conversion of CO2 to olefins via RWGS reaction followed by FT synthesis. For the metal oxides/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the metal oxides (including ZnAlOx, ZnO-ZrO2, Cr2O3, and ZnCrOx) catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol/DME as the intermediate products. In both cases, H-ZSM-5 provides the active acid site and reaction environment needed for the aromatization of these intermediate products through oligomerization, cyclization, and multiple hydrogen transfer or dehydrogenation steps. An array of catalyst parameters such as the composition of Fe-based or metal oxide catalysts, the acidity of H-ZSM-5, and the synergy between the two components can affect the overall aromatics selectivity. Among the tandem catalysts used for CO2 aromatization, the best catalytic performance has been reported for a Na-ZnFeOx/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, with aromatics selectivity and CO2 conversion of 70% and 41%, respectively, resulting in a total aromatics yield of 29% [108]. A simplified economic assessment of the CO2 aromatization technology was performed to address the ballpark targets for aromatics yield to make this process and the consequent separations of the products economically practical. Captured CO2 and renewable-based H2 were the main reactants; toluene, water, CO, and ethane were taken as the main products, with toluene and ethane being considered as the representatives of aromatics and olefins/paraffins, respectively. The results indicate that in the most optimistic case, with the lowest foreseeable CO2 and H2 prices (50 and 1500 $/ton, respectively), and the highest potential selling prices of toluene and ethane (1000 and 800 $/ton, respectively), the lower bound acceptable yield of toluene is 46%. Capital costs are not considered in these calculations; therefore, this minimum yield will not necessarily make this technology economically feasible, but it provides an initial target. Furthermore, assuming a 100% yield of the carbon to aromatics, the carbon price must not exceed 340 $/ton of CO2 to make renewable aromatics prices competitive with their similar fossil-based products. This price is higher than the range of 25–230 $/ton anticipated for post-combustion and DAC technologies in the future [19,184–189], providing motivation for future CO2 aromatization studies. Fig. 12 provides a comparison among the performances of aromatization reactions using different feedstocks. For a fair comparison among the reactions, the performance is reported on the basis of mgaromatics gcatalyst −1 h−1. The CO2 aromatics formation rates are converted from the data reported in Table 2 and Table 4. Among the two pathways discussed for CO2 aromatization, the Fe-based catalysts pathway typically provides higher CO2 conversion and aromatics formation rates. Among different studies represented in this figure, the propane aromatization reaction provides the highest aromatics formation rate [190–194]; however, it is noted that this reaction needs to be operated at relatively high temperatures (> 500 °C), which increases the operational cost for industrial processes. The CO2 aromatization reaction possesses a relatively lower conversion with respect to most of the other aromatization reactions. However, the aromatization rate for this reaction is still higher than the well-studied methane aromatization reaction [195–199], and close to those for CO [103,165,200–202] and methanol [90,91,98,203,204] aromatization reactions. This suggests a higher aromatics selectivity and/or optimum space velocity for this reaction compared to the other three processes. Considering (i) the current comparative performance of this process, (ii) novelty of the field with respect to the other aromatization reactions, and (iii) the low CO2 cost compared to the other feedstocks, further investigations of this reaction route are worthwhile. The single-pass CO2 conversion is relatively low in all of the reported studies, and therefore it needs to be improved by catalyst and process design approaches for future commercialization purposes. Furthermore, efficient separation of all products, byproducts, and unreacted materials is a key factor in improving the economics of this process. The byproducts of CO2 aromatization can be divided into two main categories, gaseous and liquid. The gaseous byproducts include CO, methane, and C2-C4 paraffins and olefins; the liquid byproducts include H2O and C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons. Among the gaseous byproducts, methane is regarded as the most undesired dead-end byproduct because of its inertness and low commercial value. CO, as the main side product formed via the RWGS reaction, can be used as a syngas component for further use or incorporated into value-added chemicals via carbonylation reactions. The C2-C4 paraffins can be used in cracking, isomerization, and alkylation processes to produce different chemicals. The C2-C4 olefins are key building blocks for producing plastics, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, and are the most useful products among the gaseous byproducts. The separation of these gaseous byproducts is a challenging issue. Advanced membranes could help to reduce the costs of separation and purification of these high-value gas byproducts. Among liquid byproducts, water can be easily separated due to its extremely different polarity from aromatics. C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons will have carbon numbers mostly below 11 because of the shape-selective behavior of H-ZSM-5. These chemicals may be used as a clean gasoline fuel mixture in the automobile industry upon separation from other liquid compounds. Direct CO2 aromatization processes with tandem catalysts have some limitations in catalyst and process design compared to indirect aromatization processes operating via two separately optimized reactors. For instance, there is a very narrow temperature range in which both catalyst functionalities are active for the relevant reactions. As such, several catalyst options for methanol or olefins synthesis are generally thought to be not applicable for direct aromatization. Moreover, some reaction parameters offer complicated trade-off behaviors at different conditions. For example, while the water improves the catalytic aromatization selectivity of ethylene due to its competition for adsorption on the surface of H-ZSM-5 acid sites that contribute to hydrogenation reactions to paraffins [122], an excess concentration can thermodynamically limit the CO2 hydrogenation reactions from moving forward [205,206]. Therefore, the presence of water is beneficial to the reaction, but only up to a certain extent. While the effect of water addition to the feed has been studied for ethylene aromatization reaction over H-ZSM-5 catalysts [122], this effect has not been explored yet for the CO2 aromatization studies. Overall, the direct aromatization process may one day provide advantages over the indirect process that could outweigh its drawbacks. Chief among these is the potential for cost and energy savings upon deployment of the tandem-reaction process-intensification approach. Other potential advantages include the presence of CO2 as a “hydrogen acceptor” to improve the aromatics selectivity through enhancing the removal of hydrogen species formed from dehydrogenative aromatization, relative to conventional MTA reactions using inert carrier gases. Additionally, the presence of H2 would help alleviate the coke formation to enhance the stability of the catalyst. Finally, the use of two separate reactors in an indirect process deprives the system of potential thermodynamic advantages such as in-situ consumption of intermediate products occurring in the direct process. A comparison of the best tandem catalysts, one from each family of catalysts, shows a significantly higher aromatics formation rate over Fe-based/H-ZSM-5, with the maximum value of 40 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h−1 [109], compared to that of the metal oxide/H-ZSM-5, optimized at 6 mmolCO2 gcat −1 h−1 [166]. There is a consensus that the oxygen vacancies in metal oxides are the corresponding sites for CO2 activation. Hence, in future studies, optimizing the density of these sites by using heteroatom doping, enlarging the specific surface area, and optimization of reduction treatments could be employed for enhancing the aromatics formation rate in these catalysts. Moreover, intensifying the synergy between the two components in the bifunctional catalyst can be an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity. For example, size-controlled Pt nanoparticles loaded on H-ZSM-5 boosted the CO2 conversions activity compared to pure H-ZSM-5 about 16 times due to the synergetic effect between the Pt and H-ZSM-5 [135]. Furthermore, the selectivity of the main byproduct of this system, CO, which originates from the RWGS reaction, can be controlled at values below 10% over Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. However, the CO selectivity over the metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalyst has not been reported below ∼35%, since metal oxides do not provide ideal functionality for the CO FT reaction at high reaction temperatures (>300 °C). As a result, the produced CO does not effectively participate in further reactions as an intermediate product. Although cofeeding CO can suppress the formation of CO by intervening in the RWGS reaction thermodynamically, optimizing the rate of the RWGS reaction through a catalyst-design approach may be more desired for practical purposes. On the other hand, metal oxides benefit from several advantages compared to the Fe-based catalysts. First, the methane selectivity over metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is usually less than 0.5% in most studies, a value remarkably lower than that of typical Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Although some efforts have been devoted to reducing the methane selectivity over Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts through alkali modification, the methane selectivity is still more than 4% in most studies. Therefore, one of the main aspects on which to focus for future studies of Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts would be reducing the methane selectivity. In addition, the aromatics content in the liquid products over metal oxide/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is higher than over Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, indicating a more efficient aromatization performance over H-ZSM-5 sites in the former catalysts. The inferior aromatization performance in Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts mainly originates from the longer path length between the Fe-based sites and H-ZSM-5 sites since a more separated, dual bed structure has been shown to perform better for the Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. This is a consequence of the poisoning effect between the basic and acidic sites of this hybrid catalyst at close active site proximities [207]. A higher aromatics selectivity in the liquid products is of more interest when it comes to the purification of aromatics for commercialization purposes. On the other hand, the superior performance in the dual-bed structure with the Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 catalyst provides an opportunity for creating a temperature gradient reactor design to optimize the performance of the reaction. Optimization of aromatics selectivity can be achieved by studying different design aspects in the H-ZSM-5 catalysts, such as type, intensity, and placement of acid sites. A summary of the catalytic parameters that are studied thus far for both families of catalysts are summarized in Table 6 . The ratio of Si/Al in H-ZSM-5 can be adjusted as a representative for the acid sites density. As shown in previous sections, the Fe-based catalysts provide optimum aromatization performance with H-ZSM-5 catalysts that have a lower Si/Al ratio; thus a higher acid density, compared to the metal-oxide catalysts. This is mainly due to the higher rate of CO2 conversion to olefins in Fe-based catalysts compared to the rate of CO2 conversion to methanol in the metal oxide catalysts, requiring a higher density of active sites for the aromatization of the intermediate product in the Fe-based catalysts. Besides optimizing the Si/Al ratio, NaOH treatments have been used to adjust the intensity and type of acid sites of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst. While strong Brønsted acid sites are less desired due to the potential for aromatics hydrocracking reactions toward paraffins [48,208], the synergy between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and their placement on the internal/external surface of the H-ZSM-5 structure has not been investigated in detail yet for this reaction. Furthermore, the diffusion-path length for intermediate products is an important parameter that likely impacts the conversion of intermediate products toward both desired aromatics as well as undesired isomerization and hydrocracking reactions. This parameter becomes more critical for tandem catalysts involving a microporous material like H-ZSM-5. Some studies have tried to address this issue by alkali treatment of H-ZSM-5 to extract silicon atoms and form H-ZSM-5 particles with hollow structures [48,108]. The resulting hierarchical zeolite structure not only tunes the nature and location of acid sites (e.g. internal, in mesopores, or on the external surface of zeolites), but also creates a hollow structure that increases the surface area of zeolite and reduces the diffusion path length. However, despite the superior catalytic performance, there are disadvantages to using this technique. Chief among these are the heterogeneity of the zeolite, including the creation of varying types of acid sites, and acid/base poisoning occurring at high alkali concentrations. Therefore, investigation of other techniques that could be used for reducing the diffusion path length via a more controlled synthesis approach could provide further enhanced catalytic behavior. Since the production of BTX aromatics is favored due to their versatile commercial applications, developing methods to enhance the selectivity toward these specific products is of interest. Covering the zeolite external surface via deposition of a SiO2 layer has been shown to provide some improvement in the selectivity to BTX in the aromatic products [106,108,121,126,209]. However, the limited acidity of the internal surface of the catalyst and possible narrowing of the pore mouths during the silylation process limit the conversion of intermediate methanol or olefins. In the Fe-based/H-ZSM-5 system, covering of the external surface may relieve the adverse poisoning effect of alkali metals from the Fe-based component on H-ZSM-5. Therefore, further studies on the zeolite passivation techniques may be warranted. Additionally, it is noted that MFI zeolites have been primarily used for the tandem reactions to date. MFI structures are known to be highly efficient for aromatization reactions, and thus their predominance is not surprising. Nonetheless, there are now hundreds of zeolite topologies available, and the potential for tuning the tandem reactions through the utilization of alternate zeolite topologies remains mostly unexplored. Besides the catalyst design modifications, comprehensive kinetic studies exploring the reaction pathways for this multistep reaction are essential. Aside from the RWGS-FT and methanol-intermediate routes, CO2 can be converted into aromatics through other pathways as well. For instance, besides a singular study on the carbon suboxide-mesitylene pathway discussed in the mechanism section [53], CO2 aromatization can also be conducted via methanation followed by CH4 aromatization in two individual, but connected reactors [47]. Nevertheless, none of the above alternative mechanisms have yet resulted in a high-selectivity CO2 aromatization process. Moreover, it is noted that the methylated aromatic compounds can be obtained by coupling the CO2-to-methanol catalyst and aromatics-alkylation catalysts [210]. Thus, the possibility of CO2 conversion into methylated aromatics via this process pathway could also be further investigated. There are numerous and substantial challenges with first-principles driven catalyst design for tandem CO2-to-aromatics catalysts that have likely led to the limited number of theoretical studies. In the case of iron and cobalt-based catalysts, DFT calculations must take into consideration spin-polarization and ensuing magnetic properties, as well as encompassing all thermodynamically feasible oxide/carbide phases under varying reaction conditions. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts and supported multi-component catalysts often have ambiguous active sites, making it difficult to determine an appropriate atomistic model. DFT supercell simulations for zeotype catalysts must account for long-range dispersive interactions; hence, an appropriate choice of exchange-correlation functional that includes van der Waals interactions is necessary. In addition, zeolites often contain many different adsorption sites and more entropic contributions, requiring advanced techniques for sampling adsorption geometries and computing free energies [211,212]. The computational challenges are compounded by complex reaction mechanisms, dynamic surfaces, and the importance of transport and conversion. The full pathway from CO2 to aromatics contains hundreds, if not thousands of possible intermediates, spectators, and side products, making it difficult to identify the most meaningful simulations. The high operating pressures suggest that the coverage of intermediates and spectators will be high. High-coverage first-principles microkinetic simulations suffer from inaccuracies originating from the effect of lateral interactions in stabilization or destabilization of key intermediate species. Kinetic Monte Carlo, or coverage-dependent mean-field models may be necessary to simulate such non-ideal scenarios in which surface diffusion and surface interactions play a major role in determining the global kinetics, but parameterization of these models requires substantial computational effort [177]. Moreover, time-on-stream can also lead to significant state alterations for catalysts that present dynamic and synergistic behaviors, which may preclude any static kinetic analysis. Different catalyst active-site domains, successive chain-reactions, and surface diffusion add additional layers of complexity to the microkinetic modeling of this reaction. The importance of transport, conversion, and selectivity also indicates that kinetic models will need to be integrated with transport and process models to obtain results that can be directly compared to experiments [177]. Ultimately, the tandem-catalytic conversion of CO2 to aromatics is a complex system that couples different classes of catalysts, multiple active sites domains, diffusive processes, and complex chained reaction networks where the atomic and electronic structure of the catalyst are computationally expensive to calculate and challenging to experimentally characterize. The catalyst surface state and its associated surface thermochemistry are also dependent on the reaction environment, necessitating the use of in-situ and operando techniques to characterize the system, and integration of kinetic models with process models to calculate meaningful metrics like selectivity and yield to support process design. Nonetheless, a single process for conversion of CO2 to BTX is an intriguing route to addressing the global problem of carbon capture and utilization. Separating the problem into simpler model systems to gain fundamental understanding, leveraging data science to integrate diverse sets of experimental and computational data, and applying machine learning to elucidate patterns in the complex reaction network and accelerate computational simulations are promising approaches for solving this daunting challenge at the intersection of catalyst science and reaction engineering."
