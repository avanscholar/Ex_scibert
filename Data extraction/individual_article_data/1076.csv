0,Introduction,"It has long been recognized that in lichens, tolerance to extreme environmental conditions has a classical aspect, where lichens can survive in extreme environments on earth, such as arctic tundra, deserts, rocky habitats, and an extremophilic aspect, where lichens could tolerate conditions beyond the extreme conditions in which they naturally occur, such as conditions that have not been recorded in terrestrial environments. In both respects, lichens can live in extreme conditions where none of their symbiotic partners could live independently. Lichens have been suggested for several biotechnological applications, like the bioplastic degradation and prevention of desertification (Oksanen, 2006), following the classical aspect of tolerance. Nevertheless, whether lichens maintain their biotechnological potentialities according to the previously mentioned extremophilic aspect remains an open question and this second aspect is examined in the current article. Nowadays, it has been recognized that the classical description of lichens as a union of a heterotrophic fungal partner (in most cases an ascomycete) and a photosynthetic partner (in most cases green algae or a cyanobacterium) is incomplete. Recent studies verify lichens as multi-symbiotes, i.e., complex multi-species associations including bacteria and other fungi or algae, even yeasts (Spribille et al., 2016; Onuț-Brännström et al., 2018; Tuovinen et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020; Leiva et al., 2021; Grimm et al., 2021), while in other studies, lichens are considered as a micro-ecosystem (Farrar, 1976; Wrzosek et al., 2017; Parasyri et al., 2018). In the symbiotic approach, each partner contributes to the association e.g. providing shelter, providing organic carbon or nitrogen in case of cyanobacteria, while in the micro-ecosystem approach, the interactions among participants and their environment, as an integrated system, take place through the factors that regulate the pools and fluxes of materials and energy through separate systems (ChapinIII et al., 2011). For example, from the symbiosis perspective, the photobiont produces sugar alcohols (e.g. ribitol, erythritol, sorbitol, and other polyols), which reach the fungal partner by diffusion, and serve as a source of carbohydrates for it. The fungal partner, on the other hand, partly converts the carbohydrates into mannitol for storage via the pentose phosphate pathway, as polyols are washable, and wash out of the thallus during rewetting after drought stress (Eisenreich et al., 2011; Eymann et al., 2017). On the other hand, from the micro-ecosystem perspective, polyols play a central role as osmoregulatory compounds during the wetting and drying cycles of the thallus, keeping water in the cells, protecting the proteins under dry stress conditions, and preventing uncontrolled water flux and cell damage, by their washing out, in the rewetting phase. In the absence of stomata, lichens are poikilohydric organisms unable to maintain and regulate their thallus water content. Therefore, they can repeatedly tolerate fluctuations in cellular water content between saturation (more than 150% water content per dw) and desiccation (less than 20% and in other cases less than 5% water content per dw). Lichens in the dehydrated stage are rather tolerant. Lichens can persist under the coldest, hottest, and driest conditions on Earth, and even under the conditions found on the highest altitudes. Studies have shown the survivability of dehydrated lichens under simulated or real extreme conditions, such as vacuum (10−7 to 10−4 Pa) (Horneck et al., 2010), cosmic ionizing radiation (up to 190 mGy) (Berger et al., 2012), fluctuations of temperature (−21.5 °C to +59.6 °C) (Rabbow et al., 2012) and solar extraterrestrial electromagnetic radiation (up to 6.34·108 J m−2) (Onofri et al., 2012). Furthermore, the viability and germination capacity of lichens were not significantly affected when exposed to vacuum and ultraviolet radiation (de Vera et al., 2003). Additionally, lichens can produce molecular hydrogen (H2) (Papazi et al., 2015). In a closed system, it is mainly the fungal partner that consumes oxygen (Ο2) through the respiratory procedure, thus establishing anoxic conditions. Oxygen depletion enables the activation of the oxygen-sensitive hydrogenase enzyme possibly of the photobiont partner, which produces H2 main through the dark fermentation pathway (Papazi et al., 2015). This desiccation tolerance of lichens, as well as their tolerance to radiation and extreme temperatures have been the key reasons for proposing lichens as the living system most likely to resist the extreme conditions of outer space (Sancho et al., 2008), while relatively recently the ability of lichens to produce H2 has been added (Papazi et al., 2015) constituting lichens an ideal model for future astrobiotechnological applications and bio-regeneration system development in extraterrestrial environments (Parasyri et al., 2018). Lichens have also recently been included as part of the biological material in open space experiments and the results revealed that they could stay alive in space despite being completely exposed to massive UV and cosmic radiation (Sancho et al., 2007), thus paving the way for new experiments on the polyextremophilic behavior of lichens in combination with their metabolic capacity to produce H2. The main objective of the present contribution was to investigate if the polyextremophilic behavior of lichens both in dehydrated and in regenerated form, under extreme conditions not necessarily recorded on Earth, is compatible with their biotechnological uses. Especially, we investigated the biotechnological use of the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum to produce high amounts of H2 after exposure to extreme UVB radiation and extremely low and high temperatures (−196°C or +70 °C), paving the way for astrobiotechnological applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,The lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum,"2.1 The lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum The lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum was used in our experiments. This lichen was collected from Acer sempervirens and Quercus coccifera substrates of Mountain Idi, Crete, Greece (HTRS07/TM07 X = 578576.83 m, Y = 1900901.19 m). More specifically, Pleurosticta acetabulum is the result of the symbiotic relationship between an Ascomycota fungus and a unicellular green alga of the genus Trebouxia. Morphologically, the lichen is leaf-shaped and has a dark green-brown color in its metabolically inactive state, however, when regenerated, its color turns light green."
3,Tissue treatments,"2.2 Tissue treatments The dehydrated and regenerated lichen was exposed to high intensity UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2 = 1000 J m−2 min−1) for various time intervals, using the UVB radiation system VL-6M from Vilber Lourmat (Marne La Vallee, France) under constant temperature (25 °C) and visible light intensity (2 μmol m−2 s−1). For the measurements of the UVB intensity used the radiometer VLX3W from Vilber Lourmat (Marne La Vallee, France). The dehydrated lichen was exposed to UVB radiation for 4 h (240 KJ/m2), 20 h (1200 KJ/m2) and 70 h (4200 KJ/m2), while the regenerated lichen was exposed for 20 h to the same UVB intensity (RUVB20h treatment). Afterwards, the samples were regenerated in both cases. Moreover, we also studied the combined exposure of the lichen to high intensity UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2) for 70 h (4200 KJ/m2) and extreme temperatures (−196 °C or +70 °C) for one hour. The corresponding treatments are the UVB70h/−196°C and UVB70h/+70°C ones. In all cases, the lichens were regenerated in water for 48 h under constant temperature (25 °C) and light intensity (10 μmol m−2 s−1). A dehydrated lichen sample regenerated in water for 48 h without any exposure to stress conditions served as the control treatment to which all the previous treatments were compared."
4,Fluorescence induction measurements (OJIP-test),"2.3 Fluorescence induction measurements (OJIP-test) The Handy Plant Efficiency Analyser (Handy PEA, Hansatech Instruments, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) was used to estimate the molecular structure and function of the lichen photosynthetic apparatus. During photosynthesis, only part of the photon energy absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments is used in the photosynthetic process, while the rest is emitted in the form of heat or fluorescence. This method is based on the measurement of a fast fluorescence transient with a 10 μs resolution in a period of 40 μs to 1 s. The fluorescence was measured at 12-bit resolution and the photosynthetic apparatus was excited by three light-emitting diodes that provided red light of the saturated light intensity of 3000 μmol m−2 s−1. A series of photosynthetic parameters and the photosynthetic efficiency, expressed as Fv/Fm, were measured according to the OJIP method (Strasser and Strasser, 1995; Strasser and Srivastava, 1995). It is known that the fluorescence induction measurements and especially the Fv/Fm parameter are the best ways to check the stress status of a photosynthetic organism (Navakoudis et al., 2003; Sfichi et al., 2004; Sfakianaki et al., 2006; Demetriou et al., 2007)."
5,"GC-TCD measurements of H2, O2 and N2","2.4 GC-TCD measurements of H2, O2 and N2 The ability of lichens to produce H2 after exposure to extreme conditions was tested transferring carefully 2 g (dry weight) of lichens samples into 125 mL hermitically sealed bottles (diameter 5 cm, height 9.5 cm) with an initial volume of 10 mL sterilized water. Then, the bottles were placed sideways in a temperature-controlled chamber (25 °C) at a light intensity of approximately 10 μmol m−2 s−1. Hydrogen, oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) measurements were made utilizing gas chromatography, using a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) (Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus, Kyoto, Japan). To separate H2 and O2, argon was used as the carrier gas under pressure of 5 bar and at oven temperature of 120 °C. The separation of gases is based on their different thermal conductivity. The temperature of the TCD was set at 200 °C for the detector and at 180 °C for the injector (Papazi et al., 2015). The quantification of H2 and O2 was accomplished by injecting known quantities in the GC-TCD and designing a reference curve."
6,Data analysis,2.5 Data analysis Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times and each treatment included 3 independent samples. Standard deviations of the average values are presented in the diagrams.
7,Results,
8,Lichen tolerance to extreme UVB radiation,"3.1 Lichen tolerance to extreme UVB radiation The lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum was studied with regard to its tolerance against extreme UVB radiation and, for this reason, it was exposed to a UVB radiation of 1.7 mW/cm2 (1000 J m−2 min−1). More specifically, the lichen was exposed to UVB radiation for 4 h (UVB4h - 240 KJ/m2), 20 h (UVB20h - 1200 KJ/m2) and 70 h (UVB70h - 4200 KJ/m2) and subsequently a regeneration attempt was made. The level of lichen regeneration was measured by assessing the molecular structure and function of the photosynthetic mechanism. These measurements were made for the Control, UVB4h, UVB20h and UVB70h samples using fluorescence induction measurements. Fig. 1A shows the fluorescence induction curves for each sample after 48 h of regeneration. Each curve follows the characteristic shape of the OJIP curve, which indicates the good structure and function of the photosynthetic mechanism in all samples without exception. Fluorescence induction curves (Fig. 1A) as well as the efficiency of the photosynthetic mechanism expressed as Fv/Fm (Fig. 1B) reflect the state of the photosynthetic mechanism and consequently the viability of the lichen. In addition, comparative kinetics diagrams of Fv/Fm are presented (Fig. 1C). Finally, according to the presented results of Fig. 1A, B and C, the UVB treatments UVB4h, UVB20h and UVB70h do not differ substantially from the control treatment; namely, the exposure of the lichen to extreme UVB radiation did not affect the lichen’s metabolism."
9,The ability of H2 production by the lichen after its exposure to extreme UVB radiation,"3.2 The ability of H2 production by the lichen after its exposure to extreme UVB radiation Since the results showed that the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum appears to be resistant to extreme UVB radiation, we tried to investigate if the lichen retains its ability to produce H2 even after its exposure to the extreme intensities of UVB radiation. The GC-TCD profiles of Fig. 2 show a comparison of H2 production by the regenerated lichens of the Control, UVB4h, UVB20h and UVB70h treatments. The first measurement was taken at the beginning of the incubation period (0 days), the second one after 3 days and the third one after 6 days of incubation in a closed system (Fig. 2). The results showed a dramatic reduction in oxygen levels from the 3rd day onwards, which allowed the activation of the hydrogenase and consequently the production of H2. There was no significant difference in the amount of H2 produced compared to the control (Control), and the amount of H2 in all treatments appeared to be similar, even on the sixth day of incubation, despite the heterogeneity of the lichen structure. This means that the lichen was not only resistant to the extreme UVB stress, but it also fully retained its ability to produce H2 after the UVB stress, even without the exogenous addition of any organic matter."
10,Testing the resistance of the regenerated lichen to extreme UVB radiation,"3.3 Testing the resistance of the regenerated lichen to extreme UVB radiation Since the lichen was found to be resistant to extreme UVB radiation in a dehydrated state, we also examined the resistance of the regenerated lichen (metabolically active lichen) to extreme UVB radiation. More specifically, a lichen sample that had been regenerated in water for 48 h was exposed to UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2 = 1000 J m−2 min−1) for 20 h (1200 KJ/m2) (RUVB20h treatment). In this case, fluorescence induction measurements were performed as described previously for a period of 48 h, immediately after the exposure to UVB radiation. Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence induction curves. Compared to the corresponding control curve, the RUVB20h curve showed that the photosynthetic mechanism had been stressed, but had not collapsed (Fig. 3A). Moreover, fluorescence induction measurements of the RUVB20h sample showed a decreased photosynthetic efficiency expressed as Fv/Fm (Fig. 3B) reflecting a stress situation. Additionally, the kinetics of the photosynthetic efficiency parameter Fv/Fm during the regeneration period (Fig. 3C) clearly showed the existence of stress in the RUVB20h treatment compared to the control treatment, but indicated no damage to the photosynthetic mechanism."
11,The ability of H2 production by the regenerated lichen after its exposure to extreme UVB radiation,"3.4 The ability of H2 production by the regenerated lichen after its exposure to extreme UVB radiation We aimed to study whether the regenerated lichen, despite being under stress, retained its ability to produce H2 even after the RUVB20h treatment. We examined the lichen’s capacity for H2 production over the course of six days long experiments using thermal conductivity gas chromatography (GC-TCD). The following graphs (GC-TCD profiles) show the comparative H2 production by the Control and RUVB20h samples. The first measurement was taken at the beginning of the incubation period (0 days), the second one after 3 days and the third one after 6 days of incubation in a closed system, as described in the Materials and Methods section ( Fig. 4). The results indicated that the regenerated lichen exposed to extreme UVB radiation retained its ability to produce H2 when placed in a closed system. From the third day onwards, there was a dramatic reduction in oxygen levels and this allowed the activation of the hydrogenase, which consequently resulted in the high production of H2. However, the stress recorded in the RUVB20h treatment (Fig. 3) resulted in a marginally lower H2 production (10–20%) compared to the control (Fig. 4)."
12,The combined exposure of lichens to extreme UVB radiation and extreme temperatures,"3.5 The combined exposure of lichens to extreme UVB radiation and extreme temperatures In order to study the combined exposure of lichens to extreme UVB radiation and extreme temperatures, we initially tested the temperature range tolerance of the lichen. Lichen samples were exposed for one hour to various temperatures from −196 °C to +70 °C (−196 °C, −86 °C, −20 °C, +5.7 °C, +25 °C, +60 °C and +70 °C). The fluorescence induction measurements (Fv/Fm) after 48 h regeneration showed that the lichen was regenerated successfully without substantial functional changes ( Fig. 5). Additionally, the kinetics of the photosynthetic efficiency parameter Fv/Fm during the regeneration time confirmed the temperature tolerance of lichens in an approximately 270 °C range, from −196 °C to +70 °C ( Fig. 6). In order to study the extremophilic behavior of lichens further, we examined their viability after combined exposure to extreme UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2) for 70 h, and to extremely low and high temperatures (−196 °C or +70 °C). Thus, dehydrated lichen samples were exposed to UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2) for 70 h and afterwards one was placed in an oven (+70 °C) for 1 h (UVB70h/+70°C), while the other was incubated in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for 1 h (UVB70h/−196°C). Finally, an attempt was made to regenerate the lichens for 48 h (as in the previous experiments) and fluorescence induction measurements were taken to check the condition of the photosynthetic mechanism of the lichens. Fig. 7A shows the fluorescence induction curves after 48 h of lichen regeneration. The control curve follows the characteristic OJIP curve shape, indicating the good structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus. Both the UVB70h/+70°C and UVB70h/−196°C treatments also follow the OJIP curve shape, albeit less closely. However, the sample UVB70h/+70°C exhibited little stress on the photosynthetic mechanism. As shown in Fig. 7B in regards to the UVB70h/+70°C treatment, it appears that the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) decreased compared to the corresponding control values. Furthermore, the UVB70h/−196°C treatment showed that the Fv/Fm values do not differ considerably from those of the control. The Fv/Fm kinetics during the regeneration time confirmed the above results (Fig. 7C), which showed that the combined exposure of lichens to extreme UVB radiation and extremely low and high temperatures did not substantially affect the functionality of the lichen."
13,The ability of the lichen to produce H2 after exposure to extreme UVB radiation and extreme temperatures,"3.6 The ability of the lichen to produce H2 after exposure to extreme UVB radiation and extreme temperatures The method used to examine the lichen’s capacity for H2 production in the UVB70h/+70°C and UVB70h/−196°C treatments was the same as that of the previous treatments and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 clearly shows that all treatments (Control, UVB70h/+70°C and UVB70h/−196°C) maintained their ability to produce H2. The UVB70h/+70°C treatment exhibited a slight decrease in the amount of H2 produced by the sixth day of incubation compared to that of the control, probably due to the stress the lichen had undergone under this extreme high temperature. However, by the sixth day, the UVB70h/−196°C treatment had produced the same amount of H2 as the Control. This means that the lichen had not lost its ability to produce H2 after its combined exposure to extreme conditions of UVB radiation and extreme temperatures."
14,Discussion,"Almost all known biotechnological applications have been designed under stable and regulatable conditions. In recent years, efforts have been made in order to develop biotechnological applications suitable also for inhospitable environments, both terrestrial (e.g. Antarctica, the North Pole) and extraterrestrial (e.g. settlement on other planets such as Mars). Therefore, this work focuses on biotechnological applications for energy production (H2 production) in extreme environmental conditions through simple biochemical engineering production systems (lichens) without the need of materials, infrastructure or energy for their operation and maintenance. In the present study, we examined the polyextremophilic behavior of the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum, both in its dehydrated and in its regenerated state, under extreme UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2 = 17.0 W/m2 = 1000 J m−2 min−1) in combination with extreme high (+70 °C) and extreme low (−196 °C) temperatures. Moreover, in addition to the study of tolerance and survival in these extreme conditions, we examined whether the polyextremophilic behavior of the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum is combined with the maintenance of H2 production of the thallus. All experiments demonstrated that the polyextremophilic behavior of the lichen under extreme UVB and temperature conditions is combined with its ability to produce large amounts of H2 in a closed system with the sole addition of water. These results are consistent with a recent publication of ours (Parasyri et al., 2018), in which we showed that Pleurosticta acetabulum can survive exposure to ultra-low temperature (−196 °C) and retain its ability to produce H2 in a closed system. There is previous in vitro experience concerning the survivability of other lichen species under extreme UVB conditions, but, to the best of our knowledge in all cases, the extreme values were narrower compared to our experiments. For example, Xanthoria elegans samples were exposed to different doses of UVB (280–320 nm) - low (0.7 W/m2), medium (1.5 W/m2) and high (3.0 W/m2) - for 5 days (Estêvao, 2015), Hypogymnia physodes samples were exposed to 0, 1.6, 2.6 or 3.7 W/m2 UV-BBE (biologically effective UV-B radiation) for 120 h (Solhaug et al., 2009), while Umbilicaria spodochroa and Nephroma arcticum were exposed to 0.7 W/m2 UV-B radiation (Váczi et al., 2018). Most part of the previous experience on extreme temperatures concerns narrower values compared to those in the present study. For example, Hájek et al. (2016) studied Usnea antarctica, Usnea aurantiaco-atra and Umbilicaria cylindrica to linear cooling from +20 to −50 °C at a constant rate of 2 °C min−1, while Barták et al. (2007) studied Umbilicaria antarctica and Xanthoria elegans within the temperature range from −20 to +10 °C, trying to simulate naturally recorded temperatures. Nevertheless, in one of the oldest studies on thermal sensitivity of lichens, Lange (1953), who examined the heat resistance of 40 species of lichens while studying normal respiration rate of air-dry thalli, accepted that the limit of heat resistance for the studied species ranged between 70 °C in Alectoria sarmentosa and 100 °C in Cladonia pyxidata. Moreover, concerning the extreme low temperatures, there is evidence that lichens Caloplaca elegans and Rhizocarpa melanophthalma reveal a combination of extremely high freezing tolerance (−196 °C) and maintenance of full photosynthetic capacity (Kappen, 1993 and references within). Our results expand our previous understanding of the polyextremophilic behavior of the lichen species Pleurosticta acetabulum, testing the H2 production of lichens in relation to their behavior in extreme UVB and temperature conditions for both hydrated and dehydrated thalli, strengthening thus the micro-ecosystem consideration of lichen thallus (Parasyri et al., 2018). Avoidance by light screening mechanisms has been documented, which ensure that the algal partner in lichens is protected against radiation stress by screening in the upper cortex of the lichen thallus (Larsson et al., 2009; Molnár and Farkas, 2010; Estêvao, 2015; Beckett et al., 2021). Lichens contain large amounts of fungal-produced secondary compounds in the cortex, which screen harmful UVB radiation, and some of them are induced by UVB radiation (Solhaug et al., 2003; Estêvao, 2015; Váczi et al., 2018). For example, atranorin, which was identified as a compound of the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum by phytochemical analysis of the acetone extract (Tomović et al., 2017), is one such compound (Solhaug et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2013). However, Estêvao’s (2015) study has shown that a decrease of UVB screening compounds occurred after exposure to a high dose of UVB radiation or long-term treatment (Pedišius, 2020). Thus, alternative mechanisms, such as stress tolerance mechanisms could not be excluded. It is known that basic proteins of the reaction centre complex appear particularly sensitive and are also damaged by UVB exposure (Li et al., 2018). The balance between damaging and restoration processes of the structural and functional integrity of PSII complexes determines the extent of the PSII damage. The ‘PSII repair cycle’, occurring in both chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, involves the proteolytic removal of the damaged D1 and D2 proteins, the production of new subunits, their incorporation into the PSII complex, the re-ligation of redox cofactors, and finally the activation of the reaction centre (Nath et al., 2013; Vass et al., 2014). Although, the PSII repair cycle appears not to have been studied in lichen photobionts, and such a cycle is only likely to operate in hydrated lichens (Buffoni Hall et al., 2003), upregulation of this cycle might help them to acclimate to radiation stress (Beckett et al., 2021). Independent of the underlined molecular, physiological and/or ecological processes of polyextremophilic behavior, the experimental detection of the survival limits will contribute to the comprehension of the effects of space and planetary environment on biological systems for future human exploration, and will expand our knowledge on the limits, the distribution and the origin of life. Solar UV radiation is one of the most harmful parameters of space for living organisms at desiccated status, such as viruses, bacterial and fungal spores (Horneck et al., 1984). Among all organisms tested, only lichens (Rhizocarpon geographicum, Xanthoria elegans, and Circinaria gyrosa) maintained full viability after 2 weeks in outer space, whereas all other test systems were inactivated (Sancho et al., 2007). The UVC and UVB regions, which are responsible for the high lethality of extraterrestrial solar radiation to the microorganisms exposed to it, comprise only 2% of the entire solar extraterrestrial irradiance, while the solar irradiance amounts to 1360 W/m2 at the distance of the Earth to the Sun (1 AU) (Noetzel and Sancho, 2020). Similarly, the temperature of a body in space can range from extremely high to extremely low. The temperature of a body in space is determined by the absorption and emission of energy, depending also on its position regarding the Sun and other orbiting bodies, and also depending on its surface, size, mass, and albedo (Noetzel and Sancho, 2020). In Earth’s orbit, the energy sources include solar radiation (1360 W/m2), the Earth’s albedo (480 W/m2), and terrestrial radiation (230 W/m2). Specifically for the International Space Station (ISS), the tolerable temperature limits are defined, with +120 °C as the highest value and −120 °C as the lowest value (Bagnoli et al., 2007). The described from our results tolerance of the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum to radiation, extreme temperatures, and desiccation, constitutes the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum a model organism for space missions. Most importantly, it is probable that in future space missions to other planets, like Mars, the lichen Pleurosticta acetabulum could serve as a potential energy source, when necessary, as it can be maintained for long periods of time at no cost, due to the stability of its inactive form (dehydrated state). It is worthy of mention that dehydrated lichens can be regenerated even after 10 years of inactivity (Kappen and Valladares, 2007; Kappen, 2000). In addition, our results further support the expanded theory of panspermia, which states that the traveling entities cannot be only single organisms, but also micro-ecosystems (Parasyri et al., 2018). The term ecosystem is defined as a community of organisms and their physical environment interacting as an ecological unit (Capra and Luisi, 2014). Moreover, our results further support the importance of lichens as model systems for astrobiotechnological applications (H2 production), such as in the development of bioregeneration systems for extraterrestrial environments."
15,Conclusions,"The results highlight that the extremophilic and polyextremophilic behavior of lichens both in dehydrated and in regenerated form, under extreme conditions not necessarily recorded on earth, is compatible with their biotechnological uses."
16,More specifically,"5.1 More specifically o Lichens tolerate extreme UVB radiation (1.7 mW/cm2 = 1000 J m−2 min−1) over different time periods (4, 20 & 70 h) and its combining exposure to high intensity UVB radiation and extremely low (−196 °C) and extremely high temperatures (+70 °C), maintaining their ability to produce large amounts of H2. o The ability of lichen micro-ecosystem to expel its moisture and remain in an inactive state, protects itself from extreme stress conditions (extreme temperatures and UVB radiation) maintaining its ability to produce large amounts of H2 with the sole addition of water in a closed system without the need for additional energy. o Hydrogen is a promising fuel for the future, and the results of the present contribution expand the potential use of lichens for future biotechnological applications even in the extreme environments of other planets, such as Mars, thus paving the way for astrobiotechnological applications."
