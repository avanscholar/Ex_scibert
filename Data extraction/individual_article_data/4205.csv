0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as a clean energy source. It is viewed as a renewable energy source and is a green fuel, unlike the carbon-based energy sources. Indeed, it can be a solution to the pollution and energy crises that the world is experiencing. Artificial photo-reduction of water to hydrogen, the process that is highlighted in this article, is mainly inspired from natural processes like photosynthesis. This process to make H2 is regarded as an environmentally friendly method that can be realized using visible light irradiation [1–5]. Compared to other processes, the photo-reduction of water under visible light is a low-cost process that can be achieved through a small reactor system and has the ability to produce pure hydrogen during the reaction [6]. The photocatalytic process depends on the ability of the catalyst to create electron–hole (e−/h+) pairs on the catalyst surface which generates free radicals able to undergo secondary reactions. An electron, excited to a conduction band (CB), reduces a water molecule to give hydrogen. In order to prevent the oxidation of water to oxygen by the h+ in the valance band (VB), a hole scavenger can be added to the electrolyte [7,8]. A key to this type of reaction is the photocatalyst, and the conversion of solar energy to fuels such as H2 depends on an optimal material which should have the ability to dissociate the water molecules by separating (e−/h+) pairs, prevent their recombination, have an appropriate band gap that can absorb light, and remain stable when in contact with water. Since the discovery of the photocatalysis process by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, TiO2 has been shown to be an efficient photocatalyst [9], but other photocatalysts have been investigated. In particular, metal d0 and d10 oxides have been shown to be appropriate photocatalysts due to their appropriate CB and VB energies [10,11]. Further, carbon based materials have shown enhanced photocatalysis for H2 generation. Thus, graphene (G), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), carbon spheres, etc. have been shown to be promising materials for the photocatalytic reaction due to their chemical stability, large surface area and electrical conductivity [12,13,7]. The enhanced H2 generation has also been shown to be affected by crystalline quality of the catalyst [14]. Recently, the attention of scientists has been focused on the development of a range of photo-catalysts with semi-conductor properties [7,15–19]. Among the materials studied in this field are metals and metal oxides, especially Ni and Ni oxide nanoparticle catalysts. They are of interest as they have advantages such as abundance, high optical absorption coefficients, and low band gap energies (1.4–2.3 eV) [20,21]. These characteristics make them prospective candidates for use in low-cost photocatalytic applications [22,23]. To improve the photo-catalytic efficiency of such materials, research has been devoted to the modification of these semiconductors, i.e. to make catalysts, with an enhanced and optimized structure to give an efficient photocatalytic reaction [24–28]. In general, it has been shown that supported semi-conductors are more effective than unsupported ones [29]. For example, when silica is used as a support, metal oxides can coat silica to form metal/silica materials [30–33]. Because of their unique properties such as high surface area, high stability, as well as excellent optical and electrical attributes these materials have been used in many applications, such as catalysis, photo-catalysis, electrochemical sensing, adsorption, etc. [34–40]. However, after the addition of a metal to a support, it is possible for the metal (or its oxide) to interact under appropriate conditions with the support to form new materials. An example is the reaction of Ni oxides with silica to form Ni-silicates called phyllosilicates (PS) [41]. The phyllosilicate (PS) phase exhibits a strong interaction between the metal and silica due to the layered PS structure [42,43]. By varying the molar ratios between Ni and PS (ratio = 2:1 and 1:1) two types of NiPSs can be obtained. For the 2:1 ratio, the structure obtained is Ni3Si4O12H2, whereas the formula is Ni3Si2O9H4 when the ratio is 1:1. Ni-phyllosilicates have been reported to give a range of morphologies and include the multi-walled Ni3Si2O5(OH)4 nanotubes with a layered structure [44], layered hybrid NiPSs [45], a mesoporous NiPS [46], and a tubular PS [47]. The possibility of making a spherical NiPS material based on using a spherical SiO2 particle as support should thus be feasible. Herein we report on the synthesis of spherical Ni-phyllosilicate materials using this approach. The application of nickel phyllosilicate-like photo-catalyst materials has not been extensively studied; indeed, previous research has focused on the synthesis and application of nickel phyllosilicate-like materials in the general catalysis field and not in photo-catalysis [48–50]. In these earlier studies, nickel phyllosilicates were prepared through the precipitation of nickel onto a silica surface by the basification of the nickel solutions under hydrothermal conditions at low temperature. In this present study spherical NiPS materials (prepared similarly) have been made and used as a photo-catalyst and shown to have good photo-catalytic activity for hydrogen production from water under visible light irradiation. The effect of various reaction parameters on the photo-catalytic activity of the spherical NiPSs have been investigated and optimized, and the reports of this study are discussed below."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation 2.1.1 Chemicals The materials listed below were used for the preparation of the new materials. Nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, 98%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35–38 %) were purchased from Biochem, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%) was obtained from Aldrich, urea (CO(NH2)2, 99%) was acquired from Labosi, ethanol (96%) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%) were purchased from Scharlau and Fluka, respectively. All the products were used without additional purification, and de-ionized water was used in all the prepared solutions. 2.1.2 Preparation of silica nanoparticles Silica nanoparticles (SiO2) were prepared by the hydrolysis of TEOS in basic media (pH ∼11) at room temperature according to the protocol of Stöber et al. [51]. Ethanol and NH4OH were mixed under magnetic stirring for 20 min. TEOS was added to this solution under constant magnetic stirring for 1 h. After the hydrolysis and polycondensation step, the mixture was neutralized with HCl (3 mL/30 mL:HCl/H2O). Finally, the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was washed several times with doubly-distilled water. The resulting precipitate was dried over night at 80 °C. 2.1.3 Synthesis of nickel phyllosilicates The synthesized SiO2 nanoparticles were reacted with nickel ions using a hydrothermal method. The silica powder was dispersed in 200 mL of water and then transferred to a Teflon vessel where nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O) was added under magnetic stirring. Urea was added to the mixture to promote the precipitation of the nickel phase onto the sphere surface and to induce reaction with silica. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 12 h. Then, the resulting product was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Nickel loadings used in this study were 5 and 10 wt.% and the samples were labeled 5NiPS, 10NiPS, respectively."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed with a Brüker D8-Diffractometer using monochromated radiation Cu-Kα (λ =1.54056 Å) with 2θ values ranging from 15° to 90° with a scanning rate of 0.02° (2θ) steps. The chemical composition of the materials used was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). A 50 mg sample was dissolved in 10 mL of aqua regia (2.5 mL HCl)/(7 mL HNO3). The resulting solution was analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (240-FS Fast Sequential, AA range from Agilent). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Thermal Analyzer instrument (Model SDT Q 600-TA). The sample was heated from ambient temperature to 900 °C under N2 flow using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The morphological characterizations of the materials were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). TEM analysis was performed on a Tecnai spirit transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV, while SEM analysis was measured using Quanta 250 coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). BET surface area measurements were carried out with Micrometrics ASAP2020 equipment using nitrogen at-196 °C.Prior to the analysis, 0.2 g of the sample was degassed in nitrogen gas using a Micromeritics Flow Prep-060 sample degasser at 150 °C overnight to ensure complete evacuation of the pores. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Spectrum one) within the range of 4000-400 cm−1. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu model UV-2100 spectrophotometer, equipped with an integrating sphere accessory. DR spectral data were transformed to a magnitude proportional to the extinction coefficient (α) through the Kubelka-Munk (K–M) equation [52]: (1) F ( R ) = ( 1 − R ) 2 2 R"
4,Photo-catalytic and photo electrochemical tests,"2.3 Photo-catalytic and photo electrochemical tests Photo-catalytic tests on the prepared materials were conducted at 50 °C under atmospheric pressure and visible light. The reaction was carried out in a double Pyrex reactor. For each test, the catalyst was dispersed in 200 mL of electrolyte (KOH, 0.5 M). The reaction temperature was regulated with a thermostated bath. After temperature stabilization, the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and irradiated with three tungsten lamps (200 W for each, intensity 25 W/cm2) emitting in the range 400–800 nm and positioned at a fixed distance (5 cm) above the reactor. Prior to the test, the electrolyte was purged with nitrogen gas at a bubbling flow rate of 10 mL min−1 for 30 min. The effect of various parameters on the catalyst activity and stability were investigated such as the nickel concentration, the catalyst dose, the reaction temperature, the electrolyte concentration, as well as the type and concentration of the hole scavenger. Hydrogen evolution was also observed by photo-electrochemical (PEC) characterization procedures. The experiment was performed in the dark, and under irradiation at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and in the potential region of [-1.5 - 1.5 V] using Autolab equipment. The working cell was composed of three electrodes: a platinum auxiliary electrode, a saturated calomel electrode and a working electrode. In our study, the working electrode represents the photo-catalyst. The PEC study was conducted using the same conditions as in the photo-catalytic tests."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the samples,"3.1 Characterization of the samples Two catalysts were prepared with two different Ni/SiO2 ratios. The amount of nickel that reacted with the silica was measured by AAS and is reported in Table 1 . Only nickel and silica were detected. The nickel concentrations determined wereclose to the nominal concentrations expected. XRD patterns for SiO2 spheres, and the 5NiPS and 10NiPS materials are shown in Fig. 1 . Broad peaks for 5NiPS and 10NiPS were located at 2θ = 34, 37, and 61°. These were assigned to the (200), (202), and (060) diffractions associated with a 1:1 Ni:PS nickel phyllosilicate structure, Ni3Si2O9H4 (JCPDS No. 49-1859) [50,53,54]. The large peak centered at 2θ = 23° is due to both residual amorphous SiO2 and nickel phyllosilicate [41].The intensity of the NiPS diffraction peaks increased when the amount of Ni increased. Fig. S1 shows the DSC and TGA curves of the 5NiPS and 10NiPS materials. Only a broad endothermic peak at 100 °C is observed, which can be attributed to the loss of water. Above this temperature, no significant weight loss is observed as expected for the stable PS structure. Also, when the calcination temperature was increased to 350 °C, the NiPS structure did not change (Fig S2) indicating catalyst stability at the synthesis conditions. Fig. 2 a shows that the silica particles generated by the Stöber method are spherical and monodispersed. In good agreement with literature data, the surface of the uncoated silica spheres is relatively smooth and the particles are well separated with an average size of 120 nm. The particle morphology is changed significantly after coating and reaction with nickel (Fig. 2b, c) [55]. The TEM images show monodisperse nickel nanoparticles where a flake like (fibrous) material is seen to uniformly coat the outside of the silica cores (Fig. 3 a, b). This fibrous structure is associated with the PS structure and further confirms the presence of the Ni phyllosilicate, as found by others, for related NiPS materials [53,50]. It has been proposed that the nickel hydroxide formed from Ni diffuses into silica through defects and pores, and reacts with the surface hydroxides on the walls of the SiO2 to yield a 1:1 nickel PS material [55,56]. This process would also lead to the spherical morphology seen in the samples made in this study. Due to the formation of the NiPS on the SiO2, the average particle size of the new material increased after the reaction and the surface became rougher. The average particle size increased from 120 nm for SiO2 to 160 nm and 300 nm for 5NiPS and 10NiPS, respectively. The diameters of the spheres increased due to the formation of NiPS on top of SiO2. As is seen in the TEM images the flakes are loosely bound to the sphere surface leading to the expanded size of the NiPS material. It is thus clear that the diameter of the NiPS can be readily varied by addition of the Ni. The EDX spectra of the 5NiPS and 10NiPS samples showed the presence of nickel, silicon and oxygen atoms (Fig. S3). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions are given in Fig. 4 . The samples exhibited type IV Langmuir isotherms with an H3-type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure ranging between 0.4 and 1.0, which characterizes the presence of mesopores in the NiPS spheres, with narrow slit shaped pores [50]. The increase in the Ni loading led to some changes of the hysteresis loop and to an increase in the pore diameter. For 5NiPS, the pore size ranged from 2 nm to 4 nm and indicated the presence of a uniform structure. A broad peak between 4 nm–18 nm in 10NiPS can be assigned to inter-particle pores or the voids between the NiPS fibres. The BJH average pore size, volume, and BET surface area are listed in Table 1. The silica prepared by a Stöber method has a low specific surface area (17 m2/g) with a large pore size (around 79 nm), which is a feature characteristic of spherical silica materials of this type [56]. After nickel addition, the BET surface area increased to 70 m2/g for 5NiPS and 95 m2/g for 10NiPS. The fibrous structure promoted the increase in the BET surface area andpore volume. Fig. S4 shows the FTIR spectra of the SiO2, 5NiPS and 10NiPS materials. The characteristic bands observed are similar to those reported in the literature for nickel phyllosilicates [50,53,57]. Under the hydrothermal conditions, NiPS was formed through reaction of nickel with the silica surface [47]. The nickel hydroxide formed in the basic medium reacted with silicic acid and formed Ni-O-Si bonds with a vibrational frequency of ca. 450 cm−1. The vibration band at 780 cm-1 is attributed to tetrahedral Si-O vibrations. These bands are characteristic of a phyllosilicate structure [50]. The bands located at 670 and 1600 cm−1 are assigned to δ OH vibrations and symmetric in-plane Si-O vibrations, respectively [58]. The band observed at 1109 cm-1 is attributed to the Si-O stretch of amorphous SiO2 [59]. It is also noted that the band intensities increase slightly with an increase in Ni content. The bands located at 950 and 1080 cm-1 indicate the presence of a symmetric stretching vibration and an anti-symmetric vibration for tetrahedral SiO4. The broad band at 3300 cm-1 is characteristic of −OH bond stretching. Nickel phyllosilicates exhibits a light green color (adsorption in the visible region) and a band gap (Eg) that can be quantified from the equation [60]: (2) (αhυ)n = const (hυ – Eg) where α is the absorption coefficient and n = 2 or 1/2 for direct and indirect transition, respectively. The diffuse reflectance spectrum R (%) of xNiPS (Fig. 5 inset) is quite similar to that of phyllosilicate structures. The relation between α and the energy of the incident photons (hv) is given by the Eq. (2). The Eg value is determined by plotting (ahυ)1/2 versus (hυ). The Eg values (2.05 for 5% NiPS; 2.11 for 105NiPS) correspond to an indirect optical transition (Fig. 5). Compared to NiO (Eg ˜ 4 eV), the Eg values of NiPS shifted to smaller values [61], making the material an efficient photo-catalysts under visible light irradiation. These values also confirm the formation of the Ni phyllosilicate material. It is also clear that while the amount of NiPS can be varied in the synthesis of the catalyst, the Eg value is little affected in the synthesis process."
7,Catalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogen production Hydrogen production from water, using semi-conductors such as NiOx as photo-catalyst, provides a potential way to obtain renewable energy. In a typical reaction, a semiconductor (SC) reacts with light to produce electrons and holes. SC + hv→ e− BC (SC) + h+ BV (SC) (SC = semiconductor) Preliminary experiments using our new catalysts were performed in a basic medium (KOH, 0.5 M). In the study, the Ni in the NiPS interacted with light to generate electrons while SO3 2− was used as a hole scavenger to prevent oxygen formation. Thus, in the solution, hydrogen is produced efficiently by visible irradiation with simultaneous removal of holes by sulfite oxidation to sulfate ions: SO3 2− +2 h+ VB + 2OH-→ SO4 2− + H2O 2SO3 2− +2 h+ VB→ S2O6 2- 2H+ + 2e− CB → H2 A good electrochemical stability of the material was observed with a dark current (Jd) of less than 2 mA/cm2. The increase of the photo-current (Jph) along the anodic-direction polarization is a characteristic of n-type conductivity where the electrons are the majority carrier charges (Fig. 6 ). The potential of the H2O/H2 couple (0.55 V for 5NiPS and 0.60 V for 10NiPS) was obtained by extrapolation of the tangent line in the current-potential curve. Fig. S5 shows the photo-catalytic performance of the 5NiPS and 10NiPS catalysts. The 10NiPS exhibited an activity less than that of 5NiPS. After one hour of irradiation, the amount of hydrogen generated was 42 and 149 μmol/g.min for 10NiPS and 5NiPS, respectively, i.e. the amount of hydrogen produced decreased with increasing nickel concentration. This result could be due to (i) the chemical composition and surface properties of the catalyst or (ii) the ability of a photo-catalyst to absorb incident light energy to generate (e−/h+) pairs. The porous structure improved the light absorption capacity due to the increased surface area and multiple inter-particle scattering [62–64]. The increase of the specific surface area of the prepared material reduced the number of PEC active sites and this resulted in a lowered photo-reactivity. The size of the particles (160 nm and 300 nm for 5NiPS and 10NiPS) also increased and favored the recombination rate of the (e−/h+) pairs which decreased the conversion efficiency [65]. Many studies have demonstrated that a decrease in particle size can reduce the recombination of the (e−/h+) pairs. Thus, e− and h+ photogeneration was faster than the interfacial charge carrier transfer processes [66,67]. On the other hand, the decrease in particle size improved the redox potential of VB and CB [68]. The photo-reduction of water to hydrogen was investigated as the catalyst quantity was changed from 0.25 to 0.5 g/L and the best results were found using the lowest concentration (0.25 g/L). (Fig. 7 ). The hydrogen generated by the 5NiPS photo-catalyst increased from 77 to 89–148 μmol/g.min as the amount of the photo-catalyst decreased (0.50, 0.37 and 0.25 g/L). Similarly, the hydrogen evolution increased (12, 30 and 42 μmol/g.min) using the 10NiPS photo-catalyst at similar decreasing concentrations. This result can be correlated with the opacity of the solution which increased with the increasing concentration and would hinder light transmission through the solution [69]. In this case, the (e−/h+) pairs photo-generated are also reduced with a consequent decrease in photo-catalysis efficiency [70]. The effect of temperature on the photo-catalytic reactivity was also examined. Using the 5NiPS photo-catalyst, hydrogen evolution rates of ˜ 6, 47 and 148 μmol/g.min were obtained at 30, 40 and 50 °C, respectively, while, for the 10NiPS photo-catalyst the H2 production rate was ˜ 6, 17 and 41 μmol/g.min at 30, 40 and 50 °C, respectively (Fig. 8 ). Since it is well known that the redox potential does not change significantly with increasing temperature, the enhanced photo-activity can be ascribed to an increase in the carrier mobility (μ) [7]. Also, the photo-catalytic process is a thermally activated process and is associated with an increase in the electrochemical rates of the redox species [71]. Also, the e−/h+ pair on the surface of the photoctalysts can theoretically enhance the redox process [72]. It is also known that, in addition to irradiation, mechanical effects can also modify the behavior of a catalyst and enhance the decomposition of water to hydrogen. Thus, Ikeda et al., have proposed that e−/h+ pairs can be created by the transfer of mechanical energy to electrical energy. This effect produces active sites that react with water to decompose organic pollutants. This effect is referred to as mechano-catalysis [73,74]. Generally, the promotion of the water splitting by the active oxides must be due to factors ranging from individual catalytic capacities to a diversity of mechanical and frictional properties [75]. Hydrogen evolution via photo-catalytic decomposition of water in the KOH electrolyte at different concentrations is shown in Fig. 9 . The photo-reactive H2 efficiency increased with the electrolyte concentration. H2 evolution rates were 244 and 232 μmol/g.min for 5NiPS and 10NiPS, respectively, in a 0.25 M solution. With a concentration less than 0.25 M, water molecules were readily reduced to hydrogen, suggesting a short life time for the (e−/h+) pairs. With the concentration of 0.5 M the reactivity decreased to 148 and 41 μmol/g.min for 5NiPS and 10NiPS, respectively. Hence, the reduction in active sites may be due to the decrease in the total number of available (e-/h+) pairs which limits the photoreactivity at higher concentrations. The nature of the hole scavenger has a significant effect on the photo-catalytic reaction. The hole scavenger is utilized to enhance the rate of the photo-catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination of photo-generated (e−/h+) pairs [76]. In this study, ethanol, methanol, benzoic acid, and Na2SO3 were used as hole scavengers (Fig. 10 ). Compared to the other hole scavengers, Na2SO3 provided good photoreactivity, possibly because of its better ability to react with holes and prevent photo-generated charge recombination [77,78]. For 5NiPS, the hydrogen evolution increased from 17, 30, 89 to 149 μmol/g.min, for methanol, ethanol, benzoic acid and Na2SO3, respectively. The alcohols act as hole scavengers (electron donors) to consume h+. Thus, the oxidation potential of the hole scavenger plays a critical role during the photocatalysis reaction. This is consistent with the oxidation potentials of methanol (1.05 V), ethanol (1.1 V) [79] and SO3 2- oxidation (VSO4 2-/SO3 2-∼ - 1.2 V). The lower oxidation potential means that they can be more easily oxidized and can more efficiently trap holes [80]. The use of benzoic acid resulted in some hole scavenging, most probably due to the COOH functional group. The effect of hole scavenger concentration on the hydrogen production was also investigated (Fig. 11 ). The concentrations selected were0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 M. For 5NiPS, it was observed that the optimum dose of Na2SO3 is 0.025 M, while the highest hydrogen yield used for 10NiPS was observed with a Na2SO3 concentration of 0.075 M. The variation of the activity vs. Na2SO3 concentration shows that the hole scavenger process improved the separation of (e−/h+) pairs and protected the photocatalysts against photocorrosion. In 10NiPS, the higher NiPS concentration limited the diffusion process to the active sites where the oxidation reaction took place [81]. Also, the poorer the transparency of the solution, the poorer the absorption of the photons. As shown in Fig. 12 , the same results were obtained when the solution was purged with N2 to reactivate the catalytic sites. After three cycles for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the photocatalysts did not exhibit any significant loss due to the good stability of the material. This result suggests that the photocatalyst could be stable for long periods in the water photoreduction process."
8,Conclusions,"A new photo-catalyst with a spherical Ni phyllosilicate (NiPS) structure was used as an efficient photo-catalyst for hydrogen generation. The spherical NiPS morphology provided a material with a good surface area and porous structure for evaluating the photcatalystic hydrogen generation studies from water. The catalyst was made using a low-cost hydrothermal method. The synthesized materials exhibited a wide absorption range in the visible region. Photo-catalytic tests to produce hydrogen through the water photo-reduction reaction by varying a range of experimental parameters showed that the 5NiPS displayed a better catalytic activity when compared to 10NiPS. The photo-catalysts exhibited a more effective separation and better transport of photo-induced pairs (e−/h+). This makes the material a promising candidate for photo-catalytic applications, especially for hydrogen generation. Further studies are underway to explore these materials as well as other related metal silicates."
