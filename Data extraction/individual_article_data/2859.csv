0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as a renewable resource is a widespread concern and has received extensive research attention in the field of energy conversion and development. The urgent need for sustainable energy sources lead photolysis of water emerging as an eco-friendly approach to mitigate global energy and environmental crises [1–4]. Out of all the research, the photocatalysis in the applications of solar-powered hydrogen production play an important role [5]. The one of the most efficient photocatalyst is a semiconductor material that is modified by a noble metal, which acts as the reactive site. Among the precious metals that serve high-performance promoters, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles and their oxides exhibit excellent efficiency of hydrogen production and activity due to their sufficiently low hydrogen potential (close to zero) and adequate free energy of hydrogen adsorption [6–9]. However, the scarcity and high cost limits large-scale application of the noble metal in the field of catalysis and energy. Therefore, the development of an alternate cheap and facile catalyst for precious metals in practical applications is very essential and worthy [10–17]. Recently, two-dimensional layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) materials receive high attention owing to their unique properties and applications in the field of optoelectronics [18–21]. Combining with the potential of the photocatalyst and photoelectrocatalyst, it can be expected to replace expensive precious metals. However, raw MoS2 materials have limited ability to transmit electrons and participate in photocatalytic reactions due to the lack of their active sites (concentrated on the edges of the layers) and poor electrical conductivity between the layers [2]. The previous studies showed that the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic activity of MoS2 are closely related to the unsaturation of the Mo atom, and the peripheral structure of MoS2 is generally considered to be an active site for participating in the reaction due to its excellent electrical conductivity [2,22–25]. However, the peripheral structure of the nano-sized MoS2 material is not thermally stable enough and is prone to curl, which further hinders its development. Therefore, the recent study of MoS2 mainly focused on the modification of nanostructure MoS2/TiO2 composite by simply introducing other semiconductor materials. For example, the vertically grown MoS2 nanosheets on TiO2, maximize the contact edge with the TiO2 and provides exposure to a large number of active sites, which undoubtedly conducive to the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the catalyst. Song et al. [2,25] successfully achieved modification of MoS2 by an interfacial coupling over the surface of the TiO2 nanobelts using three-step hydrothermal method, wherein a large number of defects of MoS2 result in plenty of active edges and active sites of unsaturated S atom. He et al. [24] employed a two-step method to achieve an interfacial control over the curved TiO2 nanofibers using gas-phase chemical deposition and formed vertical layered MoS2 promoter on its surface. It can be found that the MoS2/TiO2(B) prepared by MoS2/TiO2(E) is more effective, and the photoactivities have also been significantly improved. In general, MoS2 tends to grow along the surface of the substrate in order to reduce its surface energy since the surface energy of the edge is much higher than that of each layer of surface of substrate, so the edge of the sites cannot be fully exposed [24,26,27]. Besides, since the interlayer electronic impedance is much higher than that of intra layer, it's difficult for the photo-excited electrons to cross the interfaces for reaching the different layers of the edge of the active site. The edge of MoS2 has a higher conductivity than the inner layers, so that the contact and coupling of the edge of MoS2 to the semiconductor will greatly improve the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production [21,28]. Herein, the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts were synthesized using Cr2O3/protonated titanate (Cr-TNSs) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as precursors in solvothermal reaction by a “top-down” method (simple two-step). The large-size Cr-TNSs can form complete contact with the active edge layers of MoS2, which results in good interface coupling. It can effectively improve the transport efficiency of electron for its interface, thus accelerating the electron participation in hydrogen production and significantly improving the efficiency and activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production."

The water used in the experiment is laboratory-made deionized water."
3,Preparation of photocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalyst 2.2.1 The synthesis of the Cr-TNSs samples Initially, 0.8 g of P25 was added to 50 mL of NaOH solution (10 M). After 20 min of magnetic stirring, an appropriate amount of Cr(NO3)3 solution was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred for 30 min which was then transferred to a 100 mL of polytetrafluoroethylene reactor for the hydrothermal reaction at 130 °C for 3 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the sample was washed repeatedly with deionized water till the pH 7.0. Later, the sample was added to the pre-formulated 200 mL of 0.1 mol/l dilute HCl solution and kept on stirring for 1 h. After the pickling in HCl solution, the sample was washed with deionized water to obtain pH ∼7.0. Finally, a series of Cr2O3 loaded TiO2-based nanosheets samples (Cr-TNSs) with different Cr/Ti ratios (labeled as x-Cr-TNSs, x = 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 5.0%) were obtained by drying at 70 °C. The pure TNSs were prepared without using chromium source for the comparative study. 2.2.2 The synthesis of the MoS2 nanoflowers samples The 1.21 g of sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4 2H2O) was added to 50 mL of deionized water by magnetic stirring and 1.15 g of thiourea (CH4N2S) was added to the solution and sufficiently stirred until it was completely dissolved. The solution was then transferred to a 100 mL of polytetrafluoroethylene reactor liner for hydrothermal reaction at 200 °C for 18 h and then was allowed to cool to room temperature. The sample was obtained by centrifugation and repeated wash using deionized water for 4 times. Finally, the sample was dried at 70 °C and sufficiently ground to obtain fine powder of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). 2.2.3 The synthesis of the Cr-TM samples The 0.5 g of sample x-Cr-TNSs (x = 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 5.0%) was added to 50 mL of aqueous ethanol solution (80 vol.%) by stirring magnetically for 20 min as shown in Scheme 1 . Further, 0.1 g of MoS2 was added and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to a 100 mL of polytetrafluoroethylene reactor liner for carrying alcohol reaction at 150 °C for 6 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the obtained sample was repeatedly washed with deionized water for 4 times. Finally, the samples were dried at 70 °C and gently ground to obtain MoS2@Cr-TNFs composite samples of different Cr/Ti ratios provided with a mass fraction of 20% (samples labeled as x-Cr-TM, x = 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 5.0%). The preparation of the MoS2@TNFs composite sample (TM) was also carried out in the same manner as described above but with the precursor suitable to produce TNFs. Further, TNFs sample was prepared without the addition of MoS2 using the same procedure."
4,Characterization of photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterization of photocatalysts High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies for microstructure analysis were carried out using FEM's JEM-2010-FEF type provided with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and the elemental composition of the sample is monitored on an annex with micro-area spectrum analysis (EDS). The FEI's Sirion Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope was used for Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were monitored using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer of Cu Kα ray (λ = 1.5406 Å), accelerating voltage of 40 kV, and accelerating current of 40 mA, the scan rate of 2°/min, and the angular spread ranging from 20° to 80°. Laser Raman Spectra were recorded using Horiba LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer provided with laser source of 488 nm wavelength, 600 grating, and laser power of 5 mW. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed on Thermo VG Multilab 2000 provided with Al Kα as the excitation source. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were obtained for the wavelength range of 200–800 nm by Shimadzu UV-2550 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The analytical barium sulfate (BaSO4) is used as a reference sample. Hitachi FL 4600 provided by voltage of 500 V, excitation light of 300 nm was used for recording Fluorescence spectra (FL)."
5,Photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution The production of the photocatalytic hydrogen was carried out by the CEL-SPH2N in-line gas collection system. Initially, 0.05 g of catalyst and 80 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) (15 vol.%) were dispersed in a 250 mL of aqueous solution, using magnetic stirring followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 10 min. The reactor was then connected to the vacuum system and evacuated prior to the reaction to remove dissolved oxygen and other gases from the reaction solution. The light source was irradiated with a xenon lamp of 300 W placed at a distance of 20 cm from the top of the reaction vessel. The visible light is obtained by using a filter sheet (λ ≥ 400 nm) which was kept between the light source and the reactor of the hydrogenation reaction. The temperature of the reaction was controlled throughout the process to 6 °C by the circulating cooling system. During the experiment, the hydrogen produced in the system was collected for every 30 min and was analyzed on-line by gas chromatography station."
6,Photocurrent response measurements,"2.5 Photocurrent response measurements The surface photocurrent test of the sample was carried out on the electrochemical workstation (CHI-660C, China) using standard three-electrode system. 10 mg of the catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL of absolute ethanol. The mixture of suspension was then coated onto an ITO conductive glass (indium tin oxide coated, dimensions 2 × 1 cm) by spin coating and was then dried at 50 °C for 5 h. The prepared catalyst/ITO electrode was used as the working electrode, the saturated calomel electrode and the platinum electrode as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The Na2SO4 solution of 0.1 mol/L concentration was used as the electrolyte. The 300 W of xenon lamp was employed to irradiate the working electrode horizontally and the UV portion was filtered using a filter (λ ≥ 400 nm)."

8,"Morphology, microstructure and chemical state of the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts","3.1 Morphology, microstructure and chemical state of the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts The morphology and microstructure of the TNFs, TM and 2.0% Cr-TM were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 1 a–d. The morphology of protonated TNFs formed through the lamellar structure of TNSs during the secondary reaction was flocculation. The TNSs are continuously dissolved and recrystallized during the process of the solvothermal reaction, due to a large amount of hydroxyl groups of the solvent. The curling of 2D into 1D begins to occur over the stacked and interconnected nanosheets. During the progression of reaction, the products appear to be agglomerated up to a certain extent and accompanied by a slight curling of the sodium titanate micelles and an increase in the thickness of the lamellae, resulting in the formation of a layered structure of titanate (TNFs). The MoS2 possesses a structure of petaloid nanospheres (Fig. 1b) with the size of about 300–400 nm. The MoS2 introduced TNSs, and Cr-TNSs, TM and 2.0% Cr-TM sample respectively showed a flower-like structure. During the growth of TNFs, the introduced MoS2 combines with TNSs (2D-2D) owing to their larger specific surface area and the TNSs adhere to the active surface sites of the spherical MoS2 leading to the process of nucleation which assists growth process as well as prevents the TNSs from being coated over the surface petaloid structure of the MoS2 and the agglomeration and stacking of the lamellae. Microstructure of the 2.0% Cr-TM was monitored using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The crystal lattice with a plane spacing of about 0.43 nm which corresponds to the (20 2 ( — ) ) crystal plane of the titanate structure (H2Ti3O7) can be observed in Fig. 1e and f. This indicates that the protonated titanate structure of the sample was retained, and the sample has a better crystal structure and a higher degree of crystallinity than TNSs. Furthermore the poorly resolved lattice fringes correspond to MoS2 for TM and 2.0% Cr-TM composite samples suggests a slighter hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2. However, there are still a few observable lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of about 0.64 nm correspond to the (002), which is slightly higher than the reported value (about 0.62 nm) for the MoS2 [28–30]. From these observations, it can be conjectured that the TNSs initially enter the laminar structured edges of MoS2 by the dissolution-recrystallization during the solvothermal process and grew up among the layers. Meanwhile, TNFs grew among the edges of MoS2 and form the intertwined clusters which may lead the (002) plane spacing of MoS2 increase and a slight twist of the edge layer [27]. The EDS spectra (Fig. S1) taken for the 2.0% Cr-TM sample confirms the presence of Mo, Cr and S elements in addition to the Ti and O elements, in the sample. The structural changes for TM and x-Cr-TM samples were monitored using XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 2 , the TNFs, TM and Cr-TM samples showed diffraction peaks correspond to the anatase-rutile mixed phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 65–5714 and JCPDS No. 65–1119). The intensity of the peaks for TNFs, TM and Cr-TM samples is slightly increased when compared to that of TNSs, which can be ascribed to the secondary reaction and indicates a slight improvement in the degree of order and crystallinity. Furthermore, the patterns for TM and Cr-TM samples did not change significantly with respect to that of TNFs, indicating a negligible influence of solvothermal reaction on the phase and crystal structure of TNFs. However, the characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to the hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS No. 47–1492) began to appear as a consequence of solvothermal reaction [31,32]. The position of characteristic diffraction peak of (002) plane corresponds to MoS2, is slightly shifted to lower angle for the TM and Cr-TM samples inferring an enlargement of interlayer spacing at the edges of MoS2 which is a consequence of adherence and growth of TNFs at the interlayer space after the combining the MoS2 and TNFs. The position of peak corresponds to the diffraction from (100) plane for the MoS2 layer is also displaced slightly to lower angles for the TM and the Cr-TM sample, indicating that the TNFs grown not only in the interlayer space but also on the surface of the MoS2 layers during the formation of composite, so that physically TNFs and MoS2 were linked intimately. In order to further study the microstructure of TM and Cr-TM composite samples, Raman spectroscopy was carried out. From Fig. 3 it is clear that all samples possess characteristic Raman vibrational bands. The strongest vibrational band of Eg mode at 146 cm−1 and broad vibrational bands at 510 cm−1 (Eg) and 630 cm−1 (Eg) are attributed to the anatase phase of the samples while the band at around 448 cm−1 (Eg) is ascribed to the vibrational mode coming from the rutile phase [13,14,16]. The asymmetric band at about 456 cm−1 can be attributed to the bending of the TiO6 plane and the two-dimensional fibrous type TiO6 of the surface structure [9–11]. The intensity of this band for TM and x-Cr-TM composite samples decreased and the position is slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to that of TNFs, indicating that TNFs interacted with MoS2 without destruction of protonated titanate structure. The introduction of MoS2 into the TNFs showed significant effect on the strongest vibrational band at 146 cm−1 corresponds to the anatase phase and the broad titration band of the protonated titanate at 268 cm−1. The position and intensity of these bands changed remarkably, indicating the influence of MoS2 on the vibration of surface TiO bond of TNFs. From the HRTEM and XRD, the interaction between TNFs and MoS2 could be attributed to the formation of TiOMo bonds across the layers of MoS2. The surface of the 2D-2D composite leads to the polarization of the TiO lattice in a certain direction, and a large displacement of the vibration frequency of the Raman peak [25,33]. The bands at about 374 cm−1 and 401 cm−1, correspond to characteristic vibrational modes E2g and A1g of MoS2, respectively, suggested a well coupling between TNFs and MoS2 [34]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical composition and valence states for the TNFs, MoS2, TM and 2.0% Cr-TM. The core level spectra of all the samples for different elements was calibrated with respect to the binding energy of C 1s peak (∼284.6 eV). In Fig. 4 a, the Ti 2p doublet for TM and 2.0% Cr-TM exhibit two components at binding energies 458.36 and 464.08 eV, which attributed to Ti4+ 2p3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2 (spin orbit coupled pair) orbits respectively and are slightly lower than that (458.57 eV and 464.35 eV) of TNFs. This can be explained on the basis of the formation of TiOMo chemical bonds through the bridging oxygen bonds over the surface of TNFs/MoS2 composite during the solvothermal reaction. Since the binding energy of orbital electron for Mo4+ is lower than that of Ti4+, the binding energy of TiOMo on the surface of Cr-TM samples is reduced. The formation of TiOMo bonds during the solvothermal reaction may be attributed to the spontaneous transformation of TNSs from two-dimensional forms to one-dimensional. Initially, TNSs tend to crimp off with the assistance of surface abundant hydroxyl groups (of the form of TiOH) capable of interacting with exposed MoS bonds from the surface of MoS2 and form TiOMo bonds by the dehydrogenation process. Fig. 4c represents a broad asymmetric O 1s spectrum for TM and 2.0% Cr-TM and TNFs which is resolved in to two components located at ∼530 eV and ∼531 eV, origin from two forms of oxygen, corresponding to the TiO lattice of the sample. A large number of hydroxyl groups was formed initially while the later from chemically adsorbed H2O molecules. The O 1s binding energy (529.67 eV) of the TM and the 2.0% Cr-TM samples shift towards low binding energies when compared with the TNFs, which may be ascribed that the interaction between a large number of Mo4+ and the active sites of the surface of TNFs led the formation of TiOMo bonds. On the other hand, consumption of the surface hydroxyl groups (TiOH) may also result into the displacement in the orbital binding energy for the TM and 2.0% Cr-TM. The XPS spectra of Mo 3d (Fig. 4 b) for the TM and 2.0% Cr-TM samples exhibit two peaks at around 229.59 eV and 232.77 eV attributed to Mo4+ 3d5/2 in Mo4+ 3d3/2 states of MoS2 [35–37]. The positions of the both peaks for the TM and 2.0% Cr-TM showed a slight shift, as the binding energy of Mo4+ orbital electrons for the TM and 2.0% Cr-TM samples is lower than that of MoS2 indicating an interaction between MoS2 with TNFs and the formation of TNFs/MoS2 composite with typical interfacial properties without affecting bulk structure and intrinsic electron states MoS2 [37]. During the growth and ligation of TNFs over the edges of the MoS2 active region, the orbital coupling (TiOMo) takes place between the two interfaces will decrease the electron energy which causes the peak shift to low energies. Further, Fig. 4d presents the S 2p core energy spectrum for MoS2 which exhibits a doublet at around 162.63 eV and 163.74 eV correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively [36–38]. The binding energies for TM and 2.0% Cr-TM sample are (∼162.24 eV and ∼163.30 eV respectively) slightly lower than that of MoS2, which is consistent with the above results. In order to ensure the presence of Cr2O3 over the surface of Cr-TM during the secondary reaction, the Cr 2p XPS spectra of 0.5% Cr-TM and 2.0% Cr-TM were studied (Fig. S2). The binding energy peaks at ∼577.02 eV and ∼586.60 eV, belong to Cr3+ 2p3/2 and Cr3+ 2p1/2 of Cr2O3, respectively, indicating the stability of Cr2O3 during the secondary reaction process."
9,Photoelectric response of the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts,"3.2 Photoelectric response of the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts The optical absorption properties of TNFs, TM and Cr-TM were measured using the UV–vis diffuse absorption spectra (UV–vis DRS) in Fig. 5 . The TM and Cr-TM exhibited significant absorption in the visible region comparing with the TNFs which can be attributed to the existence of MoS2. The results are consistent with the reported literature [28,39]. However the response of TNFs in the UV region is not affected, probably due to the fact that the MoS2 instead encapsulate TNFs in the complex process, TNFs enter the interlayer space and grow, thus effectively inhibit the transformation of TNSs into TNFs and result in the reunion. This is because of the larger size (300–400 nm) and the interlayer spacing (0.64 nm) of MoS2. It can be seen that the absorption spectrum of the Cr-TM samples increases with the concentration of Cr2O3, and the absorption spectrum of the Cr2O3 exhibits a rising trend in the visible region. Further the spectra of Cr-TM samples exhibit two additional absorption bands, one at 450 nm and the other between 600 nm and 800 nm, which can be attributed to the characteristic absorption of Cr2O3 provided by the charge transfer from the Cr 3d energy band to the TNFs conduction band. The intensity of these absorption bands enhance for all Cr-TM samples with the weight percent of Cr2O3. The occurrence and variation of the bands indicates the visible light sensitization of Cr2O3 during the photocatalytic reaction. At the same time, MoS2 can serve a catalyst for interfacial electron transport [30,40], and the photocatalytic efficiency will be improved by the synergism between Cr2O3 and MoS2. The fluorescence emission spectra (FL) and surface photocurrent tests were carried out to study the efficiency of the photo-generated electron-hole pair separation for the TM and Cr-TM samples in Fig. S3a. The intensity of fluorescence emission peak for TM and Cr-TM sample is lower than that of raw sample. A new characteristic peak evolved near 462 nm, is related to MoS2. Further, the fluorescence intensity for the Cr-TM samples is lower than that of TM and the 0.5% Cr-TM, and showed the lowest fluorescence intensity among them. Though the 2H-type MoS2 is a narrow band gap (about 1.65 eV) semiconducting catalyst [40,41], photoexcitation cannot effectively induce electrons transition to the conduction band due to its indirect band gap nature simple [21,34], and thus greatly restricts the improvement of its photocatalytic activity. The loaded Cr2O3 can significantly improve the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated charges for the Cr-TM samples. Further the intensity of fluorescence for the MoS2 modified samples is significantly reduced, which indicates that the MoS2 acts as a co-catalyst and accelerate the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. On the other hand, the photocurrent response of the TM and Cr-TM samples (Fig. S3b) is in consistence with the studies of FL spectra. The Cr-TM samples exhibit a higher photocurrent density than that of TM for the same MoS2 composite ratio, and the 0.5% Cr-TM sample shows an optimum photocurrent response. This confirms the contribution of MoS2 as a cocatalyst and TNFs are dispersed at the surface active sites of the edges, which can play a role similar to that of the noble metal, acting as an electron cold trap, capable of capturing and conducting photoexcited electrons which accelerates the separation of photogenerated holes. Thus, the transport efficiency of electron is also improved. On the other hand, Cr-TNFs serve as an electron transport channels among the MoS2 layers and possess good synergism with MoS2 in the photocatalytic reaction, which leads to improve the of visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity."
10,Evaluation of hydrogenation for the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts,"3.3 Evaluation of hydrogenation for the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts The photocatalytic activity of the TM and Cr-TM sample was studied by carrying out the production of hydrogenation in Fig. 6 . The efficiency of hydrogen production for the x-Cr-TM (x = 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 5.0%) samples with the different ratio of Cr2O3 was significantly improved. The 0.5% Cr-TM sample showed a highest hydrogen production activity among all samples, with the H2 production rate of ∼217 μmol h-1 g-1. Further the efficiency of hydrogen production for the Cr-TM samples decreases with the weight percent of and reaches the lowest value for 5.0% Cr-TM, indicating that the Cr-TM sample with the appropriate weight percent of Cr2O3 (0.5%) has optimum rate of hydrogen production. It is evident that the heterostructure with interfacial properties and visible light excitation mechanism of Cr2O3 over the surface of TNFs and MoS2 can promote the hydrogen production. The above studies suggest that Cr2O3/TNFs nanostructure can be used as a good “photosensitizer”, and the MoS2 of the catalyst produces a good synergistic effect in the visible light catalytic reaction. As the stability is one of the important indices of photocatalyst performance, the stability of the sample was tested five times for 3 h. The stability test was carried out using the 0.5% Cr-TM as a representative for the photocatalytic hydrogen production in Fig. 7 . After the end of each cycle, the whole reaction system was evacuated ensuring that there was no residual gas in the system for the next reaction. The rates of H2 production are 31.3 μmol for the first reaction. After five cycles experiment, the efficiency of hydrogen production was still maintained at ca. 29.8 μmol. The stability test indicates that the Cr-TM photocatalyst exhibit good stability and recycle performance. The decrease in hydrogen production rate for the initial cycles may be mainly due to the expense of sacrificial reagents and the influence of intermediates during the reaction. The Cr-TM samples exhibit better visible photosensitivity, separation of photogenerated carriers and stability which are attributed to the incorporation of Cr2O3 than that of some catalysts that employ organic or organometallic modification for visible light sensitization. The results show that the MoS2 nanoflowers with the composite TNFs form a stable structure, and can be used as a co-catalyst to make good interfacial contact with the surface of TNFs."
11,The mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/Cr2O3/ protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts,"3.4 The mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/Cr2O3/ protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts The large size lamellar titanate nanostructures of TNSs with large inter layer-gap and active sites at lamellar edge were used as the precursor of the top-down solvothermal reaction. The MoS2 was employed to synthesize 2D-2D structure with appropriate interfacial properties and realize the growth of TNFs at the MoS2 edge layer, so that plenty of active sites of the edge of MoS2 might come in direct contact with TNFs. The photogenerated charges were efficiently separated and transmitted at the edges of MoS2, thus achieving the enhanced efficiency of visible-light photocatalysis. The Cr2O3-loaded TNFs act as the centers of generation and separation for the photogenerated charge carriers at the MoS2 edge layer during the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Furthermore, MoS2 promotes the transfer of charges across the interlayer and transport them to the surface active sites. Based on the role of catalyst and co-catalyst, we will focus on the synergistic effect of MoS2 and Cr2O3 during the hydrogen production of Cr-TM catalyst in its reaction mechanism in Scheme 2 . When TNFs are combined with MoS2, it acts as a co-catalyst at the interface to produce 2D nanostructures that allow photogenerated carriers to be transported efficiently to the active reaction sites of the edge of MoS2 to participate in proton reduction reactions. The electron (e−) from the 3d energy band of Cr2O3 on the surface of TNFs is activated under visible light excitation (λ ≥ 400 nm) and is transferred to the conduction band (CB) of TNFs through the Cr2O3/TNFs interface [Eqs. (1) and (2)]. Meanwhile, some electrons in the conduction band of TNFs are transported from the MoS2 layer to the MoS2 edge active site through the interface. The rest of the electrons are transported from the MoS2 edge layer to the active site and eventually involved in the proton reduction reaction. Simultaneously the hole (h+) left Cr2O3 during the hydrogen production on being occupied by the electrons provided by the electron donor (e.g. TEOA) of the solution. As the reaction progresses, the sacrificial agent reacts with the photogenerated hole (h+) and accelerates the separation of the photo-generated electrons, resulting in to enrichment of the number of conduction band (CB) electrons (e−) for the TNSs [Eqs. (3)–(5)] and H+ ions are produced by ionization which is further transferred to the surface of the MoS2 edge layer, the reactive site. It is well known that the S atoms expose at the edge of MoS2 and has a very high reactivity which comes from their unsaturated coordination (single co-ordination and two co-ordination) and is favorable for the photocatalytic hydrogen production as they can produce a very strong effect with H+ in solution, and quickly capture H+ during the reaction. The H+ interacts with electrons produces H2 during electron reduction process which passivizes the reactivity of the S atom in the saturation coordination [24,25]. Therefore, in the reactive sites of the MoS2/Cr2O3/protonated titanate ternary photocatalysts (Cr2O3/TNFs-MoS2-H+/H2O), the excitation electrons (e−) in Cr2O3 observed by Cr2O3/(TNFs), interface was isolated from the hole (h+) and transferred to the CB of TNFs. Due to the structural advantages of TNFs, the combination of TNFs and MoS2 allows it to fully contact with the edges of MoS2 and produce a vertical orbital coupling with the MoS2. This process significantly enhances the conductance of TNFs/MoS2 nanostructures and the transfer efficiency of electron, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [40,42,43]. Therefore the photo-excited electrons (e−) can migrate rapidly to the reactive site of the MoS2 edge layer. Subsequently, the conduction band electrons are separated to participate in the hydrogen production reaction on each edge layer of MoS2 in the sacrificial reagent/aqueous solution system. The larger interlayer space and separation among the layers act as barriers for the electrons and thus effectively inhibits the reverse oxidation of H2 and promotes the process of proton reduction of hydrogen production. (1) Cr2O3/TNFs + hν (Vis) → CrIII∗ (e− + h+)/TNFs (2) CrIII∗ (e− + h+)/TNFs → CrIV (h+)/TNFs (e−) (3) TNSs (e−) + MoS2 (basal plane) → TNFs + MoS2 (in-plane) (e−) (4) 2H+ + 2e− (MoS2 edge) → H2 (5) TEOA + h+ (CrIV) → TEOA+ + CrIII Therefore, the MoS2/Cr-TNFs composite catalyst exhibits good photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production due to the visible light-sensitive interface of the Cr2O3/TNFs nano heterostructures and the MoS2 edge active layer which serve as a co-catalyst. The synergistic effect is mainly attributed to the direct contact and interfacial coupling of TNFs and MoS2. In addition, as a class of materials with excellent adsorption properties, the unique structure of MoS2 can significantly enhance its proton capture ability in solution and increase the contact probability between electron and reactants, which is beneficial to its application in energy utilization and conversion."
12,Conclusions,"The MoS2 nanoflowers/Cr2O3/protonated titanate nanoflakes edge-on ternary heterostructures (denoted as Cr-TM) were prepared via solvothermal-assisted route. The Cr-TNFs form good physical contact with MoS2 active edges, resulted nanoflowers layered structure. The Cr-TNFs can grow between the MoS2 layers and interact with the lamellar edge on high reactivity to form interfacial coupling, and finally form Cr-TNFs/MoS2 with the hierarchical structure of edge-on-contacted nanoflowers. Most of the TNFs (Cr-TNFs) are coupled or interacted with the MoS2 active edge layer at their interface which led to form a TiOMo bond, resulting in displacement of the orbital binding energy of different elements. The Cr2O3 showed its visible light sensitization in the photocatalytic reaction, while MoS2 acted as electron transfer and transport center, and promoted the efficiency of carrier transportation over the synergistic effect of Cr2O3. In addition, MoS2 being a co-catalyst, dispersed through the Cr-TNFs near the edge of the surface active sites, which played a role similar to that of precious metals. It also serve electronic cold trap, to facilitate the timely capture and conduct light for the stimulation of electrons, and thus improves the efficiency of electron transport. The 0.5% Cr-TM sample showed a relatively high rate of photocatalytic activity (∼217 μmol h-1 g-1) for the H2 production. Further, the 0.5% Cr-TM sample exhibited stable hydrogen production efficiency in the cyclic test, which proved that the prepared photocatalyst possess a good stability due to the formation of adequate physical contact between MoS2 with TNFs."
