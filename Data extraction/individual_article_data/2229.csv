0,Introduction,"Microbial fermentation using low cost sustainable waste as substrates for renewable biofuels production has been extensively studied due to its contribution for environmental advantages and commercial benefits. Biodiesel production generates abundant waste glycerol, which serves as one of the popular carbon sources used in microbial fermentation. Microorganisms are able to degrade glycerol into metabolite products such as 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, acetic acids, lactic acids, succinic acids, hydrogen and carbon dioxide under fermentation conditions [1]. Among these fermentation products, hydrogen and ethanol have enormous value and great potential as alternative fuels for future. Hydrogen is well-known as an efficient energy that can be used for many applications including alternates for fossil fuels, electricity and thermal energy generation. On the other hand, ethanol is widely used as major substitute to gasoline as alternative fuel. Therefore, simultaneous production of both hydrogen and ethanol using waste glycerol has received increasing attention in biofuel industry. Microorganisms play a key role in fermentation system to yield desired products. Escherichia coli was identified as one of the microorganisms that able to ferment glycerol into hydrogen and ethanol [2]. E. coli, which belongs to facultative anaerobes that are tolerant to oxygen, has an advantageous over strict anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. Besides that, its well-studied characterization and ease of molecular engineering compared to other species such as Klebsiella and Enterobacter further elucidate the reason for developing researches in simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol using E. coli [3]. Theoretically, 1mol of glycerol could produce 1mol of hydrogen and 1mol of ethanol, respectively [4]. Yazdani and Gonzalez [5] performed genetic modification on E. coli to co-produce hydrogen and ethanol approaching theoretical yield during glycerol fermentation. Nevertheless, in their study, the engineered E. coli SY03 was inefficient in cell growth and glycerol utilization. Fermentation using E. coli to co-produce hydrogen and ethanol is still at its infancy stage to accomplish the feasibility in industrial applications. Thus, more related studies are still required. Previous work done by Suhaimi et al. [6] reported that locally isolated E. coli strain SS1 is able to consume glycerol at high concentration to produce ethanol at theoretical yield under optimized fermentation condition. Based on the preliminary study, E. coli SS1 has an advantage due to uninhibited growth at glycerol concentration of 45g/L. However, concurrent hydrogen production was rather low. Hydrogenase is the enzyme identified to catalyze the reversible redox reactions of hydrogen. According to previous study [7], recombinant E. coli SS1 with an additional copy of hycE gene which encoded large subunit of Hydrogenase 3 showed 1.4-fold higher hydrogen yield at initial pH5.8, while the wild-type SS1 exhibited 1.4-fold higher ethanol yield than recombinant hycE. Hydrogenases 2 was claimed to play a role for increased hydrogen production by E. coli at slightly alkaline condition under glycerol fermentation [8]. Hydrogenase 2 of E. coli is transcribed from the hyb operon which composed of eight genes (hybOABCDEFG) and hybC encodes the large subunit [9]. Trchounian and Trchounian [8] reported that E. coli hybC knockout mutant had diminished hydrogen production rate about 100% compared to wild-type. According to Maeda et al. [10], the role of Hydrogenase 2 is responsible for the hydrogen uptake activity in E. coli during glucose fermentation. The role of this hydrogenase in hydrogen metabolism is still ambiguous. Hence, further study regarding Hydrogenase 2 is vital to develop a superior hydrogen producing recombinant strain. To date, there was no research report regarding E. coli recombinant strain with additional copy of hybC gene. In the present work, the effect of hybC gene on hydrogen and ethanol co-production by E. coli strain SS1 under glycerol fermentation was investigated. Glucose fermentation was also demonstrated for comparison study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture conditions,"2.1 Culture conditions The E. coli SS1 used in this study was isolated from soil [6]. The recombinant strain with additional copy of hybC was constructed in this study. The strains were pre-cultured in LB medium consisting of 10g/L of tryptone, 5g/L of yeast extract, and 5g/L of NaCl."
3,Construction of recombinant strains,"2.2 Construction of recombinant strains Expression vector pETDuet-1 (Novagen) was used for cloning and sequencing of hybC gene in E. coli strain SS1. The hybC gene used was isolated from genomic DNA of E. coli strain SS1 and was PCR amplified using forward primer designed with the addition of BamHI restriction site 5′-GCGGATCCATGAGCCAGAGAATTACTATTGATC-3′ and reverse primer designed with the addition of NotI restriction site 5′-GATATGCGGCCGCTTACAGAACCTTCACTGAAACCA-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the nucleotide sequences of hybC available in NCBI database (GenBank accession number: AAA21591.1 ). Each PCR reaction mixture had a total volume of 25μL containing 1× PCR buffer (10mM Tris–HCl, 50mM KCl, 1.5mM MgCl2), 0.2mM of dNTP mix, 0.2μM of each of forward and reverse primers, 0.04U/μL of Taq polymerase, and approximately 200ng of the DNA template. The following PCR conditions were employed for the amplification; initial denaturation at 95°C for 2min, followed by 30cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1min, annealing temperature at 50°C for 1min, elongation at 72°C for 1min and a final elongation step at 72°C for 5min. The nucleotide sequence analysis for the amplification of full fragments of hybC gene resulted in 1704 bases, which was found to be 100% similarity with the sequence of hybC that is available in the NCBI database. The plasmid was obtained by digesting the PCR product with restriction enzyme BamHI and NotI, and then ligating with the resulting digest within the BamHI and NotI sites of pETDuet-1. The plasmid was then transformed via heatshock into host strain SS1. Selection for the presence of plasmids was carried out in the presence of 50μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies grown on the agar plate in the presence of ampicillin were selected randomly for colony PCR to determine the presence of insert DNA in plasmid. Plasmid extraction was performed using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. The positive transformants carrying plasmid with insertion of hybC produced a single band with approximately 2kb as shown in Fig. 1 . Upon nucleotide sequencing of plasmids, the DNA inserts were confirmed as hybC. Vector pETDuet-1 is driven by the T7-lac promoter, lac expression systems are typically induced using IPTG. In this study, expression of recombinant hybC protein using IPTG was not demonstrated due to the lactose which present in the tryptone that was used in the preparation of medium could induce the expression systems."
4,Batch fermentation,"2.3 Batch fermentation The late log phase culture (approximately 12h) was transferred to serum bottles containing medium consisted of (per liter): 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.5), 1.0g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.25g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.021g of CaCl2·2H2O, 2.0mg of nicotinic acid, 0.12g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.172mg of Na2SeO3, 0.02mg of NiCl2, 6.8g of yeast extract, 6.8g of tryptone, and 10mL of trace element solution [11]. The trace element solution contained (per liter) 0.5g of MnCl2·4H2O, 0.1g of H3BO4, 0.01g of AlK(SO4)2·H2O, 1.0mg of CuCl2·2H2O and 0.5g of Na2EDTA. According to previous study [12], E. coli SS1 showed the highest hydrogen and ethanol co-production yield at glycerol concentration of 10g/L. Thus, pure glycerol of 10g/L was used as substrate in this study. The medium with a total volume of 75mL was sparged with nitrogen gas for 15min. The anaerobic fermentation was carried out at temperature of 37°C with an agitation speed of 120rpm. The sampling was done for fermentation time at (h): 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72. The OD600, pH level and gas production were monitored during the course of experiments. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Anaerobic fermentation was repeated using glucose as substrate to compare the glycerol fermentation and glucose fermentation by wild-type E. coli SS1 and the recombinant hybC. Glucose was sterilized separately from medium by using membrane filtration through 0.2μm membranes. The medium was prepared by substituting glycerol to glucose of 10g/L. Noted that 1mol of glycerol and glucose carry same percentage of carbon atoms (40%), concentration of the glucose used was similar as glycerol to ensure the amount of carbon source supplied in both fermentation was same (0.11mol)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The optical density was estimated by spectrophotometric analysis to measure relative cell mass indirectly. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 600nm. Evolved gas was collected in Hungate tubes using water displacement method. Hydrogen gas composition and concentration were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC7890A-Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a CP-carboPLOT P7 column. Fermentation broth was collected and centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10min. The supernatant was used for both ethanol and glycerol analysis. The diluted supernatant was filtered through 0.2μm membranes. Ethanol was measured by gas chromatography (GC7890A-Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-WAX column. Helium was used as a carrier gas. Glycerol concentration was measured using glycerol assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Glucose concentration was monitored by performing glucose assay analysis (Biovision).The hydrogen and ethanol produced were expressed in terms of yield and productivity. Product yield was calculated by dividing the amount of product (mol) by the amount of substrate consumed (mol). Productivity was expressed as mol of product produced per liter of medium per hour, calculated by the maximum of product yield (mol/L) divided by time in hour [13]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Cell growth of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation,"3.1 Cell growth of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation The E. coli wild-type SS1 and recombinant strain with additional copy of hybC were subjected to glycerol and glucose fermentation at initial pH7.5, respectively to study their hydrogen and ethanol co-production profile. Wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC had exponential growth at first 12h during glycerol fermentation as shown in Fig. 2a . The recombinant hybC reached maximum OD600 as high as 3.04 which was approximately 2-fold higher than wild-type SS1 (OD600 =1.70). During glucose fermentation, both of wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC had exponential growth at first 6h approaching OD600 approximately 3.30 and reached stationary phase, respectively. The recombinant hybC had approximately 2-fold higher cell growth than wild-type SS1 during glycerol fermentation probably due to hybC gene plays a role for anaerobic cell growth using glycerol as carbon source under slightly alkaline condition. The observation was in agreement to the previous study of Sanchez-Torres et al. [14] suggested that Hydrogenase 2 is required to have optimum growth using glycerol as sole carbon source. The authors reported that hybC knockout mutant had 2-fold lower cell growth compared to wild-type after 120h of glycerol fermentation at initial pH7.5. Nevertheless, wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC showed fairly the same cell growth indicating hybC gene did not play a role in anaerobic cell growth during glucose fermentation at initial pH7.5. The cell growth of wild-type SS1 during glucose fermentation had doubled in comparison to glycerol fermentation. This observation was in agreement with Chaudhary et al. [15] who reported that the cell growth rate of E. coli K12 in glucose fermentation was higher than that of glycerol fermentation."
8,Glycerol consumption of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation,"3.2 Glycerol consumption of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation Substrate consumption was monitored during the course of experiment. At initial pH7.5, wild-type SS1 consumed glycerol proportionally with time for a duration of 72h, while glycerol consumption of recombinant hybC occurred predominantly within the first 12h as shown in Fig. 2b. Total glycerol consumed by both strains was approximately in the range of 7.30 to 7.60g/L after 48h. Approximately 8.8g/L of glucose was consumed rapidly by both wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC within 12h of fermentation at initial pH7.5, respectively. As for glycerol fermentation, the recombinant hybC (0.591g/L/h) had about 5.2-fold higher glycerol consumption rate than wild-type SS1 (0.113g/L/h) at initial pH7.5. Thus, it was proposed that additional copy of hybC could accelerate glycerol metabolism (further discussion in Section 3.5) at slightly alkaline condition. However, both strains had about the same glucose consumption rate suggesting that an additional copy of hybC did not play a role in glucose metabolism at initial pH7.5."
9,Hydrogen production of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation,"3.3 Hydrogen production of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation Fig. 2c illustrates the cumulative hydrogen production of wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC during glycerol and glucose fermentation at initial pH7.5. Wild-type SS1 produced gas gradually accumulating 80mL of hydrogen within 48h of fermentation when glycerol was used. On the other hand, the recombinant hybC produced 11mL of accumulated hydrogen within 12h of fermentation, and gas was scarcely produced after 12h. This was probably due to glycerol consumption that occurred predominantly within the first 12h. As for glucose fermentation, the cumulative hydrogen production had an exponential phase within 12h for both wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC, accumulating 59 and 55mL of hydrogen, respectively. The hydrogen yield and productivity of wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC are presented in Table 1 . The recombinant hybC had reduced hydrogen yield by 4-fold compared to wild-type SS1 during glycerol fermentation at initial pH7.5, probably due to the fact that the additional copy of hybC had negatively affected the hydrogen production by SS1 when glycerol was used as substrate. Trchounian and Trchounian [8] revealed that hybC knockout mutant had lower hydrogen production rate at pH7.5 in comparison to wild-type, and thus hypothesized that Hydrogenase 2 was responsible for hydrogen production during glycerol fermentation under alkaline condition. However, it was later opposed by Sanchez-Torres et al. [14] whom proposed that the diminished glycerol utilization capability was the primary factor of low hydrogen production by hybC mutant. Moreover, variation of this study and the findings by Trchounian and Trchounian [8] might be due to differences in medium composition and the characteristic of microorganism used. At initial pH5.8, the recombinant hybC was found to produce hydrogen yield of 0.04±0.03mol/mol glycerol which was about 11-fold lower than wild-type SS1. In contrary, recombinant hycE in the previous study [7] showed improved hydrogen yield (0.65mol/mol glycerol). This indicated that additional copy of hybC gene could reduce hydrogen yield regardless of pH, probably due to the mechanism involved which will be discussed in Section 3.5. For glucose fermentation in the present study, the recombinant hybC showed comparable hydrogen yield and productivity with wild-type SS1. It was suggested that recombinant hybC gene does not play a major role in glucose fermentation at initial pH7.5. According to Fan et al. [16], hybC knockout mutant had comparable hydrogen production rate and 1.3-fold higher hydrogen yield (0.70mol/mol glucose) compared to wild-type E. coli W3110 (0.54mol/mol glucose) at pH7.6. On the other hand, Trchounian and Trchounian [8] reported that hybC knockout mutant had about 10% increased hydrogen production rate during glucose fermentation at pH7.5 in comparison to wild-type. The outcome of these studies indicated hydrogen uptake characteristic of Hydrogenase 2 at slightly alkaline condition when glucose was used as substrate, which reflects the conflict with the observation of this study. Yet, the increment in hydrogen yield and productivity of mutants as reported by these studies (10–30%) were considered minor. In comparison to glycerol fermentation, hydrogen yield in glucose fermentation was higher. As for reason, 1mol of glucose could generate 2mol of hydrogen theoretically, which is higher than the theoretical yield when glycerol is used as carbon source. The higher hydrogen productivity in glucose fermentation in both wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC was probably attributed by higher cell growth. This was in agreement with Trchounian and Trchounian [8] that demonstrated hydrogen production by E. coli BW25113 using glycerol was 2.5-fold lower than that using glucose."
10,Ethanol production of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation,"3.4 Ethanol production of E. coli SS1 and its recombinant during fermentation As shown in Fig. 2d, ethanol was produced proportionally by wild-type SS1 approaching a maximum concentration of 3.20g/L after 48h during glycerol fermentation at initial pH7.5. The recombinant hybC produced ethanol achieving approximately 2.44g/L within 12h of fermentation. As for glucose fermentation at initial pH7.5, the ethanol production of both wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC occurred exponentially within 12h yielding 1.30g/L and plateaued after 12h. The ethanol yield and productivity of wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC at initial pH7.5 are presented in Table 1. The ethanol yield of recombinant hybC obtained in glycerol fermentation was lower than the wild-type SS1, whereas no prominent change of ethanol yield was observed between both strains during glucose fermentation. This indicated that the bioconversion of glycerol into ethanol was affected by the additional copy of hybC gene. The ethanol yield of recombinant hybC was found to decrease further under acidic condition and achieved approximately 0.31mol/mol glycerol at initial pH5.8 (data not shown). The lower ethanol yield (0.50mol/mol glycerol) was also observed in the recombinant hycE at initial pH5.8 [7]. Albeit lower ethanol was yielded by recombinant hybC during glycerol fermentation, the ethanol productivity was 3-fold higher in comparison to wild-type SS1 at initial pH7.5, probably due to higher consumption rate of glycerol and higher cell growth. It was noted that the ethanol yield of wild-type SS1 obtained in glucose fermentation was lower than glycerol fermentation. In theory, both glycerol and glucose could yield similar molar of ethanol which is one mole of ethanol per mole substrate. However, wild-type SS1 tends to produce higher ethanol yield from glycerol rather than glucose. Yet, the ethanol productivity of glucose fermentation was higher than glycerol probably due to higher cell growth. The outcome of this study elucidated the remarkable effect of hybC in glycerol consumption at initial pH7.5. For comparison, Yazdani and Gonzalez [5] constructed a recombinant strain by simultaneously overexpressing gldA and dhaKLM genes in combination with deletion of frdA and pta genes. The hydrogen and ethanol yield of the engineered strain approached theoretical yield. However, the fermentation rate was low and the engineered strain took 120h to consume about 8g/L (86.96mmol/L) of glycerol. Thapa et al. [17] reported that ethanol production of the recombinant (3.01g/L) overexpressed with alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate fumarate-lyase increased by 2-fold over wild-type (1.45g/L). Tran et al. [18] had successfully created the engineered E. coli (0.67mol/mol glycerol) that was able to produce 4.5-fold higher hydrogen yield than parent strain (0.15mol/mol glycerol) after 24h of fermentation and achieve the theoretical yield after 48h. The engineered strain was constructed by multiple knockout of fumarate reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, nitrate reductase, methylglyoxal synthase, and a regulator of the transcriptional regulator FhlA. In comparison to the recombinant strains in literature, recombinant hybC exhibited comparable performance in terms of glycerol consumption rate and ethanol productivity."
11,Metabolism involved in hydrogen and ethanol co-production using glycerol and glucose,"3.5 Metabolism involved in hydrogen and ethanol co-production using glycerol and glucose It was observed that cell growth, glycerol consumption rate, hydrogen and ethanol productivity of wild-type SS1 during glucose fermentation was higher in comparison to glycerol. These observations could be explained by the difference in glucose metabolic pathway of E. coli from that of glycerol [4]. Glucose is converted into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate followed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then converted into 2mol of phosphoenolpyruvate, yielding 2mol of NADH. A mole of pyruvate is produced from each mole of phosphoenolpyruvate. In contrary to glycerol metabolism that produces 1mol of pyruvate, there are 2mol of pyruvate yielded from glucose. However, the NADH yielded is similar in both glucose and glycerol metabolism. For glucose metabolism, the available NADH is insufficient for conversion of 2mol of pyruvate into 2mol of ethanol. Instead of producing 2mol of ethanol, one of the pyruvate is converted into acetate in which no NADH required during the process. Concurrently, 2mol of hydrogen are generated from 2mol of pyruvate. Hence, 1mol of glucose could yield 1mol of ethanol, 1mol of acetate, and 2mol of hydrogen theoretically. This explained the higher hydrogen yield of wild-type SS1 when glucose was used as substrate in comparison to glycerol fermentation. Production of high levels of acetate might clarify the drop of medium pH in greater extent to pH under 6.0 for glucose fermentation by wild-type SS1 (not shown). According to Trchounian and Trchounian [8], medium pH decreased scarcely from 7.50 to 7.25 for glycerol fermentation, whereas pH decreased from 7.50 to 6.78 during glucose fermentation due to higher levels of organic acids formation. The conversion of glucose to hydrogen and ethanol in addition to acetate production produce 3mol of net ATP. In contrast to glycerol metabolism that produce only 1mol of net ATP, glucose fermentation yields higher ATP leading to higher cell density. Subsequently, the higher cell density leads to higher substrate consumption rate as well as hydrogen and ethanol productivity of wild-type SS1 during glucose fermentation. The recombinant with additional copy of hybC which encoded large subunit of Hydrogenase 2 had impaired hydrogen and ethanol yield during glycerol fermentation at initial pH7.5. There was noticeable drop of medium pH at the early stage of fermentation using recombinant hybC. The additional copy of hybC gene seems leading to high accumulation of acidic products after 12h of fermentation that inhibited cell growth and eventually affected the glycerol consumption as well as hydrogen and ethanol production as shown in Fig. 3 . Hydrogenase 2 is a membrane-bound hydrogenase that involved in periplasmic hydrogen uptake by catalyzing the oxidation of H2 to H+ and have an optimal gene expression at slightly alkaline condition [19]. It was believed that additional copy of hybC gene had converted the H2 into H+ at higher rate during fermentation at initial pH7.5. This statement explains the drastic decrease of medium pH during fermentation using recombinant hybC. The increased acidity of medium had eventually disrupted enzyme activity as well as cell growth of recombinant hybC. As a result, glycerol consumption was halted and hydrogen as well as ethanol yield were impaired. Another potential reason is that additional copy of hybC resulted in lower pH in the cytoplasm. The increase of acidity in the cell could lead to activation of formate transporter to reduce formate concentration [20]. Thus, formation of hydrogen from formate via formate hydrogen lyase was inhibited, and subsequently hybC activity, glycerol consumption as well as ethanol production were repressed. Nevertheless, the recombinant hybC exhibited remarkably cell growth, glycerol consumption rate and ethanol productivity in comparison to wild-type SS1 at initial pH7.5. This suggested that additional copy of hybC had altered the glycerol metabolic pathway of SS1 at slightly alkaline condition. Glycerol dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are enzymes catalyzing the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to phosphoenolpyruvate, respectively. Both of the enzymes involve in the glycerol metabolism by reducing NAD+ to NADH. The additional copy of hybC gene had apparently triggered high oxidation levels of H2 to H+ in the periplasm and thus generated excess electrons that could be used to reduce NAD+ to NADH on the cytoplasmic (Fig. 4 ). Subsequently, both the glycerol dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were activated, thus increasing the rate of glycerol consumption by the recombinant hybC. This might explain the reason in the previous study done by Sanchez-Torres et al. [14] that claimed Hydrogenase 2 might be important for glycerol metabolism at slightly alkaline conditions. Sanchez-Torres et al. [14] reported that hybC mutants exhibited impaired glycerol consumption at pH7.5 accompanied with lower gene expression of gldA and dhaK. GldA and dhaK are genes encoded glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase, respectively. Both genes have optimum activity at slightly alkaline condition, as well as hybC gene. Apparently, hybC gene had contributed in glycerol metabolism pathway by regulating related genes with hydrogen redox reactions. The conversion of glycerol to pyruvate by E. coli would synthesize one mole of ATP to provide energy by substrate-level phosphorylation. The acceleration of glycerol dissimilation to pyruvate may allow higher ATP production, thus recombinant hybC achieved higher cell density in comparison to wild-type SS1. The higher rate of glycerol degradation by recombinant hybC had apparently accelerated fermentation process, subsequently led to higher ethanol productivity to recycle high levels of NADH to NAD+. As mentioned earlier, glycerol metabolism in E. coli generates hydrogen and ethanol simultaneously. It was expected that hydrogen productivity would increase proportionally with ethanol productivity in recombinant hybC. However, hydrogen accumulated by recombinant hybC was diminished attributed by the characteristic of hydrogen uptake of Hydrogenase 2. As for comparison study, the cell growth, glucose consumption, hydrogen and ethanol yield as well as productivity were fairly the same for both wild-type SS1 and recombinant at initial pH7.5 when glucose was used as substrate. This finding demonstrated that glucose fermentation using E. coli SS1 was not affected by the additional copy of hybC gene under this condition. In comparison to glycerol metabolism, the glucose metabolism in E. coli involves more enzymatic reactions including glucokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and phosphofruckinase. The additional copy of hybC might increase the level of H+ as well as NADH synthesis, hence stimulating conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into phosphoenolpyruvate. Nevertheless, the former pathways that convert glucose into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate were apparently not being stimulated. As a result, the rate of glucose consumption was not as fast as in glycerol."
12,Conclusion,"Additional copy of native hydrogenase gene hybC could improve substrate consumption rate and ethanol productivity by E. coli SS1 despite lower product yields under glycerol fermentation at initial pH7.5. Hydrogen and ethanol co-production of E. coli SS1 and recombinant hybC showed about the same performance in terms of product yields, cell growth and substrate consumption when glucose was used as substrate. This suggested hybC gene could play a significant role in glycerol consumption and it could be worth to investigate ethanol production by recombinant hybC. The acidic products which caused the drastic drops of medium pH during fermentation could be eliminated through genetic modification. Further study on strain improvement would be a potential strategy for future development of biofuel production using glycerol-containing wastewater from biodiesel industries."
