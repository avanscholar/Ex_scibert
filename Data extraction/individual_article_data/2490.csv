0,Introduction,"With the significant increase in the levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere, considerable effort has been directed toward the development of methods for efficient CO2 utilization. There is a wide range of literature on this topic [1,2]. Practically, CO2 is a relatively inert and stable molecule (ΔG˚ = –400 kJ·mol−1) that requires a catalyst and input energy to be activated and converted into another chemical form [3–7]. CO2 has attracted considerable attention as a C building block for generating high-value renewable solar fuels, and photocatalytic reduction (photoreduction) is a promising approach for storing solar energy and chemically reducing CO2. In the recent few decades, many studies have been systematically examined and published on this subject [8–28]. However, the current conversion rate is unsatisfactory, emphasizing the need for further studies [1]. Many reducing substances can function as both H2 sources and hole scavenges (also referred to as “electron donors”) for promoting CO2 reduction (e.g., water (H2O), H2, methane (CH4), and alcohols such as methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH)), leading to different high-value chemical products [29]. According to previous studies, C-free reductants, such as H2O and H2, drive the generation of C1 products, whereas C-containing reductants, such as CH4, CH3OH, and C2H5OH, yield C2 and C3 products [30]. The H2 source can be simply obtained via electrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting [31–43]. To focus on the eco-friendly, renewable production of high-value chemicals from CO2, C-free reductants, including H2O and H2, are investigated in this review. The photoreduction of CO2 with H2O is of particular interest. Very early, Inoue et al. presented a potential approach for reducing CO2 to organic compounds such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methyl alcohol, and methane using H2O [44]. Subsequently, many studies were conducted on heterogeneous photocatalytic systems for elucidating the fundamental mechanisms, and inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts were engineered to capture light and accelerate the chemical reactions productively. Homogeneous photocatalytic systems have been used for the latter; however, molecular photosensitizers (dyes) could not provide a more realistic and robust concept [45]. According to the theoretical changes of the Gibbs free energy (ΔGr˚) for CO2 reduction to generate hydrocarbons, such as CH3OH and CH4, the hydrogenation of CO2 by H2 to produce hydrocarbons (Eqs. (1) and (2)) is more feasible than the reduction of CO2 by H2O (Eqs. (3) and (4)) from a thermodynamic viewpoint [30]. (1) CO2,( g ) + 3H2,( g ) → CH3OH( g ) + H2O( g ) ΔGr˚ = 2.9 kJ·mol−1 (2) CO2,( g ) + 4H2,( g ) → CH4 ( g ) + 2H2O( g ) ΔGr˚ = –113.6 kJ·mol−1 (3) CO2,( g ) + 2H2O( g ) → CH3OH + 3/2O2,( g ) ΔGr˚ = 689 kJ·mol−1 (4) CO2,( g ) + 2H2O( g ) → CH4 + 2O2,( g ) ΔGr˚ = 818.3 kJ·mol−1 To learn this theory, photocatalytic reduction (photoreduction) of CO2 by H2 gas as a sacrificial electron donor under light irradiation has been proposed. This promising approach not only spontaneously hydrogenates CO2 emission but also simultaneously transforms CO2 into renewable organic compounds, such as methanol and hydrocarbons. Thampi et al. first reported photo-hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4 (49 µmol·gcat −1·h−1) by H2 over Ru/RuOx/TiO2 using a solar simulator (319 K; 80 mW·cm−2) [46]. In addition to CH4 [47–50], other products, such as carbon monoxide (CO) [47–62], ethane (C2H6) [47,50,54], and CH3OH [60,61,63–65] have been obtained, depending on the photocatalytic materials and experimental conditions. Artificial photosynthesis—another promising approach that was recently proposed—combines solar-driven water splitting and CO2 reduction and is based on natural photosynthesis, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this method, active H, which is directly produced from photocatalytic water splitting, is continuously used for the photoreduction of CO2 to produce solar fuel in the same photocatalytic systems. Guan et al. first proposed mimicking the natural photosynthesis process by using hybrid photocatalysts [66]. In this regard, the active H, which was directly supplied via the sustainable photocatalytic water splitting, was continuously used for the photo-hydrogenation of CO2 over hybrid photocatalysts to produce organic compounds. Up to date, several review articles are covering structural engineering semiconductors, particular materials, their structure and applications for photoreduction of CO2, such as sunlight‐driven photocatalysts [13], crystal phase engineering on photocatalysts [67], metal‐free‐based materials [68], ultrathin structured photocatalysts [69], cocatalysts [70], Bismuth-based photocatalysts [71]. Additionally, other reviews concentrate on tuning product selectivity [72], surface strategies for particulate photocatalysts [73], general aspects of light‐driven C1 chemistry, including solar Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the water‐gas‐shift reaction, CO2 hydrogenation, as well as methane and methanol conversion reactions [74]. Since the overall knowledge of chemical engineering for transforming the CO2 into value-added products using energy-efficient processes has significantly increased in the last decade. To differentiate from these recent reviews, we focus on the utilization of different sustainable H2 sources for the photoreduction of CO2 to obtain value-added organic products. Various photocatalysts, photoreactor configurations, and reaction parameters for the photoreduction of CO2 are discussed. For future research endeavors, a general approach for the photoreduction of CO2 to mimic natural photosynthesis, in which the H2 source is provided directly during the photocatalytic water splitting, is proposed and verified to successfully generate value-added organic products."
1,Photo-hydrogenation of CO2 toward solar products,
2,Understanding the roles and mechanism of H2 sources,"2.1 Understanding the roles and mechanism of H2 sources The mechanism of CO2 photoreduction is complex. There has been intense debated regarding the roles of active H, including molecular H2 and atomic H+, in the photoreduction of CO2. Instead of molecular H2, atomic H+ has been proposed to photocatalyze CO2 reduction via the proton-coupled multi-electron transfer processes, as follows [75]: (5) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → HCOOH (6) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O (7) CO2 + 4H+ + 4e− → HCHO + H2O (8) CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O (9) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2 H2O Li et al. performed an isotope experiment in a D2O, CO2, and H2 atmosphere with Ru/NaTaO3 for verifying whether the H2 source was water (D2O) or H2 in the products [49]. In the initial reaction, the H2 in methane was mainly derived from water (D2O), with CD4 as the primary product. Other products, including CD3H and CD2H2, were observed after several hours of the reaction. The results indicated that the active atomic H from the water source directly reduced CO2 into solar products, while the molecular H2 gas promoted the conversion of peroxide intermediates (O2*) into the water, as shown in Fig. 2 . According to the proton-coupled multi-electron transfer concept, Chen et al. successfully fused Halobacterium purple membrane-derived vesicles (PMVs) onto the surface of Pd-deposited porous hollow TiO2 NPs (Pd-HTNPs), which were then employed for CO2 photoreduction, as shown in Fig. 3 a [75]. As expected, a well-defined core–shell structure was observed (Fig. 3b and 3c). As shown in Fig. 3d, CH4 and CO were detected. For CH4, the production rate (56.4 μmol·gcat −1·h−1) and selectivity (95.2%) were high. In blank tests in the absence of the biohybrids (Pd-HTNPs@PMVs), light, or CO2 (N2 atmosphere), no catalytic performance was observed. The proton-coupled multi-electron transfer processes played an important role in the reduction of CO2 into fuels and value-added chemicals, as shown in Fig. 3e. As PtOx NPs have proven to be effective active sites for the direct splitting of water [76], PtOx NPs with a particle size of 2 nm were deposited on Bi2WO6 nanosheets (Fig. 4 b), which were then applied for the photoreduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons [77]. As expected, the product yield initially increased with the PtOx loading; the optimal CH4 production rate (108.8 ppm·g−1·h−1) was observed at 0.5%PtOx (Fig. 4a). Wang et al. confirmed the role of the proton-coupled multi-electron transfer processes in accelerating CO2 photoreduction, as shown in Fig. 4c. In addition to the H2 source from water, molecular H2, or atomic H+ intermediates [78], the idea to use H2-storage material to promote the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has received attention. Kang et al. reported that N2H4·H2O, which had a high content of H2 (7.9%), effectively worked as the H2 source and electron donor over Au3Cu@SrTiO3/TiO2 nanotube arrays [64]. Based on this system, CH4 was the primary product (an evolution rate of 421.2 µmol·g−1·h−1), which accounted 60% of the total hydrocarbon products. Interestingly, N2H4·H2O could generate a productive reductive atmosphere to protect and maintain the high stability of the Au3Cu@SrTiO3/TiO2 nanotube arrays. As expected, the evolution rate of CH4 still retained 87.6% of its original activity after five cycles of measurement during a 34 h test. In summary, the concept of using H2 source as reductants for CO2 conversion might potentially impact solar fuel production. Many H2 sources have been proposed, including water, molecular H2, H2-storage materials, or atomic H+ intermediates, which could offer advantages of enhancing photocatalytic activity and prolonging their performances. It believes that these feasible routes would bring promising concepts on designing reaction conditions and developing photocatalysts to potentially promote the efficiency of photoreduction of CO2."
3,Photocatalysts,"2.2 Photocatalysts Photon-assisted CO2 hydrogenation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This method can efficiently convert CO2 into high-value chemicals (e.g., CO, CH4, CH3OH, C2H4). It has considerable potential to address current CO2 issues because the use of H2 as the reductant significantly enhances the product yield [51,79]. In this section, the materials employed for four types of CO2 conversion reactions—CO2-to-CO (reverse water–gas shift, RWGS), CO2-to-CH3OH, CO2-to-CH4 (methanation reaction), and CO2-to-C2+ (hydrogenation reaction)—are discussed in detail. 2.2.1 Reverse water–gas shift To date, many candidates have been highlighted as potential photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 [26]. Typically, In2O3-based catalysts are a promising candidate for the photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations revealed that In2O3 containing O vacancies is favorable for the activation and hydrogenation of CO2 [80,81]. Ghuman et al. reported that In2O3− x (OH) y consisting of surface hydroxide groups, and O vacancies facilitated photoinduced CO2-to-CO conversion. In2O3− x (OH) y catalysts promote the heterolytic dissociation of H2, which results in hydride- and proton-like H bonding to In atoms and the hydroxide group, respectively. Such as-formed species facilitate the interaction and electron transfer to the adsorbed CO2 molecules [82]. In another study, He et al. prepared In2O3− x (OH) y nanorods to catalyze the solar-driven RWGS reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) in a gas-phase medium. The In2O3− x (OH) y nanorod superstructure prepared via a two-step synthesis process prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers owing to interparticle charge transfer. Owing to the unique properties of In2O3− x (OH) y and the nanorod superstructure comprising nanocrystals, the prepared In2O3− x (OH)y catalyst exhibited a significant enhancement in the light-assisted RWGS reaction [83]. Recently, Wang et al. constructed an In2O3−x(OH)y@Nb2O5 heterostructure, which exhibited a superior improvement in the photoinduced RWGS reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . This nanocomposite was prepared via a simple two-step synthesis process involving the preparation of In(OH)3@Nb2O5, followed by calcination, to obtain an In2O3−x(OH)y@Nb2O5 composite, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The resulting heterostructure exhibited extraordinary performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, as shown in Fig. 5b. The CO production rate was 44 times higher than that of pristine In2O3−x(OH)y. This improvement was due to the presence of O vacancies and hydroxides, as well as the heterostructure-induced prolonged charge-carrier lifetimes, as shown in Fig. 5c. The O vacancies and hydroxides functioned as reservoirs for photoexcited electrons and holes, respectively, whereas the heterostructure encouraged charge separation, stabilizing the excited states [84]. The use of metal nanoparticle (NP)/metal oxide catalysts arouses concern as the crucial approach in the RWGS reaction because metals induce the dissociation of H2, whereas metal oxides offer a medium for CO2 adsorption and activation [85–87]. In this case, the irradiated light induces the generation of charge carriers, which can not only improve the dissociation of H2 but also reduce the activation barrier, enhancing the selectivity [86,88,89]. For example, Upadhye et al. investigated the activity of an Au/TiO2 nanocomposite for the RWGS reaction under visible light. The Au NP-incorporated TiO2 enhanced the CO2-to-CO performance owing to the decrease in the apparent activation energy from 47 to 35 kJ·mol−1 under irradiation. This improvement was explained by localized surface plasmon resonance-induced Au NPs, which enhanced the reaction kinetics [90]. Jia et al. reported that a Pd/N2O5 nanocomposite was sufficient for the production of CO from CO2 and H2. The enhanced activity originated from the photothermal effect of Pd “nanoheaters” generating heat. Moreover, numerous H atoms, which resulted from the dissociation of H2 on Pd nanocrystals and spillover to Nb2O5 nanorods and were associated with the in situ formation of O vacancies and/or the reduced Nb oxidation state, significantly promoted the reaction between CO2 and H2 to produce CO [91]. In another study, the Pd/HyWO3-x heterostructure was demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for the light-assisted RWGS reaction. This enhancement was due to the coexistence of Brønsted acid hydroxyls OH, W(V) sites, and O vacancies (Vo), which were achieved by a hydrogenation process. Notably, the Pd NPs decorated on WO3 significantly contributed to the formation of the defective structure of WO3 because they facilitated the dissociation of H2 via spillover of H to the WO3 surface. Consequently, numerous modifications, such as Brønsted acid hydroxyls OH, W(V) sites, and O vacancies (Vo), occurred. These outstanding properties reduced the apparent activation energy, along with the light irradiation. Therefore, a large amount CO could be produced over Pd/HyWO3-x [92]. In another study, by exploiting these features, Li et al. prepared a novel Cu-decorated nanowire Pd/HyWO3-x bronze heterostructure, representing a step toward improving the RWGS reaction. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the presence of Cu on Pd/WO3 significantly increased the amount of CO produced in comparison with the sample prepared without Cu. Furthermore, the Cu-modified Pd/WO3 exhibited significantly lower activation energy for the production of CO (32.2 kJ·mol−1 in the dark and 29.3 kJ·mol−1 under illumination), suggesting efficient CO2-to-CO reduction over the Cu-modified Pd/WO3, as shown in Fig. 6b. The Cu-modified Pd/WO3 promoted the reduction of CO2 via the formation of Cu-bound carboxylate intermediates, which was beneficial for the CO formation, as shown in Fig. 6c and 6d [93]. 2.2.2 CO2-to-CH3OH conversion The production of CH3OH via CO2 hydrogenation (CO2 + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O) is a critical obstacle because of (i) the competing RWGS reaction, (ii) the exothermic nature of the methanol formation reaction, and (iii) the high activation barrier [94]. Thus, the efficiency of the reaction is limited. Motivated by these challenges, in 2018, Wang et al. performed an extraordinary investigation into the CO2-to-CH3OH conversion over In2O3−x(OH)y rod-like nanocrystals. The CH3OH product was abundantly formed with the increasing hydrogenation temperature under light-assisted conditions. This was explained by the kinetic inhibition of the production of methanol at the low temperature and pressure, as shown in Fig. 7 a–c. Notably, the amount of CH3OH obtained via the hydrogenation approach was significantly higher than that for the best-known photocatalysts, indicating the potential of this method. Fig. 7d shows the reaction pathway for CH3OH formation. Unique surface properties significantly impact the reaction pathway, driving the formation of CH3OH. In this case, the irradiation strengthens the surface frustrated Lewis pairs, improving the reactivity for H2 activation and reducing the activation barrier [95]. The hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH is promising but rarely reported. Research in the field of catalysis is expended to grow significantly in the future, which can eventually lead to large-scale solar-driven CO2-to-fuel production. 2.2.3 CO2-to-methane (CH4) conversion Considering the potential solar fuel of methane (CH4) and the environmental point of view of CO2, photo-hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4 has been proposed as a viable approach to producing high-value chemicals, which can be used for chemical storage [96]. Solar-driven production of CH4 from CO2 and H2 is promising because it is eco-friendly and inexpensive [50,97,98]. However, the performance of the CO2-to-CH4 reaction is limited, even though the reaction is thermodynamically favored (CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O; ΔG298K = –130.8 kJ·mol−1). This reaction involves an eight-electron process, which is a significant kinetic restriction [99,100]. Therefore, the catalysts play an essential role in driving the reaction and increasing the amount of CH4 produced. In the past decade, considerable effort has been directed toward the investigation of robust catalysts for solar-driven CO2-to-CH4 hydrogenation [9,101–105]. The use of nanocomposites consisting of metal, metal oxide, and/or C-based materials is an attractive approach because the synergistic effects of the components significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption, activation, and local thermal effect, facilitating the CH4 formation. For instance, Ren et al. used Ru-anchored ultrathin layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to promote photothermal CO2 methanation. The Ru-LDHs composite was a very active catalyst for the formation of CH4 from CO2 under light irradiation, owing to the efficient CO2 and H2 activation [103]. Mateo et al. recently prepared a RuO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure that significantly enhanced the generation of CH4. The RuO2-decorated SrTiO3 exhibited high CH4 production performance (up to 14.6 mmol·h−1·g−1 in the optimized condition), as shown in Fig. 8 a and 8b. This nanocomposite had a high CO2 adsorption capacity because of the SrTiO3, and the local thermal effect at the Ru sites caused by charge separation and recombination was sufficient to drive the methanation reaction on the Ru NPs [102]. Recently, there are some candidates have been proposed for selective photoreduction of CO2, which offer various advantages, including low-cost materials, high chemical/thermal stability. In typical, Barrio et al. recently reported the methanation of CO2 using a Ni/g-C3N4 nanocomposite synthesized from supramolecular, followed by Ni2+ impregnation and H2 treatment. Fig. 8c shows the evolved CH4 from various g-C3N4 and Ni/g-C3N4 samples, indicating the superior CH4 formation over the Ni/g-C3N4 composite compared with the pristine g-C3N4. The optimized sample—Ni(25)/g-CN—produced CH4 with a rate of 28 µmol·g−1·h−1, which was approximate ~ 10.3 times higher than that of the g-CN sample [106]. This outstanding activity originated from the efficient charge-carrier separation and transportation from g-C3N4 to Ni NPs. The generated electrons easily migrated from g-CN to Ni species, resulting in electron-rich reactive sites with an improved affinity for CO2 and H2. These advantages associated with the high reaction temperature improved the reactivity and methane formation, as shown in Fig. 8d [106]. In another study, Tahir et al. successfully designed montmorillonite (Mt) coupled with modified g-C3N4 (m-CN) 2D/2D hybrid composite [107], oxygen-defective OV-Ti3AlC2 with proton-rich functionalized carbon nitride (f-C3N4) [108], for CO2 reduction to fuels. They found that the CO and CH4 yield rate could reach to 253 and 165 µmol·g−1·h−1, respectively, over Mt/g-C3N4 photocatalyst.Photocatalytic conversion CO2-to-CH4 is a promising valuable source of renewable energy. Recently, the findings of metals free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal carbides compounds (MAX) materials, has opened a very bright future to develop non-noble metal catalysts for the light-driven methanation of CO2. Reducing the size of Ni species to a Ni cluster or a single atom (SA) is expected to result in extraordinary performance for CH4 generation. In this aspect, the efficiency of Ni can be improved while reducing the amount of loaded Ni species. Li et al. recently prepared single Ni atom catalyst-anchored ultrathin amorphous Y2O3 nanosheets exhibiting a superior CO2-to-CH4 conversion ability. The preparation of the SA Ni/Y2O3 nanosheet composites involved three steps, as shown in Fig. 9 a. Graphene oxide (GO) was utilized as a support for the Ni2+ and Y2+ ion adsorption caused by the interaction between metal ions and GO prior to the freeze-drying and calcination. The Ni SAs were uniformly decorated on the Y2O3 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 9b. In the SA Ni-Y2O3 nanosheets (Fig. 9c), the Ni SAs formed Ni-O bonds with neighboring O atoms of Y2O3. These bonds stabilized the Ni SAs, restricting their aggregation into Ni NPs during the calcination step. The temperature under simulated solar light (1.0 kW·m−2) was as high as ~ 255 °C (Fig. 9d). Furthermore, the temperature of the SA Ni/Y2O3 nanosheets under the assistance of a selective light absorber (AlNx/Al foil) reached 285 °C under 1.0 kW·m−2 when the gas inlet and outlet were encapsulated by thermal insulating covers, as shown in Fig. 9e. In this condition, the CO2 conversion rate approached 90%, with very high CH4 selectivity. These results indicate the extraordinary catalytic CO2 methanation of the SA Ni-Y2O3 nanosheets. Fig. 9f and 9 g show the solar flux and the CO2 reduction performance concerning the irradiation time (time of day). The Ni/Y2O3 nanosheets exhibited superior CO2 conversion under natural sunlight, suggesting that this composite is promising for solar-driven CO2 methanation [109]. These results indicate the outstanding properties of materials containing SA catalysts. The preparation of single metal atom-supported metal oxides will be a popular research topic in the coming years. Various candidates for metal SA catalysts and numerous supports can be selected to promote CO2 adsorption, activation, and reduction and enhance the product selectivity. Therefore, plenty of room will be waiting for the exploration of superior catalysts in this research field in the coming years. Graphene-based catalysts have been sufficient for the preparation of highly active materials for the light-driven production of CH4 from CO2 and H2. This is due to the unique properties of graphene, e.g., the extended π orbital, high thermal and electrical conductivities, and large specific surface area, which are beneficial for CO2 adsorption and reduction [101,110–112]. Therefore, the preparation of graphene-based composites has attracted research attention [113–115]. For instance, NiO/Ni NP-supported graphene exhibited a significant improvement in the CO2 methanation performance compared with Ni NPs supported on large-surface area silica-alumina. Graphene facilitated the charge transfer from NiO/Ni to graphene sheets, while the high reaction temperature reduced the adsorption of H2O molecules, which negatively affected the catalytic performance [104]. 2.2.4 Hydrogenation of CO2 into C2+ products The conversion of CO2 into ethanol and C2+ hydrocarbons is an attractive topic because of the higher value and energy density of C2+ products compared with C1 products [116–118]. However, the generation of C2+ products is challenging, owing to the C–C coupling reaction. The intermediates should have the appropriate binding energy for binding to the catalyst surface to promote the C–C coupling reaction [117,119–121]. Therefore, the photocatalyst surface plays a crucial role in driving the reaction, leading to the formation of C2+ with high selectivity. In 2018, Chen et al. reported the hydrogenation of CO2 into high-value products via an alumina-supported CoFe alloy catalyst, which was fabricated via the hydrogenation of CoFeAl LDH nanosheets [121]. The optimum catalyst treated at 650 °C (denoted as CoFe-650) exhibited an evolved C2+ product with high selectivity, along with a methane product, as shown in Fig. 10 a. In this case, the formation of the CoFe alloy was considered as the primary factor driving the CO2 hydrogenation that formed C2+ hydrocarbons. DFT calculations (Fig. 10b) revealed that the CoFe surface provided a lower barrier to adsorbed CH-CH2 than the Co and Fe surfaces, indicating that the CoFe alloy promoted the C–C coupling reaction. This approach provides a novel pathway for the rational design of the hydrogenation of CO2 into high-value chemical products, as shown in Fig. 10c [121]. In another study, Liu et al. found that a Na-Co@C nanocomposite had a robust capability for the photocatalytic production of C2+ hydrocarbons and ethanol (Fig. 11 a). In this case, UV light played an essential role in the generation of electrons, which were accumulated in C species. The electron-rich C species activated CO2 into CO2 δ-, and CO2 was dissociated into CO, driving the formation of ethanol. Importantly, the as-generated CO was stabilized by the C layer on the catalyst surface, while the Na affected the intermediate species, promoting the C–C formation. Such surface features are imperative for the formation of C2+ products, as shown in Fig. 11a–c [122]. In the other approach, the use of Co-based catalysts appears to provide a pathway to obtain C2+ products in light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation. It is crucial to stabilize the CO intermediate on the catalyst surface to promote the C–C coupling reaction. Furthermore, the catalyst surface with a moderate amount of C2+ products is beneficial for desorption, which can enhance the selectivity. In this context, Cu-based materials are potential candidates, as they have proven to be useful for hydrogenation and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction [123–128]. Research on the production of C2+ chemicals will become increasingly popular in the coming years. To date, various candidates, including CoFe-based catalysts, Na-Co@C nanocomposite, Co-based catalysts, Cu-based catalysts, have been successfully prepared and demonstrated as a novel photocatalytic material platform to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from CO2. From the present data, how to accumulate the charge carriers effectively and protons play a vital role to favor of the formation of C2+ products. These investigations are expected to unveil the nature of photocatalysts and provide extraordinary materials for enhancing C2+ production via photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2."
4,Photoreactor design,"2.3 Photoreactor design It notes that the efficiency of photohydrogenation of CO2 is still relatively low. Hence, several factors, such as light distribution, reaction mode, product separation, and geometries of the reactor, have gained considerable attention. These factors lead to further design and develop novel photoreactors to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 performances [8,11]. Two general types of reactors—batch- and flow-type—have been developed to perform the CO2 photohydrogenation reaction. Fig. 12 a–c describes a typical batch-type reactor system for photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. This system consists of gas suppliers, reactors, and analyzer sections. It allows in situ product analysis, and the temperature can be controlled. Therefore, both thermal- and light-assisted hydrogenation of CO2 can be performed in this system [90,129]. Another fixed-bed photoreactor (385 mL in volume) is designed by Chen et al., which is applied for the photohydrogenation of CO2 in the presence of both H2O (liquid phase) and H2 (gas phase), as displayed in Fig. 12d [9]. Herein, the photocatalyst powder is evenly placed on a flat Teflon surface, which is fixed in the middle of the photoreactor. The advantages of bath-type photoreactor are simple construction and operation, low-cost for a large-scale photoreactor. However, it frequently causes undesired second reactions or decompositions. To minimize this drawback, flow reactors have been employed in various solar-driven CO2 hydrogenation studies and have achieved promising results. Fig. 12e shows a typical design of a capillary flow-type reactor. This configuration prolongs the reactant–catalytic surface interaction time, as the gas reactants travel through the capillary reactor [82]. Another advantage of the continuous flow-type could offer accurate control of the irradiation time, light irradiation via the flow rate. In summary, several types of photoreactor have been proposed for photohydrogenation of CO2 to produce solar fuels. It is noting that some of the parameters and operating conditions, such as temperature, light distribution, reaction mode, and product separation, offer critical roles in promoting yield and selectivity to products. Although many efforts have been devoted to designing photoreactors, low surface-to-volume ratios, and inefficient light distribution are still the primary concerns. Therefore, further researches require special attention to upgrade the geometrical design of the radiation source to reaction space and improve the ratio of illuminated-light surface area to volume of photoreactor."
5,Influence of reaction mode on photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Influence of reaction mode on photocatalytic activity Xiong et al. reported that the reaction mode (solid–liquid, solid–gas, and combined solid–liquid–gas, as shown in Fig. 13 a) can influence the photocatalytic activity of Pt/TiO2. For example, the solid–liquid mode enhances the formation of H2 (H2: 47.3 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CO: 0.03 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CH4: 0.23 µmol·gcat −1·h−1), while the solid–gas mode promotes the reduction of CO2 (H2: 13.4 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CO: 0.11 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CH4: 0.73 µmol·gcat −1·h−1) [130]. As expected, combining the solid–liquid and solid–gas modes can significantly promote the photo-hydrogenation of CO2, yielding the highest CO and CH4 production rates (H2: 22.1 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CO: 0.22 µmol·gcat −1·h−1; CH4: 1.1 µmol·gcat −1·h−1). In this mode, the H2 generated by the solid–liquid interface reaction promotes the photoreduction of CO2 through the solid–gas reaction. In another study, Chen et al. did a study on three types of reaction mode, including a gas-phase, a liquid-phase, and a gas–liquid-phases, correspondingly (as shown in Fig. 13b) [11]. They found that the combined gas–liquid phases showed a remarkable result (1.1 × 10–3% in quantum efficiency), whereas the efficiency levels of the gas- and liquid-phase systems were only 0.1 × 10–3% and 0.5 × 10–3%, respectively. The observation of efficiency enhancement might be contributed by the effective utilization of both H2 in the gas phase and the atomic H+ in the liquid phase. Although the experiments were carried out in different reaction modes (such as gas, liquid, gas–liquid phases), their photocatalytic mechanisms would not be changed [11]. However, the presence of photocatalysts in different reaction modes might boost reactions toward different reaction pathways."
6,Photoreduction of CO2 for mimicking natural photosynthesis,"Since the early pioneering work of Inoue et al. [44], the photo-hydrogenation of CO2 has received significant attention. However, in these studies, an electron donor (H2 gas) had to be continuously introduced to the reaction system. To mimic the natural photosynthesis in green plants, artificial photosynthesis using molecular H2 or atomic H+, which is directly produced by photocatalytic water splitting, for the photoreduction of CO2 has recently attracted increasing attention. Various promising photocatalytic semiconductor materials and concepts to facilitate the production of solar fuels have been investigated. In 2003, Guan et al. proposed the use of H2 from water splitting for the photo-hydrogenation of CO2 with hybrid photocatalysts under concentrated sunlight, as shown in Fig. 14 a [66]. The photoreaction was conducted between 9:30 AM to 03:30 PM on sunny days (Oct. to Dec. 2001), which concentrated solar irradiation, providing effective photons and high thermal energy (average reaction temperature: 534–590 K; solar insolation: 3.73–6.06 kWh·m−2). In this system, the Pt/K2Ti6O13 and Fe-Cu-K/DAY (Fe-Cu-K/dealuminized Y-type zeolite) photocatalysts were cubic particles (approximately 0.5–2.0 μm, Fig. 14b) and rod-like crystallites (Fig. 14c), respectively. The role of the Pt/K2Ti6O13 photocatalyst was to split water into H2, and that of the Fe-Cu-K/DAY photocatalyst was to hydrogenate CO2 into organic compounds, including methane (CH4, 0.037–0.047 µmol·gcat −1·h−1), formic acid (HCOOH, 0–12.93 µmol·gcat −1·h−1), formaldehyde (HCHO, 0–3.43 µmol·gcat −1·h−1), methanol (CH3OH, 0–4.83 µmol·gcat −1·h−1), and ethanol (C2H5OH, 0–1.17 µmol·gcat −1·h−1). However, the yield of these products was not attractive and required further improvement. Recently, a novel twin photoreactor, which was designed according to the Z-scheme concept, was proposed to mimic the natural photosynthesis process in green plants, as shown in Fig. 15 [131]. This photocatalytic reactor system is separated by a circular membrane that consists of two different photocatalytic materials—e.g., Pt/SrTiO3:Rh combined with Pt/CuAlGaO4, and WO3 [132], dual-function GaN:ZnO-Ni/NiO and Pt/WO3 [12], Pt/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 [133], or Pt/CuAlGaO4 combined with Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and WO3 [10,134]—for CO2-hydrogenation/H2-generation and O2-generation, respectively, and integrates with different reversible shuttle redox mediators, e.g., IO3 −/I− [12] or Fe2+/Fe3+ [10,132]. This concept has many advantages. First, the O2 and H2/solar products generated separately in the twin photoreactor via water splitting effectively hinder the backward reaction and oxidation of hydrocarbon products. Second, molecular H2 and atomic H+, which are directly produced by the photocatalytic water splitting, are straightforwardly used for effective CO2 hydrogenation. Various experimental and theoretical studies on twin photoreactors for CO2 have been conducted. Lee et al. reported that the performance of a dual-photocatalyst system in which Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and Pt/CuAlGaO4 were used as H2-generation and CO2-reduction photocatalysts, respectively, was more than twice that of a single-photocatalyst system [132]. Recently, Yu et al. proposed a dual-function GaN:ZnO-Ni/NiO photocatalyst with both CO2-reduction and H2-production capabilities [12]. Interestingly, the photoreduction quantum efficiency of the twin photoreactor was more than four times higher than that of a single photoreactor (an increase from 0.015% to 0.070%). In another approach, Chu et al. proposed a novel bubbling twin photoreactor on the basis of theoretical calculations [135]. The results indicated that the diffusion and mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases were significantly improved, resulting in a higher conversion efficiency compared to the traditional twin photoreactor. To summarize, a combination of H2O water splitting and CO2 photo-hydrogenation in a Z-scheme system is successfully explored and adopted by using the novel twin photoreactor system to mimic the natural photosynthesis process in green plants. To date, various photocatalytic materials, which are integrated with different reversible shuttle redox mediators, perform significantly photoreduction quantum efficiency, selectivity for CO2 reduction, diffusion, and mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases via twin photoreactor, in compared with single photoreactor. Currently, the bottleneck of this system is limited by the H2-generating efficiency, leading to develop the novel H2-photocatalysts further."
7,The prototype of an artificial leaf to mimic the unique structure of a leaf,"The design of an artificial leaf that mimics the unique structure of a leaf has significant potential for the reduction of CO2 emissions and the development of renewable fuels. Zhou et al. proposed a prototype artificial leaf for the photoreduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels, as shown in Fig. 16 [136]. The typical natural photosynthetic system (NPS) at multiple scales is depicted in Fig. 16a–c. At the macroscale, green leaves produce O2, carbohydrates, and other C-rich products by splitting H2O and reducing CO2 in the presence of solar energy (Fig. 16a). At the microscale, the structures of the leaves function effectively to exchange gas, transport H2O, and harvest solar light (Fig. 16b). At the nanoscale, CO2 can efficiently diffuse throughout the mesophyll cells, where it may dissociate into carbohydrates and other C-rich products (Fig. 16c). By developing a special design for artificial leaves, which include perovskite titanates (ATiO3, A = Sr, Ca, and Pb), an artificial photosynthetic system (APS) that mimics real leaves and employs only renewable resources, such as solar light and water, for photoreduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels, was proposed, as shown in Fig. 16d–g [136,137]. However, the efficiency of the APS is relatively low, and further research is required. The overall design of artificial leaves should comprehensively consider the geometries of leaf for optimizing solar light harvesting, exchanging gas, transporting H2O, photocatalytic materials (type, morphology, composition, and support). Meanwhile, special attention should also focus on enhancing durability and extend the lifetime of modularized artificial leaf units for the potential industrialization."
8,Hybrid photoelectrochemical biological approach for solar-to-chemical conversion,"One promising approach that was recently proposed is the development of a hybrid photoelectrochemical biological system in which photocatalytic materials are combined to drive water splitting and microbial fixation of CO2 into biomass and liquid fuels, as shown in Fig. 17 a [138]. This sustainable concept uses only sustainable electrical and/or solar inputs to sustainably generate H2 from water, and then, the H2 is used with microorganisms to transform CO2 into high-value chemicals. In typical, Nichols et al. reported an electrochemical cell that contains two chambers: cathodic and anodic chambers (Fig. 17b) [139]. In the cathodic chamber, the p-InP cathode electrochemically generated H2, which was subsequently used in situ by Methanosarcina barkeri to reduce CO2 to CH4. In the anodic chamber, O2 was produced separately to prevent harmful potential by reactive O species. The conversion rate (in situ generations of H2 at the cathode) reached 86%, followed by an H2-driven reduction of carbon dioxide to methane by the Methanosarcina barkeri biocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 17c, Torella et al. designed a bioelectrochemical cell [140] containing a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) anode and a nickel molybdenum zinc (NiMoZn) cathode to generate O2 and H2 via water splitting. H2 was used to efficiently convert CO2 via the Calvin cycle into biomass in wild-type Ralstonia eutropha H16 and to isopropanol in an engineered strain of Ralstonia eutropha, Re2133-pEG12. The solar-to-biomass yields and the isopropanol reached 3.2% and 216 mg٠L−1, respectively. However, this approach is a temporary solution owing to its limitations, including the low solubility, low mass transfer rate, and safety issues of the generated H2 in the microbial cultures. For reducing the toxicity to the bacterium, Liu et al. proposed a hybrid bioelectrochemical system for CO2 fixation (as shown Fig. 17d) [141], which could effectively minimize the generation of toxically reactive O species. The R. eutropha hybrid system achieved ηSCE values of 9.7%, 7.6%, and 7.1% for biomass, bioplastic, and liquid fuels (C3, C4, and C5 alcohols), respectively. Another approach is to electrochemically produce formate, instead of H2 and then convert it into biofuels (isobutanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, etc.) via a biological pathway (Fig. 17e) [142]. A concept of a hybrid photoelectrochemical biological system, which uses electrical and/or solar inputs to sustainably generate H2 from water, and then, the H2 is used with microorganisms to transform CO2 into high-value chemicals, represents a significant breakthrough. However, this approach still requires further studies to enhance the efficiency of achieving sustainable solar-to-chemical energy conversion."
9,Conclusions and future perspectives,"In conclusion, the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals and renewable fuels associated with H2 utilization has emerged as a mainstream approach to address the overwhelming CO2 pollution. This research field can grow significantly in the future. In this review, four promising approaches for light-driven CO2 reduction were identified: (i) the development of robust catalysts for light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation, (ii) the mimicking of natural photosynthesis, (iii) the preparation of an artificial leaf, and (iv) the use of hybrid bioinorganic systems. The hydrogenation of CO2 has proven to be an efficient method of reducing CO2. The selection of materials significantly affects the outcomes. This review identified the following critical reactions: RWGS, CO2-to-CH3OH, methanation (CO2-to-CH4), and CO2-to-C2+ conversion. The preparation of novel and inexpensive materials to increase the efficiency of each type of reaction is imperative. Research on the generation of C2+ products, which are very high-value chemicals, is still in an early stage. The synthesis of extraordinary catalysts that reduce the working temperature and enhance the selectivity will facilitate the practical reduction of CO2. Mimicking natural photosynthesis is another outstanding route for converting CO2 into high-value chemicals. In this method, a photocatalytic system is employed, and the reaction medium (e.g., solid–liquid, solid–gas, combined systems) and material designs significantly affect the conversion efficiencies. It is expected that innovative reactor designs and extraordinary materials will lead to enhancements in the CO2 conversion performance with regard to conversion and selectivity. A reactor design that has outstanding properties and overcomes the limitations of current designs is highly needed. Additionally, the development of active and durable photocatalysts with a strong reduction capability will help to fill the current large gap in CO2 conversion and inspire research on high-performance and low-cost materials for solar-driven CO2 reduction. The preparation of an artificial leaf is also an intensive approach to convert CO2 owing to the unique structure of the leaf, which can promote light-harvesting, mass transfer, and gas diffusion. Notably, the integrated technique plays a crucial role in the preparation of an efficient leaf, and the use of efficient catalysts promotes the reduction reaction. It is believed that new techniques, e.g., three-dimensional printing, will lead to the development of leaves with unique structures for CO2 conversion. Hybrid photoelectrochemical biological systems have considerable potential for efficient solar-driven CO2-to-fuel conversion. The critical issues regarding the solubility, mass transfer, and safety can be considered as the primary obstacles to be addressed. Solving these problems will present an excellent opportunity for the large-scale production of renewable solar fuels from CO2. We believe that our review provides a roadmap for the future solar-driven CO2 reduction into high-value chemicals."
