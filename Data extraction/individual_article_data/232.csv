0,Introduction,"To reduce society’s dependence on limited crude oil reserves and to satisfy the increasing demands for energy resources, the development of alternative routes for converting syngas, derived from coal, natural gas, or biomass, into valuable products is a major scientific objective [1–3]. Among the routes considered for this purpose, one reliable and important approach is the synthesis of ethanol and higher alcohols from syngas. The alcohols obtained from this process can be used as fuel blends or as value-added chemicals in fine chemical synthesis [4–7]. Moreover, higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) is a prime example of reactions that rely on synergistic effects between dual catalytic sites with different functionalities, in which one type of active site catalyses chain propagation (dissociation of CO to form surface alkyl groups) and the second type catalyses oxygenation (non-dissociative activation of CO for CO insertion and subsequent alcohol formation) [5,8,9]. There are primarily four typical types of catalysts employed for HAS from syngas, namely, Rh-based catalysts [10,11], Mo-based catalysts [12,13], modified methanol catalysts [9,14], and modified Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis catalysts [15–18]. Rhodium, employed on promoters, is the only metal that is capable of effectively producing ethanol and other C2+ oxygenates from syngas [19]. However, the very high cost and limited availability of rhodium metal prohibit its large-scale utilization. Alternatively, among the available non-precious catalysts, modified FT catalysts (e.g., Cu–Co and Cu–Fe) are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for HAS. These catalysts can provide relatively high selectivities for C2+ alcohols. However, they also produce a wide distribution of C1–C6 linear alcohols, which obeys the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution, thus leading to the formation of methanol as the major product among the resulting alcohols [20]. Therefore, narrowing the distribution of alcohols and improving the selectivities for short-chain alcohols (particularly for ethanol) of these FT catalysts are highly desirable but challenging. Based on extensive density functional theory calculations, Cu–Co alloys with Co-rich compositions are considered to be the ideal catalyst surface for achieving the selective production of C2+ alcohols [21,22]. Therefore, a CuCo-based catalyst is chosen as a candidate in this study for selectively converting syngas into ethanol and higher alcohols. To ensure mixing of the Co and Cu nanoparticles at the nanoscale and no metal segregation during the reaction, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are employed as supports. Many studies have demonstrated the advantages of using CNTs as supports for dispersing transition metal catalyst particles [23–25]. The confinement effects in catalysis have been systematically investigated. Previous studies have concluded that space restriction [26], electronic interaction of the confined materials with CNTs [27], and enrichment of reactants inside CNTs [28] can be achieved. Therefore, all of these attributes may be advantageous for forming C2+ alcohols. To improve the selectivity for higher alcohols, particularly for ethanol, a different route employed for engineering the reactivity of Cu–Co catalysts consists of altering the geometric structure of the catalyst. The geometric properties are influenced by many factors, such as promoters, support interactions, and particle size, and are difficult to control in practice. However, it is known that certain metal oxides can block steps of transition metals to optimize the catalyst [29]. Furthermore, by adding oxides to FT-type catalysts, it is possible to increase alcohol selectivity [30]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that designing a metal–oxide surface interface as a new catalytic active site would suppress the formation of methane and improve the selectivity towards higher alcohols. Ceria, serving as either a promoter or a support, exhibits a strong metal–support interaction and interesting redox properties, which can influence the redox and electronic properties of the active phase [31,32]. In particular, partially reduced CeO2 could be expected to create new sites for the adsorption of CO, thereby favouring CO bond rupture in FT reactions [33,34]. Furthermore, the application of ceria as a support or as a promoter in the synthesis of alcohols has been reported, such as Pd/CeO2 and Cu/CeO2 catalysts [35,36]. Therefore, cerium is selected as the third component in the current proposed ternary catalyst to form a new active site at the metal–oxide interface. To date, there are nearly no reports or research on the influence of CeO2 on Cu–Co systems employed for HAS. In this study, the CuCoCe/CNTs precursor was synthesized using a simple and effective co-impregnation method. After calcination, a homogeneous and highly dispersed ternary catalyst was obtained, as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated a strong synergistic effect between Cu–Co and Co–CeO2−x active sites. The catalytic performance of the catalysts prepared in this work towards the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide was examined in a slurry reactor. The maximum total alcohol selectivity reached 38.4%, and an ethanol selectivity as high as 31.6% was obtained. This result deviates from the ASF distribution of alcohols typically observed for such reactions. Because of the excellent catalytic performance and facile scale-up method, the ternary CuCoCe catalyst prepared herein could potentially be applied as a promising candidate in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to ethanol and higher alcohols in the C1 industry."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Analytical-grade chemicals, including Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, were purchased from the Beijing Chemical Co., Ltd., and were used as received without further purification. Multi-walled CNTs (inner diameter: 4–8nm) were purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals. Raw CNTs were refluxed in HNO3 (68wt.%) for 14h at 140°C in an oil bath to purify and cut the carbon tubes. Then, the mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water, followed by drying at 60°C for 12h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the ends of the CNTs were open."
3,Synthesis of Cu/Co/Ce-based catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu/Co/Ce-based catalysts The CNTs were immersed in an ethanolic solution of precursor salts of Cu, Co, and Ce and then subjected to ultrasonic treatment and stirring. The ultrasonic treatment and stirring facilitated the filling of the CNT channels with the precursor solution during impregnation. After 10h of impregnation, the mixture was dried at 60°C overnight, followed by heating to 110°C for 10h. This process afforded a homogeneous distribution of the active components inside the channels of the CNTs. After drying, the products were calcined in N2 at 673K for 4h with a heating rate of 2K/min. A series of catalysts were prepared using this method, i.e., Cu/CNTs, CuCe/CNTs, CuCo/CNTs, CuCoCe/CNTs, and CoCe/CNTs. The loadings of Cu, Co, and Ce were maintained at 10, 5, and 5wt.%, respectively. Additionally, Co/CNTs was prepared for comparison, in which the loading of Co was maintained at 15wt%."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded over the 2θ range from 5° to 85° using a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer, which was operated at 40kV and 40mA with Cu Kα radiation (k =0.15418nm). H2-temperature-programmed reduction mass spectrometry analysis (H2-TPR-MS) was performed to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts using a chemisorption instrument (TP-5080), and the sweep gas was detected using an OmniStar instrument. The catalyst (50mg) was pre-treated at 300°C under a flow of N2 (32ml/min) for 1h and then cooled to 50°C; after cooling, the flow was changed to a H2/N2 =0.09 mixture (35ml/min). The temperature-programmed reduction was performed between 100°C and 900°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. The temperature-programmed desorption of carbon monoxide (CO-TPD) was used to determine the amounts and strengths of the adsorption sites in the as-prepared catalysts using a TP-5080 chemisorption instrument. The catalyst (100mg) was pre-treated at 400°C under a flow of H2 (3ml/min) for 1h and then flushed under a flow of N2 (32ml/min) for 0.5h, followed by cooling to 25°C. CO was introduced into the flow system for 15min. The TPD spectra were recorded from 100°C to 600°C using a heating rate of 10°C/min. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with a MCT detector (64 scans, 4-cm−1 resolution). For in situ treatments, approximately 20mg of catalyst was placed in an infrared cell with KBr windows. The catalysts were exposed to flowing H2 gas at 400°C for 1h; then, the temperature was decreased to 300°C, and CO was added to the gas (H2:CO=10:1). After adsorption reached completion, the inlet tube was turned off, infrared spectra were recorded for 30min, and then the cell was flushed with helium for 5min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) were used to analyse the change in the surface composition using an AXIS ULTRA DLD instrument equipped with Al Kα (hν =1486.6eV). The samples were reduced in situ under a flow of H2 at 400°C for 1h, and the following photoelectron lines were recorded: Ce 3d, Cu 2p, Co 2p, C1s and O1s. The binding energy values were corrected for charging effects by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.5eV. The chemical compositions (Cu, Co and Ce) of the as-prepared samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Thermo iCAP 6300 instrument. The morphologies and microstructures of the materials were observed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F), which was operated at 200kV, with a lattice resolution of 0.14nm."
5,Catalysis studies,"2.4 Catalysis studies Carbon monoxide hydrogenation reactions were performed in a 0.5-L continuous slurry reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator. The reactions were conducted at a temperature of 573K and pressure of 4.5MPa, using a feed gas of a 2:1 mixture of H2 and CO at a space velocity of 10,000ml/gcat h. The catalysts were reduced with a 10% hydrogen-in-nitrogen mixture for 3h at 673K in a tube furnace. After cooling to room temperature under a flow of high purity nitrogen, the reduced catalysts were added into an agate mortar with liquid paraffin, and the solid particles were finely powdered, then the mixed liquid paraffin were transferred into the slurry reactor. All experimental data were obtained under steady-state conditions that were invariably maintained for 12h, and no deactivation was observed. The products were analysed using four online GCs during the reaction. The organic gas products, consisting of hydrocarbons and methanol, were detected online by flame ionization measurements using a GC4000A (GDX-403 column). The inorganic gas products were detected online by thermal conductivity measurements using a GC4000A (carbon molecular sieves column). The H2O and methanol products in the liquid phase were detected by thermal conductivity measurements using a GC4000A (GDX-401 column). The alcohol products in the liquid phase were detected by flame ionization measurements using a GC-7AG (Chromosorb 101)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural and morphological study of the catalysts,"3.1 Structural and morphological study of the catalysts Fig. 1 presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh catalyst samples. As shown in this figure, the samples primarily consisted of a Cu2O phase, with corresponding peaks at 2θ values of 36.5, 42.4, 61.5, 73.7, and 77.6° (JCPDS No. 65-3288). Upon the addition of cobalt and/or cerium to the Cu/CNTs sample, the intensity and acuity of the Cu2O diffraction peaks decreased, suggesting an increased dispersion of the Cu2O particles in these catalyst samples. Very low intensity peaks corresponding to CoO (JCPDS No. 65-5474) were observed. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the Co component is homogeneously dispersed in the catalysts. The characteristic CNT peak was observed at a 2θ value of 25.8°. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2 a–d) show that the Cu, Co, and Ce particles were uniformly distributed inside the tubes of the CNTs in the fresh catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2a, the metal particles were arranged in a row and were in close proximity to each other at the nanoscale. The distances between two adjacent planes, d, were measured to be 0.24 and 0.21nm, which are characteristic of Cu2O and CoO phases, respectively. It is expected that such intimate contact among the metal particles would greatly improve the synergism of the Cu–Co dual sites and reduce side reactions. The d 111 spacing of CeO2 was determined to be 0.31nm. Furthermore, the Cu2O particles were partially covered by CeO2 in CuCe/CNTs. Fig. 2d shows the interface and close contact between CoO and CeO2, indicating the strong interactions between them. It was also observed that the morphology of the particles in CoCe/CNTs is very different from that in the CuCo/CNTs sample."
8,Evaluation of the catalytic performance,"3.2 Evaluation of the catalytic performance The catalytic performance of the CuCoCe/CNTs catalyst was studied and compared with that of the CuCo/CNTs, CuCe/CNTs, Cu/CNTs, CoCe/CNTs and Co/CNTs catalysts. The data are presented in Table 1 . As shown in this table, Cu/CNTs and CuCe/CNTs exhibited low activities; they presented comparable low space–time yield (STY) and alcohol distribution values. This result indicates that the addition of cerium has little influence on the properties of copper and that there are no synergistic effects between them. In contrast, CuCo/CNTs exhibited considerably higher catalytic performance. The total alcohol STY increased by one order of magnitude relative to that of the previously discussed samples. Furthermore, the alcohol distribution results indicated that the reaction over CuCo/CNTs tends to favour the formation of higher alcohols. Thus, both electronic and structural interactions may exist between copper and cobalt. In contrast, CuCoCe/CNTs presented a significantly different alcohol distribution, in which the selectivity towards methanol considerably decreased and the selectivity towards ethanol markedly increased. The selectivity for C2+ alcohols reached ∼60%, which is considerably higher than that achieved over CuCo/CNTs (i.e., 30%). To confirm the role of cerium in the CuCoCe/CNTs system, Co/CNTs and CoCe/CNTs catalysts were examined. After adding cerium to the Co/CNTs sample, the total alcohols selectivity increased by 3.4%. Furthermore, a considerably lower methanol selectivity and higher ethanol selectivity were obtained. It was also found that the selectivity for methane decreased and that the selectivity for short-chain hydrocarbons (C2–C4) increased upon the addition of cerium in both the CuCo/CNTs and Co/CNTs samples. All of these results may indicate that a strong association exists between cobalt and cerium. Catalytic performance of CoCe/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs were also compared at the same CO conversion level. The alcohol distribution of CoCe/CNTs is almost unchanged at the high space velocity condition. In addition, CuCoCe/SiO2 sample was also prepared and evaluated, which exhibited considerably lower catalytic performance than that of CuCoCe/CNTs, the results are shown in Table S1."
9,Correlation studies on the active sites and catalytic behaviour,"3.3 Correlation studies on the active sites and catalytic behaviour 3.3.1 In situ XPS characterization XPS is typically employed to analyse the composition and oxidation states of catalyst surface species. Thus, in situ XPS spectra of the Ce 3d, Cu 2p, Co 2p, C 1s and O 1s core levels of Cu/CNTs, CuCe/CNTs, CuCo/CNTs, and CuCoCe/CNTs were recorded. The C 1s binding energy value (284.5eV) was used as a reference to determine the binding energy (B.E.) values of the other elements. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the Cu 2p3/2 spectra of the four reduced catalysts were characterized by symmetrical major peaks and the absence of satellite structures. Table 2 presents the XPS and XAES data of the reduced catalysts. As shown in this table, the Auger parameter α′(Cu) was in the range of 1850.85 to 1851.11eV, which can be associated with Cu°. Thus, it can be deduced that only metallic copper is present on the surface of the catalysts after in situ reduction. The Ce 3d XPS spectra of the reduced CuCe/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs catalysts in Fig. 3b presented two groups of spin-orbital multiplets, corresponding to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, denoted as u and v, respectively. CuCoCe/CNTs exhibited three main 3d5/2 peaks at ∼883.2 (v), 888.3 (v2), and 898.9 (v3) eV and three main 3d3/2 peaks at ∼901.4 (u), 907.0 (u2), and 917.5 (u3) eV. All of these peaks could be attributed to the binding energy of the Ce4+ state. In contrast, the peaks at 885.8eV (v1) and 903.9eV (u1) were attributed to the Ce3+ state. As reported in the literature, the peaks at 883.2 and 917.5eV and at 885.8 and 903.9eV are considered to be fingerprints of Ce4+ and Ce3+, respectively [37–39]. Therefore, the valence of cerium on the surface of the catalyst after reduction is +4 and +3. The Co 2p XPS spectra of the fresh and reduced CuCo/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs samples are shown in Fig. 4 a and b. The Co 2p3/2 main peak was observed at ∼780.7eV, along with a satellite peak at 786.7eV. Comparison of the spectra in Fig. 4a and b confirmed that the peak with lowest binding energy (778.8eV) could be assigned to Co0, whereas the peak observed at the higher binding energy (780.7±0.2eV) could be associated with the Co2+ component [40–42]. For the reduced catalysts, note that the addition of cerium to the Cu–Co sample produced a more asymmetrical Co 2p3/2 main peak, whereas the peak at 778.8eV became sharper and more prominent. To confirm the influence of cerium on cobalt species, the Co 2p XPS spectra of the fresh Co/CNTs and CoCe/CNTs samples are shown in Fig. 4c. After adding cerium to the Co sample, the Co 2p3/2 binding energy increased by 0.7eV, thus indicating the existence of a strong association between cobalt and cerium. Furthermore, the relative surface contents of cobalt and cerium calculated for the reduced samples are presented in Table 3 . As shown in this table, the content of Co0 species in CuCoCe/CNTs was considerably higher than that in the Cu–Co sample. The interaction with cerium oxide is expected to facilitate the reduction of cobaltous oxide. Therefore, it is concluded that Co0 species largely co-exist with partially reduced cerium oxide in the nanotubes of the CuCoCe/CNTs sample. The electronic effects of different components on copper are shown in Table 2. As shown in this table, the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 negligibly changed following the addition of cerium to copper, thus indicating the absence of a strong association between these two species. In contrast, the Cu 2p3/2 binding energy of CuCo/CNTs shifted to a low energy of 0.18eV relative to that of Cu/CNTs. This shift indicates the existence of an interaction between cobalt and copper. Furthermore, after adding cerium to the Cu–Co sample, the Cu 2p3/2 binding energy increased by 0.22eV. This result indicates that the electronic properties of Cu–Co changed considerably due to the existence of the strong interaction between Co and Ce. The relative ratios of Cu, Co, and Ce in all samples as measured using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) in the bulk sample and in situ XPS in the surface layer are presented in Table S2. As shown in this table, copper exhibited the lowest surface concentration in the reduced catalysts, and the surface concentration of cerium was considerably higher than those of cobalt and copper. 3.3.2 CO-TPD and in situ FTIR characterization Fig. 5 presents the CO-temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD) profiles of the fresh catalysts. The catalysts presented three types of CO desorption peaks at ∼73, 230, and 442°C. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5, the relative areas/intensities of the profiles of CuCo/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs were significantly higher than those of Cu/CNTs and CuCe/CNTs. This finding indicates that the former two samples possess a considerably higher carbon monoxide adsorption capacity. Thus, it can be deduced that the addition of cobalt remarkably improves the extent of CO dissociative adsorption over the catalyst. The addition of cerium also greatly influenced the profile of the Cu–Co sample. A new CO desorption peak was observed at higher temperatures, and the profile featured three types of desorption peaks. As previously discussed, HRTEM analysis clearly revealed the intimate contact and the presence of interfaces of cobalt and ceria, whereas in situ XPS analysis indicated the existence of a strong interaction between the two components. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that new catalytic active sites (Co–CeO2−x interface) may form on the CuCoCe/CNTs catalyst. CO could bond with its carbon atom to the metal cobalt atom and with its oxygen atom to the adjacent partially reduced CeO2. Such a “tilted” adsorption of CO onto the Co–CeO2 surface would result in weakening of the CO bond and enhancement of the CO dissociation and reactivity [26,34]. As shown in the TPD profiles, Peak III observed at the higher temperature was attributed to CO dissociative desorption at the Co–CeO2−x surface, and Peak II was attributed to dissociative desorption at the metal cobalt atoms arranged in close proximity to the copper atoms. Thus, the CO–TPD result clearly indicates that the strength of the Co–C bond is enhanced and that the CO bond is weakened by the addition of cerium. Due to the enhancement of the Co–C bond at the interface, the *CH x groups are expected to remain on the surface of the cobalt atoms for a comparatively longer time, thereby increasing the concentration of surface *CH x . This concentration increase may subsequently increase the rate constant for polymerization of the CH x species and increase the probability factor of carbon chain growth, thereby resulting in an accelerated CC bond formation. The latter may be beneficial for promoting selectivity towards higher alcohols and suppressing methane formation. This hypothesis is supported by the experimental results. Following the addition of cerium to Cu–Co sample, the selectivity for methane and methanol considerably decreased, whereas the selectivity towards short-chain hydrocarbons (C2–C4) markedly increased and the selectivity towards C2+ alcohols doubled. However, it also assumed that the active sites on the catalyst surface are covered by ceria, thereby limiting the chemisorption capacity and mobility of the adsorbed species. This effect leads to a decrease in the activity of the catalyst. The calculated amount of CO desorbed from CuCoCe/CNTs (0.019mmol/g) was comparable to that desorbed from CuCo/CNTs (0.022mmol/g). The results indicate that although some surface cobalt species are covered by ceria, the Co–CeO2−x interface produced more metal cobalt species, which compensates for the loss of surface metals. The analysis also showed that the CuCo/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs samples featured comparable alcohols STY, thereby supporting the aforementioned assumption. To obtain detailed information on the molecular events that occur on the surface of the catalysts, the CO hydrogenation process was monitored using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy at the investigated reaction temperature. Fig. 6 presents the FTIR spectra recorded as a function of time of (CO+H2) adsorption onto the reduced samples. In the region of 3100–2850cm−1, a strong absorption band at 3016cm−1, corresponding to the stretching modes of unsaturated CH2, and weaker peaks between 3180 and 3040cm−1, resulting from weak olefinic CH stretching bands, were observed. The “noisy” peaks between 2990 and 2850cm−1 were attributed to CH2 and CH3 stretching modes of the saturated parts. The band at 1302cm−1 was attributed to the bending mode of unsaturated CH2. For all samples, the IR absorption peaks observed at 2110 and 2180cm−1 were attributed to CO gaseous adsorption. Over the CuCoCe/CNTs sample, all CO molecules were completely dissociated under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, consequently forming C1 intermediate species. Regarding the CuCo/CNTs sample, only some CO molecules dissociated to form intermediates. In contrast, no intermediates were detected during the process involving the Cu/CNTs and CuCe/CNTs samples. The results were consistent with the CO-TPD analysis, in which the addition of cobalt remarkably improved the extent of CO dissociative adsorption of the Cu-based catalyst and promoted the formation of the Co–CeO2−x interface that significantly enhanced CO dissociation and increased the concentration of surface CH x species. 3.3.3 H2-TPR characterization The H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of the fresh catalysts are presented in Fig. 7 . All samples exhibited two main peaks within the temperature range of 219–660°C. Specifically, the Cu/CNTs and CuCe/CNTs samples exhibited a sharp peak centred at ∼219–227°C, which was attributed to the reduction of Cu2O based on the XRD results. A broad peak at higher temperature was observed in all of the samples. To confirm the assignment of the broad peaks, temperature-programmed reduction mass spectrometry analysis was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. S1. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the broad peaks at ∼480–660°C could be assigned primarily to the decomposition of the CNTs and partially to the reduction of cobaltous oxide and ceria. The decomposition of the CNTs was also supported by the profile of Cu/CNTs. The latter profile exhibited a broad band at the higher temperature similar to the other three samples, but it does not contain other metals. The pure CNTs were also examined. The first decomposition step was observed at a higher temperature of 787°C. Thus, this result indicated that the addition of metals, particularly cobalt, accelerated the decomposition of the nanotubes. The CuCo/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs samples first featured reduction peaks that were shifted to higher temperatures, and then their reduction profiles became broad, thus indicating the reduction of more than one type of metallic oxide. As reported in the literature, catalyst reduction is influenced by the strong mutual effect of cobalt and copper, in which the reduction of cobalt can be markedly enhanced by the presence of copper [8,43]. To confirm the assignment of the first reduction peak, the total hydrogen consumption, based on analysis of the first peak, of all samples was calculated. Cu/CNTs, CuCe/CNTs, CuCo/CNTs, and CuCoCe/CNTs displayed H2 consumptions of 0.92, 1.02, 1.40, and 1.48mmol/g, respectively. The hydrogen consumption accounted for the complete reduction of cuprous oxide to metal copper (Cu2O+H2 →2Cu+H2O) for each sample. However, for the CuCo/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs samples, the hydrogen consumption was inconsistent with the quantitative complete reduction of cobaltous oxide to metallic cobalt. Therefore, some of the cobaltous oxide and ceria were reduced at the higher temperatures, and their reduction peaks overlapped with the decomposition peak of the CNTs."
10,Reaction mechanism of higher alcohols synthesis in the copper–cobalt–cerium system,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of higher alcohols synthesis in the copper–cobalt–cerium system The CO insertion mechanism for the formation of higher alcohols proposed by Xiaoding et al. [44] is widely accepted for modified FT catalysts. Specifically, the authors proposed that the Cu–M (M=Co, Fe) centre serves as a dual active site for the formation of higher alcohols. Cu is the major element for methanol synthesis and is involved in the associative adsorption of CO to form CO*, whereas cobalt species act as active sites for CO dissociation, CC chain growth, and hydrogenation to produce *C n H x groups. The *C n H x group moves to CO* (or vice versa) and is inserted via surface migration over a short distance between the Co and Cu sites for subsequent hydrogenation to produce higher alcohols [5,22]. In our catalyst system, CO hydrogenation can occur on the surface of copper, initiated by the following process, CO+H2 →CHO→CH2O→CH3O+H→CH3 +OH, through which CH3 is formed. This process is followed by the insertion of CO, originally adsorbed onto the surface, into CH3 to produce CH3CO and hydrogenation to ethanol. In contrast, methanol is more favourably formed via the optimal route CH3O+H→CH3OH. Consequently, the productivity and selectivity of ethanol from syngas is low due to the reduced availability of a CH3 source and the increasing extent of CH3OH formation [45]. Therefore, promoters are required to improve the formation of CH3 and/or decrease the formation of methanol. As a FT element, cobalt is the active site for CO dissociation, hydrogenation and chain propagation to form surface alkyl species. The combination of these two components (i.e., Cu and Co) enables the high productivity of alcohols. However, the products follow the ASF distribution, and methanol remains as the major alcohol. Furthermore, the selectivity towards methane accounts for more than half of the total products. The results demonstrate that a Co-promoted Cu surface facilitates the formation of CH3 and decreases the formation of CH3OH to some extent. However, the rate of the first CC bond formation and the ability of CO insertion limit HAS. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the concentration of CH x species on the metal surface and seek another effective pathway for the oxygenation of the generated carbon chain. Based on the XPS analysis results, there are many Ce3+ species and hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface. The formation of bridging OH groups is hypothesized to proceed via two possible routes. (1) Dissociated H2 spills over to the ceria surface to directly generate the bridging OH groups, accompanied with a change in the oxidation state of the Ce atoms (Ce4+ →Ce3+). (2) H2 or CO removes ceria surface-capping oxygen atoms to generate vacancies (and surface Ce3+), followed by H2O dissociation at the vacancies to generate the bridging OH groups [46]. In our system, in addition to direct reduction, CO hydrogenation produces H2O as a by-product, which generates surface OH groups over the partially reduced ceria. It is hypothesized that the surface active hydroxyl groups on ceria at the Co–CeO2−x interface can react with alkylidene groups that migrated from cobalt to form alkoxy groups, followed by hydrogenation to produce higher alcohols. The latter synthesis route is proposed as the second type of chain termination for the formation of alcohols. A similar route of termination of chain growth at the Co–CeO2 junction was proposed by Gnanamani et al. [47,48] in FT synthesis. Based on the CO-TPD and in situ FTIR spectroscopy analyses of the CuCoCe/CNTs catalyst, it can be deduced that the Co–CeO2−x interface accelerates the dissociation of the CO bond, provides more CH x intermediates, and promotes the retention time of CH x groups. It thus remarkably increases the probability of the first CC bond formation in the nanotube channels and accelerates the formation of ethanol and higher alcohols. Therefore, the formation of a high-activity Co–CeO2−x interface may be the reason for the enhanced ethanol selectivity observed following the addition of cerium as a promoter. These results show that in addition to the active sites of Cu–Co, the Co–CeO2−x interface likely plays an important role in determining the selectivity towards ethanol and higher alcohols. The proposed mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 1 . The ASF plots (logarithm of mole fraction vs. carbon number) for the distribution of alcohols obtained over all investigated catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . The carbon number distributions of alcohols obtained over the Cu/CNTs, CuCe/CNTs, Co/CNTs and CuCo/CNTs catalysts displayed excellent ASF plots. Deviation from the ASF distribution was observed upon the addition of cerium to Co and the Cu–Co catalyst. Furthermore, note that the α (chain growth probability factor) values of CoCe/CNTs and CuCoCe/CNTs are considerably higher than those of previous samples. Based on the characterization analysis of the catalysts discussed above, the existence of two pathways for chain growth and the formation of alcohols, involving the Cu–Co centre and Co–CeO2−x interface, respectively, could be confirmed."
11,Conclusions,"We have demonstrated that the ternary CuCoCe catalyst prepared using a facile co-impregnation method exhibits relative high selectivity towards the formation of C2+ alcohols during CO hydrogenation. The CuCoCe/CNTs catalyst exhibited a relatively high selectivity for the formation of ethanol (31.6%) and C2+ alcohols (60.2%) with a narrow range distribution. In contrast to the classical modified FT or modified Cu-based catalysts employed for HAS, the CuCoCe system instigated two types of pathways for chain termination to form alcohols, involving the Cu–Co bimetallic active sites and Co–CeO2−x interface. The desirable catalytic CO hydrogenation performance of the ternary catalyst is attributed to (1) the superior intimate contact at the nanoscale between the copper–cobalt and cobalt–ceria active sites in the nanotubes, which improves their geometric and electronic interactions, and (2) the formation of the Co–CeO2−x interface, which greatly facilitates the reduction of CoO, significantly enhances CO dissociation, and increases the formation rate of the first CC bond. The hydroxyl groups on the partially reduced ceria are involved in terminating chain growth by forming alkoxy species to produce alcohols. The high-activity interface contributes to the remarkable enhancement in selectivity for higher alcohols. The catalytic CO hydrogenation studies of the ternary CuCoCe sample and the facile synthesis route show that the catalyst may have potential for scale-up in industrial applications to produce higher alcohols."
