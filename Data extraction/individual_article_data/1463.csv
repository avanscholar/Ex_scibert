0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation is still a vital subject for investigation. A sequence of catalytic systems for the hydrogen peroxide-based oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has been described [1,2]. This is as a result of the significance of selective oxidation as a unitary procedure in the intermediate manufacturing of chemicals [3]. The catalytic transformation of primary and secondary alcohols into their analogous aldehydes and ketones is a vital reaction in organic synthesis [4,5]. Oxidations could be done with various diverse oxidants. Normally, traditional oxidation utilizes the toughest stoichiometric oxidizing agents, for example, PCC, PDC, Na2Cr2O7, TEMPO, CrO3 and KMnO4 [6,7]. Nevertheless, these substances are fairly useful in the laboratory despite the fact that these oxidants are costly and are linked with severe toxicity issues [8–10]. By contrast, a toxic solvent is commonly utilized for dissolving oxidizing agents with a huge quantity of organic wastes being produced after the process. Therefore, in terms of economic and environmental concerns, low-cost catalytic oxidation procedures with environmentally friendly oxidants are tremendously valuable. Alcohol oxidation reactions with stoichiometric quantities of dichromate and permanganate are substituted using current approaches comprising catalyzed reactions with dioxygen or H2O2. Diluted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 35% is an excellent oxidant with the advantages of being inexpensive, readily accessible and offering water as a by-product. The catalytic oxidation with H2O2 in aqueous solutions provides an economic and environmental safety substitute for oxidation reactions. Synthetic benzaldehyde can be obtained commercially with the aldehyde as a derivative of the benzoic acid industry [11]. Several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts such as Cu, Ni, Au, Pd, were reported to produce alcohol oxidation using O2 or H2O2 in the liquid phase [12–14]. In this work, the palladium catalyst with gold as a promoter were loaded on carbon (Au-Pd/C) and were prepared via impregnation and sol immobilization. The morphology and structural properties of the synthesized Au-Pd/C catalysts were characterized by using different techniques. The catalysts were evaluated for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol via a heterogeneous catalyst and 35% hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Palladium (II) chloride (99.9% purity), Gold (III) chloride trihydrate (99.9% purity), sodium borohydride, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with MW = 9000–10,000 g/mol. 80% hydrolyzed), sodium tetrahydroborate, NaBH4 (>96%), and benzaldehyde (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich USA. Benzyl alcohol (99%) was purchased from Merck USA. Sulphuric acid baker analyzed™ A.C.S. reagent (98.08%) was procured from J.T. Baker USA. Carbon used was 100 mesh particle size."
3,Synthesis of the catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the catalysts In this work palladium and gold were loaded on carbon. Thus, the three catalysts of Au -Pd/C, Pd/C, and Au/C were prepared by two methods: impregnation and sol immobilization. 2.2.1 Impregnation procedure In order to make comparisons Au singly, Pd solitary and AuPd catalysts were also primed and supported on carbon (G60 Aldrich) through the use of a normal wet impregnation method. The bimetallic AuPd material was synthesized by an impregnation method where aqueous solutions of 0.083 g PdCl2 in 10 mL and 0.1 g HAuCl4.3H2O in 10 mL were added into the dispersed carbon in 100 mL water. The mixture was kept under stirring at 80 °C until a paste of the mixture was produced. The mixture was then dried (110 °C, 16 h), and finally calcined at 400 °C, 3 h, with a heating rate of 20 °C per min. The prepared catalyst by impregnation was labeled as Au-Pd/CIM. For comparison purposes, the monometallic Au and Pd with the required ratios of Au and Pd metallic catalysts were prepared by the same process. 2.2.2 Sol immobilization procedure In a sol immobilization procedure, aqueous solutions of PdCl2 (Aldrich) and HAuCl4.3H2O (Sigma Aldrich) were prepared with the required concentrations. The gold solution was added to the palladium solution with constant stirring at 2–3 rmp. After stirring for 30 min, the solution of polyvinyl alcohol, 1 g in 20 mL, was added to the mixture of Au and Pd and kept under continuous stirring for 5 min. The subsequent stage is the addition of 0.1 M of a freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 which is then stirred for 30 min at room temperature until the colour changes to a dark brown. Thirty minutes later and after sol generation, the colloid was restrained through the addition of carbon supported material. The pH was controlled to be 1–3 by adding sulphuric acid under dynamic stirring settings. The quantity of support needed was determined to ensure a controlled amount of AuPd in the solution [15]. Two hours after the slurry was separated and washed with water, the obtained material was allowed to dry at 120 °C for about 16 h. The catalyst obtained by the sol immobilization method was labeled as Au-Pd/CSI. The monometallic of the Au/C or Pd/C catalysts with the required ratios were prepared by the same process."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The prepared catalysts were characterized by using various techniques. The morphology of the prepared catalysts was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer and using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The specimen was prepared through dissolving the catalyst powder in highly purified ethanol, and by allowing the droplet of the suspension to be vaporized on a permeable carbon film sustained through a 300-mesh copper TEM grid and likewise for their Au particle size by HRTEM (at 200 kV in a JEOL 1200 EX using CCD camera). The characteristic phases of the prepared catalysts were determined by an X-ray machine (model XRD 6000- Shimadzu) diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu-Kα1 source operating at 2.7 keV and 40 mA. Stages were determined through similar experimental configurations with the JCPDS powder diffraction file and Cu Kl radiations. The total loss of weight in the catalysts was determined through the thermal analysis of the catalyst by the use of a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, Mettler Toledo 990) apparatus (Pt crucibles, Pt/Pt– Rh thermocouple) utilizing N2 gas as a flushing out gas with the rate of heating of 10 °C min−1, flow rate of 30 mL min−1 and temperature ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C. The surface area and pore volume of the catalysts were determined by an N2 adsorption/desorption analyzer (micromeritics 3Flex Version 1.02) with the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method. The catalysts were degassed at 200 °C to eliminate wetness and other external gases on the exterior parts. The desorption and adsorption of nitrogen on the catalysts were examined at −196 °C. The catalyst acidity was investigated with temperature automated desorption using ammonia (TPD–NH3); using a Thermo Finnigan TPD/R/O 1100 device armed with a thermal conductivity detector, TCD. NH3 (2%) in helium gas was ramped for 60 min at 1 °C/ min. Flushing with N2 was done at room temperature for 55 min to eliminate NH3 in the gas phase. The temperature programmed desorption was applied for assessing the catalyst within a temperature range of 50 °C to 900 °C. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum (PS) Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer) was used to collect the IR spectra of the benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde in the range of 400–4000 cm−1."
5,Evaluation of the catalysts,"2.4 Evaluation of the catalysts The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts was evaluated for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Thus, 10 mL of benzyl alcohol and 1.0 mL of 35% H2O2 were added to 2 mg of AuPd/C without the use of any solvents. The reaction was conducted in a di-necked round-bottom flask with a capacity of 25 cm3. The curved bottom flask was linked to a reflux condenser and stirred magnetically with a thermometer which is positioned in an oil bath heated at 80 °C. The reaction was conducted for 0.5–4 h at 80 °C with continuous stirring at a rate of 2–3 rpm. After completing the reaction, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the catalyst collected by centrifuging the reaction mixture. The mixture was mixed with acetone and analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC–MS, Shimadzu fitted with a capillary column, BP20-polar column, 25 m, 0.53 mm ID, 2 capillary and helium served as a stationary phase). The GC was automated at 45–250.0 °C. The injection port temperature was set at 225 °C and the detector temperature was 245 °C. 0.5 μL acetone as an internal standard was added to the mixture sample for analysis. The benzaldehyde product was calculated according to the standard process. Straight injection of 0.5 μL of the reaction mixture was used in GC. The quantities of benzaldehyde were calculated from the internal calibration curve. The comprehensive calibration factor (CF) was calculated. Benzyl alcohol concentrations were utilized in achieving a benzyl alcohol calibration plot and the calibration factor considered as: (1) CF = Mol benzyl alcohol Mol internal standard × PA internal standard PA benzyl alcohol CF: for computing the calibration factor for the concentration of the constituent. Mol of compound = mole (Internal standard) × calibration factor (CF) × PA (Area (benzyl alcohol))/PA(Area (internal standard)). The quantity of the reactants consumed, and the products produced was calculated as conversion and selectivity using Eqs. (2) and (3). (2) Conversion % = Moles of benzyl alcohol reacted Total moles of benzyl alcohol × 100 (3) Selectivity % = Moles of product formed Moles of benzyl alcohol reacted × 100 Selectivity and conversion percentages are among the vital issues that are required to be taken into consideration for the heterogeneous catalysts operational in three-phase systems. In heterogeneous catalysts active components could leak into the mixture of the reaction, thus resulting in de-activation of the catalyst. Hence, the concluding solutions of the reaction were examined by atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the metal quantity. There were no metals containing the reaction mixture. Additionally, recyclability was evaluated, and consequently, the catalysts were utilized for 4 h for benzyl alcohol oxidation. Catalysts were recovered through filtration, washed with acetone six times and later dried at 80 °C. The powder recovered (0.2 g) was utilized to achieve a new reaction of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol for 4 h cycles."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The morphology of the prepared catalysts was characterized by EDX and TEM. The EDX analysis of the prepared catalysts showed the appearance of O, C, Au and Pd peaks in both samples which indicated the successful loading of the Au and Pd on carbon [16]. The TEM images in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the Au and Pd are more equivalently and consistently disseminated on carbon in the Au-Pd/CSI catalyst than in the Au-Pd/CIM catalyst. Bimetallic catalysts of Au-Pd/C are equally restrained on the carbon support. The particle size dissemination for every catalyst was obtained through measurement of the mean diameter of the particles from diverse locations [17–19]. The histogram of the size dissemination of the metal nanoparticles in both catalysts was evaluated. In Au-Pd/CIM, the particle size fluctuated between 2 and 18 nm, with the dominant dimension being approximately 4 nm, Fig. 1. Infrequent larger particles in a surplus of 25 nm were similarly realized in this material. The distribution of the metal particles in the Au-Pd/CSI was considerably finer, in the range of 2–5 nm. Fig. 2 depicts the XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts with peaks at 2θ = 26° and 2θ = 45° attributed to the carbon morphology. The peaks at 2thet 38, 66, 78 could be attributed to the palladium. No clear intense peaks for the Au0 reflection were noticed for the Au [20]. This reveals a minor amount of Au-containing NPs on the C surface (smaller than 4 nm) while most of the Au occurs as a non-crystalline Au3+ species [21]. The thermal stability profile of Au–Pd/C catalysts is revealed in Fig. 3 . The inspection of the TGA of Au-Pd/C showed that weight loss in the range 120 °C–380 °C occurs due to the loss of volatile water, whereas after 400 °C, major weight loss ensues, which can be assigned to carbon oxidation. Au-Pd/CSI showed improved thermal stability with a decomposition point which begins after 100 °C as a result of the elimination of physisorbed water. The second weight loss was as a result of the PVA decomposition at 225 °C [22]. Another weight loss was witnessed after 400 °C which matches the decomposition of the carbon [23–25]. Table 1 displays that Au-Pd/CSI has a higher surface area (961.7 m2/g) than Au-Pd/CIM (849.1 m2/g). Nanoparticles of very well-organized permeable supports offer a large surface area and greater dynamic positions for the material. This usually provides a valuable result for the reaction activities [26]. It was reported that catalysts possessing a higher surface area showed high catalytic activities [27]. The prepared Au-Pd/C catalysts showed a type IV isotherm which is microporous and revealed H3 hysteresis loops [28–31]. The acidity of the prepared catalyst was investigated by TPD-NH3 profiles showing the influence and the amount of acidic sites calculated from the area below the peaks [32]. The TPD-NH3 profile of Au-Pd/CIM showed three peaks; the first peak was at 209.8 °C which was attributed to the adsorption of ammonia on the weak Bronsted acid sites of carbon. The temperatures recorded for the other peaks were 650.2 °C and 851.3 °C with a total acidity of 2750.3 μmol/g. The TPD-NH3 profiles of the Au-Pd/CSI catalyst had three peaks. The temperatures recorded at the peaks were 167.2 °C and 337.7 °C, which was attributed to the adsorption of ammonia on the weak Bronsted acid sites of carbon, along with a conspicuous peak appearing at a temperature of 874.5 °C with a total acidity 6145.1 μmol/g. Thus, catalysts displayed two types of acid centres i.e. weak and strong acid sites [33,34]. Evidently, the preparation method has a significant effect on the acidic and effective sites. The results can be linked to the catalytic activities."
8,Stability tests,3.2 Stability tests The Leaching test: every leakage of the dynamic species from the support creates catalyst instability and therefore it is essential to investigate the stability in addition to the leaching of the metals from the support which can be categorized quantitatively through AAS. The leaching tests were performed on the prepared catalysts annealed at different temperatures. The leaching tests of the Au-Pd/CSI and Au-Pd/CIM catalysts heated at 110 °C showed a loss of Au of around 77 and 80% and a loss of Pd of around 82 and 86%. There was no leaching after the calcination at 400 °C for all of the catalysts which indicate good stability.
9,Catalytic activity of the synthesized materials,"3.3 Catalytic activity of the synthesized materials The catalytic efficiency of the prepared catalysts was evaluated for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The reaction conditions were optimized including the effect of the preparation method for the catalyst dosage, temperature and amount of H2O2. 3.3.1 Effect of preparation method 3.3.1.1 Impregnation method Oxidation of benzyl alcohol on Au·Pd/CIM, Au/CIM and Pd/CIM using H2O2 was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . Au-Pd/CIM revealed better catalytic activities than monometallic catalysts which is in line with the literature [34–36]. 3.3.1.2 Sol-immobilization method The results in Table 3 indicated that bimetallic Au-Pd/CSI catalysts performed better than the monometallic catalysts. Fig. 5 displays the effect of the reaction intervals on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over Au-Pd/CSI. With time, the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion increased and then remained constant. Thus, it can be observed that the 6 h reaction time was the optimal time to reach the optimum benzaldehyde production. It should be mentioned that the additional product formed beside benzaldehyde was benzoic acid and toluene. The low reaction after 6 h could be explained by the fact that, after forming benzoic acid, it reacts rapidly with the benzyl alcohol, therefore accumulating the benzyl alcohol conversion to form benzyl benzoate. The Au-Pd/CIM showed the best performance and therefore it was selected for further work shown in the next sections. 3.3.2 Effect of catalyst dosage The effect of the Au-Pd/CSI dosage was studied to produce optimum oxidation of the activity of benzyl alcohol [37]. By increasing the catalyst mass between 0.0, 0.3, there was an increase in the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion to the benzaldehyde. The increase in the catalyst mass results in speeding up the decomposition of H2O2 which influenced the quantity of oxidant obtainable throughout the reaction along with the reaction rate. However, by increasing the amounts above 0.3 g to 0.8, there was no significant increase in the rate. In terms of the selectivity, there was almost a linear trend in the formation of benzoic acid combined with a decrease in the benzaldehyde and a slight decrease in toluene. 3.3.3 Effect of temperature In determining the ideal temperature for the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction, a series of reactions were conducted at different temperatures; 80, 85, 90, 95 °C and 0.3 g of the catalyst amount, and with a 6-h reaction time. The results in Fig. 6 revealed that the conversion increased with the temperature increase. However, the selectivity of benzaldehyde slightly decreased which can be explained as a result of the additional oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid as the temperature increases [16,38]. Also, H2O2 rapidly decomposed into oxygen molecules at higher temperatures which prevents them from being actively involved in oxidation processes. For that, 85 °C could be considered as the optimal temperature for a higher conversion rate. 3.3.4 Effect of H2O2 ratio to benzyl alcohol oxidation Fig. 7 and Table 4 show the influence of the optimal mole ratio of H2O2 to the benzyl alcohol in the oxidation reaction. The conversion of benzyl alcohol to the desired product benzaldehyde showed a satisfactory increase and recorded the best selectivity to benzaldehyde corresponding to the highest conversion value. The H2O2 ratios showed a slight increase in conversion values. This happens due to the increase in the self-decomposition of the oxidant at higher concentrations. The formation of benzoic acid as a by-product was also enhanced due to the over-oxidation of benzaldehyde by continuing to increase the mole ratio of the oxidant. FTIR analysis was used to analyze the reactant and the product. The spectra, Fig. 8 , revealed that benzaldehyde in the product was considerably dissimilar in its absorption bands in comparison with that of the reactant, i.e. benzyl alcohol. The benzaldehyde revealed a strong, sharp band at 1710 cm−1 that was ascribed to the CO amplifying frequencies of the aldehyde group, whereas the absorption bands at 1359 cm−1 and 1222 cm−1 are attributed to CH rocking and CH Wang. The benzyl alcohol displayed absorption at 3313 cm−1, 1454 cm−1, and 1008 cm−1 in reference to asymmetric stretch vibrations of the OH bands at 1743 cm−1 as a result of the CO absorptions. The points ranging from 1000 to 1300 −1 were credited to widening vibrations of the CO, and the bands at 520 cm−1 was denoted to CCH bonding indicating that the benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde."
10,Conclusions,"Series of mono- and bimetallic Au and Pd loaded on carbon were prepared using two different methods: impregnation and sol immobilization. The characterization using TEM, and XRD indicated a more uniform distribution of the Pd catalyst and Au promotor on the surface of the carbon for the catalyst prepared by sol immobilization, i.e. Au-Pd/CSI. The surface area of Au-Pd/CSI was higher (961.7 m2/g) than the surface area (849.1 m2/g) of the catalyst prepared by impregnation, i.e. Au-Pd/CIM. Upon evaluating the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over the prepared catalyst in the presence of H2O2, the bimetallic catalysts showed better performance, and Au-Pd/CSI showed better performance than Au-Pd/CIM. Under the optimum conditions, the Au-Pd/CIM showed over 88% selectivity for the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Therefore, the production of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol by the application of a heterogeneous AuPd/C nanocatalyst is an effective catalyst to create an environmentally friendly procedure."
