0,Introduction,"In order to solve energy shortage, photo-induced energy conversion has attracted world community and been considered as one of the most promising routes. Among numerous photocatalytic systems, photo-induced H2 production and CO2 conversion to chemicals/fuels offer green pathways for sustainable development [1–3]. A variety of nanomaterials have been successively exploited to serve as novel nanocatalysts. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (DMSNs) as a typical kind own particular architectural characteristics of hierarchical nanopores and center-radial nanochannels [4–8], which gives rise to exceedingly accessible interior spaces, large pore volumes, high specific surface area, and so forth. Nanoparticles (NPs) with suitable sizes or functional molecules can be simply decorated onto the chemically active sites of these channels [5,7,9,10]. DMSNs have experienced rapid development with respect to synthesis mechanisms, approaches, and applications in the past decade [11,12]. DMSNs are very promising platforms for a wide variety of applications, such as cancer therapy [10,13], catalysis [14], drug delivery [15], protein delivery [16], water treatment [17], chromatography [18], fluorescence probes [19], supercapacitors [20], heat storage [21], bioimaging [22], composite materials [23], and so on. Catalysis study has drawn the most attention and accounted for approximate 40%. For DMSNs themselves, abundant basic sites of oxygen (O) and oxygen vacancies (Vo) exist in their structural frameworks, which significantly boost the catalytic activity with the help of the outstanding specific surface area [24]. In order to enhance catalytic abilities of DMSNs, two typical methods have been commonly adopted as follows. (I) Post-grafting technique. Some other catalytic substances could be decorated into DMSNs’ nanochannels, like noble metals (Pd [25], Ag [26], Au [27], Pt [28], etc.), tantalum hydride (TaH) [29], cobaltosic oxide (Co3O4) [30], candida rugosa lipase (CRL) [31], titanium oxide (TiO2) [32], etc. (II) Co-condensation technique. Some other elements were implanted into DMSNs’ skeletons without changing the dendritic morphology, like aluminum (Al) [33,34], copper (Cu) [34], vanadium (V) [35], stannum (Sn) [36], etc. The catalytic performances of the as-prepared composite or hybrid nanocatalysts can be more or less improved for certain chemical reactions. Even if great progress has been made, there still exist numerous possibilities to enhance catalytic properties of DMSNs. For example, up to now, it is found that just one kind of extraneous catalytic substance (the first one) can be easily modified into DMSNs’ nanochannels during post-grafting process. Grafting another type of catalyst (the second) seems to be very hard because of the already occupied nanochannels by the first one. Based on the above discovery, we aim to modify DMSNs with two types of catalytic materials for higher capabilities, nonetheless without destroying the dendritic topography. Very recently, our team have synthesized TiO2-decorated DMSNs by post-grafting approach and denominated them as dendritic mesoporous silica&titania nanospheres (DMSTNs) [37]. DMSTNs load ca. 21 wt% anatase TiO2 and keep the perfect dendritic morphology. The spherical TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 10 nm diameter disperse in channels uniformly. It was also found that these TiO2 nanospheres occupied the space of the dendritic channels and further modification with TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in undesirable structure. The pristine dendritic morphology was severely damaged, leading to debilitated physicochemical properties [37]. As is aforementioned that different nano-sized guest species have been usually loaded onto radial channels, we conceive a strategy of coating thin catalytic nanofilm onto nanoparticle-decorated DMSNs. Considering that polymeric triazine-based carbon nitride (CN) with a visible-light-driven band gap can be fabricated to various CN-based nanostructures (nanosheets, nanospheres, nanorods, etc.) [2,3], it is supposed that polymeric CN multilayer nanofilm might be developed on the interfaces of DMSTNs nanochannels, owing to its ultrathin thickness. On the basis of the above consideration, we load TiO2 nanoparticles and amorphous CN (ACN) nanofilm onto the nanochannels of DMSNs successively, aiming to develop a novel kind of catalyst for photo-induced H2 production and CO2 conversion. This investigation first demonstrates the structural evolution from DMSNs to DMSTNs, and further to ACN-coupled one (marked as DMSTNs/ACN) by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The basic physicochemical properties have been explored by Raman spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Secondly, some fundamental catalytic characters have been probed into by photoluminescence spectra (PL), ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under visible light, Mott-Schottky curve, and transient photocurrent response (i-t curve). In the end, DMSTNs/ACN hybrids have been adopted as novel catalysts for energy conversion in visible light environment by splitting water (H2O) and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), aiming to uncover their catalytic activities and selectivities."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT), cyanamide, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O), cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB), pentanol, ethyl alcohol, urea, and cyclohexane were purchased from Aladdin Corporation. All these chemicals were analytical grade and utilized without further purification."
3,Chemosynthesis,"2.2 Chemosynthesis 2.2.1 DMSNs synthesis process DMSNs nanospheres were prepared as described in our previous study [38]. Typically, urea (0.02 mol), tetraethyl orthosilicate (0.024 mol), cetylpyridinium bromide (0.0052 mol), pentanol (3.0 mL) were dissolved in a mixture of cyclohexane (60 mL) and water (60 mL). The solution were sufficiently stirred for 45 min at 25 °C and heated at 125 °C for 5 h. The as-prepared powder suffered calcination at 570 °C for 7 h. 2.2.2 DMSTNs synthesis method DMSTNs nanospheres were fabricated by means of a post-grafting technique as described in our work [37] and others [39]. DMSNs (1.0 g) were sufficiently mixed with anhydrous ethanol (200 mL) by sonication for 40 min. Aqueous ammonia (2 mL, 28%) and TBOT (5.0 mL) were added to the above mixture dropwise. Then, the temperature was set to 45 °C and maintained for 24 h under persistent stirring. The isolated product was washed with ethanol at least thrice, dried at 65 °C, and calcined at 750 °C for 6 h. 2.2.3 DMSTNs/ACN synthesis process DMSTNs/ACN was made by impregnating DMSTNs with cyanamide precursor and calcination in N2. In a typical synthesis, 0.5 g DMSTNs was added into the mixture of 4.0 g cyanamide and 12.0 g water. After stirring for 4 h, the solid was centrifuged, dried in air for 10 h, and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h in N2 by a tube furnace."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Structural features and physicochemical properties Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed with HITACHI-SU8010 system (Japan) and JEM-F200 system (Japan), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out by PANalytical X’ Pert Pro (Netherlands); XPS by ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with Al Ka radiation at hν of 1486.6 e. An ICP-OES instrument was utilized to determine titanium and silicon contents by PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV (USA). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis-DRS) were collected by an F-4500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) and a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), respectively. 2.3.2 Photocatalysis tests H2 production tests were performed by a photoreactor (Perfectlight PCX-50B, China) at a constant temperature. Catalysts (40 mg) were suspended in a methanol solution (70 mL, 10 wt%). Chloroplatinic acid solution (0.08 mL, 5 mM) was added and underwent ultrasonication for 30 min, followed by degasing with N2 for at least 40 min. AM1.5 (a 300 W Xe lamp) worked as the simulative sunlight. The produced gases were analyzed by a Labsolar-III chromatography. CO2 reduction was conducted by a Labsolar-III AG system (Perfectlight, China). 40 mg catalysts and 60 mL degassed mixture solution of triethanolamine and acetonitrile (V:V = 1:5) were placed into the reactor. Then, CO2 was injected into the system for 40 min. The reaction was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp at 25 °C. Yielded gas (1 mL) was collected for quantitative and qualitative analyses by a SD-9000A gas chromatography (FID) at a given time. GC column purchased from Thermo Scientific is nonpolar and apt to detach CO2 and CH4 with its length of 30 m and diameter of 0.32 mm."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Morphological and structural identification by SEM and TEM,"3.1 Morphological and structural identification by SEM and TEM Fig. 1 a shows SEM images of DMSNs under different magnifications. DMSNs keep monodisperse well and the surfaces of their edges are smooth. The morphologies of these nanospheres slightly vary and their edges’ surfaces become rough for DMSTNs (Fig. 1b). Spherical topographies are finely maintained only with the sizes of nanopores decreased due to the inserted TiO2 nanoparticles. No obvious morphological change can be observed for DMSTNs/ACN (Fig. 1c). TEM images of DMSNs are displayed in Fig. 1d with different magnifications. It is clear that DMSNs have the dendritic textures with particular center-radial fibrous channels. As for DMSTNs, the dendrimer-like structure and the center-radial state insensibly turn to be ambiguous. The channels are packed with TiO2 and become a little hard to be observed (Fig. 1e). There is no significant structural change for DMSTNs/ACN in TEM as well (Fig. 1f), compared with that of DMSTNs. However, the sharp edges of DMSNs and DMSTNs become blunt for DMSTNs/ACN, indicating that CN nanofilm might cover on DMSTNs interfaces by polymeric chemical reaction of cyanamide precursors."
7,"Exploration of physicochemical properties by XRD, FT-IR, Raman, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms","3.2 Exploration of physicochemical properties by XRD, FT-IR, Raman, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms XRD patterns of DMSNs, DMSTNs, and DMSTNs/ACN are exhibited in Fig. 2 a. For pure DMSNs, a broad peak centered at ca. 22° corresponds to amorphous silica [40]. In the case of hybrid DMSTNs, the peak dramatically reduces and characteristic anatase TiO2 peaks emerge as (204), (211), (200), (004), and (101). There is no apparent change for DMSTNs/ACN, implying that TiO2 nanoparticles are intact and not influenced by surface modification with cyanamide precursor. Most importantly, typical diffraction peaks of crystalline graphitic carbon nitride (GCN, or g-C3N4) at around 13.1° and 27.2° do not appear [41], which suggests that no GCN yields or ACN develops [41,42]. Fig. 2b shows FT-IR spectra of DMSNs, DMSTNs, and DMSTNs/ACN. For pure silica-based DMSNs, 1631, 1090, 963 and 810 cm−1 can attribute to SiOSi [43], H2O [43], SiOH [44], and SiO [45], respectively. Typical peaks of amorphous SiO2 in DMSTNs gradually diminish, revealing that these groups interact with TBOT or are covered by TiO2. Characteristic vibration absorption of TiOTi locates at 530–630 cm−1 and serves as flat broad peaks [46]. The above results imply that TiOTi groups develop by chemical condensation of TiOH groups themselves derived from hydrolyzed TBOT at an elevated temperature. Furthermore, characteristic peak of SiOTi at about 963 cm−1 [46] that overlaps with SiOH becomes more obvious for DMSTNs. This observation indicates that cross-linked SiOTi structures generate by hetero-condensation chemical reaction of TiOH from hydrolyzed TBOT and SiOH groups on DMSNs interfaces. When DMSTNs/ACN composites were developed by coupling with cyanamide precursor, the absorption band at 1430 cm−1 is an evident feature of the CN heterocycle [47], while the band centered at 1654 cm−1 can be ascribed to the C-N stretching vibration [48]. Raman spectra of DMSTNs and DMSTNs/ACN were also performed to determine crystal structures, as presented in Fig. 2c. Anatase TiO2 peaks of Eg , B1g , A1g + B1g , and Eg were monitored and situated at ca. 140, 380, 500, and 630 cm−1, respectively [49]. Thereby, peak at 140 cm−1 can be ascribed to OTiO vibration of octahedra TiO2. The intensities of these peaks increase for DMSTNs/ACN, implying that certain chemical reactions take place on DMSTNs interfaces. The disorganized vibrational Raman band at 750–1800 cm−1 in DMSTNs/ACN could be attributed to structural disorder of ACN caused by the electron–phonon coupling [41,42]. XRD, FT-IR, and Raman results can preliminarily prove the existence of ACN. Fig. 2d and e exhibit the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and their pore size distributions of the three materials. In the isotherms, all sample own similar IV characters and H3 hysteresis loops. It is defined that type H3 loop is responsible for slit-shaped pores derived from aggregates of plate-like particles [50], in good agreement with the shapes of dendritic nanochannels (Fig. 2f). The hysteresis loops decrease from DMSNs, to DMSTNs/ACN, and further to DMSTNs around 0.4 to 0.6 (P/P0) (Fig. 2d and Fig. S1). When TiO2 particles are decorated onto the nanochannels, some pores are packed and the N2 desorption turns to be easier, resulting in a smaller hysteresis loop. The loop slightly increase for DMSTNs/ACN, manifesting that nitrogen desorption becomes hysteretic due to the additional porous structures. Therefore, it is inferred that polymeric ACN nanofilm are multilayer which could introduce lot of pore space by the overlap of amorphous monolayers. (Fig. 1f and Fig. 2a–c). The distribution of DMSNs’ pore size is wide and four distinct peaks locate at about 4, 11, 15, and 25 nm, indicative of multifarious pores in skeletons as testified by us (Fig. 2f) [37,38], TEM, SEM, and Dai’s group [9]. Peaks located at ca. 15, 4, 11 nm decrease and others at ca. 25, 22, 19 nm even disappears for DMSTNs, suggesting that the pores are blocked by TiO2 particles to a certain extent. The pore size of DMSTNs/ACN significantly alters as follows. Peaks located at ca. 0–7.5 nm disappear, manifesting that tiny nanopores of various diameters (small red circles in Fig. 2f) were first filled with cyanamide precursors and then covered by polymeric CN nanofilm. A broad peak shows up from ca. 7.5 to 30 nm and gradually decreases, which implies that some other porous material generates with relatively big hierarchical nanopores. Liu [41] and Qiao [42] et al previously have testified that ACN monolayer lacks of a long-range ordered arrangement of nitrogen and carbon atoms, but is rich of short-range order owing to the disruption of partially crystallinity. This configuration endows ACN monolayer with the outward twisting of melon units. For this reason, the ACN multilayers could impart porous architectures. Combined with cyanamide chemistry, fabrication method of CN, N2 adsorption–desorption, FT-IR, XRD, and Raman results, we can infer that multilayer ACN nanofilm decorates on DMSTNs interfaces. The BET surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V P) for each specimen are tabulated in Table 1 . DMSNs possess the maximum values of S BET and V P. S BET and V P greatly decrease to the minimum and close to nearly three fourths of DMSNs reference for DMSTNs. When ACN multilayer coats on DMSTNs, S BET and V P greatly increase, close to that of DMSNs. Theoretically speaking, as ACN multilayers insert into DMSTNs nanochannels, S BET and V P would decrease correspondingly. The abnormal enhancement for the as-prepared DMSTNs/ACN adequately attests that the outermost ACN nanofilm is noncrystalline, polyporous, and multilayer."
8,"Confirmation of formation mechanism by HR-TEM, SAED, and XPS","3.3 Confirmation of formation mechanism by HR-TEM, SAED, and XPS Fig. 3 a,b and c,d show HR-TEM images and SAED patterns of DMSTNs/ACN. Approximate 10 nm TiO2 particles distribute in DMSTNs nanochannels (yellow circles in Fig. 3a) and belong to poly-crystal anatase, as fully confirmed by the 0.35 nm interplanar distance (Fig. 3b) and crystal planes of (200), (105), (103), (101) (Fig. 3c). Besides, another type of diffraction ring was found with highly diffused pattern as exhibited in Fig. 3d, typical for amorphous materials (ACN here). TEM-mapping of DMSTNs/ACN is also displayed in Fig. 3e, including the overall state, Si, O, Ti, C, and N, respectively. These elements are uniformly distributed in the skeleton, while the contents of C and N are relatively less than others. XPS was performed to uncover the chemical mechanisms among DMSNs, TiO2 layer, and cyanamide (Fig. 3f–j). XPS survey spectrum of DMSTNs/ACN (Fig. 3f) proves that Si2p, O1s, Ti2p, C1s, and N1s exist on their surfaces. The high-resolution spectra of C1s, N1s, O1s, and Ti2p are displayed in Fig. 3g–j, respectively. De-convolution of C1s owns four peaks and can be attributed to CC bond at ca. 284.6 eV, CN at ca. 286.5 eV, NCN from aromatic rings at ca. 288.2 eV, and CO3 2− from oxidized carbon at ca. 289.3 eV, respectively [42,48]. N1s can be fitted into three peaks with NCN group at ca. 399.9 eV, N(C)3 group at ca. 402.1 eV, and NC bond at ca. 403.3 eV, respectively [42,48]. These results powerfully testify that carbon nitride develops on DMSTNs interfaces. O1s de-convolution can be divided into SiOSi at ca. 533.6 eV, SiOTi at ca. 532.4 eV, and TiOTi at ca. 530.3 eV, respectively [51], indicating that hetero-crosslinked Si-O-Ti have occurred in the process of hybrid DMSTNs formation."
9,"UV–Vis-DRS, PL, and electrochemical analyses","3.4 UV–Vis-DRS, PL, and electrochemical analyses Diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectra was conducted to identify the coordination states of Ti species. DMSNs show no absorption band by a nearly flat curve in Fig. 4 a. For hybrid DMSTNs, a broad absorption band emerges at 200–370 nm which can be commonly divided into two parts: a broad one at 250–370 nm and the narrow at 202–230 nm, respectively [32]. The former can be responsible for octahedral Ti in Ti-O-Ti networks; the latter stands for tetrahedral Ti in isolated TiO2 units of Si-O-Ti crosslinks [32]. These findings agree well with FT-IR (Fig. 2b) and XPS (Fig. 3i). Excitingly and surprisingly, a highly improved visible-light response can be reached by implanting ACN nanofilm onto DMSTNs. On the one hand, the as-prepared composite can absorb more long wavelengths (400–800 cm−1) than those of DMSNs and DMSTNs (vertical ordinate in Fig. 4a). On the other hand, there exists a dramatic red shift for DMSTNs/ACN, indicating that the energy range in the gap decreases (horizontal ordinate in Fig. 4a). Moreover, UV–Vis-DRS was fitted using Tauc to investigate band gaps of the samples (Fig. 4b). The values equal to 3.27 for DMSTNs and 1.95 eV for DMSTNs/ACN (Δ = 1.32 eV), respectively. The former corresponds to crystalline anatase TiO2 [32]; the latter is a result of synergistic effect from TiO2 and ACN, which will be discussed later in mechanism analysis. Fig. 4c displays photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three specimens. Excitation wavelength at 270 nm with 4.60 eV photon energy can excite the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, since it is larger both than the band gaps of ACN (ca. 2.55 eV [52]) and anatase TiO2 (ca. 3.20 eV). A reduced line can be observed from 300 to 500 nm for DMSNs. Broad emission peaks generate in the case of DMSTNs from 325 to 500 nm (Fig. 4c), where the peak at 390 nm (3.18 eV) can be attributed to direct electron-hole recombination (the magnified PL spectrum as the inset); the emission at 460 nm (2.70 eV) can be answerable for surface recombination processes [53]. The PL intensity of DMSTNs/ACN tremendously decreases to an approximate straight line, indicating that recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs become much lower. In other words, their separation rate significantly increases and this improvement is wonderfully beneficial for photocatalytic reactions [54,55]. Electrochemical properties of the three materials were also compared with DMSNs solely as the reference. Fig. 4d exhibits the photocurrent density versus time (i-t) curves under visible light. All samples exhibit stable photocurrent response and variational photocurrent densities with typical periodic on–off modes. DMSTNs/ACN has a remarkably boosted photocurrent response, indicative of higher effective charge carrier concentration for ACN-coated DMSTNs [56,57]. Polymeric ACN units might accelerate the transport of photo-excited charge carrier. Fig. 4e demonstrates the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the two catalysts, where DMSTNs/ACN has a reduced arc radius than that of DMSTNs, implying that the composite texture improves ability of charge separation and transfer [56,58,59]. Mott-Schottky analysis was carried out to study the semiconducting behavior of DMSTNs and DMSTNs/ACN (Fig. 4f). DMSTNs (mainly TiO2) undoubtedly possess an approximate smooth straight line with a positive slope as the characteristic of n-type semiconductor behavior. Although the smooth line becomes uneven, a positive slope was still observed for DMSTNs/ACN, proving its nature of n-type semiconductor [60]. The nature of material bulk and its shape collectively determine the charge transportation. For one thing, DMSNs are insulative owing to pure SiO2, while DMSTNs-based ones are semiconductor materials due to TiO2 and ACN. Charges can be effectively transferred in the latter two. For another, TiO2 layer and polymeric ACN nanofilm can greatly shorten the diffusion path of charge migration and boost electron relocalization on terminal sites [61], which inhibits the charge recombination at their edges as verified in Fig. 4c."
10,Photocatalytic activity and selectivity,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity and selectivity H2 production and CO2 reduction were conducted under visible light to explore the catalytic activities and selectivities of DMSNs-based materials. Fig. 5 a-c display production capacities as a function of exposure time for each sample. Fig. 5d,e demonstrate the corresponding production rates. Production amounts with almost linear characteristics could be found in Fig. 5a–c, indicative of highly stable photocatalysts and photoreaction processes. On the whole, all three samples show higher photocatalytic activities on H2 production (0–15000 μmol/g, Fig. 5a) than that of CO (0–20 μmol/g, Fig. 5b) or CH4 (0–8 μmol/g, Fig. 5c), due to their selectivities to catalyzed systems. In the case of H2 production, DMSNs own low yield of 2900 μmol·g−1 (Fig. 5a) and production rate of ca. 570 μmol·g−1·h−1 (Fig. 5d). The as-prepared DMSTNs can yield more H2 of 9600 μmol·g−1 (Fig. 5a) with a ca. 1900 μmol·g−1·h−1 rate, owing to embedded TiO2 in nanochannels. The H2 production and rate further increase to 0–14,000 μmol·g−1 (Fig. 5a) and ca. 2700 μmol·g−1·h−1 (Fig. 5d) for DMSTNs/ACN as expected. Polshettiwar’s team previously constructed silica-titania hybrid nanospheres of specific dendritic morphology and employed them to generate H2 under UV light where Pt was used as a cocatalyst [39]. H2 capability and the rate can achieve as high as ca. 50,000 μmol·g−1 for 2 h and ca. 25,000 μmol·g−1·h−1. As for CO production, these catalytic materials present a different rule with the order of DMSTNs > DMSTNs/ACN > DMSNs. In the case of CH4 production, DMSTNs cannot boost the yield and even decline as the time prolongs; DMSTNs/ACN composites get the maximum CH4 yield and production rate. Furthermore, photocatalytic selectivities can be concluded by CO2 reduction as shown in Fig. 5e. DMSNs can generate 66.32% CO and 33.68% CH4 due to abundant oxygen vacancies and basic sites, as verified by Triwahyono and coworkers [24] . DMSTNs can produce 87.56% CO and 12.44% CH4; while DMSTNs/ACN can yield 49.10% CO and 50.90% CH4. This finding reveals that ACN nanofilm plays an important role in photocatalytic processes. Cycling tests for water splitting were performed to evaluate the catalytic durability and stability of DMSTNs/ACN (Fig. 5f). A very tiny decrease of catalytic activity was recorded after five consecutive cycles. The morphology and architecture of the final nanocatalysts (Fig. 5g) basically maintain unchanged like the pristine ones (Fig. 1c,f), indicative of the excellent stability of ACN-coated DMSTNs. Although relatively satisfactory consequences have been obtained in this work, a mass of scientific issues still need to be probed into, like the performances of DMSTNs/ACN for other catalytic systems."
11,Plausible mechanism for photocatalysis,"3.6 Plausible mechanism for photocatalysis The catalytic properties of semiconductor materials might be dominated by many factors, like (i) specific surface area and/or pore volume, (ii) crystallite form and size, (iii) band gap energy, and (iv) separation-recombination of charge carriers [62]. The catalyst’s performance would be influenced by these aspects synergistically or individually. The plausible catalytic mechanisms of DMSNs-based nanocatalysts are deciphered as demonstrated in Fig. 6 . For pure silica-based DMSNs, there are more oxygen (O) basic sites in the framework and oxygen vacancies (Vo) than those of traditional SiO2 bulk and MCM-41. These active sites dramatically boost the catalytic activity by the fantastic specific surface area and pore volume [24]. When TiO2 nanoparticles are decorated on DMSNs’ interfaces, the catalytic capability can be sharply enhanced with the help of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles by efficiently supplying electrons which are transferred from valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) for chemical reactions of water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction [57,59]. In terms of composite DMSTNs/ACN, the highly improved catalytic performances can be mainly ascribe to the following two aspects: (i) the increase of specific surface and volume than that of DMSTNs (Table 1 and Fig. 2d,e) and (ii) the introduction of n-type polymeric amorphous CN (Fig. 2b, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4f). The photocatalytic mechanism via charge transfer process can be tentatively explained in Fig. 6, by referring to the previous works [63–65]. ACN and anatase TiO2 have band gaps of 2.55 [52] and 3.20 eV [32,66], respectively. The couple of ACN and anatase TiO2 results in a band-offset in relative CB and VB positions. Photons from visible light can be absorbed by both ACN and TiO2 semiconductors of various band gaps. As photon energy equals to or is greater than the band gap energy, electrons can be excited from VB to CB (Eq. (1)). Since the CB of ACN lies above that of TiO2, photo-excited electrons transfer from the ACN CB to TiO2’s (Eq. (2)). Photo-generated holes go through a reversed process from the VB of TiO2 to that of ACN (Fig. 6). Accumulated electrons in TiO2 CB and holes in ACN VB confer certain decline in electron-hole recombination (Fig. 4d,e). Protons can be directly obtained by water oxidization with the assistance of the holes from ACN (h+) and TiO2 (h+), as shown in Eq. (4). Electrons from TiO2 participate in the reduction process of CO2 to formation of CO or CH4 (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [63–65]. (1) ACN → hv A C N ( e - ) + A C N ( h + ) (2) ACN (e−) + TiO2 → TiO2 (e−) + ACN (3) TiO2 - TiO2 (e−) → TiO2 (h+) (4) 2H2O + 4 h+ → O2 + 4H+ (5) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O (6) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O"
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we have favorably prepared dendritic mesoporous silica&titania nanospheres (DMSTNs) and polymeric amorphous CN-coupled ones (DMSTNs/ACN) as photocatalysts to split water and reduce carbon dioxide by their photocatalytic performances. DMSTNs and DMSTNs/ACN both can maintain the dendritic morphologies but possess different pore volume and surface area. The spherical TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 10 nm uniformly distribute in dendritic nanochannels of DMSTNs material. Polymeric amorphous CN of multilayer texture covers on TiO2-decorated DMSTNs to yield DMSTNs/ACN of highly improved visible-light response. As a result, DMSTNs/ACN can produce more hydrogen (H2) for water splitting and more methane (CH4) for carbon dioxide reduction under visible light, compared to that of the DMSTNs. Furthermore, it is found that DMSTNs/ACN displays not only higher photocatalytic activity over H2 generation than that of CO2 reduction, but also various selectivities for the production of CO and CH4. This investigation opens up the possibility of utilizing DMSTNs/ACN nanospheres as novel photocatalysts for energy conversion under visible light environment."
