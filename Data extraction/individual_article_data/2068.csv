0,Introduction,"A sustainable biomass resource can be converted into various types of fuels using different techniques depending on the type of biomass and the purpose of its use. The use of biomass as an alternative to petroleum products may also reduce the greenhouse gas effect [1]. Bioenergy supply has steadily increased, and it is expected that by 2050, 27% of transportation fuel may consist of bioenergy [2,3]. Various biomass conversion techniques, such as mechanical, biochemical, and thermochemical, have been developed. Among these processes, the most convenient means to produce various forms of fuels, such as power, gas, liquid, and solid, and chemicals is using thermochemical techniques such as combustion, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification, regardless of the type of feedstock used [4–7]. Fast pyrolysis systems, in particular, are advantageous owing to their low capital and operating costs [8,9]. Bio-oil, a representative liquid product produced from fast pyrolysis, has been considered a value-added intermediate chemical that is an alternative to fossil fuels usable for power, heat, or platform chemicals [1,10]. As bio-oil consists of various compounds degraded from carbohydrates and aromatic lignin, the yield and compositional distribution are dependent on biomass composition. Bio-oil generates reduced SO x and NO x emissions compared with petroleum oil [1]. Despite being environment friendly, it has serious disadvantages, including high viscosity, water content, acidity, and low calorific value with numerous oxygenated compounds. Bio-oil typically has 35–40% oxygen content with over 300 compounds depending on the source of the biomass (e.g., sugars, alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers, aromatic compounds including phenols, and alkanes) and the severity of the pyrolytic process [11–15]. These disadvantages may cause phase separation, ignition delay, repolymerization, corrosion, and clogging as bio-oil is utilized [16–21].Moreover, the energy density of bio-oil is almost half that of a conventional petroleum-derived fuel [8]. The reactive functional groups in oxygenated compounds, fine solid particles, and volatiles with low boiling point result in chemical and thermal instability and hinder the commercialization of bio-oil [22]. Therefore, bio-oil must be properly upgraded to meet the international fuel quality standards such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard. Table 1 shows two fuel oil grades for bio-oil established by ASTM [23]. Bio-oil produced by hydrothermal liquefaction (a type of hydrous pyrolysis) can decrease oxygen levels from 40% (biomass) to 10–18% [24,25]. This upgrading process has received research attention recently as it could improve the stability of bio-oil by reducing oxygen content and fine solid particles, leading to less reactive intermediates. Many review papers have focused on the current state of the pyrolysis process, future perspectives and recommendations [26,27], investigations into aging [28], the introduction of upgrading processes [29–31], effective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading [32,33], and applications and economic analysis [34,35]. There are few studies investigating the hydrogen transfer upgrading of bio-oil. As such, this review integrates the comprehensive knowledge base of the hydrogen transfer upgrading process for bio-oil using supercritical alcohols. This review also compares this process with other hydrotreating bio-oil upgrading processes and provides recommendations for future research."
1,Bio-oil upgrading,"Commercialization of using bio-oil as a transportation fuel have been limited because of disadvantages including: 1) its high acid content, which leads to engine corrosion, necessitating expensive anti-corrosive equipment; 2) its highly oxygenated compounds, which lowers its calorific value to 15–20 MJ kg−1; 3) its poor volatility, resulting in repolymerization and lower storage stability; and 4) its high water content, increasing ignition delay, phase separation, and immiscibility with petroleum [15,18,36,37]. In general, these disadvantages originate from the highly reactive oxygenated compounds in bio-oil including acids, aldehydes, phenols, furans, sugars, and pyrolyticlignin fragments [17,37–42]. These reactive compounds change the characteristics of bio-oil through esterification, phenol-aldehyde reactions, (hemi)acetal formation, aldol condensation, polymerization, and condensation [43–49]. To enhance the stability of bio-oil and convert these oxygenated compounds into less reactive intermediates for utilization, various types of upgrading processes have been investigated. These processes may be divided into physical and chemical methods. The former includes solvent addition [50–52], emulsification [53,54], hot gas vapor filtration [55,56], microfiltration [1], distillation under vacuum condition [57], extraction (liquid or solid phase) [58–60], and high-pressure homogenization [1,10]. The latter require a catalyst and high temperatures and are influenced by the types and ratio of catalysts and the heat transfer. These methods include esterification, HDO (including mild HDO), catalytic cracking, catalytic fast pyrolysis, and catalysis in supercritical fluids [1,27] (Fig. 1 ). Most biomass to liquid conversion processes have been pyrolyzed prior to catalytic upgrading (deoxygenation or hydrotreating) [14,61]. For esterification, only carboxylic acids and aldehydes can be converted. In contrast, catalytic cracking underwent decarboxylation and decarbonylation, where biomass could directly be pyrolyzed into aromatic hydrocarbons using zeolite catalysts [62,63]. The properties of the upgraded bio-oil vary depending on factors such as the feedstock, reaction media, temperature, initial pressure, reaction time, and the type of upgrading process (for example, variance of 15–36 wt% of oxygen content and 20–35 MJ kg−1 of calorific value) [36,64].Whilst the process resulted in a high quality upgraded bio-oil, it also caused a large amount of expensive external hydrogen consumption and catalyst deactivation by coke and inorganic elements like Si, K, Fe, and Al, which could reduce process economics [64]. The liquefaction of biomass, an in situhydrogenation process, has been developed to acquire directly upgraded bio-oil. This process is generally performed in sub/supercritical water [65]. As such, supercritical fluid-based upgrading processes that do not use external hydrogen have been developed to upgrade biomass and bio-oil [65–68]. However, biomass is typically solid and difficult to convert into a suitable liquid form for the supercritical fluid process as it requires high-pressure pumps [65]. Previous studies have demonstrated that upgrading bio-oil can be efficiently achieved in supercritical ethanol conditions without external hydrogen [69]. The following section discusses the details of such an approach, including the effect of supercritical solvents on the properties of bio-oil during the upgrading process."
2,Bio-oil upgrading via transfer hydrogenation,"Multi-stage HDO is one of the best performing HDO processes to upgrade bio-oil, which includes a mild hydrogenation step to stabilize bio-oil by decreasing concentrations of reactive components [70,71]. The reactions occurring in HDO involve the reduction of CO functionalities (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) to C–OH functionalities (e.g., alcohols) and the reduction of unsaturated CC bonds to saturated C–C bonds. The stabilization makes bio-oil more thermally stable, which improves the performance of the second stage HDO reactions occurring at harsher conditions (i.e., higher temperature and pressure than the first stage processes). Even though the multiple stage process involving mild hydrogenation and HDO has been considered the most viable bio-oil upgrading technology available in the open literature, the necessity of molecular hydrogen (H2) gas as a hydrogen donor is one of the biggest disadvantages of the HDO processes. When H2 gas is in contact with air, it is highly flammable, which results in difficulty in control of highly pressurized H2 gas in large scale facilities. In addition, a costly industrial process is needed for the production of H2 gas. For instance, H2 cost of steam methane reforming (using natural gas) and coal gasification was estimated to be $2.08–2.27 per kg and $1.34–1.63 per kg, respectively [72]. H2 production via water electrolysis could be more costly than the thermochemical pathways, ranging from $2.17 to 23.27 per kg [72]. Thus, the use of thermochemical routes to produce H2 would be preferred. The catalytic hydrotreatment for bio-oil upgrading is usually performed under high partial pressure with H2 (up to 30 MPa) to enhance solubility. Inversely related H2 gas/liquid miscibility and temperature could be overcome with a hydrotreatment process such as using supercritical fluids [73]. The latter could improve H2 gas/feedstock miscibility and prevent coke formation, extending the lifetime of the catalyst [73,74]. In addition, the process costs increase with the use of external molecular hydrogen (greater than 60%), noble metal catalysts, and expensive chemical usage. This limits scalability of the process to a practical size of liquefaction [73,75,76]. Supercritical fluids, which retain a fluid-like nature at a high temperature and pressure and are difficult to distinguish in the liquid or gas phase, are advantageous owing to their solubility, density, high diffusivity, and low viscosity [10,11,15,75,77–83]. Water and CO2 are commonly used supercritical fluids because they are readily available. Upgrading bio-oil using supercritical fluids effectively utilizes these distinguishable and remarkable properties [78,84,85]. During the upgrading process, a hydrogen transfer reaction occurs, and undesirable oxygenated compounds are converted into desirable and stable compounds. The properties of supercritical fluids make it possible to use them as reaction media in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems, where it is easy to purify the products and separate the catalysts after processing [11,80,86,87]. However, the supercritical fluid upgrading process is complicated, as it is difficult to establish the reaction routes. Previous studies that have upgraded bio-oil using supercritical solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, and water, found that esterification is the main reaction with acid catalysts [11,80,88–91]. Transfer hydrogenation, performed with supercritical solvents and lacking external hydrogen, has three key advantages. First, it prevents tar formation through reducing the crosslink between hydrocarbon and aromatic compounds. Second, it involves reduced energy consumption compared to other thermochemical conversions. Lastly, it effectively reduces the oxygen content compared with fast pyrolysis [14,92,93]."
3,Hydrogen donor,"3.1 Hydrogen donor Transfer hydrogenation is a reaction in which hydrogen atom (H) is transferred to an acceptor molecule from a donor molecule (not molecular hydrogen). It is basically a movement between a hydride ion and proton (or two protons and two electrons); however, the actual mechanism of the hydrogen transfer is highly associated with the substrate, the catalyst, and the reaction conditions [94]. The chemical nature of hydrogen transfer reactions has been investigated extensively from many points of view. Solvents that serve as hydrogen donors notably improve the bio-oil conversion rate and quality by hydrogenation and hydrocracking through the inhibition of recondensation compared with non-hydrogen donor solvents or external hydrogen [14]. Various types of hydrogen donor solvents such as ethylene glycol,ethylene carbonate, cyclohexanol, phenol, and alcohols have been introduced in the hydrogen transfer upgrading process. It has been reported that these solvents could prevent coke formation by a radical capping reaction [14,95–103]. Thus, general organic solvents such as water [14], methanol [104], ethanol [40,64,76,96,104–110], 1-butanol [111], acetone [104], tetralin [112,113], decalin [113], formic acid [114], and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [112] have been introduced in the bio-oil upgrading process as hydrogen donors, to potentially increase oil yield and enhance bio-oil quality [76].When the water becomes supercritical, its properties resemble that of hydrocarbons. That is, it has a low dielectric constant of ε = 2–30, low or zero surface tension, and solvation power, and it becomes an excellent solvent for organic compounds [115,116]. The dipole moment of supercritical water decreases with increasing temperature [14,117]. Supercritical water also suppresses the formation of coke or other undesirable compounds by generating layers between the feedstock micelles. This enables a high yield of oil productionand sulfur reduction in petroleum [2,115,118–120]. Studies have demonstrated that using supercritical water leads to successful carbonization, gasification, liquefaction, and upgrading of petroleum oil, microalgae, biomass, and waste sources [120–127]. Subcritical water has also been found to be conducive to the bio-oil upgrading process [128]. However, upgrading bio-oil with sub-/supercritical water generally results in significant corrosion [14]. As the hydrophobicity of hydrocarbons like tetralin and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran is immiscible with bio-oil, there is only a partial conversion of the bio-oil and thus, partial quality improvement. Supercritical alcohols have low viscosity, high diffusivity, low surface tension and are hydrogen-donors making them suitable for upgrading bio-oil by removing oxygen functionalities through esterification, alkylation, alkoxylation, or deoxygenation reactions [129]. For instance, highly reactive acids have been converted into less reactive esters, and oligomeric lignin fragments depolymerized into monomers. Supercritical alcohols also exhibit suitable physicochemical properties [16,130–136].As such, supercritical alcohols are capable of effectively upgrading bio-oil without the use of external hydrogen and catalysts [64,137]. Table 2 summarizes the product features associated with supercritical fluids for bio-oil upgrading via hydrogen transfer reactions. Upgraded bio-oils typically possess a high calorific value of approximately 30 MJ kg−1, have low acidity (<4–5 mg KOH goil −1 of total acid number (TAN)), low water content (<2 wt%), and low oxygen content (13–24 wt%) [16,40,64]. The in situhydrogen-donating ability of supercritical solvents and esterification, alkylation,and deoxygenationreactivity of these solvents may increase bio-oil yield, prevent coke formation, enable oxygen removal, and enhance energy density [76].The hydrogen-donating ability of supercritical methanolas hydroxyalkylating or hydrogenating reagents, its dielectric constants, and relatively weak hydrogen bonding,petroleum may be upgraded into a light fraction upgraded oil with high purity [105,129,138,139].Moreover, solubility is enhanced owing to the low electric constant of alcohol compared with water, resulting in relatively easy product separation [14]. Thus, both the low and high-boiling bio-oil fractions are capable of being highly upgraded using supercritical methanol [140]. Through the use of supercritical alcohol, the TAN, water content, and oxygen content had reduced, while carbon content, hydrogen content, and calorific value had increased through hydrogen donation, esterification, alcoholysis, cracking, and alkylation [40]. Moreover, ethanol could be easily recovered by distillation and reused with only a small addition, reducing process costs [140]. However, the use of supercritical ethanol does lead to side reactions, such as esterification, that occur during the upgrading process. This may be addressed by adding external acid to remove carboxylic acids with the ionization of ethanol [79]. For example, several acids with bio-oil were transformed into ethyl esters through acid catalysts such as HZSM-5 catalyzed esterification in supercritical ethanol. Supercritical alcohols acted as the reaction medium and the reactant, with HZSM-5 catalyzed esterification of acids into ester [86]. Compared with conventional (100 °C), subcritical (238 °C), and supercritical (260 °C) conditions of ethanol, during bio-oil upgrading, supercritical ethanol effectively cracked and hydrogenated compounds in bio-oil [86,137]. The mixture of organic solvent and water, such as ethanol/water, methanol/water, and tetralin/water, have also demonstrated effective thermal depolymerization at relatively mild reaction conditions and have provided active hydrogen free radicals to upgrade bio-oil [141]."
4,Catalyst,"3.2 Catalyst In addition to the type of solvent, catalysts typically affect the bio-oil upgrading process [111]. A comparison of experimental results with and without catalysts indicated that the catalyst significantly affected the bio-oil upgrading process [87]. Heterogeneous catalysts effectively promoted transfer hydrogenation with good recyclability [142]. For example, a previous study demonstrated that bio-oil could be effectively upgraded without the use of noble metals and external hydrogen gas in supercritical ethanol conditions. However the oxygen content and the amount of acidic compounds did not reach expected targets [40]. Moreover, bio-oil upgrading with supercritical alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol) without a catalyst resulted in the increase in pH of bio-oil from 2.39 to 4.04, and the content of esters in the bio-oil was increased by 87.49% [137]. However, in the absence of a catalyst, the aldehydes and the hydroxyl groups in the phenolic compounds were not effectively removed even with the supercritical alcohols, which is the most effective means for hydrogen transfer [87]. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., precious metal catalysts, base metal catalysts, and zeolites) have been studied in bio-oil upgrading, as they have high catalytic activity and are relatively easy to separate from the reactant [27]. Zhang et al. studied transfer hydrogenation of phenol on Pd catalysts supported on different supports such as activated carbon, TiO2, TiO2-activated carbon composite, Al2O3, and MIL-101 (a metal organic framework) using formic acid as a hydrogen donor [114]. Catalytic activity of the different Pd catalysts for liquid-phase transfer hydrogenation of phenol in the presence of formic acid was measured at 50 °C and under 5 bar), as a model reaction of in situ bio-oil upgrading. The catalytic activity for the transfer hydrogenation of phenol followed a trend of: Pd/activated carbon > Pd/TiO2-activated carbon composite > Pd/MIL-101 > Pd/TiO2 > Pd/Al2O3. Activated carbon has a hydrophobic nature similar to formic acid. The hydrophobic nature may help adsorption of the substrates onto the catalyst surface, leading to the high hydrogenation activity. In this sense, the existence of formic acid markedly decreased the transfer hydrogenation activity of Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2, and Pd/MIL-101. It was likely because of the competitive adsorption of phenol and formic acid molecules onto a Pd site. Shafaghat et al. used tetralin and decalin as hydrogen donors for hydrogenation of different phenolic species (considered renewable chemicals derived from lignin) such as guaiacol, cresol, and phenol with Pt and Pd catalysts supported on activated carbon [113]. The Pt catalyst was more active than the Pd catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds at 275 °C. Decalin was more efficient hydrogen donor than tetralin for the transfer hydrogenation of the phenolic species. The effect of adding water solvent on the transfer hydrogenation was also investigated with weight ratios of the hydrogen donor/water of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75, showing that the hydrogen donor/water ratio of 50/50 gave the highest transfer hydrogenation performance. The addition of water enhanced the hydrogenation activity because of a decrease in interaction between the hydrogen donor and metal sites, which allowed more chance of the feed molecules to reach the catalytic sites. However, a more addition of water (i.e., a weight ratio of 25/75) led to lowering the content of the hydrogen donor, causing a low amount of hydrogen required for the hydrogenation reaction. In spite of the potential experimental results of using noble metal catalysts for hydrogen transfer reactions of bio-oil compounds, the cost of noble metal catalysts can make the hydrogen transfer reactions not economically feasible. Considering that the price of heterogeneous catalyst is one of the most important factor for the commercialization of catalytic processes [143], inexpensive and active non-noble transition metals, specifically Ni (which activates hydrogenation and inhibits coke formation) and Fe (which promotes C–O bond hydrogenation and inhibits C–C bond cleavage), have attracted much research attention [46,144–146]. When Ni is used in bio-oil upgrading, it selectively removes oxygen through hydrogenation and cracking whilst Fe promotes HDO and ketonization [147–149]. With Ni catalysts, transfer hydrogenation of oxygenated compounds and aromatics had accelerated in supercritical 2-propanol. Particularly for phenol, full transfer hydrogenation was achieved only with the supercritical condition of 2-propanol and 2-butanol with a hydrogen balance of 1.0 [150]. However, mono-transition metal catalysts generally showed lower activity than noble metal catalysts. Thus, the second metal was loaded to support the metal and form bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni–Cu, Ni–Fe, and Ni–Mo, resulting in improved catalytic properties [147]. For example, Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts were found to promote hydrogenation (especially CO functional group) and hydrogenolysis reactions through adsorption of hydrogen by metal oxides (Fe increased NiO dispersion) [146,151,152]. Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts also showed high activity for in situ transfer hydrogenation. For example, Ni–Cu/γ-Al2O3 effectively transferred hydrogenolyzed glycerol to 1,2-propanediol in supercritical isopropanol [92]. Since bio-oil comprises several lignin derived low molecular compounds, there has been substantial research focusing on upgrading (transfer hydrogenation) lignin model compounds in supercritical fluids. Protolignin was selectively hydrogenolyzed to 4-n-propylguaiacol and 4-n-propylsyringol with Ni/C in supercritical methanol [153], and to 4-propenyl guaiacol and 4-propenyl syringol with Pd/C in a supercritical solvent of water and ethanol mixture [154] without external hydrogen [155]. Commercial RANEY® Ni also feasibly enhanced the transfer HDO of bio-oil in supercritical 2-propahnol under mild conditions [150]. Among the Ni catalysts, Mg–Ni–Mo/C could effectively upgrade bio-oil in supercritical methanol, ethanol, butanol, hexanol, and formic acid and acquire an upgraded bio-oil with low oxygen levels, water content, and enhanced calorific value [69,156]. Transfer hydrogenation of organosolv lignin with Cu based catalysts in supercritical methanol was found to completely remove aromatics and significantly reduce oxygen content [157]. In addition to the surface metal species and the type of catalyst support also affects the catalytic activity and products selectivity. Metal oxide supports (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, MgO, and mesoporous silica) have been used as transfer hydrogenation reactions in supercritical alcohols. The alumina support is partially transformed to boehmite or produces a high amount of coke due to its instability [158]. Alternative supports, such as acidic aluminium silicate is able to convert most acids into an ester form in supercritical ethanol as well as reduce aldehydes and phenolic compounds [87]. As the acid catalysts promote the cracking of oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons, a high silica rate to alumina led to a high yield of aromatics. However, microporous zeolites easily deactivated by water and coke, resulted in the production of undesired polyhydroxyaromatic products. The mesoporous structure was able to penetrate large fragments and effectively generate aromatics. These supports are also hardly poisoned by water or coke due to the water elimination and suitable deoxygenation [27]. For example, metal loaded HZSM-5 has been exploited for improving catalyst stability, and HZSM-5 itself has high activity and selectivity resulting in effective oxygen removal for oxygenated compounds [151,159]. Bifunctional catalysts, which are a combination of acid catalysts and metal catalysts, are able to effectively hydrocrack bio-oil under mild conditions without external hydrogen through esterification, cracking (alcoholysis and hydrolysis), hydrogenation, and acetalization [27,80,160]. The acid center of bifunctional catalystspromotes isomerization and cracking, and the metal active sites improve hydrogenation of oxygenated compounds [141,161]. On this premise, the type of supports may also be affected due to the bio-oil upgrading process, so Ru and Pt–Ni on SBA-15, ZrO2/SBA-15 and SO4 2−/ZrO2/SBA-15 were also tested and resulted in effective hydrocracking of lignin-derived compounds [80]. Metals supported on carbon (Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ru/C), Ru/HZSM-5, and Co–Mo catalysts have been used to enhance bio-oil quality, which had high regenerabilities [69,140,162].Among the catalysts, the Ru/HZSM-5 catalyst had lower hydrogenation activity due to larger metal particles, resulting in a higher amount of acids in the upgraded oil compared to the use of Ru/C [140]. Bifunctional Co–Zn/HZSM-5catalysts promoted deoxygenation more effectively, particularly for decarboxylation of acids and decarbonylation of ketones with a higher amount of upgraded oil yield consisting of hydrocarbons rather than monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts [141]. Table 3 summarizes the product features associated with catalysts for bio-oil upgrading via hydrogen transfer reactions using supercritical alcohols. Instead of a metal catalyst and external hydrogen, the activated carbon or hydrocarbon/carbon systems may also catalyze the bio-oil upgrading process [99,163,164]. In experiments with diphenylpropane as the model compound in supercritical tetralin, metal-free hydrocarbon/carbon catalyzed the solvent dehydrogenation and converted the reactant into naphthalene with a yield of 16.9% [99,165]. It is because the H atoms on the activated carbon could be transferred to the hydrogen acceptors during the upgrading process by promoting supercritical fluids and enhancing the efficient collision number between the hydrogen acceptor and hydrogen donor [99]. In addition, the liquid and gas-like properties of the supercritical medium is expected to extract coke precursors out of the pore structure of catalysts [40,99,166]. The properties of the reaction medium in the near-critical region need to be tuned for the suppression of coke formation in the hydrogen-donor solvent/carbon system [99]. In spite of its high catalytic activity, catalysts continue to have a few key issues; sintering, deactivation, and coke formation [167] with effective stabilization and oxygen removal and the high cost [27,40,87,168,169]. It is known that the use of selective supercritical conditions can lower the gaseous phase and surface concentrations of coke precursors [170]."
5,Mechanism,"3.3 Mechanism The mechanism of a hydrogen transfer reaction is highly dependent upon the starting material (i.e., feedstock) and the kind of catalyst (e.g., the particular type of metal). The hydrogen transfer reaction mechanisms can be differentiated as two major pathways: direct mechanism and indirect mechanism [171]. For the direct hydrogen transfer mechanism, hydrogen atom is transferred directly from the donor to the acceptor molecule (Fig. 2 A). Strong Lewis acids such as aluminum cation (e.g., AlIII) and lanthanide ion (LnIII) are the most catalytically active systems for the direct reaction pathway. Strong Lewis acid metal ions enable to coordinate the acceptor and donor molecules. They can be activated via polarization, promoting an intramolecular hydrogen shift (Fig. 2A). For the indirect mechanism, an intermediate metal hydride complex forms (Fig. 2B). Weak Lewis acids such as Ir, Ru, and Rh are the most catalytically active systems for the indirect reaction pathway because of their high affinities for hydrides [94]. The metal hydride intermediate can transfer one (Fig. 2B1) or two hydrides (Fig. 2B2) to the acceptor molecule, dependent upon the type of catalyst. As hydrogen transfer reactions are equilibrium reactions, the dominance of the reduction and oxidation pathways are highly associated with the concentration and thermodynamic stability of the acceptor and donor molecules involved in the reduction–oxidation equilibrium [94]. During transfer hydrogenation process for bio-oil upgrading with supported noble metal catalysts in supercritical alcohols, the compounds in bio-oil thermally promote bond cleavage and hydrogen donors (supercritical fluids) prevent repolymerization (also referred as coke formation) prior to liquefaction. The supercritical fluid as the hydrogen donor (particularly aliphatic alcohols) were more efficiently employed compared to external hydrogen [14].From supercritical fluid (especially alcohols), hydrogen derived in hydride form or by proton transfer could effectively remove oxygen in bio-oil, the cracking of pyrolytic lignin and prevent coke formation [64]. Major oxygenated compounds in bio-oil such as acids, aldehydes, levoglucosan and monoaromatics substituted with α,β-unsaturated aldehyde groups underwent esterification, cracking, alcoholysis, hydrolysis, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, aldol condensation, ring-opening, isomerization, demethylation, hydrocracking, HDO, hydrogenation, acetalization, and other reactions simultaneously to remove oxygenand convert this into a less or non-reactive species [12,16,69,80,111]. Esterification of organic acids with acid catalysts in supercritical fluids (e.g., water, methanol, and ethanol) could decrease acidity and viscosity. In particular, supercritical ethanol acts as both the reactant medium to reduce the viscosity and as the hydrogen donor (generate hydroxyl and hydrogen radical) [156]. The reduction of aldehydes and ketones into alcohols and CC hydrogenation (saturation) occurred at the stabilization step of transfer hydrogenation. This makes bio-oil thermally stable and improves the performance of the second stage such as HDO. However, the hydrogen bonds between oxygenated compounds (acids or phenols) and water in bio-oil, and bio-oil polarity result in a lower conversion rate and selectivity of undesirable compounds [78]. Hydrogen donor solvents and supercritical fluids stabilize free radicals, causing the reactivity of bio-oil and assisting thermal cleavage. It was reported that coal-derived fragments could be stabilized by partially hydrogenated aromatic compounds, with the structure swelling owing to the solvent [14]. The presence of hydrogen is also essential to inhibit char formation due to reduced thermal cleavage [14,99,172,173]. After transfer hydrogenation, the alkoxy-substituted phenolic compounds decreased whereas the alkyl-substituted phenolic groups increased, equating to the effective hydrogenation of the side chain. The supercritical ethanol derived ethyl group could also concurrently attach on the alkoxy-substituted phenol. However, the hydrogen generated from the supercritical solvent was insufficient to remove the phenolic hydroxyl group, resulting in a need for external hydrogen to completely convert into benzene, alkyl benzene, or cyclohexane [156]. When water became supercritical, the dielectric constant drastically decreased and the polarity of water reduced. Therefore, transfer hydrogenation upgrading was conducted in supercritical water, [H3O+] was produced from water, and the ion promoted the acid-required reactions and potentially extracted heavy hydrocarbons. Moreover, the increased solubility of water could extract lighter compounds [115,116]. When the catalyst was added in higher amounts, the consumed external hydrogen decreased as the generated in-situ hydrogen was utilized prior to external hydrogen, and almost all initial hydrogen remained after the upgrading process [73]. Supercritical alcohol also produced hydrogen to reduce oxygen in bio-oil through the generation of water [14]. As such, with a hydrogen-donor solvent, the supercritical fluids in the upgrade of bio-oil may be used instead of external hydrogen [99,120,174].Carbon monoxide (CO) produced during hydrocarbon upgrading could also generate in-situ hydrogen through a water–gas shift [115]. However, transfer hydrogenation generally covered the initial hydrogenation or stabilization step and did not undergo an entire deoxygenation reaction [92]. With the upgrade of bio-oil in supercritical methanol, two or three equivalent hydrogens were generated by 1) reforming CH3OH → CO + 2 H2 and 2) water–gas shift CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and then transfer hydrogenation was performed as presented in the previous study: C159H192O65 + 126 H2 → 11 C9H18 + 24 CH3OH + 41 H2O + 2 C18H34 [157]. However, ethanol, which has a longer alkyl chain than methanol, showed better solubility of larger fragments, resulting in a high yield of bio-oil with low coke yield [40]. According to the model compound study, guaiacol was converted and upgraded through 1) hydrogenation of the benzene ring (with metal catalyst, generally carbon supported noble metal catalysts); 2) demethoxylation to cyclohexanol or phenol (with acidic catalysts); 3) alkyl substitution; 4) etherification and isomerization; and 5) demethylation in supercritical fluid [175]. Particularly in supercritical ethanol, ethanol produces large amounts of ethyl and methyl groups as the reaction medium, which may be utilized as a substitute [175]. Ethanol and isopropanol, which has α-carbon, participated in self-aldol condensation to enlarge the alcohol carbon chain. However, ethanol and isopropanol barely participated in ring alkylation. This suggests that supercritical isopropanol is more active in cracking bio-oil compounds. Thus, the long carbon chain of alcohol may reduce decomposition temperature without a chain elongation reaction [64]. Hydroxyl groups of Cα underwent dehydration to form double bonds during the β-O-4 linkages, which were hydrogenolyzed, and it hydrogenated [157]. Transfer hydrogenation of bio-oil could stabilize bio-oil through the reduction of reactive unsaturated C–C and C–O bonds, preventing further repolymerization. However, further development is required to reach commercial fuel quality [92]. According to the methanol‑d4 experiment, aromatic ring hydrogenation occurred through an exchange between the protonsin the aromatic substrate and the reactive solvent medium [157]."
6,Comparison with other upgrading processes,"As discussed in Section 2, there are various ways to upgrade bio-oil. Among them, emulsification is a simple and direct utilization without engine modification. When the emulsion of bio-oil and commercial diesel was used, fuel and energy consumption increased during braking, while the brake power showed no significant difference. Moreover, there was a reduced generation of CO and smoke although CO2 emissions had increased. Depending on the origin of the emulsion, NO x emission also varied. The aldehydes and hydroxyl compounds reduced NO x due to the hydroxyl groups, while sugars and whole bio-oil increased NO x emissions. However, this process required post-treatment, such as the recovery of solvents and surfactants [176]. HDO, an effective bio-oil upgrading process to obtain high quality bio-oil with external hydrogen, may address limitations of hydrogen solubility by consuming only small quantities of hydrogen, in addition to effective stabilization of pyrolytic lignin oil under initial 1–3 MPa of hydrogen [27,77–79,111,145,158,162,169,177]. HDO of bio-oil using supercritical alcohols (ethanol, methanol, and 2-propanol) could notably reduce oxygen levels, but depending on the polarity and acidity of the alcohol, the bio-oil was highly deoxygenated (supercritical methanol) or lost a large quantities of carbon (2-propanol) [77]. Regardless of high cost and scarcity restricting large scale industrial application, noble metal catalysts including Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C exhibit high activities during HDO of bio-oil [141,178–180]. As discussed in Section 3.2., transition metals (including Co and Zn) and acidic catalysts (HZSM-5 zeolite) are inexpensive, thermally stable and have high activity for bio-oil HDO [144,159]. Although HZSM-5 is able to convert oxygenated compounds, metal-doped HZSM-5 catalysts, referred as bi-functional catalysts, may substantially enhance HDO activity [86,145,181]. During bio-oil HDO, hydrogenation and esterification typically promote the production of hydrocarbons and esters [83,151]. During the upgrading process, bio-oil stabilized at low temperature of 100–280 °C with trace amount of hydrogen (carbonyl groups were hydrogenated into stable alcohols in this step), and stabilized bio-oil intermediates were treated at a higher temperature of 350–400 °C for further oxygen removal [1]. Specifically, various phenolic compounds in bio-oil were converted into cyclohexene-derived compounds through hydrogenation or cyclohexane by further rehydrogenation. Guaiacol or syringol derived compounds performed demethylation and demethoxylation and produced phenol derived compounds with methane and methanol during HDO. Following these series of reactions, bio-oil was upgraded into a high energy density fuel, which was non-corrosive and had<2 wt% of oxygen level [27]. However, HDO is still expensive as it requires external hydrogen and also has catalyst coking at high temperatures. Therefore, mild HDO to make bio-oil as an intermediate for further refinement, or a combination with transfer hydrogenation in supercritical fluids, has been developed and performed [1,40,69]. Furthermore, stabilized oxygenated compounds were also able to utilize combustion additives or other fuel additives [92]. Even the catalytic fast pyrolysis combined with the hydrogenation upgrading process could produce thermally stable bio-oil with reduced acid and oxygen content [27]. Since thermal upgrading with catalytic treatment is also posited as a suitable bio-oil upgrading method, various types of combined processes have recently been proposed [27].Combined hydrogenation and esterification has been developed to stabilize the main reactive functional groups (acids and aldehydes) in bio-oil with bifunctional mesoporous catalysts such as Pt/SBA15-PrSO3H [1]. The combination of HDO with catalytic cracking has also been proposed, as has enhanced hydrogenation and cracking with bi-functional catalysts (Ru/ZrO2/SBA-15 and Ru/SO4 2−/ZrO2/SBA-15) in supercritical ethanol and external hydrogen. As the cracking reaction takes place in hydrogen conditions, polymerization was suppressed and coke formation was prevented [1]. In Table 4 , the pros and cons of different bio-oil upgrading processes are compared."
7,Conclusions and recommendations for future work,"Owing to the high demands for various types of energy, biorefinery processes that produce alternative liquid fuels are receiving greater attention [200–204]. Pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading is a crucial process for the improvement of the quality of bio-oil to meet a conventional transport fuel. Hydrotreating of bio-oil (e.g., deoxygenation via a reaction with hydrogen) is the most important part of the upgrading process. This review has focused on recent advances in the upgrade of bio-oil by hydrogen transfer reactions in view of employing hydrogen donor substance as alternative to H2 gas allowing less expensive and safer control of the bio-oil upgrading process than other hydrotreating methods such as HDO. As discussed above, alcohols are commonly used as hydrogen donors. Alcohols are readily available, reactive at relatively mild conditions, and highly active and selective for the hydrogen transfer reactions. They also open up the possibility of the employment of the hydrogen donor molecule as the reaction media with no mass transfer limitation. Among the hydrogen transfer processes, catalytic upgrading at supercritical conditions followed by a thermochemical conversion process could produce a bio-oil of suitable quality. Although upgrading bio-oil with supercritical fluids effectively improves bio-oil quality and stability, the process cost is still relatively expensive owing to operational problems like plugging and corrosion, reactor design, effluent dilutionrate, and high energy consumption to meet current fuel demands [40,182]. This requires improvements to energy and solvent recovery during the process, the development of effective non-noble metal catalysts, and equipment cost reduction. Model compound experiments suggest a clear reaction mechanism and kinetic, with several research studies having been conducted. However, bio-oil consists of various oxygenated compounds, and the type of supercritical solvent and its effects are highly associated with the reaction conditions and catalysts used for the hydrogen transfer reaction. In this regard, the mechanism of the transfer hydrogenation upgrading of bio-oil is extremely complex as it is characterized by simultaneously reactions which remain to be studied. Most of the research into bio-oil upgrading via hydrogen transfer reactions to date has focused on product yield, despite an emphasis on the importance of a hydrogen donor to stabilize and enhance the product quality and quantity. This highlights the need for more detailed model compound experiments with theoretical studies prior to real bio-oil experiments to stabilize and scale up for commercialization [87,115]. Supercritical ethanol possesses some process limitations despite its ability to produce high performance bio-oil. These limitations include cost (it is more expensive than methanol), the difficulty in quantifying the amount of ethanol consumed for hydrogen donation, and variations in energy recovery and efficiency due to the involvement of ethanol in the process [64]. A techno-economic analysis of the bio-oil upgrading processes is required to commercialize high quality bio-oil production. Such an analysis of pyrolysis has already been undertaken as follows. The process cost was determined by the costs of the reactor (10–15%), feedstock handling (69–88%), labor (12–19%), and transportation (5–7%); the produced bio-oil costs 0.60–1.48 $ per gallon depending on plant size. It has been suggested that the price of bio-oil upgraded by HDO should be approximately 740 $ per tonne of oil equivalent (toe), whereas the bio-ethanol price is approximately 1475–2029 $ per toe [27]. The need for a high ratio of solvent and short catalyst lifetime should also be addressed to scale up the process [92,120]."
