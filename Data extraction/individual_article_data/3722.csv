0,Introduction,"In the recent years there have been violent fluctuations in the price of oil. Furthermore there is now a widespread consensus that the anthropogenic emission of CO2 to a significant extent is contributing to the increase in global temperature. A solution that potentially addresses both these issues could be an increased use of biofuels in the transportation sector. An interesting route to biofuels is the gasification of biomass to form syngas with a subsequent conversion of the syngas to fuel chemicals. Due to i.a. their high octane numbers alcohols are interesting as additives to or substitutes for oil derived gasoline. Smaller alcohols, and particularly methanol, do however suffer from a limited miscibility with gasoline, which hampers their introduction as fuel additives [1,2]. These miscibility problems can be reduced significantly by including higher alcohols in the alcohol/gasoline mixture, as these higher species act as co-solvents to methanol and stabilize the alcohol/gasoline blend [2–4]. Such a mixture of methanol and higher alcohols can be produced directly from syngas over various modified methanol [5–8] or Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [9–11] catalysts. An interesting catalytic system, which is the subject of the present investigation, is alkali promoted molybdenum sulfide [12] – often additionally promoted with cobalt [12–14] or nickel [12,15–17]. This catalytic system was discovered by the Dow Chemical Company [18–21] and the Union Carbide Corporation [22–24] in the 1980s and has the potential to yield a substantial fraction of higher alcohols. The main product is linear, primary alcohols, while the predominant by-product is short-chained hydrocarbons. In addition to these products a small amount of oxygenated by-products, particularly esters, is also formed [25]. Although the ability of this system to produce alcohols is well established, there are still a number of unresolved issues related to the properties of the Alkali/MoS2 catalyst. One such issue is the stability of the catalyst in a syngas atmosphere, and a question here is how the presence of H2S in the syngas affects the stability. While some authors [26] mention that the catalytic properties essentially are unaltered by extended exposure to sulfur-free syngas, other investigations [27] have shown that the structure and properties of the catalyst change over time, when sulfur-free syngas is being fed to the synthesis reactor. It has also been reported that the catalyst requires the presence of 50–100ppmv H2S in the syngas feed [10]. Another unresolved issue related to the use of the sulfide catalyst is the possible incorporation of sulfur species into the liquid alcohol product. Early research by the Dow Chemical Company showed that small amounts of low boiling, sulfur-containing compounds are incorporated into the alcohol product [20,25,28]. To solve this problem the Dow process included a stabilizer column, which reportedly would be able to reduce the sulfur level in the alcohol product to 10ppm with a modest vapor boil-up [25]. The environmental regulations concerning the sulfur level in automotive fuels are becoming increasingly strict. In the US the EPA Tier II regulations have since 2006 limited the average sulfur concentration in gasoline to 30ppmw, while the limit on sulfur in highway diesel is 15ppmw [29]. Within the EU an upper sulfur limit of 10ppmw in gasoline and diesel must be completely phased in at the beginning of 2009 [30]. A substantial concentration of sulfur in the alcohol product would therefore be highly undesirable, if the product is to be used as an automotive fuel or a fuel additive. However despite the importance of such a potential incorporation of sulfur species into the reaction product, this subject has received very little attention in the open literature. It is therefore not entirely clear, to what extent sulfur is incorporated into the alcohol product, and which sulfur compounds might be present in the condensed product. Both the stability of the catalyst and the product sulfur content are likely to be affected by the presence of sulfur sources in the syngas feed. Here H2S is the most important source, since it is the dominant sulfur compound in a typical syngas obtained from gasification of carbonaceous feedstocks [31]. Isotopic labeling experiments by Santiesteban et al. [32,33] indicated that the chain growth mechanism is based upon a CO insertion into an alkyl group as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Furthermore experiments with co-feeding of methanol and ethanol along with the syngas have shown that these alcohols can be readsorbed and converted into higher species over the catalyst [12,32,34]. While these elements of the reaction mechanism have been resolved, investigations of the reaction kinetics over molybdenum sulfide catalysts are relatively scarce [35–37] and are typically conducted without H2S in the syngas feed. The reaction kinetics could also be affected by the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the syngas feed, and this influence of H2S should be elucidated. This work investigates the effects of the process conditions upon the alcohol synthesis over a K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst. A significant emphasis is on the effects of H2S in the syngas feed. This includes effects upon the reaction kinetics, upon the stability of the catalyst and upon the sulfur concentration in the condensed reaction product. The effects of other operating parameters such as temperature and H2/CO pressures are however also investigated."
1,Experimental,"The experimental work is conducted using a high-pressure flow reactor setup, which is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The reactor consists of a quartz tube (i.d. 8mm; o.d. 10mm; length 1545mm), which contains the 250mm long bed of catalyst particles (d p,average =0.9mm). The quartz tube is placed inside a TP347 stainless steel pressure shell. As the interior of the quartz tube is pressurized, nitrogen is dosed to the pressure shell to ensure that no pressure gradient exists across the quartz tube wall. The shell side pressure is regulated by two Brooks 5866 mass flow pressure controllers. The ensemble of reactor tube and pressure shell is placed inside an Entech tube oven. The reactor temperature is monitored by type K (±2.2K or 0.75%) thermoelements positioned inside two steel thermo pockets placed in the void between the quartz tube and the pressure shell. The bed of catalyst is contained within the isothermal zone (±1.5K) in the oven. The feed gases: CO, H2, N2 and 2vol% H2S in H2 are supplied to the reactor from pressurized cylinders via Brooks 5850S mass flow controllers, and the feed gases are mixed before entering the reactor. Downstream from the reactor the pressure is relieved by means of a pneumatically operated Flowserve Kämmer pressure reduction valve, and the reactor effluent is directed to the characterization section. The reactor effluent is characterized using a GC-FID/TCD detection system (6890N from Agilent Technologies), which uses helium as the carrier gas. Alcohols and H2S are separated using a DB1 column. Hydrocarbons, CO, H2, CO2 and N2 are separated using a dual column system, where a Porapak N column is followed by a 13× Molesieve column. The characterized alcohols are methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol, while the characterized hydrocarbons are methane, ethane, ethene and propane. The volumetric flow rate of the reactor effluent is measured using a bubble flow meter. The measured volumetric flow rate and the measured concentration of component i can be used to determine the molar flow rate of component i, which is denoted F i . The reported CO conversion (X CO) is calculated from the molar flow rates of CO into and out of the reactor: (1) X CO = F CO in − F CO out F CO in The alcohol selectivity (S Alc) presented in this paper is the carbon based, CO2-free selectivity, which is calculated on the basis of the four characterized alcohols: (2) S Alc = ∑ n = 1 4 n F Alc , n out F CO in − F CO out − F C O 2 out Here n is the carbon number in the alcohol. It should be noted that this expression is somewhat susceptible to experimental uncertainty, when the conversion is low. Another evaluation parameter, which is used in the subsequent text, is the weight ratio between the production of higher alcohols and the production of methanol: (3) C 2 + OH C 1 OH = ∑ n = 2 4 M Alc , n ⋅ F Alc , n out M MeOH ⋅ F MeOH out Here M Alc,n denotes the molar mass of the alcohol with n carbon atoms. In general the mass balances for C, H and O are fulfilled within 5mol% and typically better than this. Hydrogen sulfide is the only sulfur-containing compound, which is characterized, but a significant conversion of H2S is always observed, and for this reason the sulfur mass balance is at best closed within 15–25mol%. It should be mentioned that the H2S concentrations employed are rather low, and this causes an uncertainty on the concentrations measurements, as the signal to noise ratio is relatively low. This means that H2S concentrations below 10–15ppmv cannot be adequately measured. In the kinetic investigations the parameter space employed is T =275−350°C, P =100bar, P H 2 P CO ∈ [ 0.5 ; 5 ] , GHSV≅5000h−1 (based on total bed volume and referring to 298.15K and 1atm). The kinetic studies have been performed with 260ppmv of H2S in the syngas feed to avoid the gradual changes in product distribution, which, as it will be discussed subsequently, are observed for long periods of time in the absence of co-fed H2S. The measurements in the kinetic investigations are performed after at least 15h on stream and constitute an average over 2h with stable measurements. The partial pressures of CO and H2 are varied at a constant total pressure and a constant GHSV by replacing part of the flow of one reactant with a flow of nitrogen. The partial pressure of H2S is also varied as part of the kinetic investigations. As the H2S concentration is very low, the H2S pressure is varied by replacing a very small part of the H2 flow with an H2S flow, whereby the GHSV is kept constant. As the H2S concentration in the feed is very low, the H2 concentration in the feed is approximately constant (within 0.4%) even though the H2S concentration in the feed is changed by a factor of 6. The absence of both internal and external mass transfer limitations in the performed experiments has been verified by evaluating the observed reaction rates against the Mears [38] and Weiss–Prater [39,40] criteria. Diffusion coefficients and viscosities used in these calculations have been estimated using the Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory [41]. The experimental setup has previously been used for investigations of homogeneous gas phase chemistry, and in this connection additional descriptions of the setup have been provided [42–46]. Generally the system is operated without condensation of the liquid reaction product, but in some cases the alcohol product is condensed and collected. This is done at atmospheric pressure and dry ice temperature (−78.5°C). The sulfur content in the condensed liquid samples has been determined in a process, where the sample is first decomposed by microwave heating to 230°C in a mixture of HNO3 and H2O2. The mixture is then diluted with H2O, and finally the sulfur content in the diluted sample is determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP–OES). To determine the nature of the sulfur species present in the alcohol product, the liquid product has been subjected to a qualitative sulfur analysis by means of GC-AED. The experimental work is conducted using a carbon supported K2CO3/Co/MoS2 catalyst provided by Haldor Topsøe A/S. The catalyst is prepared in the oxide form, and prior to use the catalyst is sulfided in an 80NmL/min (with NmL relating to 273.15K and 1atm) flow of 2vol% H2S in H2 at atmospheric pressure. The sulfidation is initiated at 100°C, and the temperature is then raised to 300°C at a rate of 4°C/min. The sulfidation is sustained at 300°C until no further sulfur uptake can be detected. In total 3 different catalyst samples were used, and various physical properties for these catalyst samples are summarized in Table 1 . It should be emphasized that these catalysts do not represent optimized formulations. The pore structure of the catalyst is characterized by means of mercury porosimetry using a Micromeritics Autopore II 9220 porosimeter, while the BET areas have been obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 surface area analyzer. It should be emphasized that when a space-time yield (STY) is reported in the subsequent text, the STY is the mass of alcohol produced per hour and per mass of catalyst. Here the mass of catalyst is referring to the total mass of the active materials and the carbon carrier."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Stability,"3.1 Stability The first part of this investigation concerns the stability of the catalyst in the syngas atmosphere and the influence of co-fed H2S upon the stability. This investigation is conducted using the catalyst KCoMo-1. Fig. 3 shows the CO conversion and the CO2-free alcohol selectivity as functions of time on stream in an H2S-free syngas. In parallel Fig. 4 shows the CO conversion and the alcohol selectivity as functions of time on stream with a syngas feed that contains 218ppmv H2S. From Figs. 3 and 4 it can be seen that irrespective of the feed sulfur level, the catalyst requires an initiation period to reach a stabilized behavior, but the duration of this period depends upon the H2S level. With 218ppmv H2S in the syngas feed the selectivity stabilizes within the first 10h on stream, but in the absence of H2S the catalyst requires 30–35h on stream before the selectivity stabilizes. During the first hours on stream the alcohol selectivity gradually increases, while the CO conversion gradually decreases. There are presumably several factors that contribute to the behavior seen in Figs. 3 and 4. The temperature in the catalytic bed rises significantly (15–20°C), when the catalyst is first exposed to syngas, and this is to some extent contributing to the initial peak in conversion. However the gradual changes in conversion and selectivity prevail even after the temperature has reverted to the set point (after approximately 1h on stream). A factor that might contribute to the gradual developments in selectivity and activity is a gradual spreading of the alkali promoter across the catalytic surface. An enhanced alcohol selectivity at the cost of a decreased CO conversion is the reported effect of the alkali promoter [47], and this is the behavior that develops during the first hours on stream. Iranmahboob et al. [48] investigated Alkali/Co/MoS2/Clay catalysts by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after exposure to syngas, and these authors report a surface enrichment of the alkali promoter after exposure to syngas. Woo et al. [49] investigated MoS2 promoted with different potassium salts and mapped out the coverage of the alkali promoter before and after reaction using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These authors [49] found that prior to the exposure to syngas, the potassium promoter was poorly distributed. After exposure to syngas potassium in the form of some salts like K2CO3 and KOH had spread across the catalyst surface. K2CO3 and KOH were also the salts that were found to promote alcohol formation, and when these salts were used as promoters the alcohol selectivity gradually increased with time on stream [49]. This behavior is also seen with the present K2CO3 promoted catalyst. Some salts like KCl and K2SO4 do reportedly not promote alcohol formation, and potassium present in the form of these salts do not show this spreading across the surface [47,49]. Furthermore catalysts promoted with KCl or K2SO4 do not undergo these marked changes in conversion and alcohol selectivity with time on stream that are observed with salts that promote alcohol formation (e.g.K2CO3) [47,49]. The salts, which promote alcohol formation, are thus the salts that lead to a spreading of potassium across the catalyst surface and the salts that lead to marked, gradual changes in conversion and selectivity with time on stream. On this basis one might hypothesize that the changes in conversion and selectivity at least in part are due to the spreading of the alkali promoter. It should be mentioned that all of these studies [47–49] used catalysts prepared from sulfide precursors, while oxide precursors have been used in the present work. The importance of this difference is unknown, since it is not clear, to what extent the abovementioned redistribution of the alkali promoter occurs during the sulfidation of the catalyst. An additional factor that might play a role in the observed developments in catalytic properties is a gradual loss of sulfur. As it will be shown subsequently, the catalyst appears to be loosing sulfur, and this decrease in sulfur content could also affect the catalytic properties. A question here is whether this loss of sulfur is accompanied by a complete or partial phase change. The possible developments in the structure of the active phase are discussed in more detail in Section 3.5. A final parameter, which may contribute to the developments observed in Figs. 3 and 4, is that very active hydrocarbon forming sites gradually might be blocked by carbonaceous deposits. This could also lead to a gradual reduction in hydrocarbon formation with time on stream. The development in catalyst carbon content is also discussed in Section 3.5. It seems quite certain that the initial development in catalytic activity with time on stream is due to changes in the structure of the catalyst and not just due to the surface reactions approaching steady state. In the present experiments it is observed that, if at steady state the syngas flow is replaced by a nitrogen flow for several hours, and the syngas then is reintroduced, the catalyst returns to steady state within approximately an hour. Judging from this observation the stabilization of the surface reactions appears to be relatively fast in comparison to the developments observed in Figs. 3 and 4. A comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 shows that the presence of H2S in the feed to some extent shifts the selectivity from alcohols to hydrocarbons. Without co-fed H2S the alcohol selectivity is 90mol%, while addition of 218ppmv H2S to the syngas feed lowers the selectivity to 65mol%. The production of alcohols is only moderately affected by the presence of H2S, and the selectivity change in the presence of H2S therefore mainly reflects an increased production of hydrocarbons. The stabilized CO conversion does rise from 3mol% without co-fed H2S to 5mol%, when 218ppmv H2S is added to the syngas feed. This effect of H2S is not without precedence. Previous studies of dedicated hydrocarbon synthesis over sulfide catalysts have shown that H2S exerts a positive influence on the hydrocarbon production [50,51]. In the present investigations methane is the dominant hydrocarbon produced, and CH4 typically constitutes more than 70wt% of the characterized C1–C3 hydrocarbons. The alcohol selectivity of 90mol% in the absence of H2S is a fairly good result. However one should remember the limited CO conversion. In a recent system study Phillips [52] assumed alcohol synthesis with 90mol% selectivity at 60mol% CO conversion and found that with these operating characteristics the delivered, moist biomass could be converted into higher alcohols with an energy efficiency of 55%. Unfortunately an increase in conversion is connected to a decrease in selectivity [25], and the catalysts used in these investigations still have some way to go before achieving the operating characteristics assumed by Phillips [52]. Indeed one of the main challenges with regard to the alcohols synthesis is to raise the alcohol selectivity of the available catalysts. The effects of co-fed H2S are however not entirely negative. An important positive effect of co-fed H2S is that it promotes chain growth and stabilizes a high ratio of longer alcohols relative to methanol in the alcohol product. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 , which shows the weight ratio between higher alcohols and methanol in the alcohol product as a function of time on stream with different H2S levels in the feed. Fig. 5 shows that with H2S levels at or above 103ppmv the alcohol distribution stabilizes relatively fast, but with H2S concentrations at or below 57ppmv the weight fraction of higher alcohols decreases over time. The decrease in the fraction of higher alcohols with time on stream in a sulfur-free syngas is the result of an initial decrease in the production of the higher alcohols and a gradually increasing production of methanol. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 , which shows the space-time yields of the four characterized alcohols as functions of the time on stream in a sulfur-free syngas. Fig. 6 shows that the space-time yields of the higher alcohols initially decline, but after 13h at reaction conditions the production of higher alcohols has essentially stabilized. Fig. 6 also shows the interesting behavior of the methanol production. The methanol STY seems to have stabilized after 13h on stream, but then the methanol production starts to increase, and this increase continues, until the methanol STY after 30–35h on stream once again appears to be stabilizing. Fig. 3 shows that this second stabilization of the methanol production coincides with the approximate stabilization of the alcohol selectivity, which also seems to reach a steady state after around 30h on stream. It cannot be excluded that the observed behavior of the methanol production is due to changes in the active phase of the catalyst that start to take effect after around 13h on stream. Operation with 57ppmv H2S in the feed results in a behavior that is similar to the one described for sulfur-free operation, and it might be added that the H2S conversion in this case is in the range of 90–100%. As previously mentioned it is very difficult to discern the signal from the noise level, when the sulfur concentration falls below 15–20ppmv. Fig. 7 shows the space-time yields of the individual alcohols as functions of time on stream with 218ppmv H2S in the syngas feed. A comparison of Figs. 6 and 7 clearly show that the space-time yields of C2+ alcohols are significantly higher with 218ppmv of hydrogen sulfide in the feed. Additionally the data presented in Fig. 7 indicate a slight, gradual deactivation of the catalyst in the presence of H2S, but after around 15–20h on stream the tendency does become relatively weak. This trend is also observed with 103ppmv H2S in the feed. In general the presented results show that the presence of hydrogen sulfide shifts the selectivity towards hydrocarbons, but H2S also promotes chain growth. It has previously been reported that the cobalt promoted alcohol synthesis catalysts are unaffected by sulfur at levels up to around 100ppmv [12,20,26,53,54], and this is fairly consistent with our observations. Fig. 5 shows that the development in product distribution with time on stream can be divided into two distinct types of behavior depending upon the sulfur concentration. Our results show that with the presently used conditions the catalyst is only weakly affected by H2S concentrations in the range of 0–57ppmv, but in the region between 57 and 103ppmv H2S there is a remarkable shift in the influence of hydrogen sulfide (see Fig. 5). At levels above 103ppmv H2S serves to stabilize a significantly increased production of higher alcohols, whereas methanol is the dominant product at lower sulfur levels. The difference between 57 and 103ppmv H2S might be, whether or not the H2S level is sufficient to sustain the sulfide phase. The issue of a possible change in the active phase is discussed in more detail in Section 3.5. It is difficult to estimate the exact sulfur level, which is required to stabilize the catalyst. At experimental conditions of Fig. 4 with 218ppmv H2S in the feed the conversion of H2S fluctuates around 31(±7)mol%. This would correspond to full H2S conversion, if the H2S level had been 69ppmv, so this might be a reasonable estimate of the required sulfur level at the present conditions. As the products of the sulfur conversion are not determined this estimate should of course be regarded with some caution, but 69ppmv is between the observed limits of 57 and 103ppmv. In the treatment above the alcohol selectivity is expressed on a CO2-free basis, while the reported CO conversion levels include CO that is converted into CO2. Carbon dioxide is produced from the water formed in the alcohol/hydrocarbon synthesis (R1/R2) through the water gas shift reaction (R3). (R1) n CO + 2 n H 2 ⇌ C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( n − 1 ) H 2 O (R2) n CO + ( 2 n + 1 ) H 2 ⇌ C n H 2 n + 2 + n H 2 O (R3) H 2 O + CO ⇌ H 2 + C O 2 One could argue that this presentation of conversion and selectivity is somewhat misleading, but it is the presentation typically used, as the alcohol synthesis catalysts generally have a high water gas shift activity, which makes CO2 an inevitable reaction product. This is also the case for MoS2 based systems. Previous investigations [26] with K/MoS2/C catalysts have indicated that the water gas shift reaction is close to equilibrium at typical alcohol synthesis conditions. With an equilibrium constant for reaction (R3) of K eq =39 at 300°C the water gas shift equilibrium strongly favors CO2 over H2O [12], and in fact CO2 constitutes a significant part of the CO consumed in the reaction. In the experiment presented in Figs. 3 and 6 the CO conversion stabilizes at 3mol%, but the overall carbon based selectivity to CO2 is 35mol%. In the experiment presented in Figs. 4 and 7 with 218ppmv H2S in the syngas the CO conversion stabilizes at around 5mol%, but in this case the overall CO2-selectivity is 40mol%. The higher CO2-selectivity in the experiment with H2S in the syngas is both due to a larger hydrocarbon formation and a larger formation of higher alcohols (pure hydrocarbon formation with full shift of product water would yield 50mol% CO2-selectivity on a carbon basis). The downside of the large CO2-selectivity is of course that the shift reaction consumes carbon monoxide that could otherwise have been used in alcohol formation. The positive aspect of the large CO2-formation is that the water content of the alcohol product is reduced, which is an aid in a water removal stage downstream of the synthesis reactor. In essentially all the performed experiments the CO2-formation is observed to be slightly higher than what would be expected from a full shift of the water formed in the synthesis reactions. This could be related to experimental uncertainty, but it could also be due to CO2 formed in connection with carbon deposition on or carburization of the sulfide catalyst. As previously mentioned these issues will be treated in greater detail subsequently."
4,Kinetic studies,"3.2 Kinetic studies The second part of this investigation deals with the reaction kinetics. The objective of the present analysis is to formulate a series of empirical rate expressions (Eq. (4)) that describe the production of the characterized alcohols and hydrocarbons. In doing so we assume that the production of alcohols and hydrocarbons can be described as parallel reactions, despite the presumably successive nature of the chain growth (which is illustrated in Fig. 1) and the potential conversion of already formed alcohols. The kinetic investigations are performed using the catalyst KCoMo-2 (see Table 1). (4) R i = A i exp − E a, i app R T p H 2 a i p CO b i p H 2 S c i In Eq. (4) R i is the production rate of component i, p j denotes the partial pressure of reactant j, while a i , b i and c i are the apparent reaction orders in H2, CO and H2S respectively. A i denotes a pre-exponential factor, and E a , i app is the apparent activation energy. In the present work the reaction order in H2S is only investigated for H2S concentrations at or above 260ppmv. Eq. (4) will of course be invalid for p H 2 S = 0 , but judging from the results in the preceding section the validity of the model will already become questionable for H2S concentrations below 100ppmv, where we have observed a marked shift in the effect of H2S. The model parameters are determined through systematic variations in temperature and partial pressures. Although the partial pressures of the reactants change through the reactor they never differ by more than 12% from the average reactant pressures. For this reason the reactor is assumed to behave as a differential reactor with a constant reactant pressure corresponding to the average between the inlet and the outlet. Although the reaction occurs at elevated pressure, the model uses partial pressures and not fugacities. This is justified through an evaluation of the compressibility factor and of the individual fugacity coefficients by means of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state [55,56]. The determination shows that the compressibility factor and all the individual fugacity coefficients are within 5% of unity in all the performed experiments, and on this basis the gas phase is regarded as being approximately ideal. The calculation of the compressibility factor is based upon a random mixing approximation with all binary interaction parameters assumed to be 0 [57]. The SRK equation of state is used, since it has previously been shown to provide the best description of the methanol synthesis, which occurs at similar conditions [58]. In this calculation the H2O content in the gas is estimated through an assumption of equilibrium for the water gas shift reaction. As stated above the catalyst was operated with 260ppmv H2S in the feed, and no noticeable changes in catalyst behavior were observed during the kinetic investigations, but the reader should remember that a very weak gradual deactivation was observed for the similar catalyst KCoMo-1 (see Fig. 7), when it was operated with similar concentrations of H2S in the feed. The first parameter investigated is the temperature, and Fig. 8 shows an Arrhenius plot for the formation rates of alcohols over the catalyst KCoMo-2. The apparent activation energies for alcohol formation are derived from this plot. Also the influence of the partial pressures of H2, CO and H2S has been investigated. Figs. 9–11 show doubly logarithmic depictions of the alcohol production rates against the partial pressures of H2, CO and H2S respectively. The reaction orders are inferred from the slopes in these Figures. Table 2 summarizes the kinetic parameters for the formation of the individual alcohols over the catalyst. The kinetic parameters for the reactions forming hydrocarbons have been obtained in the same way as the parameters for alcohol formation. Table 3 summarizes these kinetic parameters for the formation of the characterized hydrocarbons over the catalyst. To extend the usefulness of the experimental model all reaction orders have been provided with at least two decimals, and more when this is warranted by the statistical significance. Tables 2 and 3 reveal that the reaction orders in H2 generally are quite high, while the CO reaction orders on the other hand are fairly low. This indicates a relatively large surface coverage of CO and low hydrogen coverage at the reaction conditions. The reaction orders for alcohols are generally larger than the ones for hydrocarbons, and this agrees well with previous investigations, which show that increasing pressure enhances the selectivity to alcohols [59]. For both alcohols and hydrocarbons the reaction orders in hydrogen are observed to decrease with increasing chain length, while the CO reaction orders follow the opposite tendency. These tendencies might be explained in terms of the reaction mechanism. Fig. 1 shows the presumed reaction mechanism, where adsorbed CO is inserted into an adsorbed alkyl group to form an acyl species. The formed acyl species can then be hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohol or all the way to a new alkyl group. Alternatively the alkyl species can be hydrogenated to the corresponding hydrocarbon. When moving upwards in chain length the risk of chain termination, which increases with increasing hydrogenation activity, becomes progressively more important. This can explain the generally positive albeit decreasing reaction order in hydrogen with increasing chain length, since the higher species are more affected by an increased chance of termination. Correspondingly the increasing need for additional CO insertion steps is responsible for the increase in CO reaction order with increasing chain length. The H2S reaction orders in Tables 2 and 3 show that hydrogen sulfide enhances hydrocarbon formation and generally promotes chain growth. In Section 3.1 it is described that the formation of higher alcohols is significantly increased, when going from low levels of H2S (0–57ppmv) to higher H2S levels (103–218ppmv). The data in Table 2 do however show that both ethanol and propanol have small, negative reaction orders in H2S. This must be ascribed to the fact that the kinetic investigations summarized in Table 2 have been performed with relatively high (≥260ppmv) concentrations of H2S, where the influence of hydrogen sulfide apparently differs from the effect at low H2S levels. It should be noticed that hydrocarbons generally show higher activation energies than alcohols, which implies that increasing temperature favors hydrocarbon formation. It is also worth noticing that in the investigated temperature range the activation energies increase with increasing chain length. This is an uncommon behavior for such chain growth reactions, where increasing temperature typically favors methane formation [50,60]. An important reason for this beneficial effect of the temperature upon the chain growth is presumably that, as the catalyst becomes more active at higher temperature, there is an increased chance of conversion of already formed alcohols into higher species. It was mentioned in the introduction that this can occur. It is presumably the high CO surface coverage in the investigated temperature range, which ensures that the dominant effect of increasing temperature is an increase in the rate of the CO insertion step that yields chain growth (R4). (R4) RC H 2 * + CO * ⇌ RC H 2 CO * + * It is interesting to compare the kinetic parameters obtained in the present investigation to values reported in the literature, however such investigations of alcohol formation are rather scarce, and the comparison is limited to the activation energies for the three simplest alcohols, which are shown in Table 4 . The results in Table 4 show that there is a general agreement concerning the increase in activation energy with increasing chain length, however the reported activation energies show a great deal of scattering. With respect to kinetics the most well studied syngas reaction over sulfide catalysts appears to be methane formation, and Table 5 summarizes a series of kinetic parameters reported for this reaction over various MoS2 based catalysts. Perhaps the most striking feature of the kinetic data summarized in Tables 4 and 5 is the absence of any significant agreement between the various kinetic studies. However the reaction kinetics is affected by the composition and structure of the active phase as well as by the catalyst support and the reaction conditions. Furthermore the very nature of the active phase could as discussed in the preceding section depend upon the process conditions. For this reason it is perhaps not unexpected that the reported kinetic parameters show a great deal of scattering. When looking at methane formation, the data in Table 5 generally indicate that the CO coverage is increased (the CO reaction order decreases) by increasing pressure and by alkali promotion. It also appears that the conditions, which lower the reaction order in CO, simultaneously results in an increased activation energy and a decreasing H2S reaction order for methane formation. Apart from a comparison of the reaction kinetics it is also valuable to evaluate the operating characteristics of the presently used K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalysts in relation to other alcohol synthesis catalysts reported in the literature. Table 6 contains a comparison of various alcohol synthesis catalysts including non-sulfide catalysts. The results in Table 6 illustrate various important aspects of the alcohol synthesis. Most importantly the table illustrates that it is a tremendous challenge to achieve both high alcohol selectivity and a high fraction of higher alcohols in the product. In terms of alcohol selectivity the system, which currently looks most promising, must be the modified methanol synthesis catalysts based upon Alkali/Cu/ZnO or Alkali/ZnO/Cr2O3. Among the molybdenum based systems the cobalt promoted sulfide looks like the best choice with respect to selectivity. Table 6 shows that the alcohol productivity of the reported catalysts most commonly is found in the 0.1–0.3g/g cat./h range. The table also shows that high productivities commonly are associated with a large fraction of methanol in the product. As it is reflected by the very large C2+OH/C1OH-ratios shown in Table 6 rhodium based catalysts are able to produce a large fraction of higher oxygenates – particularly a large fraction of ethanol and other C2-oxygenates [72,73]. However even at low conversion levels the Rh-based catalysts in Table 6 show a modest alcohol selectivity. When comparing the entries in Table 6 it is clear that some of the catalyst samples used in the present study have a relatively low activity in the relevant temperature range, however this must largely be ascribed to the low metal contents of at least the samples KCoMo-1 and KCoMo-2. In fact most of the catalysts presented in Table 6 are unsupported systems that consist purely of the active phase. However Table 6 also shows that the catalyst KCoMo-3, which has significantly larger molybdenum content than KCoMo-1, is considerably more active. The results in Table 6 show that KCoMo-3 at comparable conditions is more than twice as active as KCoMo-1 in a sulfur-free syngas. The influence of the metal loading is discussed in more detail in the subsequent section."
5,Effect of the metal content,"3.3 Effect of the metal content As it is mentioned above, the catalyst used for the kinetic investigations (KCoMo-2) has a fairly low content of the active materials (see Table 1), and for a potential industrial application it might be desirable to raise the space-time yield to lower the amount of catalyst needed. It should however be mentioned that in the aforementioned system the study by Phillips [52] the economic analysis of the process was quite insensitive to the space-time yield of the catalyst. An obvious way to improve the space-time yield would be to increase the metal content of the catalyst, and for this reasons we have briefly investigated the effect of an increased metal content in the catalyst formulation. This investigation is conducted using the catalyst KCoMo-3 (see Table 1). We have performed a temperature sweep with the catalyst, and the results are presented in Fig. 12 , which shows the CO conversion and the alcohol selectivity as functions of the temperature. Fig. 12 shows that while the conversion increases with increasing temperature the selectivity follows the opposite tendency, since hydrocarbon selectivity is increased by increasing temperature. As Fig. 12 shows the CO2-free alcohol selectivity it might be added that the overall, carbon based CO2-selectivity increases with increasing temperature from 17mol% at 276°C to 43mol% at 374°C. The increase in CO2-selectivity is probably due to the increased hydrocarbon formation at higher temperature. Furthermore the water gas shift reaction may not cause as rapid a CO2-formation at the lower temperatures. The conditions at the data point at 326°C in Fig. 12 correspond to the conditions of the experiment presented in Fig. 4. These conditions can thus be utilized to compare the two catalysts KCoMo-1 and KCoMo-3 to assess the influence of the metal content. Such a comparison is presented in Table 7 . The data in Table 7 illustrate that in the investigated conversion range the catalyst with the higher Mo loading shows an STY and a CO conversion that are increased by a factor of 1.9 compared to the catalyst with lower metal content. As it was described in Section 3.2, the results in Table 6 show that the difference in activity between the two catalysts is slightly larger, when an H2S-free feed is used. When looking at Table 7 it can be seen that there are small differences in alcohol selectivity and product distribution. These variations could be the result of both the subtle dissimilarities in catalyst composition and the result of the different conversion levels. With the small change in selectivity and the larger variation in conversion it is somewhat difficult to make definite conclusions about the influence of metal loading upon the alcohol selectivity. Table 7 also shows that the more active catalyst with the higher metal loading converts more H2S than the catalyst with the lower metal content. Something that also should be noted is that the general increase in activity is less than the increase in metal loading. In the patent literature [20,74] it is typically recommended to use a catalyst with a high content of the active materials – preferably in the 50–70wt% range, and on both carbon [75] and alumina [76] supports it has generally been observed that the selectivity as well as the activity increases with increasing metal loading. This reported increase in selectivity with increasing metal loading is most likely related to changes in the morphology of the active phase. Under the assumption that the sulfide does constitute the active phase, the relationship between metal loading and selectivity could potentially be rationalized on the basis of the fundamental knowledge of this system. Molybdenum sulfide has a layered structure, where a single MoS2 slab is composed of a layer of molybdenum between two layers of sulfur [77]. While molybdenum sulfide has been the subject of substantial research due to its use as a catalyst for the important hydrotreating reactions in the oil industry [78], much less research has been done on the catalyst with respect to syngas reactions. In highly active hydrotreating catalysts the sulfide is mainly present as single SMoS slabs lying flat on the support surface [79]. The hydrogenation activity of the MoS2 slab is believed to be related to the brim along the top edge of the sulfide slab [80,81]. If the slabs grow larger, or the stacking of the slabs increases, which would be the expected results of an increased metal loading, the relative amount of hydrogenation sites at the brim should decrease. In relation to the alcohol synthesis a decreased hydrogenation activity would be expected to result in a reduced hydrocarbon formation, and it might thus not be unreasonable to expect an increased alcohol selectivity, when the metal loading is increased. The previous studies of the effect of the metal content [75,76] have however used catalysts with significantly higher metal loadings and lower surface areas of the support, than it is the case in the present study. In our studies we only have a relatively modest increase in metal content and a support with a rather high surface area (see Table 1). For this reason we are not likely to see a severe change in sulfide particle morphology between KCoMo-1 and KCoMo-3, and this could well be an important part of the explanation for the observed shift in activity with only a minor change in selectivity. The data depicted in Fig. 12 can also be used to illustrate another important point about the alcohol synthesis, namely that a close relationship exists between conversion and selectivity. This is illustrated in Fig. 13 , which shows the selectivity as a function of the conversion, and this figure shows an approximately linear decrease in selectivity with increasing conversion. A linear decrease in selectivity with increasing conversion has previously been reported by Quarderer [25]. However the shape of the S Alc-X CO-curve must be expected to reflect the method by which the conversion is manipulated. An increased conversion through an increased residence time at a relatively low constant temperature must be expected to have a less detrimental effect upon the selectivity compared to the present increase in conversion through an increased reaction temperature. It seems quite reasonable that the selectivity is lowered, when the conversion is increased. In the preceding text the possible conversion of already formed alcohols has been mentioned several times, and since there is a noteworthy risk of chain termination to a hydrocarbon, the selectivity should of course suffer from an increased conversion of the already formed alcohols."
6,Incorporation of sulfur into the liquid product,"3.4 Incorporation of sulfur into the liquid product The last part of this investigation concerns the incorporation of sulfur species into the condensed reaction product. The objective here is to quantify the amount of sulfur that is present in the alcohol product and to ascertain the nature of this sulfur. The experiments related to this examination are conducted using the catalyst KCoMo-1 (see Table 1). Fig. 14 shows the weight fraction of sulfur in the collected alcohol product as a function of the H2S concentration in the syngas feed. Prior to the first condensation the catalyst has been on stream for 14.5h in a syngas-containing 460ppmv H2S, and an evaluation of the effluent gas from the reactor has indicated that the catalytic properties have stabilized. Subsequent condensation experiments have been conducted with the same catalyst and have all been initiated after at least 7h with the respective H2S levels in the feed. For the lowest H2S concentration in Fig. 14, namely 46ppmv, one must in light of the results in Fig. 5 expect that the distribution of the alcohol product changes over time. The main objective in these investigations is however to evaluate the product sulfur content, and less significance is in this investigation ascribed to the distribution of the alcohol product. Fig. 14 shows that the sulfur content in the liquid product increases linearly with an increasing H2S level in the feed. The results in Fig. 14 clearly show that sulfur species are incorporated into the liquid product. In all the experiments the sulfur content in the liquid product can even be seen to be well above the US and EU limits for sulfur in automotive fuels that were mentioned in the introduction. It should be mentioned that if all the H2S, which is observed to be converted in the experiments in Fig. 14, had been incorporated into the liquid product, the sulfur content of the product would have been roughly 10 times higher, than it is the case. Part of the hydrogen sulfide is therefore clearly converted into gaseous sulfur species, but these species are not determined in the present investigations. The incorporation of sulfur species into the liquid product also continues after H2S is removed from the feed stream, but in this case the product sulfur content decreases over time. This is illustrated in Fig. 15 , which shows the sulfur content in the liquid reaction product as a function of the catalyst age in a sulfur-free syngas. Fig. 15 shows that during the experiment, there is a linearly decreasing relationship between the sulfur content in the alcohol product and the catalyst age in a sulfur-free syngas. This must imply that the catalyst itself gradually is losing sulfur in the syngas atmosphere, and that the sulfur, which is lost, becomes incorporated into the condensed reaction product. From Fig. 15 it can be seen that even if the decreasing linear tendency continues all the way to zero sulfur content in the product, it will take a substantial period of time, before the sulfur content is below the 10ppmw EU limit for sulfur in gasoline. The above results indicate that at least if H2S is present in the syngas feed, it will be necessary to perform a cleaning operation to remove sulfur from the final product. To assess the complications associated with such a cleaning operation we have performed a qualitative GC-AED analysis of the sulfur compounds present in the condensed alcohol product. This analysis indicates that thiols are the dominant sulfur species. Interestingly; there are essentially no traces of dissolved H2S or COS in the product, although it cannot be fully excluded that these dissolved gases had been present, but had evaporated before the analysis of the sulfur species. However analysis of the effluent gas from the reactor before and during the condensation indicated that little or no H2S was captured in the condensation. Fig. 14 shows that when the catalyst is operated with H2S in the feed, there is a substantial amount of sulfur in the condensed product, and the analysis of the nature of the sulfur species also reveals that a multitude of sulfur compounds are present in the alcohol product. Apart from thiols the analysis also indicates the presence of dimethyl sulfide and even traces of various thiophenes. When H2S is removed from the feed, the number of sulfur-containing compounds in the liquid product decreases over time. For the liquid product condensed after 35h of operation with a sulfur-free syngas the GC-AED analysis only shows the presence of ethanethiol, 1-propanethiol and 2-methyl-1-propanethiol. The fact that the catalyst forms thiols is not entirely unexpected. Chen et al. [82] have previously employed Alkali/Co/MoS2 catalysts to synthesize methanethiol from H2S-containing syngas, and in their case COS and CH3SH were the dominant reaction products. However it must be added that these authors used a feed, where H2S was the main constituent. The incorporation of sulfur species into the alcohol product is certainly a clear disadvantage for the sulfide catalyst. If the catalyst is used with a sulfur-free syngas the problem of sulfur compounds incorporated into the product should of course disappear, when all sulfur or at least all detachable sulfur has been removed from the catalyst. If the catalyst on the other hand is operated with a sulfur-containing feed, it seems certain that measures would have to be taken to remove the thiols and other sulfur species from the product in order to ensure that the alcohol product is usable."
7,Effect of H2S upon the nature of the active phase,"3.5 Effect of H2S upon the nature of the active phase The preceding text has illustrated several effects of H2S upon the alcohol synthesis catalyst, and the purpose of the following two sections is to provide a general discussion of the results. In short the presence of hydrogen sulfide favors chain growth for both alcohols and hydrocarbons, but H2S lowers the alcohol selectivity by enhancing the hydrocarbon production. Furthermore there is a significant shift in the effect of hydrogen sulfide, which at the presently used conditions occurs at an H2S level between 57 and 103ppmv (see Fig. 5). Above this concentration range the product distribution stabilizes relatively fast, and the higher alcohols are the dominant reaction products. Below 57ppmv of H2S the effect of hydrogen sulfide appears to be quite limited, methanol is the dominant reaction product, and the development of a stabilized product distribution is much slower. In a discussion of the effects of H2S it is a clear complication that the active phase of the stabilized catalyst is not unambiguously determined. The present results indicate that the catalyst is losing sulfur in the syngas atmosphere. On the basis of the available information it is however difficult to say, whether the observed loss of sulfur from the sulfide is accompanied by a complete or partial phase change into what could be a carbide. This discussion should be especially relevant, when an H2S-free syngas is used. Højlund Nielsen et al. [50] studied the conversion of syngas to hydrocarbons over a Co/MoS2/TiO2 catalyst, and these authors [50] speculated that a carbide might constitute the stabilized phase of the catalyst. Saito and Anderson [83] studied CO methanation over MoS2 in a sulfur-free syngas, and these authors observed a slowly increasing catalyst carbon content with time on stream, but they also reported that the sulfur content was quite constant. One could envision a partial carburization that is limited to the formation of an MoS x C y -like phase at the exterior surface of the sulfide cluster, while the interior of the cluster remains sulfided. Such a structure has in fact also been proposed for catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization processes [84,85]. Although there is insufficient evidence to clarify the issue of a possible phase change, it can not be excluded that the initial development in activity and selectivity, which we observe in the first hours on stream (see Figs. 3 and 4), to some extent could be related to a change in the active phase of the catalyst. Alkali promoted molybdenum carbides have been reported to possess activity for alcohol formation [65,66,86], and at least a partial carburization of the sulfide catalyst is certainly a possibility in the present experiments. As previously mentioned it could be speculated that the strong shift in the effect of H2S, which we observe between H2S levels of 57 and 103ppmv (see Fig. 5) is related to, whether the concentration is sufficient to uphold the sulfide as the active phase. To obtain a further understanding of the changes that the sulfide catalyst undergoes, it seems prudent to compare the presently used catalyst to molybdenum carbide catalysts described in the literature. When alkali promoted molybdenum carbide is used as an alcohol synthesis catalyst, the alcohol selectivity is commonly reported to be lower than for catalysts based on molybdenum sulfide, as the carbide generally causes a larger hydrocarbon formation (see the examples in Table 6) [87]. In the first hours on stream the alcohol selectivity obtained with MoS2-based catalysts gradually increases (see Fig. 3). The development in selectivity does therefore not seem to indicate a carburization of the catalyst, but as previously mentioned this gradual increase in selectivity could also be due to other factors such as spreading of the alkali promoter or blocking of hydrocarbon forming sites by carbonaceous deposits. An indication of a partial carburization of the catalyst does however come from the distribution of the alcohol product. We have compared the product distribution obtained with the presently used K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst to results obtained by Woo et al. [87], with K2CO3/β-Mo2C catalysts. Although the carbide catalysts employed by Woo et al. [87] do not contain cobalt it is a large advantage that these carbide catalysts yield conversion levels similar to the ones obtained in the present investigations. For a chain growth reaction such as the alcohol synthesis the product distribution will be a function of the conversion level [25], as already formed alcohols may readsorb and extend their carbon chains. It therefore seems appropriate to compare product distributions obtained at similar conversion levels although the operating conditions and catalyst compositions are somewhat different. Fig. 16 shows the detailed distribution of the alcohol product obtained with the presently used K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst (KCoMo-1). Also shown in the figure is the product distribution obtained by Woo et al. [87], with a K2CO3/β-Mo2C catalyst operated with and without sulfur in the syngas feed. Interestingly; Fig. 16 shows how the product distribution obtained with a CoMo sulfide catalyst operated in a sulfur-free syngas is very similar to the distribution obtained with a molybdenum carbide catalyst operated in a sulfur-containing syngas. The carbide operated in a sulfur-free atmosphere yields a product distribution that is further away from the distribution obtained with the sulfide catalyst, but there are also larger differences in the CO conversion. These results could suggest that when an MoS2 based catalyst is operated in a sulfur-free syngas, the stabilized phase of the catalyst is a combined phase containing both carbon and sulfur, and a similar phase is formed, when an Mo2C based catalyst is operated in a sulfur-containing atmosphere. It must however be emphasized that while the conversion levels are similar for the different results in Fig. 16 there are differences in catalyst compositions and operating conditions. Additionally Fig. 16 also illustrates how the addition of H2S to the syngas passed over the MoS2 catalyst shifts the product distribution towards the higher alcohols. At both high and low H2S levels we observe the same general development in the first hours on stream, where the conversion gradually decreases, and the alcohol selectivity gradually increases (see Figs. 3 and 4). In Section 3.1 it has been mentioned that a spreading of the alkali promoter might be part of the cause of this development. Based upon the gradually increasing carbon level observed by Saito and Anderson [83] one might as previously mentioned also speculate that a gradual blocking of the catalyst by carbonaceous deposits could contribute to the development in activity and selectivity, which we observe in the first hours on stream."
8,Effect of H2S at higher concentrations,"3.6 Effect of H2S at higher concentrations The results in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate that even at H2S levels, where the product distribution is stabilized, the concentration of hydrogen sulfide has an influence upon the reaction kinetics. Under the assumption that the H2S level in this case is sufficient to sustain the sulfide, these effects might be rationalized in terms of the properties of the sulfide. EXAFS investigations of MoS and MoMo bond lengths show that the sulfide in supported MoS2 and Co/MoS2 catalysts exists as a phase that resembles well-crystallized, bulk MoS2 [88,89], and similar results from investigations of supported K/MoS2 alcohol synthesis catalysts indicate that this is also the case for the alkali promoted system [27,90,91]. It has previously been mentioned that the structure of MoS2 is like a sandwich with a layer of Mo atoms between two layers of sulfur atoms. MoS2 can potentially be terminated by two low Miller-index planes, namely the Mo ( 10 1 ¯ 0 ) edge and the S ( 1 ¯ 010 ) edge [77,92]. These edges are commonly described as the Mo edge and the S edge respectively due to the element nominally exposed at the respective edges. However both edges might, depending upon the chemical potential of sulfur and the reductive potential of the gas, be covered with sulfur [92–94]. Investigations of pure MoS2 without the alkali promoter have indicated that hydrogen is adsorbed as SH groups [95,96], and that these SH groups are located on the outermost sulfur atoms along the edges of the sulfide [92,93,97]. In a reducing gas these outermost sulfur atoms can be removed to the gas phase, whereby sulfur vacancies are formed at the edge of the sulfide [98]. Such vacancy formation is believed to play an important role in hydrodesulfurization reactions, and vacancy formation has been illustrated by STM investigations, where molecular hydrogen has been dosed to sulfide clusters [99]. If the outermost sulfur atoms constitute the hydrogen adsorption sites, then their disappearance would also mean a loss of hydrogenation activity. The role of H2S in the syngas could therefore be to replenish the hydrogen adsorption sites. This notion that H2S serves to form hydrogen adsorption sites is supported by the results of Hou and Wise [51], who found that the hydrogen chemisorption capacity of MoS2 increased with the H2S/H2 ratio in the preceding treatment of the catalyst. The formation of an increased number of hydrogen adsorption sites and the enhanced hydrogenation activity, which should ensue, could explain the increased hydrocarbon formation, when H2S is added to the syngas feed. Moses et al. [98] used density functional theory to calculate the relative amount of vacancies along the S edge at various partial pressures of H2 and H2S, and judging from these results the amount of vacancies should, with the presently used amounts of H2S in the syngas, be quite significant. A loss of sulfur and a corresponding loss of hydrogenation activity could even in the absence of a phase change be contributing to the developments in activity and selectivity, when the catalyst is first exposed to syngas. If the catalyst is gradually losing hydrogen adsorption sites, the result should be gradually increasing alcohol selectivity, since the hydrogenation activity, and with it the hydrocarbon formation, decreases. This is the tendency observed in Fig. 4, which shows the developments in selectivity and conversion with time on stream in a syngas with a relatively high H2S level of 218ppmv. The idea that the presence of hydrogen sulfide influences the number of SH hydrogen adsorption sites can potentially explain the enhanced hydrocarbon formation in the presence of H2S, but some hydrogenation activity arising from the presence of MoH groups can not be completely excluded. Such groups have reportedly [100] never been observed experimentally, although some computational studies have indicated their existence [100–102]. On the other hand it is quite likely that the formation of vacancies apart from a loss of hydrogenation sites simultaneously serves to provide new CO adsorption sites. Using infrared spectroscopy Travert et al. [103] observed that the intensity of bands related to CO adsorbed on MoS2 decreased with increasing exposure of the catalyst to H2S, while the band intensity increased with H2 treatment. This result could suggest that the amount of CO adsorption sites is related to the number of vacancies, which would be increased by reducing treatment and decreased through blocking with sulfur derived from for example H2S. It should be emphasized that the study of Travert et al. [103] deals with a sulfide without the alkali promoter, and the alkali promoter might also affect the CO adsorption. However if H2S serves to lower the amount of adsorbed CO by blocking sulfur vacancies this could certainly also contribute to the lowering of the oxygenate selectivity that is observed in the presence of H2S. The reason for the promotional effect of H2S upon the chain growth is not entirely clear. As described above the concentration of H2S has been observed to influence the number of adsorption sites for hydrogen and CO. In light of these observations it seems quite possible that the H2S level also affects the number of adsorption sites for the reaction products and intermediates and perhaps even the nature of these sites. It could be in such an effect that the beneficial influence of hydrogen sulfide upon the chain growth is to be found."
9,Conclusion,"The preceding text has covered various effects of the process conditions upon the synthesis of higher alcohols over a K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst, and several conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the presented results. Irrespective of the presence of H2S in the syngas feed the pre-sulfided catalyst requires an initiation period, before a steady state is achieved, but the duration of this initiation depends upon the H2S concentration in the feed. With H2S levels from 0 to 57ppmv the fraction of higher alcohols gradually decreases with time on stream. This development seems to wear off after around 30h on stream. With H2S levels at or above 103ppmv the distribution of the alcohol product stabilizes much faster, and the production of higher alcohols is larger. However the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the syngas feed lowers the alcohol selectivity by enhancing the hydrocarbon formation. The reaction kinetics have been investigated in the presence of H2S, and the main conclusion to be drawn from these investigations is that the CO surface coverage appears to be relatively high at alcohol synthesis conditions, while the hydrogen coverage appears to be correspondingly low. An analysis of the condensed alcohol product shows that the presence of sulfur in the syngas feed to a significant extent leads to incorporation of sulfur species into the reaction product. This incorporation of sulfur into the alcohol product even continues for a substantial amount of time after the addition of H2S to the feed has been discontinued. Sulfur concentration in the condensed product is still 340ppmw after 35h of operation with an H2S-free feed. The sulfur in the alcohol product is mainly in the form of thiols. The observed incorporation of sulfur species into the alcohol product indicates that the sulfide catalyst is loosing sulfur in the syngas atmosphere, and it cannot be excluded that this loss of sulfur from the catalyst is associated with a full or partial phase change into what could be a carbide. The highest alcohol productivity reached in the current investigation was 0.276g/g cat./h corresponding to a CO conversion of 18mol% and an alcohol selectivity of 65mol%. This productivity was achieved at the following conditions: 350°C, 100bar, GHSV=5244h−1, Feed: 49.9vol% H2, 50.1vol% CO."
