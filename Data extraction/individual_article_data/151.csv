0,Introduction,"Among renewable fuels, alcohols as ethanol are a viable option as it can be directly incorporated into the existing transport infrastructure in different blends with gasoline. The use of ethanol produced from biomass offers significant greenhouse gas benefits (Niven, 2005). At present, the ethanol production process depends on the use of raw materials containing high levels of fermentable sugars. Crops like sugar cane, beet, wheat and corn are typical feedstock materials. The use of these crops has a number of serious disadvantages: (i) it creates high feedstock prices; (ii) crop production has a high (fossil) energy consumption lowering system efficiency; and (iii) competition with food production for arable soil raising ethical issues related to food scarcity (Granda et al., 2007). The use of a different feedstock as lignocellulosic biomass would offer significant benefits regarding the reduction of feedstock price, system energy efficiency and competition for arable land (Cardona and Sanchez, 2007). The difficulty of using lignocellulosic biomass is that a cost-effective pretreatment step to access the biomass still needs to be developed, therefore lignocellulosic ethanol production is still in pilot phase (Angenent, 2007). Solid organic waste materials are abundantly present in many agricultural areas. The use of these materials for fuel production would be economically very attractive. The production of fuel from waste materials is considered sustainable as the waste is tuned from an environmental burden into a benefit. Waste materials are, however, often unsuitable for ethanol production as their sugar content is low. In this paper we propose alcohol production from organic waste materials through biological reduction of volatile fatty acids derived from fermentative biomass acidification. Acidification of waste materials containing lipids, proteins and carbohydrates is a cheap reliable step known from anaerobic digestion. This step within anaerobic digestion produces an effluent containing volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids together with a gas phase containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). As acidification is a well-known process we focus our study on the biological reduction of the carboxylic group of a VFA to an alcohol. The reduction is driven by hydrogen as single electron donor. Hydrogen is a co-product of the same acidification process of organic material, in which VFAs are produced (Li and Fang, 2007). Lay et al. (1999) were one of the first to yield large amounts of hydrogen from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and to obtain a hydrogen headspace of 60%. For the reduction of 1mol of VFA, 2mol of hydrogen are needed. Considering the fact that hydrogen is a fuel, it may sound contradictorily to use hydrogen for fuel alcohol production. But, ethanol production with hydrogen through VFA reduction recovers a larger share of the energy content of the organic material, compared to hydrogen production only from the same material; 1mol of ethanol has two times higher heating value than 2mol of hydrogen. Another advantage of ethanol over hydrogen, is the high energy density of 23.4GJ/m3 of ethanol compared to compressed hydrogen at 200bar of 1.95GJ/m3. Besides, using VFA and hydrogen instead of fermentable sugars for fuel production, diversifies the type of raw materials for the alcohol production process. In this research we introduce hydrogen as single electron donor and use mixed cultures to reduce the carboxyl group in VFAs, being acetate, propionate and n-butyrate as they are the most common products of acidification process (Dinopoulou et al., 1988). The biological reduction of the carboxylic group of aliphatic and aromatic compounds has been described for several pure cultures for the synthesis of specialty chemicals (Simon et al., 1987; Fraisse and Simon, 1988; Arfmann and Abraham, 1993; Ban et al., 1999; Li and Rosazza, 2000). Our study differs considerably from these studies as we use firstly mixed cultures instead of a pure culture, and secondly hydrogen as electron donor instead of carbon monoxide or formate. Reduction of a VFA by mixed cultures has been mentioned earlier by Smith and McCarty (1989); they observed propionate reduction in a reaction coupled to ethanol oxidation. According to the authors this reaction was mediated by ethanol oxidizing organisms during high rates of ethanol utilization. To our knowledge, present study is the first attempt to produce alcohols from VFAs by mixed cultures with solely hydrogen as electron donor. The objective of this paper was to study and examine whether it is feasible to convert acetate, propionate and butyrate into alcohol by mixed cultures with solely hydrogen as electron donor. The biological reduction of acetate (Eq. (1)), propionate (Eq. (2)) and n-butyrate (Eq. (3)) yields little energy at standard conditions (ΔG r 0 =−9.1, −9.4 and −5.4kJ/mol−1, respectively at p 0 =1atm and pH 7). The value at standard condition is exothermic, but is close to 0kJ compared to glucose fermentation (−225.5kJ). Therefore the concentrations and partial pressure of reactants VFA, hydrogen and protons should be controlled such that a sufficient low actual Gibbs free reaction energy is created. (1) C 2 H 3 O 2 − + H + + 2 H 2 → C 2 H 6 O + H 2 O Δ G r 0 = − 9.1 kJ / mol (2) C 3 H 5 O 2 − + H + + 2 H 2 → C 3 H 8 O + H 2 O Δ G r 0 = − 9.4 kJ / mol (3) C 4 H 7 O 2 − + H + + 2 H 2 → C 4 H 10 O + H 2 O Δ G r 0 = − 5.4 kJ / mol Thermodynamic calculations were first used to determine values for hydrogen pressure and pH to have a sufficient low actual Gibbs free energy to enable VFA reduction. Based on these values the experimental conditions were chosen and applied in the batch test so that VFA reduction would be at least thermodynamically feasible. Alcohol production capacity of the mixed cultures was evaluated on alcohol concentration, rate and reaction efficiency."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Thermodynamic calculations,"2.1 Thermodynamic calculations An exothermic reaction has a reaction Gibbs free energy lower than 0kJ. Schink (1997) and Thauer et al. (1977) reported that organisms are taking part in the metabolized energy to grow or to maintain cell functions. So the minimum energy quantity to have a microbial reaction should be lower than 0kJ. Schink and Thauer et al. discussed a minimal energy quantity in the range of −15 to −20kJ/mol reaction. This last value −20kJ/mol was used as upper limit for the thermodynamical calculations on VFA reduction. Process variables as VFA concentration, hydrogen pressure and pH were calculated at which the biological reaction would still be thermodynamically feasible. The reaction Gibbs free energy change of the reduction of VFA was defined by Eq. (4) (for derivation see the Supporting Information) (4) Δ G r ′ = Δ G r 0 + R T ln [ Alcohol ] [ VFA t ] pH 2 2 + R T ln K a + [ H + ] K a [ H + ] Standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG 0) of components was given by Amend and Shock (2001). During the experiment, reactants are converted and ΔG r′ increases with time until an equilibrium has been reached at posed limit of −20kJ. With Eq. (4), we can calculate a maximum concentration of alcohol that can be produced. Then we assume that reactants are solely converted to alcohol and that the pH remains constant."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup 2.2.1 Inoculum Based on preliminary experiments (data not shown) granular sludge from up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors was selected as inoculum. The anaerobic granular sludge was obtained from an UASB reactors treating wastewater from a distillery (Royal Nedalco, Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, 2004). Granular sludge was washed with medium solution and sieved with a mesh of 500μm. 2.2.2 Batch experiments setup Serum bottles (120ml) were filled with 37.5ml medium having a concentration of 50mM of either acetic, propionic or butyric acid. Medium was prepared according to Phillips et al. (1993), which has a low sulfate content to prevent sulfate reduction. To each bottle 0.5g TS sludge was added. The pH of the liquid was set on 5 with 2M of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid, since thermodynamical calculations pointed out that a low pH value increases the ΔG r′. The bottles were sealed with rubber inlets and capped with aluminum crimp caps. The headspace was replaced five times with pure hydrogen to a final overpressure of 0.5bar, since thermodynamical calculations pointed out that high hydrogen pressure decreases the ΔG r′. Four controls were included in the setup to identify the effect of hydrogen, VFA, sludge or a combination of them on the alcohol production capacity (Table 1 ). The bottles were incubated at 30°C in a rotating shaker (170rpm). Samples of gas and liquid phase were taken with a syringe to determine the composition of both phases. The ratio of gas/liquid volume was corrected for sampling. The pH and pressure were measured at each sampling. The batches were performed in triplicate with exception of the controls of acetate which were done in duplicate."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis Hydrogen, oxygen and methane were measured with an HP 5890A gas chromatograph by injecting 100μl of gas-sample on a molsieve column (30m×0.53mm×0.25μm) with thermal conductivity detection (TCD). The oven temperature was 40°C, the injection gate 110°C and the TCD 150°C. The carrier gas was argon and had a flow rate of 20mlmin−1. Carbon dioxide, methane and oxygen were measured with a Finsons Instruments GC 8340 gas chromatograph. Gas was splitted (1:1) over a molsieve column (30m×0.53mm×25μm) and a porabond Q column (25m×0.53mm×10μm). The oven temperature was 40°C, injection gate 110°C and the TCD 90°C. The carrier gas was helium and had a flow rate of 45mlmin−1. C2–C5 alcohols and C2–C5 VFAs were measured by gas chromatography (HP 5890 series II) with AT™ aquawax-DA glass column (30m×0.32mm×25μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Liquid samples were centrifuged for 5min at 10,000rpm and diluted fivefold with 3% w/w formic acid water solution. Prepared sample (1.0μl) was injected into the injection port at 280°C and was splitted into a ratio of 1:50 with a flow of 60mlmin−1. The oven temperature was 5min on 60°C then to 210°C at 25°Cmin−1 ramp and held for 2min. FID had a temperature of 300°C. The carrier gas was nitrogen and had a flow rate of 2.6mlmin−1. The pH was measured with a pH electrode Sentix 21 with pH range (0–14) stored in a 3M KCl solution. Pressure of headspace of the bottles was measured with the GMH 3150, digital pressure meter from Greisinger electronic (Germany)."
5,Electron equivalents balance,"2.4 Electron equivalents balance An electron balance gives insight into the direction of the electron flow from electron donor towards products. Moreover, the conversion efficiency of reduction can be defined with the electron balance. Following McCarty (1972), the electron balance was expressed in electron equivalents (in mol e) which is based on concentration, carbon atoms and degree of reduction of each individual compound. The degree of reduction indicates the capacity of a compound to reduce other compounds. It is expressed in number of electrons that are involved in the half reaction of the compound with the compounds in the reference oxidation state. These components are HCO3 −, NO3 −, SO4 2−, water and protons, and have by definition a degree of reduction zero. Knowing the degree of reduction, the electron equivalents of a compound were calculated by multiplying the degree of reduction with the concentration and number of carbon atoms of the compound. Electron equivalents in the experiment were initially present in the form of reactants (carboxylic acid and hydrogen) and biomass. At time greater than zero, the total amount of electron equivalents remained equal to the beginning situation, only the division among reactants, products and biomass may have changed (Fig. 1 ). The total amount of electron equivalents (e total) is defined as the summation of the electron equivalents of reactants (r) i (e r i ), of products (p) j (e p j ) and of the biomass (e b) (Eq. (5)). (5) e total = ∑ i = 1 m e r i ( t ) + ∑ j = 1 n e p j ( t ) + e b ( t ) The electron equivalents of reactants and products were known by analyzing VFA, alcohol and biogas concentrations. The absolute amount of electron equivalents in the sludge, however, could not be measured. Instead of the absolute amount, the change in electron equivalents of the sludge was estimated. The change in the electron equivalents (Δe) was defined as the value at time t compared to the time=0, such as Δe b in Eq. (6). (6) Δ e b = e b ( t ) − e b ( 0 ) Solving Eq. (5) for e b(t) and substituting this result in Eq. (6) gives the following result in Eq. (7). (7) Δ e b = [ e total − ∑ i = 1 n e r i ( t ) − ∑ j = 1 n e p j ( t ) ] − [ e total − ∑ i = 1 n e r i ( 0 ) − ∑ j = 1 n e p j ( 0 ) ] = − ∑ i = 1 n Δ e r i − ∑ j = 1 n Δ e p j The change in sludge electron equivalents (Δe b) is defined consequently by the change in reactant (Δe r i ) and product (Δe p,j ) electron equivalents. Here we assumed that all reactants and products were detected in the gas and liquid phase and that the change in total electron equivalents was allotted to the change in electron equivalents of the sludge. Regarding product formation, alcohol was produced either via VFA reduction or via sludge degradation. This implies that part of the electron equivalents in alcohol could derive from reactants (αi ) or from sludge (βi ) (Eq. (8)). (8) Δ e p i = ∑ j = 1 n α i Δ e r j + β i Δ e b with 0 ≤ α i ≤ 1 Λ 0 ≤ β i ≤ 1 The fraction of converted VFA and hydrogen (αi ) that contributed to alcohol product was indirectly calculated using βi , which derived from the controls without VFA (control no. 1). Products in these controls were assumed to derive only from the sludge as no VFA was added as reactant. The contribution of electron equivalents of hydrogen here was disregarded (α H2 =0). Parameter βi was calculated for each product i according to Eq. (9). (9) β p i = e p i Δ e b To determine the occurrence of biological reduction of VFA, a conversion efficiency and a recovery of VFA and hydrogen into alcohol product were defined from Eq. (8). The recovery is defined as the percentage of electron equivalents of the product that derived from VFA and hydrogen (Eq. (10)). (10) Recovery ( p i ) = ∑ j = 1 n α i Δ e r j Δ e p i 100 % = Δ e p i − β i Δ e b Δ e p i The efficiency is defined as the fraction of consumed VFA and hydrogen that was converted to product i (Eq. (11)). (11) Efficiency ( p i ) = e p i − β i Δ e b ∑ j = 1 n Δ e r j 100 % Eqs. (10) and (11) were applied to main products formed in the bottles as alcohol and methane, noting that for each product i, a specific βi was used that was calculated from the controls."
6,Results and discussion,
7,VFA reduction is thermodynamically feasible at elevated hydrogen pressure and low pH,"3.1 VFA reduction is thermodynamically feasible at elevated hydrogen pressure and low pH According to the thermodynamic limit of Schink (1997), biological reduction of acetic, propionic and butyric acids would not be feasible at standard conditions with 1M of all components and pH 7. As Fig. 2 shows, ΔG r′ of reduction of acetic acid becomes more negative at higher hydrogen pressure and lower pH, though ΔG r′ leveled off when the pH becomes 5 or lower. The limit of −20kJ at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1bar is reached when the pH is 4.36. A further decrease of pH results finally in a minimal reaction energy of ΔG r′=−20.7kJ, which is close to the required energy quantity for maintenance and growth. In other words, only low pH cannot contribute further to stimulate biological reduction, instead hydrogen pressure or the acetic acid/ethanol ratio should be increased. Eq (4) revealed that the hydrogen pressure has a stronger effect on the Gibbs free energy change than ethanol/acetate concentration ratio. Similar trends were found for reduction of propionic and n-butyric acids as the reaction formula is similar to acetic acid reduction (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). Consequently, an elevated hydrogen partial pressure of 1.5bar was used in the batch tests. With applied conditions as described in Section 2 and a low pH of 5, a theoretical maximum ethanol concentration of 24.3mM can be reached (Fig. 3 ). In case of propionic acid reduction the maximum propanol concentration would be 24.7mM and with n-butyric acid reduction it is 9.4mM n-butanol."
8,"Granular sludge with acetate, propionate or n-butyrate in the presence of hydrogen results in corresponding alcohol production","3.2 Granular sludge with acetate, propionate or n-butyrate in the presence of hydrogen results in corresponding alcohol production Figs. 4, 5 and 6 and Table 2 all show a decrease in VFA and hydrogen concentration in each batch experiment together with an increase in alcohol concentration. The type of alcohol produced corresponds to the chain length of the VFA present in the medium (Table 2); only ethanol was detected with acetate as substrate (Fig. 4), only propanol with propionate (Fig. 5) and only n-butanol with n-butyrate (Fig. 6 ). The highest measured alcohol concentration was 8.08±0.85mM propanol, which is 33% of the theoretical maximum. This concentration is high considering that reactants are not only used for the production of alcohol, but for by-products as well. By-product formation lowered hydrogen pressure or caused an increase of pH, which consequently lowers the theoretical maximum alcohol concentration. Similar results were found for the butanol concentration which was 39% of the theoretical maximum. The obtained ethanol concentration was 15% of the theoretical maximum that could have been produced from present acetate and hydrogen. In the four controls, no alcohol was produced when hydrogen was left out. In another control without VFA, small amounts of propanol and n-butanol were detected. Propanol concentration (1.2±0.02mmol/l) was, however, eight times lower than in the presence of 50mM propionate. n-Butanol concentration (0.34±0.02mmol/l) was 10 times lower than in the presence of 50mM n-butyrate. Alcohol production in the control is assumed to attribute fully to the release of electron equivalents from the sludge, which was used to calculate βi . Parameter βi was 0.334 for ethanol, 0.223 for propanol and 0.084 for n-butanol. Parameter βi was determined under experimental conditions of the control no.1, though the conditions differ somewhat from the experiment. In the absence of VFA (control 1), 10–31 times more electron equivalents were measured in the aqueous and gas phase than in the presence of VFA. These electron equivalents are estimated to derive from the change in electron equivalents of the sludge. Without substrate, the sludge decay is higher as the release of electron equivalents was larger. Given this, β derived from the control might not be fully representative, but gives an overestimation of the influence of sludge decay on alcohol production. The mass balance based on electron equivalents was almost closed, while the carbon recovery was in some cases much higher (110.4±3.7%). It is known that granular sludge in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems can contain high amount of calcium carbonate precipitates even up to an ash content of 90% (Van Langerak et al., 1998). Release of the carbonates present in sludge causes a positive carbon balance and while the electron balance remains unaffected by the carbonates. The highest alcohol production rate during the first 10 days was observed for propanol amounting to 0.459±0.026mmol/ld−1 compared to ethanol with 0.309±0.042mmol/ld−1 and n-butanol with 0.211±0.009mmol/ld−1. The production rate was not limited by hydrogen transport from gas to liquid phase as the transport rate even by diffusion in a stagnant medium would be higher."
9,The highest conversion efficiency of reactants to alcohol was observed for propionate and hydrogen,"3.3 The highest conversion efficiency of reactants to alcohol was observed for propionate and hydrogen It was found that minimally 50.3±4.7% of the converted propionate and hydrogen is reduced to propanol based on the electron balance (Table 2). When taking β =1 the reduction efficiency is underestimated, and would be 32.5±5.2% for ethanol, 46.6±5.3% for propanol and 42.2±2.7% for n-butanol. Thus even with an overestimation of the influence of electron equivalents of sludge, one-third of the electron equivalents of the carboxylic acid and hydrogen are converted to alcohol product."
10,Positive value for alcohol recovery indicates reduction of VFAs,"3.4 Positive value for alcohol recovery indicates reduction of VFAs High recovery was observed in alcohol products: at least 83.4±4.6% of the electron equivalents in alcohol derived from VFA and hydrogen (Table 2). The high positive values for recovery of reactants in alcohol give evidence that the majority of the alcohols were products of biological reduction. The residual percentage of the total electron equivalents in alcohol products might originate from the sludge. When taking β =1, the recovery would be 50.2±13.6% for ethanol, 91.6±14.5% for propanol and 88.2±10.3% for n-butanol."
11,Methane was the most predominant by-product,"3.5 Methane was the most predominant by-product Table 2 shows that of all products methane was the predominant by-product in the presence of acetate, propionate and n-butyrate. The conversion efficiency of reactants to methane was 33.6±9.6% with acetate as substrate (Eq. (11)), while 27.1±7.1% for propionate and 36.6±2.2% for n-butyrate. Contribution of released electron equivalents from the sludge to methane formation is calculated to be maximum (β =1) for all controls. Methane formation with granular sludge as inoculum is not remarkable as the sludge was taken from a UASB reactor treating brewery wastewater that converted VFAs among others into methane daily. The substrates in present experiment are either direct or indirect substrates for methanogenesis: hydrogen for hydrogenotrophic and acetate for acetoclastic methanogenesis. In addition to that, from a thermodynamical point of view, the most favorable reaction to occur spontaneously is hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (ΔG r′=−110kJ/mol) compared to acetic acid reduction (ΔG r′=−37kJ/mol) calculated for initial experimental conditions. Propionic and n-butyric acids, however, cannot directly be converted to methane, but first need to be oxidized to acetic acid. The oxidation of propionic and n-butyric acid is suppressed by the high hydrogen partial pressure applied in the experiments consequently. Here the actual free energy for propionic acid oxidation (+13.9kJ/mol) is endothermic and higher than reduction of propionic acid (−37.5kJ/mol). Comparably, oxidation of n-butyric acid (−9.73kJ/mol) has a higher actual Gibbs free energy than reduction of n-butyric acid (−33.7kJ/mol). This could explain the high efficiency for propionic and butyric acid reductions compared to acetic acid reduction especially in the beginning of the experiment. Although we can explain methane formation it was not likely to occur at a low pH, for the reason that Kim et al. found that a pH below 5 sincerely inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Kim et al., 2004). With the aim of preventing methanogenesis, the medium of present study had initially a pH of 5. Nevertheless, during the experiment the pH slowly increased to 5.6 with acetate as substrate, to 6.1 with propionate and to 5.7 with n-butyrate. The pH increase canceled the inhibiting effect on methanogenesis and made simultaneously VFA reduction energetically less favorable. The pH increase was not expected regarding the buffer capacity of the remaining VFAs in the medium. An explanation for the increase would be carbonate release from the granular sludge. As described earlier, granular sludge contains metal precipitants as metal carbonates that will dissolve at pH shocks. A shock of pH 5, as done in the initial phase of the experiment, already strongly affects metal content as iron in the anaerobic sludge was concluded by Zandvoort et al. (2005)."
12,General discussion,"Acetate, propionate and butyrate were reduced to alcohols by mixed anaerobic cultures with solely hydrogen as electron donor. As far as we could find in literature this is for the first time demonstrated. The propionate reducing capacity of mixed cultures is also reported by Smith and McCarty (1989). They observed propanol formation in a methanogenic ethanol- and propionate-fed CSTR after a sudden increase in ethanol concentration in the effluent. After perturbation with ethanol, the hydrogen partial pressure increased, where after propanol was formed and a shift towards more reduced products occurred. The highest observed pH of 2 (7.6×10−3 atm), however, is thermodynamically still too low to initiate propionate reduction with hydrogen. Smith and McCarty attributed propanol formation to a coupled ethanol oxidation/propionate reduction, whereas we demonstrated direct propionate reduction with hydrogen. Maintaining a high hydrogen pressure for reduced product formation seems crucial as Smith and McCarty observe that the reduced products were oxidized as soon as hydrogen pressure decreased again. In the present study partial pressure of hydrogen decreased in the batch tests and might even have become limited for VFA reduction. Further research could study the influence of maintaining a high hydrogen partial pressure on VFA reduction and increase alcohol concentration and production rate. Reduced organic products as alcohols might substantially contribute to sustainable bioenergy production from waste even if hydrogen is used as electron donor. The heating value of the fuel is higher with alcohol production from waste than with hydrogen production from the same waste. This is demonstrated by a calculation based on the research of Fang et al. who determined the hydrogen production potential of a carbohydrate-rich food waste with mixed cultures at pH 5 (Fang et al., 2006); it was calculated that acidification of 1kg of rice food waste yields 3.0mol butyrate, 2.8mol acetate and 10.4mol of hydrogen. When assuming that all produced hydrogen is used to bio catalytically reduce acetate and butyrate, it was estimated that 2.7mol butanol and 2.5mol ethanol can be produced from the same kilogram of food waste. Compared to the production of only hydrogen, this process would recover 4.3 times more energy from the food waste. The energy requirement to separate the fuel from fermentation liquid is not included in this calculation. More research is needed to determine whether this new method to produce alcohols can substantially contribute to the mixed-culture biotechnology for bioenergy purposes. Measured concentrations and production rates in the batch test are still very low compared to conventional alcohol production. Further research should focus on inhibition of methane formation to increase the conversion efficiency, e.g. by pretreatment of the inocolum to decrease carbonate release. Further attention should be paid on increasing alcohol concentrations and production rate for example by maintaining a high hydrogen pressure and by optimizing pH."
13,Conclusions,"• Results of batch experiments showed that acetic, propionic and butyric acids could biologically be reduced to alcohols with hydrogen as electron donor in the presence of granular sludge. The highest measured alcohol concentration was 3.69±0.25mM of ethanol, 8.08±0.85mM of propanol and 3.66±0.05mM of n-butanol produced from the reactants with an efficiency of 55.1±5.6%, 50.3±4.7% and 47.6±2.2%, respectively. As far as reported in literature this is the first research that showed that alcohol was produced with solely acetate, propionate or butyrate as substrate and hydrogen as electron donor using mixed cultures. • Methane was the largest by-product. The conversion efficiency of acetate and hydrogen to methane was 33.6±9.6% (Eq. (11)), of propionate and hydrogen it was 27.1±7.1% and of n-butyrate and hydrogen it was 36.6±2.2%. • Alcohol production from VFAs allows the use of a wide diversity of organic raw materials, though the alcohol concentrations and reaction rate should be increased to become competitive with current alcohol production."
