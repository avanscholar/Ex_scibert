0,Introduction,"Recent reviews [1–3] show how steam reforming (SR) of ethanol has received significant attention in the literature as a promising way to produce hydrogen from renewable resources. However, so far essentially all reported investigations have been performed with pure ethanol/water mixtures, i.e. by mixing distilled ethanol and water. Here, we present results on catalytic steam reforming of technical 2nd generation bioethanol produced from straw. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation using 2nd generation bioethanol feedstock although there do exist a few previous papers on the topic using 1st generation bioethanol [4–6]. The difference between 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol is the source of feedstock. 1st generation feedstocks are for instance corn, sugarcane and crops, whereas 2nd generation feedstocks could be agricultural waste, wood or household waste. Typically, 1st generation feedstocks are based on sucrose or starch whereas 2nd generation feedstocks are based on lignocellulose. Ethanol is produced by fermentation of glucose, which is readily achieved from the first group of feedstocks through simple hydrolysis. 2nd generation feedstocks typically consist of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin with the glucose bound in complex structures and more energy is required to release the glucose for fermentation [7]. It is important to realize that the 1st generation feedstocks are also used as food for humans and animals, which is usually not the case for the 2nd generation feedstocks. The use of 1st generation bioethanol has led to a vehement debate about the ethical issues of using food for fuels, see for example reference [8]. Contrary to 1st generation bioethanol, 2nd generation bioethanol significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels [9], thus the use of 2nd generation plants are expected to increase at the expense of 1st generation bioethanol plants. Also, the use of diverse feedstocks for the production of ethanol can pose different challenges in a subsequent steam reforming process, due to the variety of contaminants, and hence it is vital to have good experimental data with different feeds. We have analyzed three different distillation fractions of a technical 2nd generation bioethanol produced from wheat straw and we will give a discussion about the hurdles in using technical bioethanol in steam reforming. The two largest producers of bioethanol in the world are Brazil and the USA, each producing approximately 13 million tons annually (2005) [10] from sugarcane and corn, respectively. With regard to the Brazilian situation, the price of ethanol is comparable to, if not lower than, the equivalent amount of fossil fuel, and the amount of sugarcane available exceeds the need as an edible resource, leading to a situation that might be sustainable [11]. In the US, bioethanol is mainly produced by fermentation of corn. With a corn/oil price ratio that has decreased more than 10 times in the last 60 years [12], bioethanol is continuously gaining importance as a fuel for combustion engines in vehicles. The efficiency of a combustion engine is, however, relatively low and only 20–25% [13] of the energy in the fuel is converted into useful power. Fuel cells, on the other hand, potentially have energy efficiencies of 50–60% [13–15] when operating on pure hydrogen. Fuel cells connected to an onboard ethanol reformer could potentially be used in the automotive sector or to produce heat and power in household micro combined heat and power plants (CHP's). Therefore, a process allowing inexpensive and energy-efficient conversion of bioethanol to hydrogen could increase the value of the fuel considerably [16]. Important factors to consider when evaluating the use of bioethanol as fuel or feedstock is the overall economy of the processes involved as well as the energy-efficiency from biomass to wheel. Fuel grade bioethanol needs to be water-free, thus the production requires distillation beyond the azeotrope point, and this is one of the major production costs of fuel-ethanol [17–19]. On the other hand, the ethanol SR process requires a significant amount of water (Eq. (1)), which makes the expensive distillation superfluous. Only a simple flash distillation to some 50–70% is necessary thereby considerably lowering the production costs of bioethanol. (1) CH3CH2OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 The use of 1st generation bioethanol, like that obtained in Brazil and in the US from sugarcane and corn is, as mentioned above, continuously questioned due to the use of food for fuels [20]; and there have also been concerns over the amount of fossil fuels used in the production of the bioethanol [18] but the topic is still controversial [8,21]. In most places of the world, it will only be reasonable to produce bioethanol from non-food resources like household waste, straw, cornstower and wood. These resources are often considered to be waste materials and are thus significantly less valuable than edible ones; not only will the use of these resources not interfere with food production it will also greatly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and feedstock costs from the ethanol production [9]. Therefore, there is globally an intense research on developing so-called 2nd generation bioethanol, however only a few companies have reached the point of demonstrating the process in a pilot plant. The Danish company Inbicon, a subsidiary of DONG Energy A/S, has for the last 4 years operated a pilot plant, able to convert straw into ethanol using the so-called IBUS process. The demonstration plant is located in Skærbæk, Denmark, and has a capacity up to 1000kg of straw per hour. The bioethanol examined in this paper was received from this pilot plant."
1,Experimental,
2,Production and characterization of technical bioethanol,"2.1 Production and characterization of technical bioethanol The bioethanol received from Inbicon, was delivered in three different purities. The produced fractions were based on a run of 50kg/hr of Danish wheat straw. The straw was heated with steam for 5–15min between 180 and 220°C. The dry-matter concentration of the pretreated straw was approximately 26%. To the pretreated straw was added yeast and enzymes supplied by Novozymes AS, no other chemicals are added in the process. The mixture of heated straw, enzymes and yeast were fermented for 5 days in an 11m3 fermenter, which resulted in an ethanol concentration of around 5–6%. This fibre beer was distilled in a traditional distillation column, with modified trays in the stripper section. The column has a capacity of 1000kg fibre beer per hour, and is operated under vacuum at around 0.1bar. The Inbicon Process is well described in a recent paper [22]. The first fraction was the “fibre beer”, which is 5–6% ethanol in a mixture of water and biomass residues. The other two fractions where taken from different parts of the distillation process. Fractions 2 and 3, with greatly reduced amounts of impurities, had an ethanol concentration of 42 and 72vol%, respectively. All fractions have been analyzed by GC-MS (Agilent 6850 GC equipped with a capillary HP-5MS column an FID detector and Agilent 5975C MSD) and GC (Agilent 6890 N equipped with a capillary HP-5 column and FID detector), the beer was also analyzed by HPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex Rezex RHM-Monosaccharide H+ 8% Column) to determine the composition of each."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis A 10wt% Ni/MgAl2O4 and a 1wt% K doped 10wt% Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. An industrial high surface area spinel (MgAl2O4) with a pore volume of 427mLkg−1 and a specific surface area of 72m2 g−1 received from Haldor Topsøe A/S was used as support material. The spinel tablets were crushed to a size fraction of 300–710μm and dried for 1h at 100°C. The solution for the impregnation was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of the different metal compounds, as nitrate salts, in water under moderate heating. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 100°C for 2h and finally calcined at 500°C for 4h. A 2wt% Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst was prepared similarly from a nitrosyl nitrate aqueous solution [Ru(NO) (NO3)3], leaving out the calcination step to prevent any formation of the volatile and hazardous RuO4 as well as to avoid a decrease in reactivity of the catalyst due to metal sintering. The different catalysts investigated in this study are listed in Table 1 ."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization All catalysts were characterized by BET surface area measurements and hydrogen pulse chemisorptions to determine the total surface area, metallic surface area, metal dispersion and metal particle size. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The hydrogen pulse chemisorptions were made at 50°C for the nickel-based catalysts and at 150°C for the ruthenium catalyst. Before the actual pulse chemisorptions, the catalysts were reduced and activated in situ according to the catalytic experiments described in the next paragraph. After the reduction, the catalyst was kept at the temperature for 1h in a nitrogen flow of 50mLmin−1 to remove adsorbed hydrogen."
5,Catalytic measurements,"2.4 Catalytic measurements The experimental setup used in the catalytic investigation is shown in Fig. 1 . Catalytic experiments were performed in a tubular fixed bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 6mm. For each test, 200mg of catalyst material was loaded into the reactor and secured by quartz wool. The reactor was placed in an electrically heated oven. Before each run, the loaded catalyst was reduced and activated by heating at 5°Cmin−1 to 500°C for 2h in a gas flow of 100mLmin−1 of Formier gas (10% hydrogen in nitrogen) (the Ru catalyst was reduced at 600°C). SR experiments, at 400, 450, 500 and 600°C, were conducted with a helium gas flow of 80mLmin−1 and an ethanol/water liquid flow of 0.04mLmin−1. The liquid was pumped by a Knauer K-120 HPLC pump and vaporized by heating tape at 150–200°C. The bioethanol (fraction 3) was diluted to approximately 25vol% ethanol, which gave a total molar gas flow ratio to the catalyst bed of ethanol–water–helium of about 1:10:20. An Agilent GC 6890 N equipped with a CP Poraplot Q-HT capillary column to the FID detector and an advanced packed column system consisting of Porapak N column and a Molsieve column to the TCD detector was used for analyzing the reaction stream. Furthermore, a Rosemount BINOS 100 was continuously measuring the CO and CO2 contents in the exit gas after condensation of any liquids in an ice bath. The condensate was mainly water and occasionally minor amounts of unreacted ethanol and trace amounts of other liquid species."
6,Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO),"2.5 Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) The experimental setup used for activity measurements was also used for analyzing the amount of carbon formed on the catalysts during SR. The TPO experiments were carried out by heating the oven to 600°C at 10°Cmin−1 in a gas flow of 20mLmin−1 consisting of a mixture of 5% oxygen in helium. By this method, the carbon deposits was completely oxidized to CO and CO2, thus facilitating accurate measurements with the BINOS detector."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Technical bioethanol,"3.1 Technical bioethanol The unpurified fibre beer fraction is a dark mixture of many different compounds (cf. Table 3 ) and some sort of purification is needed before it can be used in any process. If the solids are disregarded, the main contaminants are different sugars and higher alcohols. Several methods were investigated for cleaning the broth with the best results obtained by using activated carbon under reflux at 80°C for 16h. After filtration, a clear ethanol solution was obtained but it still contained considerable amounts of sugars, which caramelize as soon as vaporization of the solution is attempted. No easy and inexpensive method was found for removing these sugars except distillation. Hence, this fraction was not studied further in the steam reforming reaction. Although the different sugars in the beer have to be removed, there is no need to distill to fuel grade ethanol; for SR purposes, a simple flash distillation will probably be sufficient. This will remove the parts of the feed that are not easily vaporized, whereas most of the fusel oils and other low boiling contaminants will remain in the ethanol solution. It has been shown elsewhere [5] that this should not necessarily pose a problem since these contaminants can also be steam reformed and only cause an apparent higher yield of H2 from the reaction. However, Akande et al. [5] used 1st generation bioethanol available from fermentation of crops with mainly lactic acid and glycerol as contaminants, which are very different than those from our study, cf. Table 3. Glycerol has previously been proven reformable [23–25] however the requirements of the equipment are considerably different. The composition of contaminants in various grades of bioethanol is dependent on the feedstocks used and the different refinery processes in 1st and 2nd generation plants. To make the ethanol SR process as economically feasible as possible, it is required that the purification of the feedstock is kept at a minimum. Therefore, this paper investigates the steam reforming reaction using technical bioethanol of different purities. As seen in Table 3, the main contaminants found in fractions 2 and 3 are various higher alcohols, which are not expected to be detrimental for the reaction. By this reasoning, the fraction with lower concentration of ethanol (fraction 2) should be the preferred feedstock for steam reforming, or perhaps a distillation fraction that matches the overall stoichiometry of the reaction with an ethanol to water molar ratio of 1:3, cf. reaction (1). The use of this fraction would allow a reduction in the cost of the feedstock, but the question still remains as to whether this fraction of bioethanol will perform comparably to using a pure ethanol/water mixture."
9,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"3.2 Catalyst synthesis and characterization The catalysts used in this paper were chosen due to the industrial importance of Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst for the SR reactions [26,27]. The spinel support has a good stability at high water pressures and temperatures, and it does not contain acidic sites, which are known to increase the carbon formation rate [28–30]. The potassium doped catalyst was expected to have a lower carbon formation rate due to the potassium covering the most active step-sites on the nickel crystals [31] as well as increasing the steam adsorption on the catalyst [26]. The ruthenium catalyst was included in this study according to recent promising results in the literature with this metal [29]. From Table 2, it is seen that the BET surface area of the spinel (72m2 g−1) does not change when impregnating with Ni and K/Ni. A minor increase in surface area is observed upon impregnation with Ru, which might be attributed to the high acidity of the nitrosyl nitrate solution used to impregnate the support. The metal particle size of Ni and Ru of 10 and 1.9nm, respectively, is very well in agreement with previously observed results from TEM experiments performed on the same catalysts in a previous study [16]. Also the relatively large average diameter of 17nm for the K/Ni catalyst can be explained by earlier TEM analysis of this catalyst, which showed that the particles were typically around 10nm like the undoped Ni catalyst but with several very large metal particles of up to 100nm among them [16]. This will obviously result in a higher average diameter and a lower metal dispersion. Ru catalysts are known to be rather difficult to analyze with chemisorption techniques [32]. Here, a TPD experiment was performed to analyze at which temperature the Ru starts to release adsorbed hydrogen. This happens at around 200°C and therefore a slightly lower temperature of 150°C was chosen for the hydrogen pulse experiment. On the other hand, a standard hydrogen pulse chemisorption procedure at 50°C was chosen for the Ni-based catalysts."
10,SR experiments,"3.3 SR experiments Steam reforming of ethanol is thought to proceed through two separate routes; either by dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (Eq. (2)) or by dehydration forming ethylene (Eq. (3)). (2) CH3CH2OH→CH3CHO+H2 (3) CH3CH2OH→C2H4 +H2O These two intermediate products can then be decomposed and steam reformed to an equilibrium mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and water (Eqs. (4)–(6)). Fig. 2 shows the theoretical equilibrium composition, under the experimental conditions given in the experimental section. At equilibrium the ethanol conversion is 100%, and selectivities in Fig. 2 are in complete agreement with the actual results for all the catalysts in the investigated temperature interval of 400–600°C, as long as no deactivation is observed. Furthermore, ethylene is known to polymerize into pyrolytic coke on metal surfaces (Eq. (7)) [27], and it is assumed that it is mostly ethylene that is responsible for the carbon formation on the catalyst in this reaction although other carbon-forming reactions (Eqs. (8) and (9)) can also be important [27]. The final two reactions for achieving equilibrium among the gasses are the methane SR reaction (10) and the water gas shift (WGS) reaction (11). (4) CH3CHO→CH4 +CO (5) CH3CHO+H2O→3H2 +2CO (6) C2H4 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO (7) C2H4 →coke (8) CH4 →2H2 +C (9) 2CO→CO2 +C (10) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO (11) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 For an accurate comparison between the technical bioethanol and the commonly used ethanol/water mixtures, the same catalysts (Ni, K/Ni and Ru cf. Table 1) as those previously investigated in our group were used [16]. In our previous investigation, it was seen that most experiments showed equilibrium composition in the exit gas, which means that all ethanol was converted to a mixture of H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O. Furthermore, the experiments showed that carbon formation was highly affected by the operating temperature and the choice of catalyst. Only small amounts of carbon were deposited on any of the catalysts at 600°C. At 400°C, it was only the Ru catalyst, which had a full ethanol conversion and a low rate of carbon formation, cf. Fig. 3a [16]. For the current experiments, the bioethanol of fraction 3 was diluted to approximately 25vol% ethanol to facilitate the comparison with previous results. From Fig. 3b and Table 4 , it can be seen that the rate of carbon formation shows the same apparent order and trends in the runs with technical bioethanol as in the previous ones with a pure ethanol/water mixture. However, the rate of carbon formation is generally slightly higher for fraction 3 than for the pure ethanol/water mixture, which can be explained by the slightly higher concentration of carbon-containing compounds in the feed from the contaminants in fraction 3 compared to the pure ethanol/water mixtures. It is also evident, as in the investigation with pure ethanol/water mixtures that an increased temperature of the reaction slows down the rate of carbon formation. This behavior can most likely be explained by diffusion limitations [16]. Consequently, the concentration of ethanol at the catalyst surface will be low and therefore the rate of carbon formation will also be lower. Another observation from the comparison between Fig. 3a and b is the apparent significantly lower rate of carbon formation on the nickel-based catalysts with pure ethanol/water at 600°C. These runs were maintained over a week compared to 16–18hours for the experiments with technical bioethanol. It is anticipated that the rate of carbon formation is highest in the start of the reaction and therefore the apparent rate of carbon formation will be slightly lower for these two long runs. Since the Ru catalyst had higher activity and longer lifetime at the lower temperatures, compared to the Ni-based catalysts, this catalyst was also used in a comparative study with the more contaminated bioethanol of fraction 2. This fraction was also diluted to 25vol% and used as feed in the reaction at 400°C and 500°C. The exit gas composition as measured on the BINOS at 400°C is shown in Fig. 4 . From this it can be seen that the yield of CO2 decreases whereas the yield of CO increases after approximately 12h for fraction 2. For the run using fraction 3 as feedstock neither the CO nor the CO2 concentration changes during the duration of the run (approximately 18h). For the run at higher temperature, 500°C, no deactivation is seen for any of the fractions during the duration of the run. It is also apparent that the CO2 concentration at equilibrium is higher for fraction 2. Both of these observations make sense when the total concentration of steam reformable material is considered. The increased carbon concentration from the contaminants at the catalyst surface will give a higher rate of carbon formation, resulting in an earlier decrease in catalyst performance. The increased amount of steam reformable material is also responsible for the higher concentration of CO2 in the exit gas; a calculation of the gas composition to the catalyst bed from fraction 2 and 3 shows that the extra contaminants in fraction 2 correspond to about a 10mol% increase in the carbon content, in good agreement with the results in Fig. 4. On the other hand, it seems like the larger alcohols and other contaminants in fraction 2 also contribute to the faster deactivation of the catalyst. Through GC-analysis it is evident for all the experiments that full conversion of ethanol leads to the equilibrium gas-mixture as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover all the contaminants in fraction 2 and 3 are also reformed as they do not appear in the GC-analysis. First when the catalysts deactivate; ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethylene, ethane and traces of the contaminants start to appear in the exit gas. This is observed simultaneously with a decrease in methane and CO2 and an increase in the CO concentration, and is occurring with all of the used ethanol/water mixtures. The larger alcohols, as present in fraction 2, could cause severe difficulties through catalyst deactivation at low SR temperatures of technical bioethanol. One possible alternative to decrease carbon formation rates could be to use autothermal reforming instead of SR, this would negate some of the problems with carbon formation but at the expense of a lower H2 yield [33]."
11,Conclusions,"Here, it is shown how steam reforming of bioethanol for hydrogen production can be effectively carried out over different heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, we have indicated some of the challenges for implementing this process into industrial applications. Bioethanol is becoming more and more important as a fuel or fuel additive to gasoline. Yet, a conversion of ethanol to hydrogen could increase the energy-efficiency of the fuel significantly by utilizing the hydrogen in fuel cells with much higher energy efficiencies than in conventional combustion engines. One possible way to convert bioethanol to biohydrogen is by steam reforming, whereby an optimal six hydrogen molecules are formed from every molecule of ethanol (Eq. (1)). Some industrially important heterogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium and nickel shows interesting potential as catalyst for the SR of technical bioethanol, though some challenges still remain, e.g. in reducing carbon depositions on the catalysts. A major factor in limiting carbon formations is the operating temperature. Higher temperatures decrease the carbon formation significantly. Since the activities of the catalysts are high at the temperatures used in SR, the most important parameter to optimize is the catalyst lifetime. When using technical bioethanol of lower purity the lifetime of the catalyst decreases as a consequence of the increased amount and nature of the carbon-containing compounds; this deactivation must be addressed in the design of the process. As long as the deactivation issues are accounted for, it is apparent that the use of fuel grade ethanol is not required; a simple flash distillation of the fibre beer to remove the sugars and other non-volatile substances from the feedstock seems to be sufficient. Therefore, the economics in a biorefinery can be improved by minimizing the process heat (steam) for the energy-intensive distillation along with the capital costs for the distillation equipment."
