0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production stands out as an environmentally friendly process, and can be accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure [1,2]. Among them, dark fermentation has many advantages such as high-efficiency hydrogen production, simple operation, low production cost and independence of light [3]; the hydrogenogens herein play a very important role in fermentative hydrogen production process. More recently, the isolation of high-efficient hydrogenogens has attracted considerable attentions. The different hydrogen-producing bacteria such as Clostridium [4], Enterobacter [4], Klebsiella [5] and Citrobacter [6] have been reported so far. For example, Shin et al. isolated a strain of Enterobacter asburiae which showed the maximum hydrogen yield of 104 ml/g at pH 7 with an initial glucose concentration of 25 g/l [7]. Long et al. isolated a facultative anaerobe, Klebsiella oxytoca from a hot spring which showed the maximum hydrogen yield of 1.0 mol/mol at an initial glucose concentration of 50 mM, pH 7.0 and 35 °C [5]. Nevertheless, the quest for ideal H2-producing microbes has propelled the researchers to screen various sources. Bacillus sp. as ideal biocatalyst for degradation of lignocellulosic biomass is metabolically versatile, grows in minimum mineral salts, and utilizes a wide range of substrates [8,9]. Moreover, Bacillus sp. can be used to achieve hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from biowaste [10]. For example, Patel et al. found defined mixed H2-producers including some Bacillus spp. could produce 65 l H2 and 62.5 g PHB from 1 kg Pea-shells slurry (PSS) [11]. However, useful information on bio-hydrogen production by Bacillus sp. has been rarely reported so far. In the present work, a new hydrogen-producing strain FS2011 from anaerobic effluent of a bioreactor was isolated and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The hydrogen production performance of the strain was further investigated in batch cultivations."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of hydrogen-producing strain,"2.1 Isolation of hydrogen-producing strain The bacterial samples were collected from anaerobic sludge in a bioreactor which was seeded with the pretreated compost by microwave irradiation [12]. The basal medium used for isolation and cultivation of H2-producing strains is composed of 10 g/l glucose, 3 g/l peptone, 1 g/l yeast extract, 1 g/l KH2PO4, 1 g/l K2HPO4, 0.5 g/l L-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1 g/l FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/l MgCl2. The initial pH of medium was adjusted to 7.0. The sludge samples were diluted with sterile distilled water, spread onto agar plates and then incubated at 36 ± 1 °C under anaerobic condition. Single colonies obtained on agar plates were re-streaked more than three times to ensure the purity of the strains. The microbiological work was performed in an Anaerobic Glove Box (Shanghai Yuejin Medical Instruments Factory, China) under a gas mixture containing 85% N2, 10% H2 and 5% CO2. Single colonies were transferred into a serum bottle containing the basal media. The bottles of 140 ml (working volume of 50 ml) had been flushed with nitrogen gas, capped with rubber stopper and then sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min. The cultivations were performed at 36 ± 1 °C in a gyratory incubator with a shaking speed of 120 rpm, and the hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected based on the existence of hydrogen in the evolved gas from the serum bottle. The colony with high hydrogen production activity was selected for further analysis. The strains were stored at −18 °C in sterile 20% (v/v) glycerol solution with an anaerobic environment."
3,Morphological test,"2.2 Morphological test Morphological examinations were performed with a light microscope CH-30 (Olympus, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) H-7650 (Hitachi, Japan). Gram staining was performed by the Hucker method, as described by Doetsch [13]."
4,Strain identification,2.3 Strain identification The genomic DNA was extracted from cell with the standard method [14] and the 16S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR as described [15]. The double-stranded PCR products were sequenced. The 16S rDNA sequence was aligned and identified by GenBank using the BLAST program.
5,Hydrogen production characteristics,"2.4 Hydrogen production characteristics The above isolate with high hydrogen-producing activity was pre-cultured on basal medium, and then the early-stationary-phase culture was transferred to 140 ml serum bottles containing 50 ml of basal fermentation media for the following batch tests. The basal fermentation medium was listed as follow: 10 g/l glucose, 3 g/l peptone, 1 g/l yeast extract, 0.1 g/l FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/l MgCl2, 10 ml mineral salt solution (contained 2.0 g/l NH4HCO3, 1.0 g/l KH2PO4, 0.1 g/l MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g/l NaCl, 0.01 g/l Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.01 g/l CaCl2·2H2O, 0.015 g/l MnSO4·7H2O, 0.00278 g/l FeCl2). The bottles were shaken at 36 ± 1 °C and 120 rpm in the air bath. The biogas volume at regular intervals was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using displacement of saturated brine. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates. The standard deviation in results was within 5%."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Hydrogen concentration was measured by a Gas Chromatograph (GC, Agilent 4890D) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a porapak Q stainless column. The temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 100 °C, 80 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Nitrogen served as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min [2]. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were detected using another GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an 8-ft stainless column packed with 10% PEG-20 M and 2% H3PO4 (80/100 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, FID detector, and oven were 220 °C, 140 °C, and a programmed column temperature of 115–170 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min [2]. The glucose concentration was determined by the method of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) [16]. The cell dry weight was determined by centrifuging culture broths (10,000 rpm, 3 min), washing triple with distilled water and drying to constant weight at 100 °C. Hydrogen yield was calculated by measurements of the gas composition in the headspace plus the total volume of biogas production at each time interval using the mass equation [17]: (1) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H,i and V H,i−1 are the cumulative hydrogen volumes at the current (i) and previous (i − 1) time intervals, respectively; V G,i and V G,i−1 are the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fractions of hydrogen gas in the headspace in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; V H is the volume of headspace of vials."
7,Kinetic modeling,"2.6 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (2) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml); λ is the lag time (h); P is the hydrogen production potential (ml); R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h) and e is the constant of 2.718281828. The values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 5.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm. In this study, R m is expressed as ml/g-substrate·h−1, the specific hydrogen production potential (P s) is defined as ml/g-substrate [18–20]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Isolation and identification of hydrogen-producing strain,"3.1 Isolation and identification of hydrogen-producing strain Seven strains capable of producing hydrogen were screened and purified from the anaerobic sludge mentioned above. Among them, the strain FS2011 was selected for further studies based on its high hydrogen-producing potential. The bacteria had a rod-shape (Fig. 1 ), with the diameter from 0.7 to 1.0 μm and the length from 2.0 to 3.0 μm. They exhibited Gram-positive staining in both the exponential and stationary growth phases. Spores were observed when the environment became stressed. Other physiological and biochemical properties are summarized in Table 1 . The strain FS2011 exhibited 99% sequence identity with B. amyloliquefaciens (GenBank Acc. No.: NC_017061.1) by aligning with the 16S rDNA gene sequences from GenBank releases. Furthermore, the 16S rDNA gene sequence of B. amyloliquefaciens FS2011 had been deposited in the GenBank with accession number JX316756."
10,Hydrogen production characteristics of Bacillus sp. FS2011,"3.2 Hydrogen production characteristics of Bacillus sp. FS2011 3.2.1 Effect of carbon source From the standpoint of the reclamation of wastes, it is important to utilize different carbon sources as feedstock for hydrogen-producing bacteria [21]. Herein, the effects of different carbon sources on hydrogen production with Bacillus sp. FS2011 were further investigated at medium pH 7.0 and carbon source of 5 g/l. The result was given in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, the bacterium could utilize various carbohydrates, in which sucrose, fructose, glucose and soluble starch were found to be suited for hydrogen production. The corresponding hydrogen yields were 272 ml/g, 255.4 ml/g, 246 ml/g and 203.2 ml/g, respectively. It should be noted that sorbitol as carbon source was more suitable for hydrogen production with FS2011 in comparison with glucose. And the corresponding R m of 3.5 ml/g h−1 and P s of 268.6 ml/g from sorbitol were observed, respectively. The difference in hydrogen production capacity could be attributed to different redox states between sorbitol and glucose [22]. When xylose, galactose, mannose or arabinose was applied as the substrate, the lower hydrogen yields of 143 ml/g, 161.6 ml/g, 94.4 ml/g and 72.7 ml/g were observed, respectively. Nevertheless, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was hardly utilized by Bacillus sp. FS2011. The results revealed that the strain FS2011 could utilize various types of carbon sources as feedstock to produce bio-hydrogen, which would be of great significance to waste recycling [23]. When glucose was used as the carbon source, the effect of the initial glucose concentration on P s, R m, residual glucose and dry cell weight (DCW) are represented in Table 3 . As can be seen from Table 3, the maximal hydrogen yield (P s) of 253.8 ml/g occurred at the substrate concentration of 5 g/l, and then gradually decreased along with the increase of glucose concentration. For example, P s and R m decreased from 253.8 ml/g and 6.7 ml/g h−1 at glucose concentration of 5 g/l to 107.0 ml/g and 1.5 ml/g h−1 at glucose concentration of 30 g/l. When glucose concentration ranged from 5 to 10 g/l, almost all of the glucose had been consumed. Thereafter the residual glucose changed from 0.99 g/l (glucose conversion 90.1%) to 4.09 g/l (glucose conversion 86.3%) while glucose concentration was further elevated from 10 to 30 g/l. The results suggested that the carbon flux was more directed to the production of reduced by-products such as organic acids and alcohol at higher substrate concentration [24]. The similar research was also reported by Ginkel et al., in which, the excess substrate had been converted to alcohols rather than acids, leading to the decrease of hydrogen yield [25]. In the meantime, the cell concentration increased from 0.24 to 0.80 g/l while glucose concentration increased from 10 to 30 g/l, but the cell productivity increased from 0.236 to 0.243 mol/g-DCW with glucose concentration ranging from 5 to 10 g/l, and then dropped with further increasing glucose concentration. For instance, when glucose concentration was elevated from 10 to 30 g/l, the cell productivity decreased from 0.243 to 0.179 mol/g-DCW indicating substrate inhibition. According to the above results, the glucose concentration of 10 g/l was selected as carbon source in the following batch cultures. 3.2.2 Effect of nitrogen source Nitrogen is an essential component in microbial protein and nucleic acid which directly affect microbial hydrogen productivity. The effects of various nitrogen sources on hydrogen production by the strain FS2011 were plotted in Fig. 2 . As described in Fig. 2, the kind of nitrogen source significantly affected hydrogen production in batch tests. While peptone, beef extract, tryptone, yeast extract, urea, NH4HCO3 or (NH4)2SO4 was employed as nitrogen sources, the maximal hydrogen yield was observed to be 221.0, 251.7, 204.9, 176.9, 193.6, 210.2 and 161.5 ml/g, respectively. In general, organic nitrogen sources (such as beef extract and peptone) were more suitable for hydrogen production than inorganic nitrogen sources (such as urea and (NH4)2SO4). The reason may be that the organic nitrogen sources contain some peptides and free amino acids which can be easily absorbed for cell growth and hydrogen production. However, these growth factors are lacking in inorganic nitrogen sources [26,27]. Likewise, nitrogen source concentration also significantly affected hydrogen production in the basal fermentation medium (Fig. 2). For instance, when beef extract was applied as nitrogen source, the hydrogen yield decreased from maximal value of 251.7 to 150.1 ml/g with increasing concentration from 2.0 to 10.0 g/l. However, when peptone was used as nitrogen source, the hydrogen yield drastically increased from 64.9 to 221.0 ml/g with increasing concentration from 2 to 4 g/l, and then slightly decreased from 221.0 to 146.8 ml/g with further increasing concentration from 4 to 10 g/l. It was noteworthy that the maximum hydrogen yield of 210.2 ml/g was achieved while NH4HCO3 (8 g/l) was employed as nitrogen source. The results demonstrated that Bacillus sp. FS2011 could utilize different types of nitrogen sources to produce hydrogen. 3.2.3 Effect of initial pH The effect of initial pH of the medium on hydrogen production was illustrated in Fig. 3 and Table 4 at the fixed glucose 10 g/l and beef extract 2 g/l. As presented in Fig. 3 and Table 4, the value of P s was above 200 ml/g when the initial pH varied from 5.29 to 7.38. The maximum P s of 242.1–246.0 ml/g and R m of 6.5–6.8 ml/g h−1 occurred at initial pH 6.47–6.98, in which the shortest lag phase of 40–34 h was also observed in this run. However, the trend was reversed while initial pH was below 5.0 or above 8.0, e.g., P s of 53.0 ml/g and R m of 0.4 ml/g h−1 occurred at initial pH 4.92; P s of 99.4 ml/g and R m of 4.9 ml/g h−1 occurred at initial pH 8.04, respectively. The results were in consistent with previous reports by the literature. For example, Li et al. found the initial pH range of 5.0–7.0 was benefit for hydrogen production by mixed cultures [6]. Mizuno et al. found that hydrogen yield fell off sharply while initial pH below 4.5 and hydrogen production process was completely inhibited at initial pH 4.0 [28]. The results exhibited that the initial pH considerably affected the hydrogen production because the hydrogenase activity would be inhibited and the corresponding metabolic pathway would change under extreme pH condition [29,30]. 3.2.4 Effect of phosphate buffer concentration As is known to all, the generation of hydrogen by fermentative bacteria usually accompanies the formation of volatile fatty acid as metabolic products leading to a sharp drop of medium pH, the effects of phosphate buffer concentration on hydrogen production and the distribution of soluble metabolites were investigated at fixed initial pH 6.98, glucose 10 g/l and beef extract 2 g/l. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and Table 5 , the cumulative hydrogen yield and the ratio of acetate to butyrate in soluble metabolites increased along with the increase of phosphate buffer concentration from 0 to 20 mmol/l. The maximum P s of 280.8 ml/g (2.26 mol/mol), R m of 6.7 ml/g h−1 and the ratio of acetate/butyrate 1.55 peaked at the phosphate buffer concentration of 20 mmol/l. After that, the three parameters decreased gradually from 280.8 ml/g, 6.7 ml/g h−1 and 1.55 to 153.4 ml/g, 4.7 ml/g h−1 and 1.32 while the phosphate buffer concentration increased from 20 to 30 mmol/l. In the meantime, the medium pH increased from 4.27 to 5.98 when phosphate buffer concentrations were enhanced from 0 to 30 mmol/l. Results indicated that acetate was the major metabolite at higher phosphate buffer concentration by the strain FS2011, which suggested that the change of medium pH leaded to the shift of bacterial metabolic pathway, and carbon flow was favorable to the acetate production at higher pH value. Similar study was also reported by Tang et al., in which the ratio of butyrate to acetate increased from 0.6 to 1.4 with the decrease of medium pH from 7.5 to 5.5 by mixed culture [31]; The similar results had been reported by Ding and his collaborators, of which the ratio of acetate to butyrate increased from 0.74 to 1.82 in the soluble metabolites by Clostridium butyricum while phosphate buffer concentration changed from 10 to 50 mmol/l [32]. 3.2.5 Effect of temperature Fermentation temperature is also a vital parameter on the performance of bio-hydrogen production. The change of P s and R m with temperature ranging from 25 to 45 °C by Bacillus sp. FS2011 was presented in Table 6 . As shown in Table 6, both P s and R m increased with increasing temperature from 25 to 35 °C and then decreased when temperature further increased from 35 to 45 °C. The maximum P s of 279.8 ml/g and R m of 6.5 ml/g h−1 appeared at 35 °C, respectively. And then, P s and R m declined to 53.9 ml/g and 3.1 ml/g h−1 at 45 °C, respectively. In the meantime, the maximum biomass (0.51 g/l) and cell productivity (0.24 mol/g-DCW) peaked at 35 °C (see Table 6), but cell growth was inhibited at higher or lower temperature level (such as 25 or 45 °C). The results were in general agreement with the literature, in which, the maximum value of cell growth and hydrogen production by Bacillus coagulans IIT-BT S1 appeared at 37 °C. However, the developing trend was reversed when the operating temperature was above 40 °C [8]. This may be attributed to the increase of the denaturation rate of the enzymes at higher temperatures [24], leading to the decrease of hydrogen yield. At last we briefly compared the hydrogen production characteristics of several hydrogen producers belonging to Bacillus sp., and the results were summarized in Table 7 . As can be seen from Table 7, Bacillus sp. FS2011 is an ideal candidate for the fermentative hydrogen production compared with the literature data."
11,Conclusions,"A new hydrogen-producing strain Bacillus sp. FS2011 was successfully isolated and identified, which could utilize various carbon and nitrogen sources for hydrogen production in a wide initial pH range from 5.29 to 7.38. In addition, the phosphate buffer concentration also significantly affected bio-hydrogen production by Bacillus sp. FS2011. The maximal hydrogen yield of 2.26 mol/mol-glucose was observed at fixed substrate concentration of 10 g/l, beef extract of 2 g/l, phosphate buffer of 20 mmol/l, initial pH 6.98 and 35 °C. Bacillus sp. FS2011 is an ideal alternative for the fermentative hydrogen production compared with the literature data."
