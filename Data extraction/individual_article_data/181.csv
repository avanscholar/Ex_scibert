0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most potential strategies for mitigating environmental pollution and energy shortage [1,2]. Plentiful photocatalysts have been developed for hydrogen production since Fujishima and Honda [3] firstly reported the use of TiO2 semiconductor for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production in 1972. However, the practical application of TiO2 is restricted by its large bandgap (3.2 eV) that is only responsive to ultraviolet (UV) light [4,5]. Therefore, developing efficient visible-light responsive photocatalysts have received much attention [6,7]. As a two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides with atomically layered structure, ZnIn2S4 has attracted growing attention as a visible light responsive photocatalyst with outstanding chemical stability and low toxicity [8]. However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers limits its photocatalytic performance [2,9–11]. Accelerating the separation and migration rates of the photogenerated carriers is still a general challenge for ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst [12,13]. Loading cocatalysts in photocatalytic semiconductors is one of the most efficient method to promote the separation and migration rates of the photogenerated carriers [5,14–16]. Meanwhile, the cocatalysts also provide extra reaction sites and decrease the activation energy, bringing obvious enhancement for hydrogen evolution [8,9]. Noble metal with large work function has been widely used as the most common candidates in photocatalysis [5,17]. Nevertheless, the expensive noble metal cocatalysts are not suitable for commercial production and application [5,8,18,19]. Reassuringly, some non-precious metal cocatalysts, like nickel, cobalt, molybdenum and wolfram, show remarkable positive effect on photocatalytic hydrogen production [8,20–22]. Among these noble-metal-free cocatalysts, nickel-based cocatalysts (Ni, NiO, NiS, Ni(OH)2, Ni2P) have demonstrated a significant effect on photocatalytic hydrogen production and show perfect ability to absorb and store hydrogen and thus efficiently promote reaction rates [12,23–28]. For example, Ding et al. reported that the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4 could be significantly improved by loading NiS acting as electron harvester anchors [27]. The extraordinarily highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production was approximately 10 times that of pure ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Similarly, ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst decorated by Ni(OH)2 also showed a high hydrogen production performance of 8.35 mmol·h−1·g−1, which is 18 times that of pure ZnIn2S4. And its photocatalytic activity remained stable after 4 cycling photocatalytic experiments [28]. Recently, Lin et al. have synthesized Ni surface-modified ZnIn2S4 for highly enhanced dual activities of photocatalytic hydrogen production and benzaldehyde oxidized from benzyl alcohol [12], owing to the Ni modification beneficial to enhance capacity of the charge carrier separation. These results suggest that using Ni as cocatalyst is quite promising to greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 nanostructures under visible light irradiation. In this work, we report in-situ photo-depositing Ni clusters in hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers for unprecedented photocatalytic hydrogen production. The Ni clusters as cocatalyst in ZnIn2S4 provide extra active sites for photocatalytic reaction as revealed by in-situ photoluminescence measurement. In particular, the Ni clusters effectively improve the separation of the photogenerated electron and holes. Therefore, the Ni/ZnIn2S4 photocatlaysts exhibit highly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. The best 2 wt%-Ni/ZnIn2S4 (2-Ni/ZnIn2S4) photocatalyst demonstrates the highest hydrogen production rate of 22.2 mmol·h−1·g−1, which is 10.6 times higher than the pure ZnIn2S4 (2.1 mmol·h−1·g−1). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is as high as 56.14% under 450 nm monochromatic light. The present work indicates that depositing non-precious Ni in ZnIn2S4 could take full advantage of their features on efficient electron-hole separation and excellent reactant activity for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance."

Ethanol (C2H6O, ≥99.7%) and Zinc chloride (ZnCl2, ≥98%) were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals are used as received."
3,Preparation of hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers,"2.2 Preparation of hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers In this work, hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers was prepared by hydrothermal method [9]. Briefly, 0.5 mmol of ZnCl2, 1.0 mmol of InCl3·4H2O and 2.0 mmol of thioacetamide were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. The solution was transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the yellow ZnIn2S4 precipitate was collected by filtering and washing with deionized water and ethanol for three times and then dried at 40 °C overnight."
4,Depositing Ni clusters in hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers,"2.3 Depositing Ni clusters in hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers Hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers was in-situ decorated by nickel nanoclusters through a facile photoreduction method. Typically, 20 mg of ZnIn2S4 was dispersed in the solution containing 80 mL of H2O and 20 mL of TEOA. Different amounts of NiSO4·7H2O were added into precedent solution. The mass percentages of nickel were 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 wt%, respectively. The reaction solution was evacuated for 30 min to completely remove air and subsequently irradiated under visible light (λ > 420 nm, PLS-SXE-300D with a visible light intensity of 158 mW cm−2) for 2 h. The obtained Ni/ZnIn2S4 was collected by filtering and washing with deionized water for three times and then dried at 40 °C overnight. The prepared samples were denoted as 0.5-Ni/ZnIn2S4, 1-Ni/ZnIn2S4, 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 and 3-Ni/ZnIn2S4, respectively."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The crystalline phase of the obtained samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540596 Å), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphologies of samples were observed by a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed on FEI Talos F200S microscope fitted with Super-X EDX system, operated at 200 kV. The surface chemical composition and valence states of products were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were calibrated versus the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV). Room-temperature UV–vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using a UV-2550 Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were measured by Autolab 86,005 to investigate the electronic transmission efficiency of samples. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of dispersions were measured by a customized PTI spectrofluorometer with an InGaAs detector, and the excitation wavelength is 350 nm. N2 adsorption–desorption was performed in automatic specific surface area and porosity analyzer (Tristar Ⅱ3020), and the specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The samples were vacuum degassed at 120 °C for 12 h before N2 adsorption–desorption test. The content of Ni was measured by an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrum (ICP, Prodigy 7). Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical analyzer (Autolab 86005) with a standard three-electrode system: the prepared samples as the working electrodes (the active area of 1 cm2), a Pt tablet as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode and aqueous Na2SO4 (0.5 M) solution as the electrolyte. The preparation of working electrode is as following: 10 mg of sample and 30 μl of Nafion solution were dissolved in 1 mL of ethanol, which was ultrasonically dispersed to form a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was then dropped onto a 1 cm2 FTO glass and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The electrochemical impedance experiment was started at an open circuit voltage with a frequency of 10 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The flat band potential of the samples was analyzed by Mott-Schottky curves of the samples at 2 kHz, and 3 kHz, respectively. For photocurrent experiment, the working electrode of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 was prepared as following: 10 mg of pure ZnIn2S4, 1 mg of NiSO4·7H2O and 30 μl of Nafion solution were dissolved in 1 mL of ethanol, which was well ultrasonicated to form a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was then dropped onto a 1 cm2 FTO glass and dried in an oven at 80 °C. And the solution with 20 vt% TEOA was used as electrolyte. This working electrode was placed in the electrolyte and irradiated by visible light (λ > 420 nm, PLS-SXE-300D with a visible light intensity of 158 mW cm−2) for two hours with N2 purging, and then the photocurrent experiment was performed. And the preparation of the working electrode of pure ZnIn2S4 was the same as 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 except for the absence of Ni source."
6,Photocatalytic activity,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of prepared samples was directly tested after the photoreduction of nickel clusters. Specifically, after the photoreduction of nickel clusters, 20 mL of triethanolamine was added in above mentioned dispersion again, then the whole closed circulation system (Labsolar-IIIAG) was evacuated for 30 min to completely remove air and subsequently the reactor was irradiated under simulated solar light (λ > 420 nm, PLS-SXE-300D with a visible light intensity of 158 mW cm−2, and an ultraviolet (UV) light intensity of 34 mW cm−2, Beijing Perfectlight, ). The amount of produced H2 was analyzed using on-line GC with TCD using N2 as carrier gas. Typically, the photocatalytic H2 production was performed in a Pyrex reactor with an entry window of optical quartz glass. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the H2 production was tested under monochromatic light (λ = 450 nm) and calculated based on the following equation: A Q Y = 2 × n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 %"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and microscopy observations,"3.1 Structure and microscopy observations Fig. 1 a displays the schematically synthetic process of Ni/ZnIn2S4. Typically, the yellow ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers were obtained by hydrothermal method [9]. Then Ni2+ ions were adsorbed on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers and subsequently reduced to Ni clusters by the photogenerated electrons from ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation. Fig. 1b-f present the FESEM images of the obtained hierarchical ZnIn2S4 and the Ni/ZnIn2S4 with different amount of Ni clusters. The pure hierarchical ZnIn2S4 is flower-like sphere assembled by nanosheets with the diameter of ∼ 5 μm (Fig. 1b). After Ni clusters deposition, the nanoflowers structure of ZnIn2S4 collapses slightly due to the mechanical stirring during the visible light irradiation reduction process (Fig. 1c-f). The crystalline phases of the ZnIn2S4 and Ni/ZnIn2S4 composites are further investigated by XRD (Fig. 1g). The pure ZnIn2S4 with three strong diffraction peaks at 21.6°, 27.7° and 47.2° defines a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 01–089-3962) of (003), (011) and (110) crystal planes, respectively. The XRD patterns of Ni/ZnIn2S4 are almost the same as pure ZnIn2S4, suggesting that nickel clusters deposition does not change the crystalline structure of ZnIn2S4. It is noted that no distinction of crystalline phase of Ni is detected. From the previous report [12], this is because of the very low amount and very small size of Ni. TEM is further conducted to investigate the Ni/ZnIn2S4 composites. As the only difference for the Ni/ZnIn2S4 composites is the amount of Ni clusters, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is then chosen as a representative of the Ni/ZnIn2S4 samples. TEM, HRTEM images and FFT patterns are shown in Fig. 2 a-c. The flower-like structure is obviously shown in Fig. 2a, consistent with the SEM observation. From Fig. 2b, one can clearly observe the diffraction rings of the (210), (124), (215) and (420) crystal planes of ZnIn2S4. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2c shows the lattice spacing of 0.33 nm, which is ascribed to the (210) crystal plane of ZnIn2S4. It is worth noting that through the intensive observation, the Ni clusters have not been clearly observed in ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 2c), in agreement with the XRD results. On the one hand, the amount of Ni is very low. On the other hand, this means that its size is small enough. Moreover, Ni element is lighter than Zn and In elements, which also interfere the observation of Ni. However, EDX elemental maps show a homogeneous distribution of Ni in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 2e-h) and the EDX spectral line measurement also demonstrates the signal of nickel (Fig. S1). Both confirm the existence of nickel. It is then reasonably concluded that the Ni is in cluster form after deposited in ZnIn2S4. The following XPS results also reveal that Ni clusters are successfully deposited in the ZnIn2S4 samples. The nickel content in the samples was further confirmed by the ICP-OES measurement as illustrated in Table S1. It shows that the Ni contents in all the Ni/ZnIn2S4 samples are very low. The highest Ni content is 0.51 wt% in 3-Ni/ZnIn2S4. That is why no Ni peaks appeared in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1g)."
9,Band structure and electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Band structure and electrochemical characterization Fig. 3 a presents the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the ZnIn2S4 and all the Ni/ZnIn2S4 samples to study their electronic structures and the optical absorption properties. It shows that the absorption edges of both all samples present at ∼ 570 nm analogously, indicating no obvious change of the bandgap of ZnIn2S4 after Ni clusters deposition. Fig. 3b displays the Tauc plots of ZnIn2S4, showing the electronic bandgap of ZnIn2S4 (2.36 eV). The Fermi levels of ZnIn2S4 was then investigated by Mott-Schottky plots measured at 2000 Hz and 3000 Hz (Fig. 3c). The calculated flat band potential (Vfb) for ZnIn2S4 is −0.45 V. XPS are further carried out to the determine the distance between the valence band (VB) maximum and the Fermi level for ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 3d). It shows that the distance between the VB maximum and the Fermi level of ZnIn2S4 is 1.9 eV. Therefore, the VB of ZnIn2S4 is calculated at 1.45 eV. Moreover, the conduction band (CB) of ZnIn2S4 is deduced to −0.87 eV. Therefore, the CB and VB positions of ZnIn2S4 are −0.26 eV and 2.06 eV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Fig. 3e then displays the accurate electron band structure of ZnIn2S4. It shows that the CB of ZnIn2S4 is negative than E(Ni2+/Ni) (-0.257 eV vs NHE). This confirms that the photogenerated electrons in hierarchical ZnIn2S4 can reduce nickel ions to Ni clusters. Fig. 3f is the transmission efficiency of photogenerated charges investigated by EIS Nyquist plots. The ZnIn2S4 shows an obviously larger diameter of the semicircle than 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. Namely, electrons transfer in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is faster than in ZnIn2S4 [29]. In addition, Fig. S2 presents the periodic on/off photocurrent responses of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4 photoelectrodes under visible light. It shows that the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode displays significantly enhanced photocurrent density (30.86 μA cm−2), about 3 times of pure ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode (11.36 μA cm−2). This confirms that the Ni clusters in ZnIn2S4 promote the transmission efficiency of photogenerated charges, which is beneficial for photocatalytic hydrogen production."
10,Photocatalytic H2 production,"3.3 Photocatalytic H2 production The photocatalytic activity of the ZnIn2S4 and all of the Ni/ZnIn2S4 samples is evaluated by the hydrogen production from water splitting under visible light irradiation. All of the Ni/ZnIn2S4 samples show higher hydrogen production rate than the pure ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 4 a). It proves that Ni clusters as cocatalyst can dramatically promote the photocatalytic hydrogen activity of ZnIn2S4. In particular, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 demonstrates the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production with an amount of 55.4 mmol g−1 in 2.5 h. Fig. 4b presents the cycling performance of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 for 5 cycles. One can note that the photocatalytic activity of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 decreases a little from the second cycle. From our experience, it should be the partial change of the hierarchical structure as evidenced by SEM observation on the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 sample after the first cycle (designated as R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4) as shown in Fig. S3b. It clearly shows that the flower-like structure becomes dense particles, leading to the decrease of specific surface area. Fig. S4 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the pure ZnIn2S4 and the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 and R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. All isotherms are of type IV [30,31], indicating the presence of mesoporous. However, after Ni clusters deposition and hydrogen production, the specific surface area of the ZnIn2S4 sample is reduced from 80 m2·g−1 to 47 m2·g−1, and finally to 39 m2·g−1 (Table S1), consistent with the SEM observation. Therefore, the lower specific surface area leads to the less reactive sites in R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. This reduces the contact with free hydrogen ions in the solution, resulting in a slight decrease photocatalytic activity from the second cycle [32–35]. The XRD result shows that the crystalline structure of ZnIn2S4 does not change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S5), and the diffraction peak of Ni cannot be detected yet. TEM observation was also conducted on R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4, as shown in Fig. S6. The low magnification image (Fig. S6a) clearly shows the aggregation of the R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Interestingly, no Ni clusters are found through our intensive observation (Fig. S6b and c). This means that the Ni clusters are still well dispersed on 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 nanosheets as the EDX elemental maps shown in Fig. S6d-g. Furthermore, even prolonging the visible light irradiation time to 14.5 h on 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 (designated as L-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4) or increasing the content of nickel from 2% to 10% in solution for ZnIn2S4 (designated as H-Ni/ZnIn2S4), one can not observe Ni clusters or nanoparticles through TEM (Fig. S7c and Fig. S8c). This means that the amount of nickel clusters deposited on the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets is extremely limited from the ICP-OES test (Table S1), consistent with the XRD result (Fig. S5). Again, the nickel signals (Fig. S7b and Fig. S8b) and the EDX elemental maps (Fig. S7d-g and Fig. S8d-g) really confirm the existence of nickel. This indicates that the nickel size is very small. Therefore, we tend to use nickel clusters to describe nickel because it is invisible under HRTEM and XRD for these samples. Owing to the surface activation generating more reaction sites during photocatalytic reactions [36], the photocatalytic activity recovers a little from the fourth cycle. This is also consistent with the following XPS results on R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. Fig. 4c displays the hydrogen evolution rate of ZnIn2S4 and Ni/ZnIn2S4. Again, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 gives the best hydrogen production rate of 22.2 mmol·h−1·g−1, which is 10.6 times as high as the pure ZnIn2S4 at 2.1 mmol·h−1·g−1. It is noted that the hydrogen evolution rate on Ni/ZnIn2S4 increases with the amount of Ni increase at first and subsequently decreases. This is because that the Ni clusters benefit to charge separation and migration, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. However, the excessive Ni clusters on the surface could affect the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4 because they can act as the recombination centers of photogenerated electrons and holes [37]. Table 1 compares the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate and the rate comparison of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 with recently reported pure ZnIn2S4 and corresponding ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts. It clearly shows that the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 sample is much more efficient and more conducive to the positive progress of ZnIn2S4 for photocatalytic hydrogen production than the previous reported results. Under the irradiation of 450 nm monochromatic light, the average intensity of irradiation is determined to be 36.5 mW·cm−2. The 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 gives the hydrogen production rate of 5.34 mmol·h−1·g−1 (Fig. 4d). Therefore, its AQY is 56.14% according to the AQY formula as following: AQY = 2 × 5.34 × 10 - 3 × 2.5 × 6.02 × 1023 36.5 × 10 - 3 × 38.5 × 2.5 × 3600 × 450 × 10 - 9 / ( 6.626 × 10 - 34 × 3 × 108 ) × 100 % = 56.14 %"
11,Chemical status characterization,"3.4 Chemical status characterization The XPS measurement was then performed to clarify the chemical surface properties of the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 before and after reaction. The survey scan spectrum (Fig. S9) shows the peaks of Zn, In, S, Ni, O and C, indicating that Ni has successfully been decorated on ZnIn2S4 regardless of whether it has undergone the photocatalytic reaction. It is interesting to note that there is C and O signals in these samples. Generally, the C signal is from the adsorbed CO2 and unreacted chemicals. And the O signal comes from the adsorbed water and CO2 in air. It is interesting to note that the intensity of C peak from fresh 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is higher than that of R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4, indicating the adsorption capability of the 2D ZnIn2S4 nanostructure decrease [17], consistent with the decrease of specific surface area. Fig. 5 a shows the Zn 2p spectra of ZnIn2S4 and 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 before and after reaction. The peaks at 1045.2 and 1022.2 eV are attributed to the Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively [41]. However, the Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is 1045.0 and 1021.9 eV, respectively after Ni clusters deposition. This indicates strong interaction between Ni and ZnIn2S4. After photocatalytic reaction, the binding energy of Zn 2p1/2 (1044.8 eV) and 2p3/2 (1021.8 eV) further decreases in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 comparing to the pure ZnIn2S4. Most possibly, the further decrease comes from the hydroxyl group attached on 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 during the reaction, which is helpful for the photogenerated carriers migration in Ni/ZnIn2S4 [17,18,42]. Fig. 5b presents that the binding energy of In 3d3/2 (451.5 eV) and In 3d5/2 (444.0 eV) in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 is 1.0 eV lower than that of In 3d (452.5 eV for 3d3/2 and 445.0 eV for 3d5/2) in ZnIn2S4 [41]. The decreased binding energy is associated with the Ni clusters deposition, suggesting that there should be very strong interaction between Ni and ZnIn2S4. After reaction, the In 3d3/2 is 452.2 eV and In 3d5/2 is 444.7 eV for R-2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. Both are still 0.3 eV lower than pure ZnIn2S4 due to the further attachment of hydroxyl group, which influences the surface chemical status of Ni/ZnIn2S4 [17,18,42]. Fig. 5c is the high resolution XPS spectra of S 2p. It shows that after loading Ni clusters, the binding energy of S 2p1/2 is 162.3 eV and 2p3/2 is 160.9 eV. Again, both decrease 0.7 eV compared to the pure ZnIn2S4 (163.0 eV for S 2p1/2 and 161.8 eV for S 2p3/2) [41]. Similarly, the S 2p1/2 (162.8 eV) and 2p3/2 (161.6 eV) further increase 0.5 eV in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 after photocatalytic reaction. This phenomenon is similar to the changes of In spectra before and after reaction. On the one hand, both In and S contribute to VB of ZnIn2S4 [29]. After Ni clusters deposition, the strong interaction between Ni and ZnIn2S4 leads to these binding energies decrease. On the other hand, after reaction, more hydroxyl group will adsorb on the surface [17,18,42], which will also influence the surface chemical status of Ni/ZnIn2S4, leading to the slightly binding energies increase. Fig. 5d presents the Ni 2p spectra of 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 before and after reaction. For 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4, the peaks at 873.7, 862.1 and 856.1 eV are attributed to the Ni 2p1/2, 2p3/2 satellite and 2p3/2 of Ni2+, respectively [43]. The Ni2+ should come from the adsorbed NiCl2 on the surface of nanosheet because of its high BET surface area. Therefore, only two peaks at 870.4 and 853.2 eV are found after reaction, attributed to the Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Ni0, respectively [44]. With the reaction going on, the adsorbed Ni2+ are fully reduced by the photogenerated electrons. This may also explain the different shift of binding energies of Zn, In and S element in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 before and after reaction."
12,In-situ photoluminescence test and mechanism,"3.5 In-situ photoluminescence test and mechanism To directly reveal the role of Ni clusters as active sites for hydrogen production, the in-situ photoluminescence measurement was for the first time conducted on 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4. During this measurement, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 was dispersed in water containing TEOA as hole capture reagent illuminated under 350 nm monochromatic light. And the result is presented in Fig. 6 a. It shows that after loading Ni clusters, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 demonstrates increased intensity comparting to the pure ZnIn2S4. This indicates that more photogenerated electron-hole pairs are produced in 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 under illumination after Ni clusters decoration [11]. When the illumination time is at 1.5 and 2 h, both has the highest photoluminescence intensity. This suggests the equilibrium of the photocatalytic reaction. This result confirms that Ni clusters are active sites for enhanced hydrogen production because it is beneficial for photogenerated carriers separation and transport. This is consistent with the previous work that loading Ni as a cocatalyst can effectively improve the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes [12]. According to the above results and analysis, Fig. 6b illustrates the schematic hydrogen evolution mechanism of ZnIn2S4 and 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 under visible-light. Firstly, ZnIn2S4 is excited under visible-light irradiation and the electrons can transfers from its VB to CB, leaving the h+ in the VB. Generally, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be quickly recombined without co-catalysts, resulting in the poor photocatalytic activity for pure ZnIn2S4. After loading Ni clusters as the cocatalyst, the photogenerated electrons from the CB of ZnIn2S4 can easily transfer to Ni clusters [9] because of the lower band of Ni (Fig. 3e). This largely decreases the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes in ZnIn2S4 and drastically improves the hydrogen production rate of ZnIn2S4. As the Ni clusters have strong chemical interaction with ZnIn2S4, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 has very good stability and exhibits the best performance for hydrogen production."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, we successfully depositing Ni clusters in hierarchical ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers through a facile in-situ photoreduction method. Loading Ni as a cocatalyst not only provide active sites for chemical reactions as revealed by in-situ photoluminescence measurement, but also effectively improve the separation of the photogenerated electron and holes to highly enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production. Especially, the 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 shows the highest hydrogen production rate of 22.2 mmol·h−1·g−1 among all samples, which is 10.6 times as high as the one of ZnIn2S4 at 2.1 mmol·h−1·g−1. Compared with the previously reported works about ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts with cocatalyst [25,27,28,38], our synthesized 2-Ni/ZnIn2S4 has unprecedented photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. And its AQY is as high as 56.14% under 450 nm monochromatic light. Moreover, all the Ni/ZnIn2S4 composites exhibit good stability and reusability. This confirms that Ni is an alternative for noble metals to substantially reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of photocatalysts. Our work here provides an economic and efficient method to design non-precious metals as cocatalyst for highly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
