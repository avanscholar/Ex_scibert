0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and increasing energy demand coupled with climate change have encouraged researchers to seek alternative energy sources that are sustainable, renewable and environmentally friendly. Energy carriers such as hydrogen and methane have been suggested as good alternatives for fossil fuel [1]. Several methods have been explored for hydrogen and methane production, including electrochemical or thermochemical processing [2] as well as biological gas production such as photofermentation and anaerobic fermentation. Biological gas production, or so-called biogas production, is an attractive new area of fuel processing technology that proposes gas production from various renewable resources. Biogas (i.e., hydrogen) can be produced from organic matters such as cellulose [3], lignocelluloses [4,5], sugar cane molasses [6], starch [7], glycerol [8], glucose, xylose and paper sludge [9] via thermal, fermentation and microbial electrolysis processes. Compared to electrochemical or thermochemical gas production, biological methods have less energy intensity [2,10]. Anaerobic bacteria, cyano-bacteria and fermentative bacteria are three types of microorganisms used in biogas production. In terms of hydrogen and methane production, dark fermentation (DF) under anaerobic conditions is considered more interesting due to its low energy requirements, renewable and non-polluting qualities, and its ability to utilize organic matter such as carbon and energy sources [11]. The fermentative bacteria are one of three types of microorganisms used to convert organic matter into organic acids, alcohols and mixed gases, such as hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide [12]. In general, fermentation processes using mixed cultures can produce methane, hydrogen [12,13] and carbon dioxide. Both hydrogen and methane generation can be divided into two distinct stages, namely, acidification and methane production. Each step is carried out by a number of microorganisms through a syntrophic interaction. In the first stage, acidification produces hydrogen as a by-product, which in turn is used as an electron donor by many methanogens in the second stage of the process. Immobilized cell technology is a technique in which microorganisms are immobilized onto a support, such as agar, gelatin, calcium alginate, glass, a synthetic polymer or others. This technique is a promising method for creating high cell densities to achieve rapid carbohydrate conversion to organic acids and gases. In addition, immobilization cell technology is more efficient than conventional techniques because it enables the repetitive use of a high biomass to carry out biochemical reactions. In addition, it can also be used for bioprocessing organic acids [14] and for bio-hydrogen production [15]. Most studies on this topic have been focused on conventional techniques, which use a pure strain culture, activated sludge and immobilized pure cell technology [16]. Many types of bacteria, such as anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Clostridium sp) [17,18], facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacter sp) [19,20], obligate anaerobic bacteria and their mixed cultures have been studied as potential bacteria for the production of hydrogen. It is known that most fermentation processes are conducted in suspended-cell systems. High hydrogen production can be achieved by high substrate feeding, but this process may cause instability in the system due to the cell washout phenomenon [21]. The immobilized cell technique is one of the techniques that can be used to minimize this limitation [22,23]. In this technique, the immobilized cells can remain stable for experimental runs of more than 60 days. Only a few studies have reported biogas production using an immobilized mixed culture [24–26]. Therefore, in this study, our aim was to evaluate both hydrogen and methane production from glucose by using an immobilized mixed-culture reactor (IMcR). Additionally, this work is a preliminary step towards the enhancement of hydrogen production using the effluent of fermentation as a substrate in both microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) [15]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Mixed-culture inoculation,"2.1 Mixed-culture inoculation The anaerobic digester of palm oil mill effluent (POME), collected from an aerobic treatment pond located in Seri Ulu Langat, Dengkil, Selangor, Malaysia, was used as a mixed-culture source in this study. The mixed-culture was grown in a medium rich nutrients (MRN) in a bottle (DURAN 500 mL) under anaerobic conditions and placed inside an incubator shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h. After shaking, the grown mixed-culture was kept in a refrigerator for further experiments."
3,A medium rich nutrients (MRN) and immobilization of mixed-culture,"2.2 A medium rich nutrients (MRN) and immobilization of mixed-culture A medium rich nutrients (MRN) was formed by mixing a total of 5 g glucose into a medium containing (all in L−1) 2.0 g yeast, 2.0 g tryptone, 0.5 g Cystein-HCl, 3.0 g NH4Cl, 1.0 NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.5 g KH2PO4, 3.0 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgCl2.6H2O, 1.0 mL vitamin solution and 1.0 mL mineral solution. The pH of the MRN was adjusted to 7.0 (with NaOH). Then, the MRN was heated at 60 °C and mixed using a magnetic stirrer for 15 min to obtain a homogenous mixture. The immobilization of mixed-culture was conducted under anaerobic conditions at room temperature. The grown mixed-culture was then harvested and mixed with 3% (w/v) sodium alginate to produce a final concentration of 1.5% (w/w) of sodium alginate mixture. The sodium alginate mixture was then dropped into a 2% (w/v) calcium chloride solution using a 3 mm pipette to obtain hardened beads after 2 h. The beads were washed three times with distilled water to remove the excess cells and calcium ions. Following this procedure, the beads were placed in a reactor under aerobic conditions by purging with nitrogen for 2–3 min [6]. The diameter of the obtained beads was approximately 3.0 mm. The beads were then called as the immobilized mixed-culture."
4,Immobilized mixed-culture reactor (IMcR) setup and gas analysis,"2.3 Immobilized mixed-culture reactor (IMcR) setup and gas analysis The immobilized mixed-culture reactor (IMcR) is a tubular reactor with an internal diameter (ID) of 8.0 cm and a height of 15 cm, as shown in Fig. 1 . A total of 80% of the IMcR was filled out with the immobilized mixed culture and fresh media, and 20% of the extra space was used for the anticipated expansion of beads by the fresh media. The IMcR was conducted at different temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 ± 1 °C), various fermentation times (12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h) and glucose concentrations (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 g/L medium) in batch-mode operation. H2, CH4 and CO2 gases were monitored at each stage of the operation. The produced gas mixture was collected using a syringe (60 mL), and 1.0 μL of the collected sample was analysed using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD 6890). A Porapak Q & MolSieve (6 ft & 10 ft) column was used with a retention time of approximately 15 min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 150 °C and 180 °C, respectively. The percentages of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide in the gas mixture were expressed by the peak areas (%) of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide in the chromatogram."
5,Effluent analysis,"2.4 Effluent analysis The organic content of the effluent was determined by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. The COD indicates the mass of oxygen consumed per litre of solution, expressed as mg/L. In this work, the COD was determined according to the APHA standard method using an instrument set for COD measurement (DRB 200 and DR 2800 spectrophotometer HACH, USA) [27,28]. Initially, a total of 2 mL of effluent was centrifuged (FORCEMICRO model) at 13000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 0.2 mL of the effluent was extracted and dropped into a vial containing potassium dichromate before placing the mixture into the heating area (DRB 200 instrument). Subsequently, the solution was heated at 150 °C for 2 h before cooling the sample to room temperature. Finally, the COD value was determined using a spectrophotometer (DR 2800 HACH). The organic compound analysis was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)."
6,Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis,"2.5 Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis The mixed-culture colony in the beads was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as described by Satar et al. [15], Kumar and Das [29] and Zao [30]. In this analysis, fresh bead samples taken from the IMcR system and samples collected after 60 days of the experimental run were used. Before the analysis, the dried samples were mounted on SEM stubs coated with gold. Different sections of the solid matrices were examined and imaged by SEM (JEOL JSM 5800) using an accelerated voltage of 20 kV at a distance of 10 mm. The digital images were captured using a resolution of 1280 × 960 and a dwell time of 160 s."
7,Calculations,"2.6 Calculations The COD of feed (COD 0 ) and effluent (COD t ) were calculated to determine the change in COD (ΔCOD). The COD removal (COD rem) is the amount of the change in COD divided by the COD of feed, as described by Equation (1): (1) COD rem= Δ COD CO D 0 ×100% (2) Δ COD = CO D 0 − CO D t where COD rem is the amount of chemical oxygen demand lost during the IMcR operation. ΔCOD is the change in the chemical oxygen demand of the substrate (COD 0 ) over to chemical oxygen demand of the effluent (COD t ). The amount of gas was calculated based on the composition of each gas in total gas produced, as described by Equation (3): (3) V g = V t × [ g ] where V g is the volume of gas (mL), V t is the volume of total gas produced from the IMcR and [g] is the composition of the gas (%) based on the GC-TCD analysis. The IMcR efficiency (ɳ IMcR ) can be determined by calculating the yield of gas. The yield of gas (ɳ g ) is the number of moles of gas divided by the number of moles of substrate added to the IMcR, as described by Equation (4): (4) η IMcR = η g = n g n f × 100 % where n g is the number of moles of gas and n f is the number of moles of feed (substrate). The number of moles of gas can be determined by Equation (5): (5) η g = P V g R T where V g is the volume of the gas, and P and T are pressure and temperature at standard conditions, respectively (1 atm and 273.15 K). R is the ideal gas constant (0.08206 L atm mol−1 K−1). The gas production rate (Q) is the amount of gas ( V g ) divided by the amount of feed ( V f ) added to the system over time (t, day) as described by Equation (6): (6) Q = V g V f × t"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Hydrogen and methane production,"3.1 Hydrogen and methane production Theoretically, 1 mol of glucose can produce 6 mol of carbon dioxide and 12 mol of hydrogen (Equation (7)). However, in practice, 1 mol of glucose can only produce 3–4 mol of hydrogen and x moles of carbon dioxide and organic acid (Equation (8)). This result indicates that the behaviour and activity of microorganisms are significantly influenced by operational conditions such as fermentation time, pH, substrate and temperature [31,32]. Hydrogen fermentation proceeds by a complex pathway [33], and its products depend on the microorganisms used in the process. It is known that the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and solvents (e.g., ethanol) also contributes to the generation of hydrogen [34]. However, the fermentation of simple sugars (e.g., glucose) using either single [15,33] or mixed cultures [7] generally produces mixed gases such as hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 CO 2 + 12 H 2 (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O microorganisms → xCO 2 + ( 3 - 4 ) H 2 + organic acids In addition to hydrogen, methane can also be produced from glucose by the IMcR system. Afery Jr. et al. [35] reported that methane production occurred when methanogen (e.g., acetoclastic methanogens and/or hydrogenotrphic methanogens) groups, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were present in the system. It is well-known that fermentation of simple sugars (e.g., glucose) can produce organic acids (e.g., acetate), carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Therefore, methane was also expected to be produced in the IMcR system. Methane is generated through a two-step reaction, as described in Equation (9) and (10). First, acetate is converted by acetoclastic methanogenesis to methane and carbon dioxide (Equation (9)). Second, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are combined by hydrogenotrophic methanogenes to produce methane and water (Equation (10)). Based on these reactions, the hydrogen and methane yields will be gradually decreased and increased, respectively, with the increase in fermentation time. (9) C 2 H 4 O 2 acetoclastic methanogens → CH 4 + CO 2 (10) 4 H 2 + CO 2 hydrogenotrophic methanogens → CH 4 + H 2 O Fig. 2 (a) shows the hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide production from various glucose concentrations at 60 °C with a fermentation time of 48 h. Based on Fig. 2(a), the highest yields of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide were 37.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu (corresponding to 0.08 mmol/g glu), 17.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu (corresponding to 0.04 mmol/g glu) and 373.0 ± 0.8 (×10−3) mol/mol glu (corresponding to 0.83 mmol/g glu), respectively, using 5 g/L glu. The hydrogen yield increases with the increase in glucose concentration up to 5 g/L. Thereafter, there was a significant decrease in hydrogen yield with further increase in glucose concentration (6–10 g/L). This phenomenon is because the high amount of feed provides an inhibiting effect on the microorganism's productivity, and as a consequence, the hydrogen yield decreases at higher glucose concentrations (6–10 g/L) [15,36]. According to the produced yields, the optimal conditions for hydrogen and methane production were obtained at the same glucose concentration of 5 g/L glu. Generally, either hydrogen or methane production rates were significantly affected by increasing the glucose concentration. It is significant to note that the hydrogen and methane production rates gradually increased with the increase in glucose concentration, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). The highest production rates of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide were 21.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, 10.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day and 140.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, respectively, using 10 g/L glucose. However, in terms of the IMcR efficiency, which correlated with the hydrogen yield, it can be said that 5 g/L glu is more suitable for the further IMcR investigations, especially to evaluate the hydrogen and methane production. The glucose concentration of 5 g/L was further used to study the effects of temperature on the production of hydrogen and methane. The activities, behaviour and productivities of microorganisms can also be affected by temperature. The hydrogen and methane yields as a function of temperature are displayed in Fig. 3 (a). The highest yields of hydrogen and methane were obtained at 37.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu and 17.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu, respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows a gradual increase in hydrogen and methane yields as the temperature increased from 30 °C to 60 °C; thereafter, both hydrogen and methane yields gradually dropped with increasing temperature. This result was expected due to the unsuitability of the IMcR system for high-temperature operation. At high temperatures, the beads in the IMcR system were found to be damaged and broken into small pieces, and consequently, the mixed-culture colony matrix was detached from the damaged beads. Similarly, the production rates of hydrogen and methane appeared to increase consistently with the increase in temperature up to 60 °C before a sudden drop, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The highest rates of hydrogen and methane production were 21.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day and 10.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, respectively, at 60 °C with a fermentation time of 48 h. Hence, this temperature was expected to be optimal for hydrogen and methane production. According to Elhsarnouby et al. [37], the microbial productivity for hydrogen production was determined to be higher at 55–60 °C (or in thermophilic conditions). This result indicates that the mixed culture consumes more glucose for hydrogen and methane production within this temperature range, which is consistent with the optimal temperature (60 °C) determined in this study. This result indicates that a higher microbial productivity for hydrogen and methane production can be achieved by controlling the temperature. The effect of fermentation time on the yield of hydrogen and methane was revealed in Fig. 4 (a). This investigation was conducted at 60 °C. The figure indicates that the hydrogen yield steadily increased with the fermentation time and reached a maximum value of 37.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu at a fermentation time of 48 h. Further increase in fermentation time led to a decrease in the hydrogen yield as a result of the reaction between hydrogen and carbon dioxide to form methane. This result explains why the methane yield consistently increased with fermentation time. The highest methane yield was found to be 39.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu at a fermentation time of 72 h. Thus, the fermentation time needs to be controlled to optimize the production of hydrogen rather than methane. Fig. 4(b) shows the gas production rates for hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the highest hydrogen production rate was 21.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, obtained at a fermentation time of 36 h–48 h. Meanwhile, the highest methane production rate was 10.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, obtained at a fermentation time of 48 h using 5 g/L glu. Based on the hydrogen yield and production rate, the optimal fermentation time for hydrogen production is expected to be between 36 h and 48 h in this study."
10,Effluent analysis: COD and pH,"3.2 Effluent analysis: COD and pH Generally, microorganisms consume the substrate during the enrichment process, simultaneously producing gases and organic acids. After the enrichment process is completed, microorganisms continue to consume the substrate for survival and thus continue to produce gases and organic acids as during the enrichment process. Fig. 5 (a) presents the mixed-gas production and COD removal for various glucose concentrations at 60 ± 1 °C. The fermentation time was fixed at 48 h. As shown in the figure, the highest COD removal was found to be 30.4 ± 0.1% using 5 g/L glu. The COD removal, however, significantly dropped at higher glucose concentrations (6–10 g/L) and was determined to be unsuitable for optimal production of hydrogen. However, the production of mixed gases increased with the glucose concentration, as shown in the figure. Fig. 5(b) presents the effect of temperature on the COD removal and pH of the effluent using 5 g/L glucose. The fermentation time was fixed at 48 h. Based on the figure, the lowest pH value was obtained at 60 °C, whereas the highest pH value was obtained at 30 °C and 70 °C. This finding could be due to the higher organic acid concentration produced from the increased microbial activity at the optimal temperature of 60 °C compared to other temperatures. Fig. 5(c) shows the effect of fermentation time on the COD removal and pH of the effluent using 5 g/L glucose. This investigation was performed at the optimal temperature of 60 °C. It can be seen that the pH of the effluent dropped from 7.0 to 3.9 after 48 h of fermentation. Hence, the pH was nearly constant after 48 h of the experimental run, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The effluent of the fermentation consisted of various organic acids, such as lactic, formic, malic and acetic acids. In general, a simple sugar such as glucose is more readily converted by microorganisms into acetic acid rather than other organic acids. Hence, the composition of acetic acid in the effluent was found to be higher than those of malic, succinic, lactic, propionic and butyric acids, as shown in Fig. 6 . The summary of the calculated effluent composition is shown in Table 1 . Based on the table, the acetic and lactic acid compositions were found to be 52.9% (v/v) and 34.6% (v/v), respectively, and these were the two main organic acids in the effluent. Wang et al. [3] and Satar et al. [15] reported that the effluent of fermentation, which has a high composition of acetic acid, can be used as a substrate in microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) [15]. Table 2 presents the summary of hydrogen and methane production using the IMcR system for all the conditions used in this study."
11,Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images,"3.3 Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images A series of SEM images of the beads from the IMcR system was taken at the beginning and end of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the sodium alginate had a polymeric structure with many pores for the entrapment of the mixed culture before the experiment was conducted. However, Fig. 7(b) shows the structure of the beads after 60 days of the experiment. Fig. 7(a) clearly shows that the surface of the polymeric structure of sodium alginate was covered by the cylindrical-shaped mixed-culture, which is very critical for the effective production of gases. However, Fig. 7(b) illustrates that the mixed-culture colony was detached from the beads. Hence, the IMcR system, due to its ineffective beads, was found to be unsuitable for further production of gases. This result may have been the reason for decreased production of hydrogen after 48 h of fermentation, as described in Fig. 4(a). This result shows that the IMcR was only effective for 60 days of the experimental run."
12,Conclusions,"The immobilized mixed-culture reactor (IMcR) in batch mode operation has been successfully used for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and methane using glucose as a substrate. The hydrogen and methane production rates (Q) increased with increasing glucose concentration (4–10 g/L). However, the IMcR system efficiency determined by the yield of the produced gas indicated the highest efficiency at a glucose concentration of 5 g/L. The optimal temperature for the production of hydrogen and methane using 5 g/L of glucose was 60 °C at a fermentation time of 48 h. The hydrogen and methane production rates at this temperature were 21.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day and 10.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day, respectively. Fermentation time is the most influential factor for hydrogen and methane generation compared with the glucose concentration and temperature in an IMcR process. The highest hydrogen and methane production rates of 21.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day and 10.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mL/mL/day were found at fermentation times of 48 h and 72 h, respectively. In this measurement, the glucose concentration and temperature were fixed at 5 g/L and 60 °C, respectively. In this study, the IMcR system was effectively operated for 60 days before its performance degraded as a result of the detachment of the mixed-culture colony from the beads. Acetic and lactic acids were the main organic acids in the effluent of fermentation. Overall, the optimal conditions for hydrogen and methane production using the IMcR system were obtained using the substrate of 5.0 g/L glucose at 60 °C for fermentation times of 48.0 h (hydrogen) and 72.0 h (methane), respectively. The maximum yields of hydrogen and methane in these optimal conditions were 37.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu and 39.0 ± 0.0 (×10−3) mol/mol glu, respectively."
