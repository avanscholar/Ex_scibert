0,Introduction,"Lignin, an amorphous 3D phenolic polymer is the third largest component of lignocellulosic biomass made up of coniferyl, sinapyl, p-coumaryl alcohols linked together via numerous ≡C-C ≡ and ≡C-O-C ≡ linkages and is profusely obtainable as a by-product in the pulp and paper industry and in the synthesis of bio-ethanol [1,2]. Lignin after depolymerization carried out in presence of either acids, bases, or ionic liquid catalysts yields oxygen containing compounds like substituted phenols, furans, etc. with varying concentrations [3–7]. It is desired to upgrade these chemicals through catalytic dehydration and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions, both of which are known as defunctionalization reactions [8–12]. The characteristic reactions involved in HDO are hydrogenation, deoxygenation by decarbonylation, cleavage of CO bond etc. and thus make HDO process an intricate one. Consequently, the choice of active sites for achieving these reactions in controlled manner is critical when designing effective heterogeneous catalysts for HDO processes [7,13,14]. One of the chemical which can be targeted to be achievable from lignin is cyclohexanol as it is presently derived from phenol, which in turn is obtained from fossil feedstock. As known, commercial production of adipic acid proceeds via formation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (KA oil), which in turn are obtained either from hydrogenation of phenol or oxidation of cyclohexane/cyclohexene, both of which are derived from fossil feedstock [15]. Most of the HDO reactions are performed using molecular hydrogen as a hydrogen source using precious metals like Ru, Pt, Pd loaded over various supports under high temperatures (>275 °C) and pressures (>5 MPa H2) so as to cleave strong CO bonds (bond dissociation energy, 414 kJ/mol) present in phenolic compounds [16,17]. Guaiacol having practically comparable chemical environment (CO bonds) as present in lignin: Ar(C)-O-CH3 [C(sp3)–OAr (methoxy group), C(sp2)–OMe] and C(sp2)–OH (hydroxyl) having bond energies of 247, 356 and 414 kJ/mol, respectively is classically used as a model compound for these reactions [18]. The effects of various metals, supports, solvents etc. are well studied in these reactions [4,18–23]. Although effective way for HDO, the low solubility of molecular hydrogen, and thus use of higher hydrogen pressure, necessitates to develop high pressure resistant infrastructure etc. which in turn makes this process commercially unappealing. To ally these concerns, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH involving addition of hydrogen across CC or CO bonds) and/or catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (CTH involving cleavage of CC and CO bonds) can be an alternative methodology to carry out HDO reactions. In view of this, Ru/C and RuRe/C catalysts are reported for CTH of guaiacol in isopropanol system at 200 °C and 2 MPa N2 pressure and within 5 h, cyclohexanol formation was observed as a major product (60%) [21]. Lately, comparative study based on CTH of lignin is reported in presence of PtRe/TiO2, Re/TiO2, Pt/TiO2 at 240 °C in inert media [22] . However, it is emphasized that detailed research in this area is prerequisite to evaluate catalytic parameters to attain improved results in terms of selectivity, TON etc. [23]. CTH of lignin derived monomers opens up a prospect for the designing and optimization of HDO processes. In view of above deliberations, aim of this work was to carry out HDO of lignin derived monomers via CTH pathway to enhance the formation of cyclohexanol as product (Scheme 1 )."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cyclohexane, cylohexanol, phenol, and eugenol, RuCl3 (Ru, 45–55%), γ-Al2O3 (Acidic, Neutral) were ordered from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals. guaiacol, anisole, veratrol, 4-propyl cyclohexanol, isopropyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, and propanol were purchased from Loba Chemie. 2-methoxy cyclohexanol was procured from Alfa Aesar. 4-propyl phenol was purchased from TCI Chemicals."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Supported metal catalysts were synthesized using wet impregnation method. Prior to synthesis, supports were activated overnight at 60 °C. Then supports were activated at 150 °C under vacuum for 6 h. In a classical synthesis procedure, activated support (2 g) was suspended in water (10 mL) and kept under vigorous stirring for 0.5 h. To this solution, dropwise aqueous solution of RuCl3 containing (2 mL) 0.098 mmol Ru (0.5 wt% Ru/Support) (10 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 16 h at 35 °C. The obtained thick aqueous slurry was subjected to rotary evaporator to remove water. Powder thus obtained was dried in oven at 60 °C for 16 h followed by vacuum drying at 150 °C for 6 h. Then, dried powder was reduced under the flow of hydrogen (H2, 10 mL•min−1) for 2 h at 150 °C. The obtained catalysts were named Ru/Al2O3-Acidic, and Ru/Al2O3-Neutral depending on nature of support."
4,Catalytic runs,"2.3 Catalytic runs CTH of guaiacol was carried out in Parr make 100 mL hastelloy high pressure reactor. 2.13 wt% aromatic monomers (guaiacol, phenol, anisole, veretrol, eugenol) solution in (24 g) IPA with guaiacol/surface exposed Ru metal molar ratio, 35,520 is charged in the reactor. Reactions were carried out in N2 (0–1.5 MPa at R.T) at desired temperature. After completion of the reaction, autoclave was allowed to cool down to the R.T. under air flow. Reaction mixture was collected in centrifuge tube and subjected to the centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 10 min., which helps in separation of catalyst from the reaction mixture. Before analysis reaction mixture was filtered through 0.22 μm syringe filter. It was also noticed that with an initial 0.7 MPa N2 pressure charged at R.T, at desired reaction temperature of 225 °C, final pressure of the reaction reached upto 5.4 MPa."
5,Analysis of reaction mixture,2.4 Analysis of reaction mixture Recovered liquid was filtered and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent GC) technique using HP-5 capillary column and flame ionization (FID) detector. The GC–MS (Agilent-7890 GC and Agilent MS-5977A MSD) equipped with DB-5 MS column was used for the analysis and identification of the products. Following formulae are used for the calculation of conversion and yields. Conversion % = moles of substrate converted based on GC moles of substrate charged x 100 Yield % = moles of product formed based on GC moles of theoretical product formed based on substrate converted x 100

7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Before employing the catalysts for the CTH reactions, those were characterized to understand their morphologies and properties. The x-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts demonstrate characteristic peaks for the supports (Fig. S1, ESI). However, nonappearance of any peaks for the Ru metal is advocated to be because of very high dispersion of metal on the supports. From TEM images it was pragmatic that Ru with average particle size of 3–4 nm is present on Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst (Figs. S2, ESI) and on Ru/Al2O3-Neutral it was 5–7 nm. CO chemisorption study for these catalysts was carried out and it was seen from Table S1 (ESI) that the results of this analysis follow the same trend of particle size as that of TEM findings. XPS analysis for Ru at 3d3/2, 3d5/2 and 3p3/2 level was carried out. Though, due to superimposition of C(1 s) peak in the same range of Ru, 3d3/2, it was impractical to check oxidation state(s) of Ru conclusively (Fig. 1 ). After deconvolution of peaks obtained for Ru 3p3/2 level, peak at B.E. of 461.2 eV is designated for the Ru(0) and peak at B.E. of 463.7 eV indicates presence of Ru in oxide form (RuO2 species) [24]. Thus, it can be safely proposed that Ru is both present in metallic state and also in higher oxidation state over the support. A cautious look at the XPS profiles illustrate that ratio of Ru (metallic) to Ru (oxide) varies depending on the support used. Based on the clear increase in full-width half maximum (FWHM) observed with peaks in Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst and calculation of area under the peak, in case of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, Ru is predominantly present in metallic state (4:1 ratio for metallic:oxide) but in case of Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst, distribution of Ru oxidation state is virtually equal (1:1). It would be fascinating to find out based on this, whether catalyst shows variance in the activity. When NH3-TPD of Al2O3-Acidic support was done, NH3 desorption peak was appeared at 200 °C (Fig. S3, Table S2, ESI). Subsequently, supported Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was subjected to TPD analysis and appearance of additional sharp peak for NH3 desorption was seen at 335 °C. The extra peak can be designated for desorption of NH3 from the different site on the catalyst, which must be then from the Ru species. It is also anticipated that if Ru is electron rich and present in metallic state then it may not interact with NH3, but, fact is that extra peak is seen, which points out the existence of Ru in electron deficient state. This further emphasizes the fact that Ru is present in higher oxidation states (II, IV) and it may have strong interaction with NH3. Furthermore, XPS analysis too has evidenced occurrence of Ru in higher oxidation state along with metallic state. Thus, in summary, catalyst characterization studies reveal that Ru is highly dispersed on the Al2O3 support with smaller crystallite size and is present in metallic as well as higher oxidation state."
8,Catalyst activity,"3.2 Catalyst activity 3.2.1 Support effect Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions were conducted in high temperature, high pressure, batch mode reactors. When reaction was carried out at 225 °C, under 0.7 MPa N2 pressure for 2 h in IPA solvent over Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst, 55% guaiacol conversion was achieved along with the formation of cyclohexanol (39%) and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (12%). Subsequently, as an evidence of acidity playing a role in HDO reactions, enhancement in the yield for cyclohexanol (74%) with Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was seen as compared to neutral Al2O3 (39%). Besides this, formation of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (9%) and (5%) cyclohexane was also seen, which was lower than Al2O3-Neutral supported catalyst (12%). In order to comprehend the difference in the activity between two catalsyts, crystallite size of Ru was examined for both the catalysts (Al2O3-Neutral, Al2O3-Acidic) and it was perceived that over both the supports, Ru crystallite size is almost equivalent (Table S1, ESI), which means that Ru particle size might not be responsible for difference in activity. Another factor that might be accountable for variance in activity is related to the oxidation state of Ru. As evidenced by XPS studies, ratio of Ru (metallic):Ru (higher oxidation state) is higher in case of Al2O3-Acidic (4:1) supported catalyst than in Ru/Al2O3-Neutral supported catalyst (1:1). CTH-HDO reaction thus, can be considered as governed by bifunctional (regarding oxidation state) catalyst. Moreover, fact that Ru is present in higher concentration in metallic state in Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, also emphasized the fact that metallic state is more predominantly participating in the mechanism as during CTH-HDO, metal can remain in electron rich state due to availability of hydrogen at higher temperature than required for reduction of it. Yet additional factor that must be responsible for difference in activity is due to the acidity alteration of the support. Acidity plays a noteworthy role in the cleavage of CO bond and hence, acidic Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst might be showing higher cyclohexanol yield than neutral Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst. These results endorsed that the adsorption of oxygenated compound(s) on the acidic supports has greater influence and it has resulted into the formation of higher cyclohexanol as a product. To relate the activity of two catalysts, TOF calculations were done while reactions were performed for shorter time of 0.5 h at 225 °C under 0.7 MPa N2 pressure. With Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst, 7.2 h−1 and with Ru/Al2O3-Acidic, 48 h−1 TOF was observed, which indicates that Ru/Al2O3-Acidic is a better catalyst. The difference in the TOF is because of marginal increase in exposed Ru in Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst (1.86 nm) compared to that of Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst (2.18 nm). However, it is believed that additional difference in the TOF may also arise from the fact that, in case of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, concentration of Ru present in higher oxidation state is higher compared with Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst (Fig. 1). These two factors give synergistic effect to enhance the activity of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst. This also suggests that Ru present in higher oxidation state must be active center for this reaction. To check whether during the reactions methane is obtained as methanol would form after the cleavage of CO bond (Ar-OCH3), vent gas was analyzed by GC-TCD. Nevertheless, absence of any peak for methane or any other gas suggested that methanol does not undergo any reaction. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature Since, at 225 °C over Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, 74% yield for cyclohexanol was achieved in CTH-HDO there was a scope to improve the yield further and hence effect of reaction temperature was studied (Fig. 2 ). At 175 °C no conversion of guaiacol was seen, which can be explained based on the fact that normally CTH does not happen <170 °C. When temperature was increased to 200 °C, 50% yield of cyclohexanol along with 22% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol and 2% yield of cyclohexane was found. With further increase in temperature to 225 °C, improvement in CTH-HDO activity of catalyst was seen [cyclohexanol (74%), trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (9%), cyclohexane (5%). In order to investigate whether at higher temperature, more cyclohexanol yield is possible, reaction was carried out at 250 °C but lower yields of cyclohexanol (68%) and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (6%) were seen. However, at this temperature increase in cyclohexane (14%) formation was seen, which was understandable. Interesting observation in all these results is that reaction intermediate; trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was not completely converted into cyclohexanol. This suggests that cleavage of CO bond is a rate determining step in the CTH-HDO pathway. To achieve the best results with lower Ru content, molar ratio of substrate to surface exposed Ru metal was varied from 35,520 to 65,573 and the results are summarized in Fig. 3 . With highest S/C molar ratio of 65,573, 55% conversion with 33% yield of cyclohexanol, 5% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol with 2% yield of cyclohexane was achieved. Reaction with S/C molar ratio of 43,478 showed 91% conversion of guaiacol with 66% yield of cyclohexanol and 18% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol with 2% yield of cyclohexane. Subsequently, ratio of 35,520 was used and complete conversion with 74% yield of cyclohexanol and 9% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol along with 5% yield of cyclohexane was observed. One of the curious observations is that in non-catalytic reaction, guaiacol did not show any conversion which indicates that guaiacol is thermally stable until 225 °C. It is interesting to note here that with higher S/C molar ratio, lower mass balance was seen, which must be due to less obtainability of the active sites and thus few side reactions might be probable. However, with S/C molar ratio of 43,478, maximum mass balance was seen. This indicates that with this ratio, optimum active sites must be present as with lower S/C molar ratio of 35,520, few side reactions are possible due to availability of active sites in plenty. This is evidenced by higher formation of cyclohexane at this ratio compared to other ratios. As noticed earlier, in all the reactions, intermediate formation was perceived, which yet again underline the fact that conversion of intermediate to cyclohexanol is a rate determining step in this reaction. 3.2.3 Effect of H2 donor solvent In order to understand the role of solvent on CTH-HDO reaction, change of solvent was done and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . When reaction was carried out in IPA solvent, conversion of guaiacol reached upto 100% with formation 74% of cyclohexanol and 9% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. Although the reaction was carried out in the presence of n-propanol solvent, lower (16%) conversion of guaiacol was achieved along with lower (7%) yields of cyclohexanol and (3%) trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. As seen, n-propanol, which is a primary alcohol is less active for CTH-HDO process in comparison with IPA (secondary alcohol). This is because, IPA forms corresponding ketone, a stable form during CTH-HDO process. To prove this fact, another secondary alcohol isobutanol was tested for CTH-HDO process, and complete guaiacol conversion, with 71% yield of cyclohexanol with 12% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol were achieved. From the obtained results, it is suggested that secondary alcohol is more active for CTH-HDO process than primary alcohol. Based on the results obtained and deriving catalyst property-activity correlation, reaction mechanism for CTH of guaiacol is proposed (Fig. S4, ESI). Since achieved decent CTH-HDO activity with Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst in guaiacol conversion into cyclohexanol, reactions were carried out with other lignin derived monomers like phenol, veratrole, anisole, and eugenol under similar reaction conditions. Complete conversion of substrates was achieved in all the reactions. When phenol was used as a substrate, the yield of cyclohexanol was 90% with formation of 5% cyclohexane. CTH-HDO of anisole showed 28% cyclohexanol yield with 61% conversion and with eugenol as substrate 100% propyl eugenol yield was achieved."
9,Conclusion,"It is witnessed that Ru supported on acidic Al2O3 shows superior activity compared to supported on neutral Al2O3, which emphasizes the fact that in CTH-HDO reaction pathway, support plays crucial role. However, a difference in oxidation state distribution of Ru on both these supports may also be responsible to change in activity and this needs to be investigated further. The catalytic system is apt to show CTH-HDO activity for wide variety of substrates and thus can be generalized easily. The ultimate aim of this study to use CTH pathway instead of molecular hydrogen pathway for HDO is seen to be efficacious as respectable yields of cyclohexanol can be achieved."
