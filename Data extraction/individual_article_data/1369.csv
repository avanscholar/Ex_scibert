0,Introduction,"Organic compounds are essential for the manufacture of a great number of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and food additives which are an integral part of everyday life. Processes aiming to improve the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones are very relevant and are welcome in organic synthesis [1]. In particular the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes is essential since these products will find wide applications as intermediates in fine chemicals industry particularly for perfume manufacturing [2,3]. Oxidation of alcohols is accomplished in most of the described reports, using inorganic oxidants under stoichiometric regime. These include permanganate, [4] bromate, [5] or Cr(VI) reagents leading to large waste amounts [6]. The use of several other homogeneous systems based on transition metals – palladium, ruthenium, rhenium, copper, among others has also been reported [7]. In addition, some of the reactions need to be performed under severe conditions, employing high temperature and oxygen pressure, and in many cases these reactions are also carried out in environmentally undesired halogenated hydrocarbon solvents. These reaction mixtures may bring safety hazards (risk of explosion), which must be avoided. Given these issues, the development of environmentally benign and safer catalytic routes for oxidation of alcohols using greener oxidants (molecular O2, H2O2 or in situ generated reactive oxygen species) is a field of active research. Among the early transition-metal complexes, molybdenum(VI) complexes have functional as well as structural similarity with molybdo-enzymes and have the ability to catalyse a variety of oxidation reactions [8]. Various molybdenum organometallic complexes and oxides are known to be very good homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation/epoxidation reactions [9–12]. Crystalline titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles have been reported as one of the best photocatalyst to oxidize organic molecules in aqueous media [13–16]. However, the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes in water, photo-catalysed by TiO2, is difficult since the aldehyde is easily decomposed by sequential photocatalytic reactions that are also catalysed by the TiO2 surface. Alternatively, the selective alcohol oxidation can be successfully attained with TiO2-based catalysts, by using organic solvents instead of water. Under these conditions, the production of OH radicals as result of the reaction of water with positive holes is not possible. Therefore, using organic media, the presence of O2 is required in order to make possible the formation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) via superoxide (O2 −) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) routes. To try overcame this problem, the substitution of oxygen by a scavenger capable of reducing, by trapping, the photo-generated electrons, in the conduction band it has been reported [13]. However, under these conditions the oxidation of the organic species present in the solution still happens to some extension [17]. Aiming to improve the TiO2 catalytic selectivity and efficiency in these types of process, its combination with other transition metal oxides, like Mo oxides, it seems a promising route to achieve this goal. Following this line, in this work the combination of TiO2 nanoparticles with MoO3 is described. The preparation of TiO2/MoO3 nanocomposites was attained using a hydrothermal treatment but two distinct synthesis approaches were evaluated. After structural and morphological characterization, the samples were tested for the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol using UV–vis and visible radiation sources. After analysis of the results, it can be concluded that TiO2-MoO3 composite catalysts are very promising to be used in photo-assisted benzyl alcohol oxidation processes, presenting high selectivity in the production of benzaldehyde."
1,Experimental,"All reagents used in this work were of analytical or chemical grade and they were used as received. Commercial grade solvents were dried and deoxygenated by standard procedures, distilled under nitrogen and kept over 4 Å molecular sieves (3 Å for acetonitrile). The solutions were prepared with distilled water."
2,Nanoparticles synthesis,"2.1 Nanoparticles synthesis 2.1.1 TiO2 The TiO2 nanoparticles synthesis starts with the preparation an amorphous precursor, following a procedure previously reported [18]. A titanium trichloride solution (10 wt% in 20–30 wt% HCl) diluted in a ratio of 1:2 in standard HCl solution (37%) was used as titanium source. To this solution, a 4 M ammonia aqueous solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring, until complete precipitation of a white solid. This suspension was kept overnight at room temperature and then filtered and vigorously rinsed with deionized water, in order to remove the remaining ammonia and chloride ions. The obtained white solid (amorphous precursor) was then crystalized to produce nanocrystalline TiO2 particles. The synthesis was performed in an autoclave system using ~ 6 g of precursor in water and heated at 200 °C, during 6 h. The TiO2 particles were washed several times with water, filtered and finally dried at 60 °C, during 12 h. 2.1.2 MoO3 The MoO3 sample was prepared according to a described method in literature [19]. α-MoO3 nanoparticles were prepared using 0.325 g of MoCl5 dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of ethanol. The solution was stirred for 1 h and subsequently heated in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 180 °C overnight. After cooling until room temperature, the resulting solid was centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C. The α-MoO3 grey powder was obtained after annealing the dried solid at 450 °C for 1 h (heating rate: 1 °C min−1) under air."
3,PTM3 nanocomposite,"2.2 PTM3 nanocomposite The PTM3 nanocomposite was obtained using the TiO2 amorphous precursor as reagent in the synthesis of the MoO3 nanoparticles. During this synthesis, 0.5 g of amorphous precursor was added to the initial solution of MoCl5 and stirred for 1 h. The succeeding hydrothermal heating and annealing steps were unchanged from the original procedure. A grey powder was attained corresponding to the PTM3 nanocomposite."
4,TM3 nanocomposite,"2.3 TM3 nanocomposite Similar to the previous procedure, the TM3 nanocomposite was synthetized using the beforehand prepared TiO2 nanoparticles combined in the synthesis of MoO3 nanoparticles. The MoO3 synthesis procedure was followed, in which the TiO2 nanoparticles were added in a 2:1 M ration in relation to the initial MoCl5. The TM3 solid presented a grey-blue colour."
5,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.4 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol Two sets of experiments were performed in acetonitrile, to study the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde: using a xenon-mercury lamp, emitting in the visible and near UV range (500 W, Newport) and using a 450 W Hanovia medium-pressure mercury vapor lamp - the total irradiated energy being 40–48% in the UV range and 40–43% in the visible region. For those reactions performed using the Xe-Hg lamp, a reactor made of borosilicate glass was used; here the borosilicate glass was acting as a natural cut-off for UV radiation. For each photocatalytic experiment, 20 mg of catalyst were suspended in 100 mL of acetonitrile with 1 mL L−1 of benzyl alcohol (BA). The reaction was performed under continuous magnetic stirring conditions, with O2 bubbling. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were kept in dark conditions, under stirring, during 60 min to ensure the adsorption equilibrium. After the photocatalytic experiments, the suspensions were centrifuged at 7500 rpm to separate the photocatalysts out from the solution. The identification and quantification of benzaldehyde in solution were performed by GC–MS. Samples were taken prior to irradiation and at each hour, throughout the 4 h reaction. Yield of benzaldehyde and selectivity for benzaldehyde were calculated for each sample using the following equations: Y i e l d % = [ C BZD / ( C BA + C BZD + C BnOOH ) ] × 100 = [ C BZD / T o t a l c o n v e r s i o n ] × 100 S e l e c t i v i t y % = [ C BZD / ( C BZD + C BnOOH ) ] × 100 with C BA , C BZD , C BnOOH being the concentrations of benzyl alcohol (BA), benzaldehyde (BZD), and benzoic acid (BC), respectively."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The samples identification and structural characterization was performed by XRD using a Philips Analytical X-ray diffractometer (PW 3050/60) with automatic data acquisition, employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) working at 40 kV/30 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected in the 2θ range 10–60◦ with a 0.02◦ step size and an acquisition time of 200 s/ step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were carried out on a JEOL-700F system operating at 10–15 kV. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis of the samples was carried in the 400–4000 cm−1 wavelength range (resolution of 4 cm−1), on a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) analyzer using a Smart Diffuse Reflectance accessory. Specific surface areas were obtained by the B.E.T. method, from nitrogen (AirLiquide, 99.999%) adsorption data at − 196 °C, using a volumetric apparatus from Quantachrome mod NOVA 2200e. The samples, weighing approximately 55 mg, were previously outgassed for 2.5 h at 300 °C at a pressure below 0.133 Pa. The powder diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using an UV–vis spectrometer Shimadzu UV-2600PC equipped with an ISR 2600 Plus integrating sphere, in the 250–1400 nm wavelength range. After photocatalytic experiments, the benzyl alcohol concentrations were monitored using a Shimadzu QP2100-Plus GC/MS system with a capillary column Tecknokroma TRB-5MS, operating in the linear velocity mode. Dibutyl ether was added to the solutions before analysis and was used as an internal standard."
7,Results and discussion,"The prepared nanocomposites, TM3 and PTM3, together with the pristine TiO2 and MoO3 powders, were characterized. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of TM3 and PTM3 prepared nanocomposites. The presence of crystalline TiO2 anatase and orthorhombic MoO3 phases were identified in both nanocomposites. No peak shift was observed when compared with the XRD patterns of pristine metal oxides. Two diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 27.3° and 56.4°, corresponding to the (021) and (012) diffraction planes of orthorhombic MoO3, respectively, are present in both nanocomposites, as well as the TiO2 most intense peak at 2θ = 25.4° which confirm the presence of both oxides in TM3 and PTM3 samples. A comparative analysis of the XRD patterns of TM3 and PTM3 composites allow to conclude that having the TiO2 nanoparticles during MoO3 synthesis, instead of the amorphous precursor, let to achieve a higher crystalline structure for the TM3 nanocomposite in comparison to that of PTM3. The TM3 and PTM3 nanocomposites were further investigated by SEM, in order to analyse the morphology. For the MoO3 particles, the SEM images exhibit aggregated particles with hexagonal/circular shape and with two smooth faces (Fig. 2 c). In the case of PTM3 sample, a biphasic system composed by lumpy particles (MoO3) supporting smaller flocculate-like TiO2 particles was observed. The TiO2 nanoparticles morphology was analysed by TEM and very small spherical particles were observed (not shown), in agreement with previous reported works [3]. A higher homogeneity of the TiO2 and MoO3 particles morphology is noticeable for TM3 nanocomposite. The SEM image of this sample reveals that the particles have a sphere-like morphology and they seem to be composed by TiO2 and MoO3 agglomerates. To confirm the existence of Ti, Mo and O in the synthesized nanocomposites, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopy analysis was performed. The EDS spectra obtained for both samples (Fig. 3 ) confirms the presence of such elements. It is interesting to note that for the sample prepared using the amorphous precursor during the MoO3 synthesis, sample PTM3, the Ti/Mo ratio it seems to be considerably higher when compared to the sample obtained using the same load of TiO2 nanoparticles during MoO3 production, sample TM3. This information is in agreement with the XRD data obtained for these two samples. This lower amount of Ti together with a very homogeneous distribution of the TiO2 and MoO3 nanoparticles in the TM3 nanocomposite powder were confirmed by the EDS mapping (Fig. 4 ). The nanocomposite samples were analysed by DRIFT spectroscopy (Fig. 5 ) aiming to investigate the chemical bonding states between MoO3 and TiO2 entities. In the spectra of PTM3 and TM3 (Fig. 5), are visible some bands that can be assigned to different vibrational modes of MoO3 and TiO2. The broad peak between 424 and 860 cm−1 is ascribed to the vibrational modes of TiO2; [20] –OH group from water, adsorbed at the materials surface shows bending and stretching peaks, identified at 1631, 1614 cm−1 and at around 3200–3660 cm−1 for PTM3 and TM3, respectively. The small peak identified at around 1400 and 1380 cm−1 is attributed to some OH group’s interactions between the surface and TiO2 or MoO3, for PTM3 and TM3. In TM3 nanocomposite spectrum it is also possible to assign peaks corresponding to the vibrational modes of MoO3; peaks at 649 cm−1, 883 cm−1 and 993 cm−1 are related to Mo-O-Mo bending mode, Mo-O-Mo and Mo=O vibrations, respectively. For the PTM3 nanocomposite material these bands are observed at 974 cm−1, 740 cm−1 and 681 cm−1, respectively. In the analysis of TM3 sample spectrum, a red shift of these bands was observed, together with the existence of a new broad band at 887 cm−1, as reported by others [21]. The feature at 1230 cm−1 can be assigned to ammonium ions that are in the structure of the nanocomposite, it́s presence is due to its use in the synthesis of all the samples MoO3, TiO2, TM3 and PTM3. FTIR results show that the PTM3 and TM3 materials have a strong interaction between the two components of the samples, MoO3 and TiO2. From the results, it is possible to conclude that these materials are nanocomposites in nature which corroborates with previous results [18]. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis (B.E.T. method) was performed to evaluate the specific surface area of the PTM3 and TM3 nanocomposite materials, and the obtained values are summarized in Table 1 . Considering that TM3 and PTM3 powders are TiO2 and MoO3 containing composites, they present lower surface areas, 85 and 55 m2g−1 respectively, when compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (102 m2g−1). However, these values are higher in comparison to that of MoO3 particles (25 m2 g−1). The lower surface area observed for the PTM3 powder, when compared to TM3 should be a consequence of the TiO2 precursor compulsive crystallization (180 °C, overnight) that occurred under different experimental conditions compared to the ones used for TiO2 synthesis (200 °C, 6 h). However, both materials present higher surface area when compared to MoO3 particles, indicating that the combination of MoO3 with TiO2 can be a key step to enhance their catalytic active surface area. The nanocomposites surface area are in agreement with the SEM data. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was used to analyse the optical absorption properties of the as-prepared nanocomposite samples. After conversion of diffuse reflectance data applying the Kubelka-Munk function (fKM ), the UV–vis absorption spectra of the prepared samples are presented in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, all the samples present activity under UV and visible irradiation, with PTM3 apparently presenting the best absorption behaviour. The contribution of the optical activities of both nanocomposite constituents, TiO2 and MoO3, is visible from Fig. 6 analysis. Anticipating the use of these materials for photocatalysis under visible irradiation, the PTM3 sample can be considered a very promising material since it presents high radiation absorption in the visible range. It is also interesting that the absorption edge of this nanocomposite, (near 400 nm) that should be attributed to the TiO2 contribution, is clearly red shifted when compared to the pristine TiO2 sample. This is in agreement with the literature, reporting an absorption red shift for nanoparticles with higher dimensions [22]. The characteristic MoO3 absorption band at ca. 954 nm is present in both spectra of the nanocomposite materials, confirming the presence of such oxide. The bandgap energy for these samples was calculated using Tauc plots (not shown), [23] and the values are presented in Table 1. The Eg values obtained for TiO2 and TM3 samples are identical, 3.47 and 3.48 eV, respectively. The reddest shift was obtained for the PTM3 nanocomposite with an energy value of 3.32 eV."
8,Selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.1 Selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposites PTM3 and TM3 was examined for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) under visible light irradiation. Pristine TiO2 and MoO3 particles were also tested, for comparison. The outcome of the BA photocatalytic oxidation might result in several side products besides benzaldehyde (BZD), such as benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) or tert-butyl benzoate (C6H5COOC(CH3)3). The presence of such products, even in vestigial amounts, usually less than 1% in concentration, have been reported in benzyl alcohol oxidation processes as by-products and/or they have also been detected in the starting alcoholic solution [24]. Nevertheless, all products detected after the photo-oxidation reaction were taken into account when calculating the yield and selectivity."
9,Simulated solar light (visible light),"3.2 Simulated solar light (visible light) Before any experimental work using the as-prepared catalysts, the BA photolysis was performed and made proof that the simulated solar light used was not energetic enough to promote the alcohol conversion after 240 min, with insignificant quantities of benzaldehyde being obtained after that time (less than 2%). In addition, analogous experiments were carried out using the catalysts in dark conditions and similar results were achieved, showing that light, O2 and a catalyst are crucial to the photo-oxidative process. The activity of all prepared materials in the photo-oxidation of BA into benzaldehyde is presented in Fig. 7 . The plots show that all the samples are catalytic for this process and for each sample the yield of BZD increases with the irradiation time. In what concerns the MoO3 material, the reaction yield vs irradiation time was far lower when compared with the other tested catalysts, yielding only 7% of BZD after 240 min (Table 2 ). However, the selectivity for the oxidation product after 240 min of reaction was high towards benzaldehyde production (95%). For the nanocrystalline TiO2 the photocatalytic performance attained was, in the same period of time, 38% yield corresponding to 98% of selectivity. The analysis of the performance of both PTM3 and TM3 nanocomposites showed that under a reaction temperature of 25 °C and visible light radiation, the TM3 exhibits the highest photo-activity for the selective oxidation of BA. Under these conditions, the yield of BZD reaches 45% which is higher than that of the parent anatase TiO2 and with an excellent selectivity of 99%, indicating that this material can effectively be used to catalyse the alcohol oxidation. The obtained yield (45%) of BZD using the TM3 sample was 20% higher than that obtained for anatase TiO2, which is of relevance. Although and in terms of selectivity the observed difference was not significant being both of them very selective towards that product. Despite this, the reaction rate using this catalyst is much lower in the first 120 min than that found for TiO2 (Fig. 7). After this period, the reaction boosts and its rate dramatically increase. The BZD yield progression, using PTM3 as catalyst, poorly increases when compared to TM3 or TiO2. It must be noticed that by GC–MS analysis, benzaldehyde was detected as virtually the sole product of this photo-assisted catalytic process, regardless of which sample was used as catalyst, since the detected amount of benzoic acid was less than 1%. The overall selectivity was always between 95% and 99%, being the lowest value for the MoO3 catalysed reaction. The differences in the samples morphology, namely in the nanocomposites, had implications in the enhanced surface properties of these materials when compared to the pristine oxides, affecting the overall selectivity and reaction yield. The kinetic of benzyl alcohol photo-oxidation was analysed; it is a first order reaction and the constant rate was calculated for all the tested catalytic runs (Table 3 ). It is possible to observe that the higher constant rate was obtained when the TiO2 nanomaterial was used as photocatalyst, reaching a value of 0.146 min−1. Although, the PTM3 and TM3 nanocomposites reached high conversions after 4 h irradiation time, they achieve first order rate constants of 0.034 min−1 and 0.060 min−1, respectively. The MoO3 material was the catalyst presenting the lower first order constant rate, 0.012 min−1."
10,UV–vis light,"3.3 UV–vis light To better understand the photocatalytic assisted process of BA aerobic oxidation, the catalytic performance of the PTM3 and TM3 composite materials was also studied using a more energetic, UV–vis light source (medium pressure Hg lamp) as described in the experimental section. The profile of BA photocatalytic oxidation, under the presence of TM3 and PTM3 samples is presented in Fig. 8 . The yield and selectivity obtained, concerning the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) reaction, are summarized in Table 4 . Under a reaction temperature of 25 °C and UV–vis radiation, PTM3 catalyst exhibits the highest photo-activity for the selective oxidation of BA, when compared to TM3 powder. After 240 min of irradiation and using PTM3 as catalyst, the conversion of BA into BZD reaches 50% which is about 2.5 times higher than the conversion achieved by the same catalyst but under visible light. These results are in agreement with the ones obtained by XRD and EDS that indicates the PTM3 sample as the nanocomposite with the higher level of TiO2, a semiconductor material with recognized activity under UV radiation. In what concerns the selectivity, the obtained results are very promising with benzaldehyde being the major product obtained for all the catalysed experiments. The TM3 catalyst exhibits a lower conversion for BA oxidation, achieving only 40% conversion after 240 min of irradiation; this result is possibly due to the lower activation of this catalyst under UV–vis radiation. The first order constant rate obtained for the PTM3 and TM3 photocatalytic assisted processes, when UV–vis light was used, were 0.21 min−1 and 0.16 mim−1 respectively. These values are higher than the calculated for the TiO2 photocatalyst, under visible light conditions. To better evaluate the catalytic performance of the PTM3 and TM3 nanocomposite materials, in Fig. 9 is shown the benzaldehyde yields obtained using visible and UV–vis light conditions. As can be seen, the TM3 catalyst presents enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible radiation, concerning the benzaldehyde production, contrasting with PTM3 that possess higher activity under UV–vis radiation. Once again, these results are in accordance with the ones obtained by XRD, SEM and EDS, namely the relative amount of each oxide, TiO2 and MoO3, in the two composite samples, TM3 and PTM3. Supported on the above results and on reported works, [25–29] a proposal for the mechanism of TiO2-MoO3 light-activation and for benzyl alcohol photo-assisted oxidation is presented in Fig. 10 . After activation by visible light, pairs of photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+ ) are formed in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of MoO3, respectively. Considering the relative energy band positions, these h+ would be rapidly transfer to the TiO2 VB. The photo-generated e− will be responsible for the reduction of adsorbed oxygen and consequently for the production of O2 − radicals. In accordance with literature [25–29], both O2 − and holes are the species responsible for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Simultaneously, and through the combination of TiO2 and MoO3 particles, the photogenerated charge carriers recombination is reduced and consequently the photocatalytic activity of the composite material is greatly improved. The photocatalytic performance achieved by the synthesised nanocomposites in this work was compared with others described in literature. Based on a literature survey, Table 5 collects data from the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol experiments, using distinct materials as catalysts. This includes different materials resulting from the combination of TiO2 with e.g. CdS, Ru and Mo. As can be seen from data presented in Table 5, in general all the catalysts evaluated showed catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation and good to excellent selectivity for the desired product, benzaldehyde. However, selectivity to benzaldehyde production can be an issue since other non-desired products can also be obtained. For instance, Zhang et al. reported a CdS-TiO2-0.24 material (entry 7) that had limited efficiency in benzyl alcohol oxidation [26]. That material reached only 38% conversion and the benzaldehyde selectivity was only ~ 90%. The TM3 catalyst reported in this work (Table 5, entry 11) shows a conversion of 45% and a selectivity of 99%, demonstrated to be very selective for the desired product. In a different study, 62% conversion was achieved in 1 h of reaction (Table 5, entry 8) using a CdS-MTA material as catalyst [27]. Nevertheless, the amount of catalyst required is 2.25 times higher (45 mg) than that used in this work, demonstrating that it is less active than the one described in this work. For the same substrate, benzyl alcohol, the TiO2 catalysts containing Ru (Table 5, entries 4 and 5) report higher conversions, 58 and 72% respectively, but for longer reaction times, 5 h [30]. Despite the fact that both systems reached higher substrate conversions, the selectivity for benzaldehyde production was worse, 75 and 81% for Ru/P25 and Ru/TiO2, respectively, compared with the values obtained in this work. In a general way, the nanocomposite materials described in this work show higher selectivity and lower toxicity, being excellent candidates to be used for the photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, distinct MoO3-TiO2 crystalline nanocomposite materials were successful prepared using two distinct experimental procedures: TM3 was obtained by producing MoO3 in the presence of previously prepared TiO2 nanoparticles; for PTM3 production, both MoO3 and TiO2 components were synthesized at the same time using an on-pot methodology. The identification of both TiO2 and MoO3 crystalline phases, in the two composite materials, was confirmed by XRD data. The morphological characterization indicates that the TM3 nanocomposite sample is composed of TiO2 and MoO3 small agglomerates. A higher level of homogeneity was observed for this sample, with both TiO2 and MoO3 nanoparticles presenting quasi spherical morphology. In the case of PTM3 sample, a biphasic system composed by lumpy particles (MoO3) supporting smaller flocculate-like TiO2 particles was observed. After optical characterization, the samples were tested for the photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction, under visible and UV–vis radiation. The results show that the best catalyst, concerning yield and selectivity on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol through benzaldehyde production, was TM3 under visible radiation, and PTM3 under UV–visible light. It is also possible to say that the nanocomposite materials PTM3 and TM3 described in this work show higher selectivity for benzaldehyde than other materials described in the literature, being excellent candidates for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
