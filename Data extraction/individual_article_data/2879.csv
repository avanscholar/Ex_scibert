0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production by fermentation using waste or wastewater is a promising way of economical and sustainable energy source generation. Although biohydrogen production in a pilot-scale has been conducted by mixed bacteria (Ren et al., 2006), the optimal condition, especially the metabolic pathway for hydrogen production have not yet been fully understood. It is known that hydrogen is not produced in propionate fermentation pathway. Conversely, bacterial butyrate and ethanol fermentations all have the potential of hydrogen production (Ren et al., 1997, 2007a). Consequently, various studies have been carried out to investigate the characteristics and cultivation conditions of the two kinds of pure hydrogen producing bacteria (Bisaillon et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2005; Kotay and Das, 2007; Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2006, 2008). The optimization of fermentation conditions, particularly nutritional and environmental parameters are very important. The statistical methods are believed to be effective and powerful approach for screening key factors rapidly from a multivariable system to optimize fermentation conditions and have been extensively used recently (Majumder and Goyal, 2007; Tanyildizi et al., 2005). However, the statistical design has been reported in the study of hydrogen production only recently. To our knowledge, researches on hydrogen production were only very few and they were all related to the butyrate fermentation hydrogen producing bacteria. Other than nutrient composition, substrate concentration was found to be one of the most important factors affecting hydrogen production (Fan et al., 2004; Lay et al., 1999; Pan et al., 2008; Van Ginkel et al., 2001). Well, as an important kind of hydrogen producer, the ethanol fermentation hydrogen producing bacteria are quite necessary to be studied. However, biohydrogen research using pure strain of Ethanoligenens harbinense sp., which is recognized as an effective hydrogen producer by ethanol fermentation, is surprisingly rare till now. In the present study, the effects of nutrition components were evaluated using Plackett–Burman design, and a suitable medium by Box–Behnken design using response surface methodology was also employed for maximizing hydrogen production by ethanol fermentation hydrogen producing bacteria E. harbinense B49."
1,Methods,
2,Strain and inoculation preparation,"2.1 Strain and inoculation preparation Hydrogen producing strain E. harbinense B49 (AF481148 in EMBL), was obtained from Harbin Institute of Technology, China which was stored at 4 oC and sub-cultured monthly with glucose-based fresh medium at 35 oC. The basal medium contained (g/L): glucose, 10; polypepton, 4; beef extract, 2; yeast extract, 1; NaCl, 2; K2HPO4, 1.5; MgCl2 ·6H2O, 0.6; FeSO4 ·7H2O, 0.2; l-cysteine, 0.5 was used as the basal medium. Ten milli litre trace element solution and 10ml vitamin solution were also added to each one liter of the basal medium to maintain the necessary nutrient requirement of the cells. The trace element solution contained (g/L): MnSO4 ·7H2O, 0.01; ZnSO4 ·7H2O, 0.05; H3BO3, 0.01; N(CH2COOH)3, 4.5; CaCl2 ·2H2O, 0.01; Na2MoO4, 0.01; CoCl2 ·6H2O, 0.2; AlK(SO4)2, 0.01. The composition of vitamin solution was (g/L): riboflavin, 0.025; citric acid, 0.02; folic acid, 0.01; para-aminobenzoic acid, 0.01."
3,Batch reactor and fermentation,"2.2 Batch reactor and fermentation All experiments were carried out in 150ml Erlenmeyer flasks as batch reactors described before (Ren et al., 2008). The reactor contained 90ml of basal medium and 10ml of the prepared bacteria to make a final media volume of 100ml under a mesophilic condition of 35 oC. The batch reactor was run for 48h at 120rpm to provide release of biogas and better contact between substrate and bacteria. The flask was flushed with nitrogen gas before the startup. All the batch experiment was conducted under anaerobic conditions with the anaerobic culture technique proposed by Bryant (1972)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The H2 was analyzed by a SP-2305 gas chromatograph (Lunan Instrument Factory, Shandong, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m stainless column packed with Porapak TDS-01 (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures at the column oven and the detector were both 150 oC. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 70ml/min (Ren et al., 2008). The liquid samples were centrifuged at 4000rpm for 15min, and then the supernatants were filtered through 0.45μg cellulose acetate membranes for analysis of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol. The concentrations of the VFAs and alcohol were determined using a model GC-122 gas chromatograph (Shanghai Analytical Apparatus Corporation, China) with a flame ionization detector and a 2m stainless (5mm inside diameter) column packed with Porapak GDX-103 (60/80mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the column and the detector were 220, 190 and 220 oC, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 50ml/min (Ren et al., 2008). Glucose concentration was determined by the method described before (Wang et al., 2007)."
5,Experiment design and statistical analysis,"2.4 Experiment design and statistical analysis 2.4.1 Plackett–Burman design The Plackett–Burman design, an effective technique for medium-component optimization (Li et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008), was used to select factors that significantly influenced hydrogen production. The technique is based on the first-order polynomial model: (1) Y = β 0 + Σ β i x i where Y is the response (hydrogen production rate), β 0 is the model intercept and βi is the linear coefficient and xi is the level of the independent variable. Six nutrients, FeSO4 ·7H2O, MgCl2, NaCl, K2HPO4, ZnSO4 ·7H2O and CaCl2 ·2H2O, were examined to investigate the key ingredients significantly affecting the production of hydrogen. Based on Plackett–Burman design, each factor was prepared in two levels: −1 for low level and +1 for high level. A center point was run to evaluate the linear and curvature effects of the variables (Plackett and Burman, 1946). Table 1 illustrates the experimental design with six factors as well as the response, whereas, Table 2 shows the design matrix. In the present study, six assigned variables were screened in twelve experimental runs in addition with three runs at their center points. Hydrogen production was carried out in triplicate and the average value was taken as the response. The factors significant at 95% level (P <0.05) were considered to have significant effect on hydrogen production and thus used for further optimization by response surface methodology (RSM). 2.4.2 Box–Behnken design RSM was used to optimize the screened variables for enhanced hydrogen production based on Box–Behnken design (Box and Behnkin, 1960). For statistical calculations, the relation between the coded values and real values are described as follows: (2) Xi = ( A i - A 0 ) / Δ A where Xi is a coded value of the variable, Ai is the real value of variable, A 0 is the real value of the Ai at the center point; and A is the step change of variable. The levels of the variables and the experimental design are shown in Table 3 . In this study, the experiment design contains 17 trials and the value of the responses was the mean of triplications. The second-order polynomial coefficients were calculated and analyzed using the “Design Expert” software (Version 7.1.4.0, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) statistical package. Statistical analysis of the model was performed to evaluate the analysis of variance (ANOVA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Evaluation of important nutrient salts affecting hydrogen production,"3.1 Evaluation of important nutrient salts affecting hydrogen production Nutrients conditions have played an important role in the production of hydrogen. Thus, the relative significance of six nutrient salts, FeSO4 ·7H2O, MgCl2, NaCl, K2HPO4, ZnSO4 ·7H2O and CaCl2 ·2H2O, was investigated by Plackett–Burman design. As seen in Table 2, the main effect of each variable upon hydrogen production rate (Ps ) was estimated as the difference between both averages of measurement made at the high level (+1) and the low level (−1) of that factor. Fe2+, Mg2+, K2HPO4 and Ca2+ displayed a positive effect for hydrogen production, whereas NaCl and Zn2+ had a negative effect on hydrogen production. The variables with confidence levels greater than 95% were considered as influencing hydrogen production significantly. Fe2+ and Mg2+ were significant at above 99.9% confidence levels for hydrogen production. K2HPO4 and Ca2+ were insignificant with positive coefficients for hydrogen production. Whereas, NaCl and Zn2+ were found insignificant with negative coefficients for hydrogen production, which would not be included in the next optimization experiments. K2HPO4 and Ca2+ were only chosen in the low level for further optimization by Box–Behnken design."
8,Optimization of the key culture conditions for hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49,"3.2 Optimization of the key culture conditions for hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 The optimal level of the key factors (glucose, Fe2+ and Mg2+) and the effect of their interactions on hydrogen production were further explored by the Box–Behnken design of RSM. By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, the following second-order polynomial equation was established to explain the hydrogen production: (3) Y = 2.13 + 0.094 X 1 + 0.17 X 2 + 6.250 E - 003 X 3 - 0.15 X 1 2 - 0.13 X 2 2 - 0.052 X 3 2 + 0.040 X 1 X 2 - 0.047 X 1 X 3 + 0.020 X 2 X 3 where, Y is the predicted hydrogen production rate; X 1, X 2 and X 3 are the coded values of glucose, Fe2+ and Mg2+, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the significance of the fit of the second-order polynomial equation for the experimental data as shown in Table 4 . The Model F-value of 17.63 implies the model is significant. There is only a 0.05% chance that a “Model F-value” could occur due to noise. The P-values are used as a tool to check significance of each variables, which also indicate the interaction strength between each independent variable (Liu et al., 2003). The smaller P-values, the bigger the significance of the corresponding variable (Muralidhar et al., 2001). P-values in this study less than 0.0500 indicate model terms are significant. In this case coded values X 2, X 3, X 2 2 , X 3 2 are significant model terms. P-values greater than 0.1000 indicate the model terms are not significant. Here the R 2 value was 95.77%, which could explain 95.77% variability of the response. It indicates a good agreement between experimental and predicted values and implies that the mathematical model is very reliable for hydrogen production in the present study. From the Eq. (3), the optimal coded values of X 1, X 2 and X 3 were estimated to be 0.16, 0.31 and 0.68, respectively. Correspondingly, the maximum point derived from the model was 15.81g/L of glucose, 165.64mg/L of Fe2+ and 687.77mg/L of Mg2+, respectively. The maximum predicted value of Ps was 2.21molH2/molglucose. Response surface plots and contour plots are shown in Figs. 1–3 , which depict the interactions between two variables by keeping the other variables at their zero levels for hydrogen production. Tanyildizi et al. (2005) showed that the maximum predicted value is indicated by the surface confined in the smallest ellipse in the contour diagram. Previous studies also reported that elliptical contours are obtained when there is a perfect interaction between the independent variables (Muralidhar et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2008). As analysis from the present study, the model predicted a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.21mol/molglucose, under the condition of the respective glucose, Fe2+ and Mg2+ were 14.57g/L, 177.28mg/L and 691.98mg/L and by keeping the other variables at their zero level."
9,Validation of the models,"3.3 Validation of the models According to the results of the statistical design, the optimized medium was prepared as follows: 14.5g/Lglucose, 180mg/L Fe2+, 690mg/L Mg2+, 1.0mg/L Ca2+, 0.5g/L K2HPO4, 4g/L polypepton, 2g/L beef extract, 1g/L yeast extract, 0.5g/L l-cysteine. The initial pH was 6.0, and the temperature was 35±1 oC. Under the above optimized condition, the maximum production of hydrogen based on glucose consumption was estimated as 2.20mol/molglucose. The main dissolved metabolic products were ethanol and acetate and the glucose uptake rate was all 100% in triplicate tests. The excellent correlation between predicted and measured values verifies the model validation and existence of an optimal point. The RSM designs applied in the present investigation have been successfully applied in many recent biotechnological researches including bio-hydrogen production (Lotfy, 2007; Jo et al., 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, no single report was obtained on hydrogen production optimization by ethanol-type fermentation. Moreover, the maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.20mol/molglucose achieved by the verified study was much higher than the results obtained by other investigators (Xing et al., 2008)."
10,Conclusion,"Plackett–Burman design and Box–Behnken design were adopted to screen the key factors and identify optimal culture conditions which enhanced hydrogen production by E. harbinense B49. The results suggested that statistical design methodology offers an efficient and feasible approach for hydrogen production medium optimization. The proposed model equation illustrated the quantitative effect of variables and also the interactions among the variables on hydrogen production. Under the optimal medium condition (glucose 14.5g/L, Fe2+ 180mg/L and Mg2+ 690mg/L), the experimental hydrogen production of 2.20mol/molglucose perfectly matched with the predicted value of 2.21mol/molglucose, which verified the practicability of this optimum strategy."
