0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from hydrogenation of carbon monoxide has drawn much attention due to its potential application as a promising route for the production of clean fuels and petrochemical feed stocks from coal, natural gas and biomass [1,2]. Several catalytic systems for HAS, including the MoS2-based catalysts, modified methanol synthesis catalysts and modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts were developed [3–5]. Due to the strong ability to promote carbon chain growth for the Fischer–Tropsch elements, copper-modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts have been extensively studied in recent years [6,7]. Compared to the Cu–Co based catalyst, the Fe–Cu based catalyst is more favorable for converting the syngas with low H2/CO ratio derived from coal or biomass due to its higher water–gas shift activity, lower cost, and favorable engineering characteristics [8,9]. There are unabated attempts for further investigation to elucidate the factors that affect the catalytic performance of iron–copper catalyst and improve the potential capability for application. Most of these attempts have been focused on the addition of chemical promoters such as K and Na, as well as the structure promoters, namely SiO2 and Al2O3 [10–12]. It is generally accepted that manganese has obvious influence on the catalytic performances over the iron-based catalysts [13,14]. It has been reported that manganese could be acted as an electronic promoter, promoting the dissociation of carbon monoxide and shifting the products towards heavy hydrocarbons [15]. On the other hand, the Mn promoter has some structural promoted function, which plays an important role in the catalytic performances [16,17]. The strong metal–support interaction of the manganese species influences the physical and chemical properties of the iron-based catalyst, promoting the transformation of syngas into light olefins [18]. Recently, Ngo et al. [19] investigated the influence of manganese on the iron-promoted Rh/TiO2 catalysts for alcohols synthesis, and found that the addition of manganese decreased the catalytic activity and improved the ethanol selectivity. Zhang et al. [20] studied the Mn/Ni-modified Mo2S-based catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis, and suggested that adding Mn dispersed well the Ni element in the catalyst, promoting the formation of C 2 + alcohols. However, the effect of manganese on the HAS performances over the iron–copper based catalysts is rarely studied systematically [21]. The present work focuses mainly on the impact of manganese promoter and reaction conditions on the HAS performances over the co-precipitated Fe–Cu catalysts. Because of complex change in phase compositions, several techniques including N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction/desorption of hydrogen (H2-TPR/TPD) are used together to characterize the catalyst samples."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Mn-modified FeCuZnO catalysts were prepared by a conventional co-precipitation method. Typically, a solution containing Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Mn(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 in the required ratio was added to a continuously stirred tanker together with a sodium carbonate solution. The precipitation temperature and pH value were maintained at 80±1°C and 8±0.1, respectively. After aging for 2h, the precipitate was filtered, washed completely with de-ionized water, and dried in air at 120°C for 12h, and then calcined at 450°C for 3h. The compositions of these catalysts are as follows: Fe:Cu:Mn:Zn=0.15:1:(0,0.5,1,2):1 (molar ratio), which are labeled as FeCuZnO, FeCuMn0.5ZnO, FeCuMn1.0ZnO, and FeCuMn2.0ZnO, respectively. In addition, the FeMnZnO catalyst was prepared with the same method as above, and the molar ratio of Fe:Mn:Zn is 0.15:1:1."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of the catalysts were measured by N2 physisorption at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instruments. The samples were degassed under vacuum at 120°C for 6h prior to measurement. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the catalyst samples were measured on a D/max-RA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with CuKα radiation (λ =0.154nm) operated at 40kV and 100mA. Temperature program reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) was carried out in a U-tube quartz reactor with a hydrogen–argon mixture (containing 5 vol.% of hydrogen) as the reductive gas. The samples (50mg) were flushed with an argon flow of 50ml/min at 120°C to remove water and then reduced in a flow of reductive gas at a rate of 10°C/min with a programmable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The effluent gas was passed through a cold trap placed before TCD in order to remove water from the exit stream of the reactor. Temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (H2-TPD) was performed in a U-tube quartz reactor equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using Ar as the carrier gas. The sample loading was 200mg. The gas flow rate was 50ml/min and the heating rate was 10°C/min. The catalyst samples were reduced in 5% H2/95% Ar (volume ratio) at 300°C and 0.10MPa for 12h. After pretreatment the samples were cooled in the carrier gas to 50°C. In the subsequent steps, hydrogen adsorption on catalysts was performed for 30min, and then the samples were purged by Ar for 30min to remove weakly adsorbed species. After this step, H2-TPD was carried out while the temperature was increased to 800°C."
4,Catalyst pretreatment and testing,"2.3 Catalyst pretreatment and testing The higher alcohols synthesis tests were conducted in a fixed-bed, stainless flow microreactor. All catalysts were reduced for 12h in pure hydrogen at 300°C and atmospheric pressure. A steady gas flow rate of 50ml/min was maintained through the whole activation process. After on-line activation described above and cooling to 180°C, syngas was introduced into reactor, followed by a rise of reaction temperature with a rate of 2°C/min. All synthesis reaction was employed at the designed temperature and pressure with 6000h−1 and the H2/CO ratio of 2.0. Both gaseous and liquid products were analyzed off-line by gas chromatographs. H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were determined by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a TDX-101 column. The water and methanol in liquids were also detected by TCD with a GDX-401 column. The alcohols and hydrocarbons were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) with a Porapack-Q column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 BET surface area The textural properties of the fresh samples are listed in Table 1 . The BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of the FeCuZnO catalyst is 57.95m2/g, 0.21cm3/g, and 13.81nm, respectively. In contrast, the FeMnZnO catalyst presents a slight increase in BET surface area, indicating that the Mn is more easily to facilitate the dispersion of the catalyst particles compared to the copper [22]. As the manganese is added gradually into the FeCuZnO catalysts, the BET surface area increases while the pore diameter presents a decreasing trend, which further validates the well dispersion effect of Mn promoter on the metal species [20]. With further increase in Mn content the BET surface area begin to decrease, which may be attributed to the formation of more Fe–Mn–O solid solution, blocking the pores of the particle network and decreasing the BET surface area. 3.1.2 Temperature program reduction The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . One main peak at about 450°C is presented in the TPR profiles for the FeMnZnO catalyst. It is known that the reduction peaks of Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 →Fe in the pure Fe2O3 are showed at around 215–280°C and 605°C, respectively [23]. Therefore, the increase of reduction temperature for Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 may be attributed to the formation of Fe–Mn–O solid solution, which strengthens the interaction between the iron and manganese species, restraining the reduction of iron oxide. For the FeCuZnO catalyst both one main peak and a shoulder are observed at about 160–300°C, which may be attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 and CuO→Cu, respectively. With gradual addition of manganese in the Fe–Cu based catalysts, the position of the reduction peak of Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 shifts towards higher temperature, further validating the enhancement between the iron and manganese species because of the formation of more Fe–Mn–O solid solution. 3.1.3 Temperature program desorption Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPD profiles of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2, there are several peaks in the TPD profiles. A small peak at 160–200°C and an intense peak at about 400°C present in all of the profiles, except for the FeMnZnO catalyst, which presents an intense peak at about 380°C. Only one peak showed on the FeMnZnO catalyst indicates that only one type of adsorbing species could exist over the catalyst. Due to easy combination of the iron and manganese, it is possible that the peak at about 380°C is attributed to the desorption of hydrogen on the surface of Fe–Mn–O solid solution [14]. For the Fe–Cu based catalysts, the low desorption temperature at 160–200°C may be attributed to the desorption of weak hydrogen adsorbing species, and the peak at higher temperature could be attributed to the desorption of strong hydrogen adsorbing species [24]. The amount of adsorbed hydrogen increases with increasing Mn concentration, implying that incorporation of manganese facilitates the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface layers. This is in agreement with the results of Li et al. [25]. They suggested that the addition of manganese in the Cu–Zn–Al catalyst enhanced the hydrogen adsorption capacity and increased the amounts of adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst. 3.1.4 XRD The XRD patterns of the fresh and used catalysts are showed in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. From Fig. 3 it can be found that the XRD patterns of the FeMnZnO catalyst show the mainly diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 29.6°, 33.4°, 36.4°, and 61.1°, all of which are the characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe1− x Mn x O4 [16]. This indicates that the manganese promoter is easily combined with iron oxide to form the Fe–Mn–O solid solution, which is consistent with the BET and TPR results. For the FeCuZnO catalyst, several diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ values of 35.5°, 38.8°, 48.5°, 66.2° and 31.7°, 56.6°, 62.9°, 68.1° as well as 36.2° correspond to CuO, ZnO and Fe2O3, respectively. Compared to the intensity of diffraction peaks in the FeCuZnO catalyst, the diffraction peaks of Fe–Mn–O solid solution in the FeMnZnO catalyst are smaller, implying that the iron species are well dispersed by the manganese promoter. This may be attributed to the formation of Fe1− x Mn x O4, helping to stabilize the small crystallites from sintering during the high-temperature calcination process [26]. With increasing Mn content in the Fe–Cu based catalysts the intensity of diffraction peaks of both the iron and copper species presents a decreasing trend, further validating the well dispersion effect of Mn. After reaction phase compositions in all of the catalyst samples take place obvious changes. From Fig. 4 it can be found that some new diffraction peaks in the used Fe–Cu catalysts appeared at 2θ values of 30.0°, 35.4°, 56.8°, 62.8° and 50.5°, 74.2°, which can be ascribed to Fe3O4 and Cu, respectively. In addition, an intense peak appears at about 43.4°, which may be attributed to the formation of iron carbides [27]. The peak intensity of Fe3O4 in the FeMnZnO catalyst is lower than that in the FeCuZnO catalyst, which may be attributed to the strong interaction of Fe–Mn, restraining the reduction of iron oxide and decreasing the amount of magnetite formed. For the Mn-modified Fe–Cu based catalysts, the peak intensity of Fe3O4 formed is higher than that in the FeMnZnO catalyst, which could be stemmed from the strong hydrogen adsorption capacity of copper [28], promoting the reduction of Fe–Mn–O solid solution. Additionally, the intensities of all of the diffraction peaks present a decreasing trend with increasing Mn content, indicating that all of the Fe3O4, iron carbides and Cu formed during reaction are well dispersed in higher Mn concentration."
7,HAS performances,"3.2 HAS performances Higher alcohols synthesis performances of the Mn-modified FeCuZnO catalysts were measured under reaction conditions of 260°C, 4.0MPa, 6000h−1 and H2/CO=2 (see Table 2 ). As shown in Table 2, the FeMnZnO catalyst produces a large number of hydrocarbons (73%), while the CuMnZnO catalyst produces mainly methanol (over 94%), indicating that the iron-based catalyst and copper-based catalyst provide the active sites for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis, respectively [8]. Both the alcohols and hydrocarbons are produced for the Fe–Cu based catalysts, implying that the synergistic effect between the iron and copper species could be existed, promoting the formation of higher alcohols products. In addition, the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation increases gradually with the increase of manganese concentration in the Fe–Cu based catalysts. The CO conversion increases from 21.6% to 26.4% as the Mn/Cu ratio increases from 0 to 1. Subsequently, the CO conversion decreased to 16.2% when the Mn/Cu ratio increases continually to 2. It was reported that incorporation of manganese promoted chemically or electronically the active iron surface of iron-based catalysts, increasing the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation [23,15]. Herranz et al. [29] suggested that the addition of Mn promoter in the iron-based catalyst promoted the formation of active sites. The results in the present study indicates that incorporation of Mn in the Fe–Cu based catalysts promotes the formation of Fe–Mn–O solid solution, which facilitates the dispersion of both the iron and copper species and increases the BET surface area, resulting in the formation of more active sites for CO hydrogenation. Accompanied with further increase in Mn content the amount of Fe–Mn–O solid solution formed increases gradually, which restraines the reduction of iron oxide and reduces the BET surface area, leading probably to the decrease of active sites for higher alcohols synthesis. Fig. 5 shows the detailed product distribution of alcohols and hydrocarbons. From Fig. 5a, it can be found that with the increase of manganese concentration in the Fe–Cu based catalysts, the amounts of methanol produced decrease gradually while that of C 2 + OH products present an increasing trend. The ratio of C 2 + OH /C1OH (showed in Table 2) increased from 1.56 to 1.95 with the ratio of Mn/Cu increased from 0.5 to 2. This indicates that increasing Mn concentration in the Fe–Cu based catalysts facilitates the product distribution shifting towards C 2 + OH . In addition, the increase in Mn content promotes the formation of heavier molecular weight hydrocarbons (Fig. 5b). Zhang et al. [20] investigated the Mn-modified Ni–MoS2 catalysts and found that adding manganese promoted the dispersion of nickel element, facilitating CO insertion on the catalyst and enhancing the selectivity to C 2 + OH . The results of Xu et al. [30] showed that the increase of manganese concentration in the CuFeZrO2 catalysts promoted the formation of C 2 + OH products. According to the XRD results, both the iron and copper species are well dispersed in higher Mn concentration during reaction. It is possible that the synergistic effect of Fe–Cu is enhanced in higher manganese content, promoting the formation of higher alcohols. In addition, manganese is known to be an important promoter for improving the yield of heavier molecular weight hydrocarbons [31]. Therefore, increasing Mn concentration plays an important role in restraining the selectivity of methane and enhancing the selectivity of higher alcohols and hydrocarbons. The Anderson–Schulz–Flory (A–S–F) plots (logarithm of mass fraction vs. carbon number) for the distribution of alcohols over the Mn-modified Cu–Fe based catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . Similar to the Zn–Mn promoted Cu–Fe based catalyst [32], the carbon number distributions of alcohols over the Mn-modified Cu–Fe based catalysts follow excellent A–S–F plots. The chain growth probability (α) calculated over the FeCuZnO catalyst is 0.23, which is lower than the value of α over the Mn-modified Cu–Fe based catalysts, indicating that adding manganese promoter promotes the chain growth probability. This is consistent with the results of product distribution. 3.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature and pressure Effect of reaction temperature on the HAS performances over the Mn-modified Fe–Cu based catalyst is further investigated. From Fig. 7 a, it can be found that CO conversion presents a monotonically increasing trend with the increase of temperature. Higher alcohols space time yield (STY) increased gradually from 250 to 270°C. As the temperature raises beyond 270°C, the STY of higher alcohols begin to decrease. It can be observed from Fig. 7b that the selectivity of total alcohols decreases gradually with increasing temperature, while the contrary trend is found for C 2 + OH /C1OH molar ratio. The ratio of C 2 + OH /C1OH increases gradually from 0.76 to 1.98 with the increase of temperature from 250 to 280°C, indicating that increasing temperature facilitates the formation of higher alcohols [33]. The HAS performances of the catalyst under different reaction pressures are shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8a, CO conversion and total alcohols formation rate increase monotonically with increasing pressure. It is also noted from Fig. 8b that with the increase of pressure the selectivity of total alcohols and molar ratio of C 2 + OH /C1OH present an increasing trend. Increasing pressure facilitates the reaction of CO+2H2 →CH3OH shifting towards the right hand side, further promoting the formation of higher alcohols [34]. 3.2.2 The reaction mechanism for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas The reaction mechanism for mixed alcohols synthesis over the Cu–Fe based catalysts is similar to that over the Co based and Rh-based catalysts [35]. For the Mn-modified Cu–Fe based catalyst, copper is known to be the major element for mixed alcohol synthesis, facilitating the dissociative chemisorption of H2 and the associative adsorption of CO. Iron elements, especially for iron carbides are the active sites of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, serving as the dissociative adsorption of CO and the associative adsorption of H2 [36]. Therefore, the production of higher alcohols requires the synergetic functioning of iron and copper. The reaction mechanism scheme for mixed alcohols synthesis from syngas over the Mn-modified Cu–Fe based catalyst is shown in Fig. 9 , where * represents a vacant site and * R or R * indicates a molecule adsorbed on a site. The dissociation of CO* and association of H2 on the surface of active iron species result in the formation of *CH x , which is further hydrogenated to form CH4. The dissociation of H2 and association of CO* on the surface of active copper sites induce the formation of methanol. CO* molecular moves to an adsorbed *CH x alkyl group and inserts between iron species and the alkyl group to form ethanol via the hydrogenation reaction. The carbon-chain growth of *CH x group leads to the formation of alkyl group (*C n H z ), which is further hydrogenated to form the olefin and paraffin products. The insertion of CO* into the *C n H z species and further hydrogenation results in the formation of mixed alcohols [36]."
8,Conclusions,"Incorporation of manganese into the co-precipitated Fe–Cu catalysts has significant influence on the microstructure and the performance for higher alcohols synthesis. Adding manganese facilitated the formation of Fe–Mn–O solid solution and promoted the dispersion of both the iron and copper species, resulting in the increase of BET surface area and increasing the active sites for CO hydrogenation. During HAS reaction, increasing Mn content promoted the catalytic activity for HAS and improved the selectivities of C 2 + OH and hydrocarbons, which may be attributed to the enhancement of synergistic effect between the iron and copper species in higher Mn concentration. The increase of reaction temperature and pressure facilitated the alcohols product distribution shifting towards C 2 + OH . The optimum temperature and pressure for producing the higher alcohols over the Mn-modified Fe–Cu based catalyst were determined as 270°C and 6.0MPa."
