0,Introduction,"Hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) is an important chemical intermediate to produce polyamides (e.g. nylon-66 and nylon-610) and epoxy resins, and widely used as curing agent and organic crosslinking agent [1–3]. The production of HMDA becomes a hot topic as the demand for its downstream products speedily emerges [4]. The catalytic hydrogenation process of adiponitrile (ADN) can be used as an preferential strategy to produce the HMDA due to its simplification, high product quality and low raw cost [5,6]. Early studies used iron-based catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of ADN [7,8]. Ostermaier et al. developed a process to produce HMDA from crude ADN with phosphorous-containing impurities. The ozone-treated ADN can be converted by iron catalyst in a trickle bed reactor under 250 bars H2. However, harsh conditions such as high pressure and high temperature are necessary and limit the integrated development of the ADN industry. Several studies based on mono- and bi-metallic noble metal catalysts suggested their good activity for the hydrogenation of ADN, commonly to produce a mixture of the primary amines, e.g. HMDA and 6-aminohexanonitrile (ACN) [9,10]. Balladur et al. [11] verified that the homogeneous Ziegler-type catalyst was responsible for the high efficiency of hydrogenation under milder reaction conditions with only few catalyst dosage. However, these catalysts were also limited in industrial applications due to their high cost and difficulty to be separated from the products [3,12]. Series of Raney-type catalysts have been reported later for good activity, particularly the Raney Ni catalysts [3,13,14]. However, the stability is frustrated that is easily broken and spontaneously combusted [15]. Hereafter, supporting materials including silica, carbonous material and alumina are used as carriers of nickel based catalysts pursuing the significant activity for the hydrogenation of ADN [15,16]. However, problem still exists that it is difficult to achieve simultaneously both high selectivity of single product-HMDA and superior conversion rate of ADN [17]. Harsh conditions such as basic solvent or/and high pressure of NH3 are usually necessary to avoid the formation of other by-products. In recent years, it was suggested that appropriate amount of metal oxide is able to give surprisingly activity for many heterogeneous reactions [18–22]. The most profitability of the protocol to introduce a secondary metal oxide is the generated synergy between Ni and metal oxide, which greatly changes the surface chemistry and electronic property. Taking the CeO2 for instance, high concentration of ceria was able to induce large amount of surface defects and new Lewis acidic sites by two adjacent Ce3+ [23]. The Lewis base by neighboring lattice oxygen and the as-constructed Lewis acid created solid frustrated-Lewis-pair sites and easily dissociated the HH bond. On the contrary, the CeO2 decorator was also reported as electron donor and transfer electrons to the adjacent active metal species for hydrogenation reaction as the ceria loading was lowered to 4 wt% [24]. Serra et al. [13] studied the doping effect of magnesium oxide on nickel-based catalysts, indicating that the introduction of MgO can lead to the formation of NiO-MgO eutectic, thereby inhibiting the reduction behavior of nickel oxide, possibly increasing the alkaline sites and being conducive to the formation of primary amines in the hydrogenation of ADN [4,25]. Lv et al. studied sepiolite-supported potassium- and rhodium-modified nickel-based catalysts. It was found that potassium could neutralize some acidic sites on the catalyst and inhibited the formation of 1-azacycloheptane (ACH) by-products [26–28]. Strong synergistic effect between additional metal oxide and nickel made the Ni species highly active, resulting from the better dispersion of nickel nanoparticles, greater metal surface area, lower reduction activation energy of nickel oxide precursors and higher ratio of Ni0 on the surface of carrier [29]. It is also remarkable that the dosage and surrounding chemical environment of secondary decorator may obviously alter their main functional roles on the property of catalyst. However until now, most research works on the selective hydrogenation of ADN claiming the “satisfied” selectivity of products, are still commonly based on a mixture of primary amines (both ACN and HMDA), disregarding of the subsequent separations during further application in the industrial world. Besides, the presence of high pressure of NH3 and/or the large dosage of alkali are indispensable for most of the research studies [16,30,31]. The selective hydrogenation of ADN to HMDA with exclusive selectivity under milder conditions is with great challenge. At the same time, the essential factors of Ni catalysts and the key roles of metal auxiliaries for the selective hydrogenation of ADN is still unclear and advanced exploring is urgent. Herein in this work, alumina-supported nickel nanoparticles have been synthesized and decorated by small dosage of metal oxide including MgO, CeO2 or La2O3 and used for the selective hydrogenation of ADN. The functional roles of decorator on the surface structure, the chemical property as well as the catalytic performance were revealed by characterizations including the XRD, XPS, HR-TEM, HR-STEM, NH3-TPD and H2-TPD. The DFT calculations was also carried out for the simulation of the electron property. The CeO2 doped nickel-based catalyst exhibited exceeding selectivity to HMDA instead of a sum of all primary amines (ACN and HMDA) in the absence of any basic solvent nor high pressure NH3."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The series of Ni-Mx/Al2O3 (M = Ce, Mg or La) catalysts were synthesized by co-precipitation method using sodium carbonate as precipitant. The mixture solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and additional metal nitrates (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, La(NO3)3·6H2O, or Mg(NO3)2·6H2O) (A.R. from Macklin) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water to form the solution A. Na2CO3 solution (2.5 mol/L) was co-added dropwise with solution A into a three-necked flask containing 5 ml of water at a rate of 3 s/drop at 45 °C with constant stirring. The final pH of solution was adjusted to 10 with residual Na2CO3 solution and aged for 8 h. Samples in powder could be obtained after washing, filtering and dried overnight. The fresh samples were subsequently calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in 40% (v/v) O2 balanced with Ar at a heating rate of 2 °C·min−1, and then activated at 400 °C for 4 h in 40% (v/v) O2/Ar. The synthesized catalyst is expressed as Ni-Mx/Al2O3 (M = Ce, Mg and La, x represents the mole fraction of the additional metal species in the range of 0–10 at%, the nickel loading is 30 wt% if not specified). The as-synthesized catalysts were pre-treated in 40% (v/v) H2/Ar at 400 °C for 6 h before the reaction tests and characterizations. Before the samples were exposed to air, passivation of each sample is carried out after H2 reduction by inletting trace amount of O2 in Ar (1% O2/Ar mixture, 50 ml/min) at room temperature for 0.5 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu XRD-7000S diffractometer equipped with a CuKα monochromator source (λ = 1.5418 Å), operated at 40 KV and 100 mA and the 2θ from 10° to 80° with a scanning rate of 5o·min−1. All catalysts are tested after calcination and reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was operated on the ESCALAB 250 (Thermo VG, USA) spectrometer with a power of 150 W using Al KR (1486.6 eV) radiation and all catalyst are pre-reduced before test. The C1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as standard for the calibration of binding energy. The acidity of the catalyst sample was characterized by ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorber with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 100 mg catalyst sample was loaded and purged with Ar at 25 °C for 30 min, and in-situ reduced at 400 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere for 6 h to ensure that the process is consistent with the conditions of the catalyst before catalytic tests. NH3 was adsorbed for 60 min at 50 °C under the NH3/He stream. Argon was then purged to remove the physically adsorbed ammonia. Finally, the desorption was carried out and recorded from 50 to 700 °C at 10 °C·min−1. The reduced sample was characterized by hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorber with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 0.1 g of the catalyst sample was first purged in Ar at 25 °C for 30 min. H2 was adsorbed at 50 °C for 60 min in 10% H2/Ar flow and was then purged by Ar to remove the physically adsorbed hydrogen. Finally, the desorption was carried out from 50 °C to 800 °C at 10 °C·min−1. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope equipped with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) detectors under 200 keV High-resolution. Aberration-corrected high-resolution HAADF-STEM was performed on JEM ARM200F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV with probe corrector. The pre-reduced catalyst sample was sonicated in ethanol and dispersed onto a copper grid covered with a porous carbon film. CO chemisorption was operated on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system. 50 mg catalyst was reduced in situ in H2 at 400 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. After cooled down to room temperature and purged with He, gas mixture of 5% CO/He was pulsed several times until the CO peak area remained constant. The CO uptakes could be obtained by assuming the adsorption stoichiometry as CO: Ni = 1 for all samples."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The liquid phase hydrogenation of adiponitrile (Aladdin) was carried out in a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with the temperature control system and pressure-sensing device. 2.5 g of adiponitrile, 25 ml of ethanol and 0.5 g of the reduction-activated catalyst were placed in the reactor. The reactor was sealed and filled with 3 MPa H2, vented and repeated three times to evacuate the residual air in the reactor. The autoclave was finally filled with H2 at the aimed pressure and heated to the required temperature. Reaction was carried out under stirring at the speed of 800 rpm/min for a certain time and was then naturally cooled down to room temperature. The reaction solution was separated with the catalyst and analyzed by a GC (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a hydrogen ion flame detector (FID) and a capillary column HP-5 (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The internal standard method was used for quantitative analysis by using 1, 3, 5-trimethylbenzene (Sinopharm) as an internal standard. The conversion of adiponitrile (ADN) and yield of products were calculated as follows, C o n v e r s i o n o f A D N = n ADN t n ADN 0 - n ADN t × 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y o f p r o d u c t = n product t n ADN 0 - n ADN t × 100 % In the equations, n 0 ADN and n t ADN were the molar ratio of ADN in the reactant and the final solution after reaction. And n t product was the molar ratio of product at the end, including the HMDA, ACN, and 1-azacycloheptane (ACH), etc. The turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated based on the transformed amount of ADN per Ni atom per second using the following equation: TOF Ni = N / M · t In the equation, N is the transformed ADN within the tested reaction time, in mol; M is the number of surface Ni atoms in the catalyst, and can be calculated by the surface metal dispersion evaluated by CO chemisorption; t is the tested reaction time. The reaction temperature was fixed at 60 °C (2 h) for adequate ADN conversion under 3 MPa H2. The dosage of catalyst was 300 mg. 2.5 g adiponitrile in 25 ml ethanol (50 ml autoclave) was transformed into the semi-hydrogenation product-ACN within the ADN conversion range of 5%-20%."
5,Calculation,"2.4 Calculation All DFT calculations were carried out using the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach to represent ion-electron interaction, [32] as implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [33,34]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [35] with the PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [36] functional was used to describe the electronic exchange and correlation effects. The kinetic energy cutoff was set to 500 eV. The convergence criteria for force and energy was set to be 10−5 eV and 10−2 eV/Å, respectively. The Brillouin zones were sampled at 3 × 3 × 1 by Monkhorst-Pack meshes [37]. The vacuum region of 15 Å was set to avoid the interactions between adjacent images, to describe the van der Waals interaction, the semi-empirical dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 scheme proposed by Grimme [38] was used. The binding energies (Eb) of CeO2 binding with Ni (1 1 1) (CeO2/Ni (1 1 1)) are calculated by the following Eq. (1), (1) E b = E CeO 2 / Ni ( 111 ) - - E Ni ( 111 ) - E CeO2 where the ECeO2/Ni (111), ENi (111), and ECeO2 refers to the total energies of the CeO2 binding with the Ni (1 1 1), isolated Ni (1 1 1) substrate, and the isolated CeO2, respectively."
6,Results,
7,Nickel catalyst promoted by metal oxide,"3.1 Nickel catalyst promoted by metal oxide The XRD patterns of freshly reduced Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Mx/Al2O3 (M = Ce, Mg or La) catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . Diffraction peaks at 2θ of 44.5°, 51.7°, and 76.5° are clearly observed and correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) Ni faces (PDF#04-0850) [39]. The broad peaks locating around 34.8° and 64.1° should be ascribed to the amorphous alumina support. The diffraction peaks of additional metal oxide are absent in all the Ni-Mx/Al2O3 catalysts, either due to the low metal content (2 at%) or the high dispersion of metal particles. TEM images of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst do not display any bulk aggregation of Ni particles on the surface of alumina (Figure S1a† in the supporting information). However, no much information is given by the TEM images due to the weak contrast between metal particles and thick Al2O3 blocks. Clear contrast can be observed from the HADDF-STEM images (Figure S1b†). The average particle size of nickel is around 8.2 nm based on more than 200 particles. High-resolution TEM images display Ni particles of 2–10 nm in the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 sample (Figure S2†). The existance of lattice distance as 2.03 Å confirms the exposure of Ni(1 1 1) face. No clear evidence of Ce-containing species is observed in the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 sample, unless the occasionally observed CeO2(1 1 1) face with lattice distance of 3.12 Å surrounding the Ni particles (Figure S2b–c†). The additional Ce species may selectively locate around the nickel particles, which is a common phenomenon by using silica or alumina as support for metal particles [40]. It is not to claim that ceria could only be loaded on the surface of Ni particles, indeed they were also going to deposit proportionally on the surface of alumina. No matter how, the CeO2/Al2O3 is confirmed to be innocent to the catalytic activity for ADN transformation. In this circumstance, only CeO2 depositing surrounding Ni particles will be useful and mentioned in this work. Similar morphology is also present in the Ni-Mg2/Al2O3 and Ni-La2/Al2O3 samples (Figure S3†). Considering the well crystallinity of nickel species in XRD, it is suggested that the co-precipitation method assisted by Na2CO3 provides both dispersed nickel particles and well-crystallized nickel grains. The additional metal species with the percentage of 2 at% in the Ni-M2/Al2O3 samples are fully dispersed on the surface of catalysts. In order to understand the chemical compositions of different nickel catalysts, the XPS spectra in the Ni2p region are displayed in Fig. 2 . The peak at binding energy of 852.0, 854.7, and 856.4 eV should be corresponding to the Ni0, Ni2+, and Ni3+ species, respectively [30,41]. The surface information of different nickel species is listed in Table 1 . After doping of metal species, the composition of nickel species is directly depending on the nature of the additional metal species. The addition of 2 at% Mg species leads to the slightly lowered amount of both Ni0 and Ni2+ species, with obvious generation of Ni3+ species. The addition of 2 at% of Ce and La species gives nearly identical or slightly higher parentage of reduced nickel species (Ni0 + Ni2+) compared with those in the Ni/Al2O3. The XPS spectra in the Ce3d region illustrate the presence of both Ce3+ and Ce4+ species in the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 sample (Figure S4†). Positively charged Mg and La species in the Ni-Mg2/Al2O3 and Ni-La2/Al2O3 samples are also detected. It is suggested that the additional surface dispersed metal oxides pretend to be positively charged and bonded with oxygen atoms. The selective hydrogenation of adiponitrile (ADN) by Ni catalysts have been carried out at 80 and 90 °C for 3 h in 7 MPa H2 as shown in Fig. 3 . The monometallic Ni/Al2O3 catalyst displays 24% selectivity of hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) with 85% conversion of ADN. The selectivity of the semi-hydrogenolysis product- 6-aminocapronitrile (ACN) is as high as 76%. The addition of CeO2 or La2O3 obviously promotes the selectivity of HMDA to 28% and 66%, respectively, although the ratio of additional metal is only 2 at%. The conversion of ADN by Ni-La2/Al2O3 reaches nearly 100% at only 80 °C. However, the addition of 2 at% MgO causes the lower selectivity of HMDA with large amount of semi-hydrogenolysis product-6-aminocapronitrile (ACN, about 93%). The conversion of ADN by Ni-Mg2/Al2O3 is only 34%, suggesting its insufficient ability to activate either H2 or ADN. The hydrogenation results of ADN at 90 °C by different catalysts are also displayed in Fig. 3b. No residual ACN is detected after reaction using the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 and Ni-La2/Al2O3 samples, suggesting the full activation and transformation of ACN to HMDA by the two samples. The yields of HMDA by the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 and Ni-La2/Al2O3 samples at 90 °C are 88% and 85%, respectively. Small amount of 1-azacycloheptane (ACH, less than 12%) are produced as a result of the higher temperature. The Ni-Mg2/Al2O3 with MgO decoration is still inferior to the other nickel based catalysts at 90 °C, and the selectivity of HMDA is only 37% with 97% conversion of ADN. It is suggested that the ADN can be easily activated by the monometallic Ni catalyst, and can be further promoted by small amount of CeO2 and La2O3 (2 at%). However, the addition of MgO limited the hydrogenation process by producing mainly the incomplete hydrogenolysis product-ACN. In a word, the hydrogen activation ability, or/and the adsorption/desorption of intermediate with the surface greatly depend on the nature of additional metal species. The addition of Mg species limited the further hydrogenation of ACN into HMDA, leading to the impeditive production of HMDA. The different catalytic performances of modified nickel catalysts may be resulted from the initial chemical properties of additional metal oxides, that is, the constructive or obstructive effects on the electron and surface structures. The NH3-TPD is subsequently carried out to understand the surface acidity of different samples (Fig. 4 ). Three main peaks are appeared in the temperature range of 50–700 °C. The first peak locating at 135 °C (α peak) should be assigned to the existence of weak acid sites in the catalyst [42]. The peak at about 500 °C (β peak) is resulted from the medium acid sites. After the doping of additional metal oxide, the high-temperature desorption peak (γ) around 600 °C appears, which should be related to the strong acid sites. The additional metal oxide does not obviously change the amount of surface weak acid sites, but is mainly responsible for the generation of strong acid sites on the surface of Ni-M2/Al2O3 catalysts. In order to understand the relationship between the surface properties and the catalytic performance in depth, the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 catalyst is studied as a model catalyst. The influences of ceria atomic dosage on the chemical property and surface structure are therefore revealed."
8,Ni-Cex/Al2O3 catalysts with different CeO2 dosages,"3.2 Ni-Cex/Al2O3 catalysts with different CeO2 dosages The XRD patterns of the typical Ni-Cex/Al2O3 catalysts (x = 3 and 10) are displayed in Fig. 5 . Similar to the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 1), diffraction peaks of nickel species can be clearly observed in these two samples. The diffraction peaks of CeO2 are absent in the Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 sample, but are clearly observed in the Ni-Ce10/Al2O3 with 10% ceria loading, which are around 2θ of 28.7°, 33.5°, 47.4° and 56.8° and correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of CeO2. It is confirmed that ceria with lower dosage in the nickel based catalysts should be successfully deposited and are readily dispersed on the surface of different catalysts. Excessive CeO2 species accumulate and form big grains in the Ni-Ce10/Al2O3 catalyst. In this circumstance, a certain degree of CeO2 coverage on the Ni particles is able to occur, leading to the relevant variations of surface chemical compositions, the redox property, as well as the catalytic activity. In order to understand the influence of CeO2 dosage on the surface chemistry of nickel based catalysts, the XPS spectra in the Ni2p region are displayed in Fig. 6 and the related information is listed in Table 1. The formation of surface Ni0 species increments with the raised CeO2 loading until it reaches 5 at%. Interaction between Ni and additional CeO2 may happen and cause the partial charge transfer from CeO2 to surface Ni, leading to the increased amount of reduced Ni species (Ni0 + Ni2+). The percentage of reduced nickel species in the Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 sample are as high as 74.5%. Further increase of CeO2 loading to 10 at% results in the lowered amount of surface reduced Ni species to 69.7%, mainly due to the accumulation of CeO2 to form larger grains (XRD results) that easily cover the surface of nickel particles, leading to the weakened synergy between Ni and CeO2. For better confirmation, the XPS spectra in Ce3d region are also detected as shown in Fig. 7 . Two sets of spin-orbital multiplets corresponding to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 are labeled as v and u, respectively [43]. The v0/u0 and v’/u’ peaks are ascribed to the Ce3+ species, and the v/u, v’’/u’, and v’’’/u’’’ peaks are designed to the Ce4+ species. The Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair exists on the surface of all the ceria doped samples. The surface atomic ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ is listed in Table 1, changing in the range of 1.0 to 1.24 as the CeO2 loading increases from 1 at% to 10 at%. It should be taken as a sign of the modification on the redox property by ceria. The maximum of Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio is reached in the Ni-Ce10/Al2O3 sample. The H2-TPD profiles of the pre-reduced Ni-Cex/Al2O3 catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 8 . Three broad desorption peaks are related with the different surface states of the adsorbed hydrogen species. The peak at temperature lower than 200 °C (α peak) should be designed to the desorption of the adsorbed H on surface small nickel species [44] collaborated with CeO2 as the synergy between small Ni particles and CeO2 may facilitate the activation/adsorption of H2. The peaks in the temperature range of 400–600 °C correspond to the desorption of strongly adsorbed hydrogen on bigger Ni particles (β peak). The high-temperature desorption peak (γ) around 720 °C are ascribed to the adsorbed H strongly bonded with the sub-layer surface or the spillover hydrogen [45]. The quantitative information of H2 consumption are listed in Table 2 . The loading of small amount of ceria (1–5 at%) induces obvious raising of H2 consumption by about 20–40%. Considering the disproportional H2 consumption of the additional peak area in the Ni-Cex/Al2O3 (vs. the Ni/Al2O3) samples and the atomic percentage of ceria, the increased H2 consumption ought to be partially resulted from the enhancement of metal dispersion and H2 activation/dissociation ability due to the synergistic interaction between nickel and ceria species compared to the monometallic Ni/Al2O3 sample. It is also remarkable that although the addition of ceria leads to the slight variation of the desorption temperature, the desorption peaks of Ni-CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts (CeO2 loading < 5%) generally locate at very similar position independent of the ceria loading. It is revealed that the addition of ceria is to modify preferentially the surface of catalysts with higher amount of active H2 adsorption sites, instead of changing the activation/dissociation barrier of H2 molecules. However, the surface adsorbed α species decrease as the ceria loading increases to 5 at%. And hydrogen species strongly bonded with the surface and bulk catalyst (β and γ peaks) raises as compromise in the Ni-Ce5/Al2O3. The higher amount of ceria species may easily cover the surface of nickel particles or accumulated and lessened the synergy between Ni and CeO2 compositions as previously inferred by the XPS spectra. The catalytic performances of the Ni-Cex/Al2O3 samples for the selective hydrogenation of ADN are shown in Fig. 9 . The conversion of ADN and the selectivity of HMDA volcanically increase with the raising of CeO2 loading. Few amount of CeO2 loading (2 at%) already leads to the promotion of the catalytic performance. The ADN conversion reaches higher than 90% with 3–5 at% CeO2 loading at only 80 °C. The selectivity of 66% to HMDA with total transformation of ADN can be achieved by Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 at 80 °C (7 MPa H2 for 3 h). It is revealed that small amount of CeO2 (2–5 at%) is capable to promote the hydrogenation performance of nickel based catalysts. Higher amount of CeO2 is unnecessary and harmful to further transformation of HMDA from the ACN intermediate. The ADN can be completely converted as the reaction temperature reaches 90 °C, except that by the Ni-Ce10/Al2O3 sample with 10 at% CeO2 loading. The selectivity of intermediate-ACN is as high as 70% and cannot be further transformed into the final product HMDA by Ni-Ce10/Al2O3. The selectivity of HMDA reaches 90% by Ni-Ce3/Al2O3. The catalysts with 3 at% CeO2 and different Ni loading have also been tested (Figure S5†). Nickel catalyst with Ni loadings of 30 wt% is confirmed to be more efficient for the conversion of ADN to HMDA. For comparison, the catalytic performance of Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 have also been detected under much milder condition (2 MPa H2 at 90 °C for 3 h) with the same weight ratio of catalyst/reactant (Figure S6†). The selectivity of HMDA reaches 94% with nearly complete transformation of ADN. There is not any residual semi-hydrogenation product- ACN detected. Only about 6% ACH is formed. It is suggested that HMDA as the main product with high yield can also be obtained under milder conditions by optimizing the dosage of catalyst and reactant, only if the H2 was sufficiently supplied to hydrogenate all the nitriles. It is also remarkable to note that no basic solvent or supplementary NH3 have to be added during the reaction. Production of HMDA with high yield can be achieved instead of a sum of primary amines (both ACN and HMDA). The turnover frequency (TOF) of three typical nickel catalysts are also evaluated. The catalytic performance for ADN hydrogenation is carried out at 60 °C under 3 MPa H2 for 2 h with less dosage of catalyst to pursue proper ADN conversion (<20%, as shown in Figure S7†). TOF values at 60 °C of Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Ce2/Al2O3, and Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 are 0.0041, 0.0072, and 0.0079 s−1, respectively."
9,Discussion,"For the sake of better information of the CeO2 promoted nickel catalyst, the detailed structure and morphology of Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 are studied by high resolution TEM (Fig. 10 a). Nickel particles around 5 nm are observed. However, there is still no observation of big CeO2 grains unless small clusters surrounding the nickel particles with the lattice distance of 1.9 Å corresponding to CeO2(2 0 0). Aberration-corrected high-resolution HAADF-STEM images display the single nickel particles neighboring CeO2 clusters with only few layers of CeO2 atoms (Fig. 10c-area III). It is also remarkable that very small CeO2 sub-nanoclusters are also present and surrounding the Ni particles in the Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 catalyst, confirmed by the shining spots as marked in Fig. 10b due to the specifically high mass number of Ce element. The HAADF-STEM elemental mapping (Figure S8†) of the Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 catalyst also confirms the highly dispersion of Ce-containing species around the Ni particles. Herein, it is observable that the additional metal oxide is readily to form highly dispersed sub-nanoclusters surrounding the nickel particles. To be summarized, decoration by small amount of metal oxide did not able to change the crystallinity of active species, the morphology of catalyst or the sizes of nickel particles. However, the chemical properties of nickel active species can be easily modified, with abundant contacting interfaces between Ni and CeO2, benefiting from the fine dispersion of ceria species. Additional metal oxide acts as electron donor with electrons transferred to the nickel species. As a result, the nickel species with lower chemical valences (Ni0 and Ni2+) are generated during the pre-reduction. And new active sites for the adsorption and activation of ACN are generated, together with the enhanced H2 activation ability, all induced by the appropriate synergy and the constructed interfaces between Ni and CeO2 sub-nanoclusters on the surface. Simultaneously, the decoration of ceria greatly enhances the number of new active sites for H2 activation/dissociation (H2-TPD), rather than lowering the dissociation barrier of H2. It is also necessary to note that the hydrogenation performance of nickel based samples seemed to be correlated with the amount of reduced nickel species (Ni0 + Ni2+) in each sample. For better confirmation, the relationship between surface ratio of reduced nickel species and the yield of HMDA are correlated as shown in Fig. 11 a. The yield of HMDA exponentially increases along with the incremental surface ratio of reduced nickel species. The formation of surface nickel species lay great importance on the catalytic performance in different samples, independent of the type or the dosage of the decorator. In another word, one of the direct effects of metal oxide decorator is to modify the surface Ni species due to the specific electron transfer between Ni and the decorator. CeO2 or La2O3 with appropriate dosage facilitates the electron effect as well as the hydrogenation activity. Whilst decoration by MgO or excessive amount of ceria causes the improper occupation and coverage of active Ni sites. The surface electron structure of typical samples can be simulated and revealed simply from the total density of states (TODS) and the d-band center by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) results as shown in Fig. 11(b-d). The calculated equilibrium lattice constant of bulk Ni is 3.55 Å, which agrees well with the previous theoretical result [46]. The optimized four layer 3 × 3 supercell of Ni (1 1 1) is built to model the binding process. The two bond lengths of CeO in the optimized configuration of CeO2 are both 1.84 Å and the bending angel between two CeO bonds is 132.1°. The binding energy of CeO2 on Ni (1 1 1) is −3.13 eV, indicating the strong interaction between CeO2 and Ni (1 1 1). As shown in Fig. 11(b), the two bond lengths of Ce-O after optimization are both stretched to 2.10 Å due to the strong CeO2-Ni(1 1 1) interaction. It is well studied that d-band center (εd) is a key sign to reflect the reactivity of one catalyst and is calculated by the following equation (2) [47]. Here ρ(x) refers to the distribution function of density of states. The calculated the d-band center values of the Ni (1 1 1) and CeO2@Ni (1 1 1) are −1.39 and −1.33, respectively. It was reported that a catalyst exhibited better reactivity if its d-band center was closer to the fermi level [4]. It is therefore rational based on both the experimental and calculated data that Ni particles with CeO2 sub-nanoclusters on the surface deserve better activity than the mono-metallic Ni catalyst. (2) ε d = ∫ - ∞ ∞ x ρ ( x ) d x ∫ - ∞ ∞ ρ ( x ) d x No matter how, there exist the threshold limitation of the metal decoration effect. Taking CeO2 for instance, the compromised balance between surface properties and catalytic properties are visualized in Fig. 11e. Nice story is happened with CeO2 loading below 5 at%. The amount of active Ni species and the ability for H2 activation/dissociation at lower temperature (about 150 °C) are promoted with the incremental CeO2 decoration. However, severe reduction of all surface properties are observed as soon as the CeO2 loading reaches 10 at%, although the ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ still increments in the full range. Appropriate CeO2 loading positively enhances the surface properties of nickel based catalysts. However, large amount of CeO2 leads to the formation of well-crystalized CeO2. It on the one hand alters the formation of well-contacting Ni-CeO2 interfaces, and may lead to the passive alternation of the electron structure and the coverage of Ni sites on the other hand. Considering the raw cost and energy saving aspects, 2–3 at% CeO2 atomic loading are preferential. The study of the chemical kinetics are operated and the influences of H2 pressure and temperature on the catalytic performance are detected (Fig. 12 ) using Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 as a model catalyst. Selective hydrogenation of ADN have been carried out in H2 pressure of 3–7 MPa. The H2 pressure at higher than 4 MPa does not greatly influence the ADN conversion, which is maintained at higher than 99%. Whilst the H2 pressure lays great importance on the selectivity of HMDA. Lower H2 pressure (<5 MPa) generally leads to the obvious formation of the intermediate- ACN, mainly due to the insufficient supply of H2 source. Reaction at H2 pressure higher than 5 MPa causes the subsequent transformation of AND to HMDA, with the formation of ACH (<17%). The further increase of H2 pressure gives a stable maintenance of HMDA yield at about 90%. Simultaneously along with the incremental temperature, the conversion of ADN achieves >99% at temperature higher than 80 °C. The selectivity of different products is greatly manipulated by the reaction temperature. The selectivity of target product- HMDA volcanically increases with the reaction temperature and reaches its maximum of 90% at 90 °C. Further raising of temperature leads to the additional by-product, which is mainly formed by the ACN coupled with the alcohol solvent. Reaction in the temperature range of 70–110 °C by the Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 sample has the similar trend (Figure S9†), and additional coupling of ADN with alcohol solvent also happened only under higher temperature (>100 °C). It can be seen that ACN was the main product by Ni-Ce2/Al2O3 if the reaction temperature was lower than 80 °C. Whilst the selectivity of HMDA (red column) increases in the temperature range of 80–90 °C and reaches its maximum at 90–100 °C. In another word, the ACN is further hydrogenated into the final product HMDA at higher temperature, the reaction rate sharply accelerated by the increased 10 °C. The concentration of reactant and the products have also been detected (Fig. 12c). The concentration of ADN gradually attenuates with the reaction time. The semi-hydrogenolysis produce- ACN generates immediately with time-on stream and steadily reaches its saturation after about 5 h. The concentration of HMDA slowly increases within the first 5 h and speedily raises up, which should be evenly transformed from the ACN. Very small amount of cyclisation product-ACH is also formed along with time (<3%). The reaction process can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 12d. As a semi-hydrogenolysis product, ACN is transformed from ADN immediately, which will be further hydrogenated as the main product- HMDA. And ACH is formed as by-product·NH3 is able to be generated during the production of ACH if harsh condition was applied (either higher pressure or temperature), which will reversely limit the further generation of ACH and cause the reversible maintenance of the selectivity to HMDA. The C2H5NH(CH2)6NHC2H5 will also be produced in case of higher temperature (e.g. T > 100 °C) due to the intense activation of residual nitrile. During the reaction, ADN is easily transformed into ACN, with one side of CN hydrogenated into CH2 NH2 intermediate, dependent on the detailed reaction temperature, pressure and the specific catalyst. Efficient nickel catalysts help to transform the ACN further into HMDA. ACH is able to be formed due to the coupling of two CN in an ADN molecule. Appropriate loading of ceria obviously limits the side products such as ACH and ACN, leading to the superior selectivity of HMDA. The modification of CeO2 on its chemical property in turn results in the better resistance of the NH3 formed during the reaction as well as the coke. The Ni-Cex/Al2O3 acts as competent catalyst for the production of HMDA with high yield in the absence of either basic solvent or high pressure of NH3. Five reaction cycles have been taken using the Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 catalyst, and well stability are displayed even after 5 reaction cycles (Figure S10†)."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, a series of nickel based catalysts has been synthesized and promoted by metal oxides including the CeO2, MgO and La2O3. The initial chemical properties caused the distinctive catalytic performances of the nickel catalysts, although the MOx loading was only 2 at.%. The doping of metal oxide did not change the particle sizes or the crystallinity of nickel particles. New interfaces and appropriate synergy could be formed with certain amount of the additional metal oxide. By using the Ni-Cex/Al2O3 as model catalyst, it was found out that CeO2 sub-nanoclusters were easily formed on the surface of nickel particles. Suitable surface dispersion of CeO2 led to the electron transfer from CeO2 to Ni, causing the formation of higher amount of reducible nickel species (Ni0 and Ni2+). The additional ceria was not helpful to decrease the energy barrier for H2 adsorption/dissociation, it was directly responsible for the formation of more active sites and interfaces with Ni. However, threshold exists if the doping content of CeO2 was higher than 5 at%. Excessive amount of CeO2 could cover the active sites of nickel particles, causing the deactivation of nickel catalysts. By using Ni-Ce3/Al2O3 with only 3 at.% CeO2, adiponitrile can be completely transformed at 90 °C (7 MPa H2 for 3 h) with 90% yield of hexamethylenediamine. The additional CeO2 also resulted in the enhance stability of Ni catalyst, which maintains its high catalytic stability even after 5 reaction cycles."
