0,Introduction,"The interest in sustainability, green chemistry, and attention toward the environment is currently gaining. It is associated with the fast development in the synthesis, processing, and applications of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers [1]. Among these polymers, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) plays an important role because of its nontoxicity, water-solubility, and excellent film-forming capacity along with high tensile strength and flexibility [2,3]. In general, PVA is a semi-crystalline synthetic polymer which is easily obtained and has a relatively low cost of production. PVA can be applied in many fields such as food packaging, coatings, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics industries [4,5]. Based on the characteristics of PVA, it can be blended with different synthetic and natural polymers [6]. The blending of polymer is a facile and effective method for developing new materials with desired properties [7]. Several studies have been reported to produce PVA-based films by blending it with an antibacterial biopolymer, for instance, chitosan [5,8–10]. Chitosan (CTS) as a polycationic polysaccharide, is derived from chitin found in the exoskeleton component in crustaceans [11,12]. The deacetylation degree, molecular weight, and consequently functional properties of chitosan depend on its source [13]. The unique remarkable properties of chitosan, including good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and a capacity to form films, microparticles, fibers, scaffold, and hydrogels, make it a suitable polymer in a large set of applications [14–16]. However, chitosan has low water resistance, poor mechanical and thermal properties, which limits its usage in functional films. Pure chitosan films are relatively brittle and fragile [12,17]. In order to overcome these drawbacks, chitosan can be mixed with other polymers, for example, poly(vinyl alcohol). Bonilla et al. prepared CTS/PVA films at different weight ratios. The chitosan addition significantly reduced the stretchability of the PVA films, with a simultaneous increase in their rigidity and the resistance to fracture. Apart from that, a reduction in the crystallinity degree was also observed along with a rise in thermal stability [18]. Liu et al. also produced matrices from PVA and chitosan. Their results demonstrated that the PVA/CTS films had greater elongation at break, lower oxygen permeability, higher water barrier properties, and greater antibacterial activity compared to the pure PVA film. It was found that the PVA/CTS films might be a promising material for food packaging applications [19]. Despite the fact that the PVA and chitosan films providing great properties, a lack of flexibility is still one of the main restrictions for their applications. It has been proved that the addition of a plasticizer improved the flexibility of polymer films. The concentration of the plasticizer in the film-forming solution is a parameter that needs to be optimized. Polyols, such as glycerol or sorbitol are the most commonly used plasticizers [12,20–22]. Matet and co-workers investigated the effect of three different polyols (glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol) on various properties of chitosan films. It turned out that the chitosan films plasticized with the highest molecular weight polyol (sorbitol) showed higher thermal resistance, higher tensile strength, and higher storage modulus in comparison with the other used polyols. Furthermore, the crystallinity degree of chitosan decreased when the polyol content increased [23]. Cerqueira et al. studied the influence of glycerol on the physicochemical properties of chitosan films, and they found that the presence of glycerol resulted in a more hydrophilic structure and lower matrix affinity for water [24]. The aim of the present work was to prepare environmentally friendly polymer composite films with improved mechanical and chemical properties. More specifically, the purpose of this research was to achieve polymer matrices composed of PVA and chitosan using a solvent evaporation technique. The PVA/CTS films were prepared at various weight ratios to evaluate the optimum composition. The plasticizer (glycerol or sorbitol) was added to the films to improve mechanical properties, also the surfactant (cocamidopropyl betaine) was the blend component to give the films washing properties because of potential usage of such materials as disposable wipes. The obtained films were characterized by contact angle measurements, ATR-FTIR, atomic force microscopy, mechanical tests, and moisture content analysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (CTS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and sorbitol (S) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznan, Poland). Glycerol (G) and acetic acid were supplied from Avantor Performance Materials Poland S.A. (Gliwice, Poland). Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB) was acquired from CHEMCO (Sobowidz, Poland). The molecular weight of PVA was 31,000–50,000 g/mol and the hydrolysis degree was about 98–99%. The deacetylation degree of chitosan was ≥75%. The molecular weight of chitosan was evaluated in our laboratory by viscometric measurements using Ubbelohde viscometer. The measurements were performed in 0.1 M CH3COOH/0.2 M NaCl solution at 25 °C. Based on these measurements, the limiting viscosity number, [η], was obtained from the Huggins equation. Then, the viscosity-average molecular weight ( M ¯ v ) was calculated from the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation, [η] = K M ¯ v a , where K = 1.81 × 10−3 cm3/g and a = 0.93 [25]. The average molecular weight of chitosan was equal to 444,000 g/mol."
3,Preparation of polymer films,"2.2 Preparation of polymer films The films were fabricated from chitosan, poly(vinyl alcohol), the plasticizer (glycerol or sorbitol), and the surfactant (cocamidopropyl betaine) using a casting solutions technique. First, chitosan was dissolved in 1% (v/v) acetic acid solution, to prepare 2% (w/w) concentration of chitosan solution. PVA solution (2% w/w) was produced by the dissolution of PVA powder in deionized water. Then, these solutions were mixed in different weight ratios (Table 1 ). The addition of the plasticizer (G or S) and the surfactant (CAPB) was 2%. The blended solutions were cast onto square plastic dishes with 10 cm diameter. The samples were dried under ambient conditions for 7 days. The scheme of film production is shown in Fig. 1 . The thickness of the films was about 45 μm and was measured with a digital micrometer at a resolution of 0.001 mm (MIB Messzeuge, Germany)."
4,Characterization of polymer films,"2.3 Characterization of polymer films 2.3.1 Contact angle measurements The contact angle (θ) measurements were conducted at room temperature with two liquids: diiodomethane (apolar liquid) and glycerol (polar liquid) using a DSA G10 goniometer equipped with a drop shape analysis system (Krüss GmbH, Germany). The obtained contact angle values were the average of 7 measurements. The surface free energy, and its polar and dispersive components, were calculated using the Owens-Wendt method [26]. According to this method, the surface free energy of a solid (γs) is the sum of polar (γs p) and dispersive (γs d) component: γ s = γ s p + γ s d The polar component describes polar, hydrogen, induction, and acid-base interactions, while the dispersive component characterizes dispersion London forces. Two liquids with known surface free energy (γl), polar (γl p), and dispersive (γl d) components, are needed to determine the surface free energy and its components of the solid. One can use the following equation: 0.5 γ l 1 + cos θ = γ s d + γ l d 0.5 + γ s p + γ l p 0.5 However, two such equations are demanded as two unknowns, γs p and γs d, are present. Thus, solving a system of equations for two testing liquids, one can obtain γs p and γs d, and then γs of the solid. 2.3.2 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy The chemical interactions between the blend components were evaluated by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) with the usage of Spectrum Two™ spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA) equipped with an ATR device. The spectra were collected at room temperature at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and with 32 scans. Diamond was used as an ATR crystal for which the incidence angle of the infrared radiation was 45o. 2.3.3 Atomic force microscopy Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired with the usage of a MultiMode NanoScope IIIa (Veeco Metrology Inc., USA) equipped with a silicon tip (Veeco). The atomic force microscope was working in a tapping mode in the air and at room temperature. Moreover, roughness parameters, Ra - arithmetic mean deviation, and Rq (RMS) - root mean square deviation, were calculated for the scan area of 5 μm × 5 μm. The mentioned parameters are described by the formulae below: R a = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y i R q = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y i 2 where y i is a deviation of i-point from the average line, n is the number of measuring points made at equal intervals along the measuring section. 2.3.4 Mechanical properties The mechanical tests were conducted at room temperature using a mechanical testing machine equipped with tensile grips (Z.05, Zwick/Roell, Germany). Prior to the measurements, samples were cut by a dumbbell-shaped sharpener with initial dimensions 50 mm length and 4.5 mm width. The prepared samples were inserted between the machine clamps and stretched to break. The elastic modulus (Young's modulus, E) was calculated from the slope of the stress-strain curve in the linear region (strain from 0.05% to 0.25%). The stress at break (σb) and the elongation at break (εb) of the samples were also determined. The measurements were carried out at a velocity of 5 mm/min. The results were recorded by the testXpert II software. The presented data are the average values calculated from 5 measurements for each type of film. 2.3.5 Moisture content The moisture content of the blend films was determined by measuring weight loss upon drying in an oven at 110 °C to a constant weight [27]. After removing the samples from the oven, they were kept in a desiccator. The samples were analyzed in triplicate. The moisture content (MC, %) was calculated according to the following formula, considering the initial weight (IW) of each sample and the weight after drying (DW): M C % = I W − D W I W × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Contact angle measurements results,"3.1 Contact angle measurements results The contact angle technique is one of the most effective method for examining the surface properties of different materials. The Owens-Wendt method was used for determining the surface free energy as well as the polar and dispersive components [28,29]. Based on the obtained results (Table 2 ), one can see that PVA/CTS films possessed the hydrophobic surfaces as the polar component values were low for these samples due to the interactions between the functional groups of these polymers. PVA contains hydroxyl groups, while chitosan possesses hydroxyl and amine groups, thus these groups took part in the creation of new hydrogen bonds, which resulted in the formation of the hydrophobic film surfaces. The hydrophobicity of PVA/CTS matrices was observed by other research groups [30,31]. The addition of glycerol or sorbitol to the PVA/CTS blends caused a further decrease in polar component values indicating the participation of the polyols in intermolecular hydrogen bond formation. Slightly lower polar component values were noticed for the films with glycerol owing to a shorter chain of this plasticizer compared with sorbitol. The mobility of the blend ingredients in the presence of glycerol was higher compared to the blends with sorbitol, so the formation of hydrogen bonds with glycerol could be easier. However, the introduction of the surfactant to the PVA/CTS blends caused the opposite effect, the matrices surface polarity distinctly increased, which was expressed by the rise in the values of surface free energy and its polar component. It indicated that the polar/ionic groups of the blend ingredients were able to interact with the polar testing liquid because they were not bound by hydrogen bonds. Functional groups were directed toward the surface not bulk. The formation of hydrogen bonds between the film components was disturbed in the presence of the cocamidopropyl betaine. The surfactant possesses hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. The quite long hydrophobic chain could not interact with the polymers rich in polar groups. The negatively charged ionic head of the surfactant potentially can interact with the positively charged amine groups of chitosan. However, generally, repulsion forces between the blend ingredients appeared in the films with the surfactant, which led to higher amount of polar groups at the surface region. A similar situation was noticed for PVA/CTS films with the plasticizer and the surfactant. The studied polymeric blends with both additives had much higher values of the surface free energy and the polar component compared to PVA/CTS matrices and those with the plasticizer. It indicated greater hydrophilicity of the four-component systems. The surface polarity of the PVA/CTS films with both additives was similar to the films only with the surfactant, which suggested that cocamidopropyl betaine was responsible for the very high surface polarity of the obtained matrices. Moreover, the surface free energy and polar components values of the prepared films depended slightly on the ratio of PVA and chitosan in the blend. One can notice a minimal increase in the surface free energy and polar components values with rising PVA content in the blends."
7,ATR-FTIR spectroscopy results,"3.2 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy results ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used for analyzing the molecular interactions in the studied systems. Only characteristic absorption bands coming from functional groups which might be involved in the interactions were discussed. Fig. 2 shows the infrared spectra of pure polymers and their blends. In the spectrum of pure PVA, a broad band in the region of 3000–3600 cm−1 with a maximum at 3269 cm−1 is seen. This band was assigned to the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups [32]. In chitosan, there is also the broad band in this region with a maximum at 3286 cm−1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of OH and NH bonds [32]. In the polymeric blends, the maximum of this band is placed between the maxima of these bands seen in the infrared spectra of the neat polymers indicating the formation of intermolecular hydrogen linkages between PVA and chitosan [31]. Moreover, maxima of amide I band are seen at 1627 cm−1 and 1657 cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of chitosan but in the polymeric blends containing 50 and 75% of chitosan the maxima are observed at 1630 cm−1 and 1659 cm−1, respectively. In the case of the blend with 25% of chitosan content, this band has one maximum at 1648 cm−1. A maximum of amide II is observed at 1551 cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of chitosan but for all blends, the maximum of this band appears at 1556 cm−1. Furthermore, in the range of CO stretching vibrations, one can see a maximum at 1087 cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of PVA, in the spectrum of chitosan, the maxima of this band are detected at 1064 cm−1 and 1023 cm−1. In the PVA/CTS blends, one can notice the maxima at 1066 cm−1 and 1025 cm−1, respectively. These shifts of absorption bands in the infrared spectra indicate the interactions between the blend components. Similar results were found by other researches [31,33]. After the addition of glycerol or sorbitol to the polymeric blends, there are some alterations in the infrared spectra of the samples (Fig. 3A–B). In the region of hydroxyl groups, a maximum of the band at about 3280 cm−1 in the blends is shifted to 3284 cm−1 in the blends with glycerol and to 3287 cm−1 in the blends with sorbitol. There is also a remarkable growth in the intensity of this band suggesting higher amount of hydroxyl groups. The amide II band does not change its position, but the maximum of the amide I band appears at 1644 cm−1 in the blends with glycerol and with sorbitol. The most noticeable changes are seen in the CO region where one main maximum appears at about 1033 cm−1 in the glycerol modified PVA/CTS blends. Whereas in the case of the polymeric blends modified with sorbitol, the maximum of the band of CO stretching vibrations at 1025 cm−1 does not shift but the second maximum at 1066 cm−1 moves to higher wavenumbers and is detected in the range of 1069–1075 cm−1, depending on PVA content. These changes in the infrared spectra of the plasticized polymeric films indicate the alterations in the functional group surroundings and the formation of new hydrogen bonds between the polymers and the plasticizer [34,35]. Infrared spectra of the polymeric samples with CAPB show that the region of the OH/NH bond vibrations is slightly narrower with no change in the band maximum (Fig. 3A–B). Moreover, CAPB has no band in the ether range, thus the alterations in this spectrum region result from the different surrounding of the CO groups in both polymers. The maximum of this band at 1066 cm−1 is shifted to 1068 cm−1. The most pronounced changes are seen in the amide bands. The maximum of the amide II band is shifted from 1556 cm−1 to 1550 cm−1 in infrared spectra of the polymeric blends modified with CAPB. The amide I band appears at 1631 cm−1 in these modified blends. Moreover, the amide bands overlap with the band coming from the vibrations of carboxylate anion in the surfactant [32]. Thus, these changes observed in the infrared spectra suggest ionic interactions between the surfactant and chitosan. The infrared spectra of the PVA/CTS blends both the plasticizer and the surfactant show the alterations in a shape and the intensity of the absorption bands as well as their shifts. These changes indicate new interactions in the four-component blends, such as new hydrogen bonds between PVA or chitosan and the plasticizer, or ionic interactions between chitosan and the surfactant, which results in the changes in surface and bulk properties of the modified blends."
8,Atomic force microscopy results,"3.3 Atomic force microscopy results The AFM images of the studied samples are shown in Fig. 4 . It was noted that the blends composed of PVA and chitosan were very flat and homogeneous. Some ordered structures can be noticed in the AFM image of the blend containing 75% of PVA. Moreover, the roughness parameters values were very low for the neat polymer blends and increased with rising PVA content in the blends (Table 3 ). Such low surface roughness indicates the presence of the interactions between the blend components, like hydrogen bonds, which were formed below the blend surfaces, making these surfaces relatively flat [36–39]. This finding was also demonstrated by contact angle measurements and ATR-FTIR analysis. The addition of the plasticizer and surfactant into PVA/CTS blends resulted in important changes in the surface morphology (Fig. 4) and the roughness parameters (Table 3). The surface morphology became more folded with cavities and the roughness parameters increased significantly. The high surface roughness is indicative of the immiscibility of blend components, which may be due to the presence of the surfactant [36–39]. The addition of CAPB to the polymer films disturbed the formation of the hydrogen bonds between the blend components. It is clearly seen that the Ra and Rq as well as the surface architecture changed greatly with increasing PVA content in these four-component samples (Table 3). The blend with the lowest PVA content (25%) with the addition of sorbitol and cocamidopropyl betaine had a grainy structure. The films with higher content of PVA (50, 75%) with S/G and CAPB had folded structures with high hills and valleys. It was accompanied by higher values of the roughness parameters for these blends. It suggests that CAPB seems to be more compatible with chitosan owing to the negatively charged head, which can interact with the positively charged amine groups in chitosan. When the amount of chitosan was decreasing in the blends, and PVA content was increasing, the surfactant weakly interacted with PVA due to the differences in their structures, which resulted in the high surface roughness of these samples. Moreover, PVA is capable of forming the ordered structures, which can also be the reason for the high values of the roughness parameters. However, this factor appears to have less effect on the morphology because the blends without any additives had quite flat surfaces and Ra and Rq values were low. There is no AFM image of the film PVA/CTS (25/75) with glycerol and cocamidopropyl betaine due to the stickiness of these sample surfaces. The atomic force microscope needle stuck to the sample and the image could not be obtained."
9,Mechanical properties test results,"3.4 Mechanical properties test results Young's modulus (E), stress at break (σb), and elongation at break (εb) values obtained for various studied systems are summarized in Table 4 and the stress-strain curves of the chosen samples are shown in Fig. 5 . Young's modulus describes the stiffness of a material and its high value is typical of the rigid material and a low value is characteristic of the flexible material. It is seen in Table 4 that PVA/CTS films had the highest values of E among the studied systems, indicating very stiff structure owing to the presence of hydrogen bonds between the polymeric molecules, which was confirmed by infrared studies, contact angle measurements, and AFM studies. The addition of the surfactant or the plasticizer to the PVA/CTS matrices reduces E values, which points out that all the additives individually act as plasticizers. The polymeric blends with glycerol or sorbitol were characterized by much lower Young's modulus values compared to the films with cocamidopropyl betaine and the neat blends. If one can compare the type of plasticizer added to the composites, it is seen that the films with sorbitol were stiffer than those with glycerol. Young's modulus values were higher for the films with sorbitol compared to these values for the films with glycerol. It means that especially glycerol has good plasticizing properties. This polyol is built of a shorter carbon chain than sorbitol and therefore, in the presence of glycerol, the changes in the polymer positions were easier. Thus, in general, the plasticized matrices have become very flexible. The plasticizers penetrate between the polymer chains in the blends reducing the intermolecular forces and leading to sliding of the macromolecules. The Young's modulus values obtained for the polymer matrices with both sorbitol and surfactant were slightly higher than these values for the corresponding blends without CAPB. However, E values of the films with glycerol and CAPB were about twofold higher than E values for the analogous blends without this surfactant. It suggests that CAPB made the blend structure a little bit stiffer. Moreover, the high elasticity of the PVA/CTS blends with the plasticizer and CAPB mainly resulted from the presence of the plasticizer as the E values of the four-component blends were similar to these values of the films only with the plasticizer. The added plasticizers possessed a large number of hydroxyl groups in their structures, and therefore they were capable of entering between polymer chains and disturbing intermolecular hydrogen bonds [40]. The values of elastic moduli of the prepared blends were significantly dependent on the composition of the polymer films, namely these values showed a decreasing trend with increasing PVA content. The higher amount of chitosan in the films increased the stiffness of the prepared materials due to its stiffer polymer chain and the existence of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Elongation at break (εb) is a ratio between a final length after breakage and an initial length of the test specimen [41]. The measured elongation at break values indicates the stretchability of the samples [18]. The material with a high value of εb is ductile, while the material with a low value of εb is brittle. As shown in Table 4, PVA/CTS films exhibited the lowest elongation at break values of the studied samples and it means that the neat blends were very brittle. The addition of the plasticizers to the matrices caused an increase in the εb values, indicating a high impact of these compounds on the mechanical properties of the tested samples. When describing the type of the plasticizer added to the films, it can be seen that the films with sorbitol were more ductile than those with glycerol. Moreover, the polymer blends with the CAPB had slightly higher elongation at break values compared to the neat PVA/CTS films, which pointed out that these films were also brittle. The elongation at break values measured for the polymer blends with both the plasticizer and the surfactant were slightly lower than these values for the corresponding films without CAPB, which denoted that the added surfactant caused a small decrease in the stretchability of the produced materials. The elongation at break values were also dependent on the weight ratios of the polymers in the prepared samples. Based on the data in Table 4, it was noticed that the lower εb values were associated with lower content of PVA in the materials. It indicates that lower amount of PVA in the blends increased the fragility of the obtained matrices. The same trend for PVA/CTS films was observed by other researchers [15,42,43]. Stress at break (σb) may be defined as the tensile force applied on a cross-sectional area of the specimen at the rupture point. This parameter determines the resistance to fracture of a material. The obtained results (Table 4) show that PVA/CTS films had the highest values of the breaking stress, which indicated that these blends were the most resistant to rupture among the studied samples because of strong interactions between the blend components. The incorporation of the surfactant into the matrices resulted in about a twofold reduction in σb values. Furthermore, the addition of the plasticizer (glycerol or sorbitol) to the polymeric blends induced a subsequent reduction in the breaking stress. However, the addition of the CAPB to the plasticized polymeric blends had no significant effect on the stress at break. It was also noted that weight ratios of the blend components had an impact on the measured stress at break. Coherently, the σb values of the samples raised when the chitosan content in the blends increased. Thus, the films with higher amount of chitosan were more resistant to rupture."
10,Moisture content test results,"3.5 Moisture content test results The results of moisture content studies in the samples are shown in Fig. 6A–C. This property relates to an affinity of the sample components for water. It is seen in Fig. 6A that moisture content is quite low in PVA/CTS films. Moreover, the addition of cocamidopropyl betaine to the polymer mixtures also did not influence this quantity much, which suggests still compact construction of the polymeric blends. The situation changed when glycerol was introduced to the polymer blends (Fig. 6B–C). The moisture content values became highest for all samples with glycerol probably due to the high affinity of glycerol for water. These samples were also the most flexible. The results suggest that the films with glycerol had less compact structure and allowed water to get inside. However, the addition of the other plasticizer – sorbitol – reduced the ability of the samples to absorb water most effectively, suggesting much less affinity of sorbitol to absorb moisture and more compact structure compared to the matrices with glycerol. It indicates that the plasticizers were responsible for water absorption in the blends. The moisture content of the neat and modified PVA/CTS films increased with increasing PVA content. Srinivasa et al. produced films from chitosan and PVA and they also observed that higher moisture content value was characteristic of the films with higher amount of PVA in the materials [43]. PVA is more hydrophilic polymer than chitosan, so the moisture content is higher with its greater content in the polymer blends."
11,Conclusions,"The polymer films made of poly(vinyl alcohol) and chitosan with the addition of surfactant and plasticizer were successfully obtained. Cocamidopropyl betaine was used as the surfactant, and glycerol or sorbitol was the plasticizer in this experiment. These polymer blends exhibited improved mechanical and chemical properties compared to the PVA/CTS films. The neat and plasticized PVA/CTS films had very hydrophobic and smooth surfaces due to the attraction forces between the blend components, which was proved by ATR-FTIR analysis, contact angle measurements, and AFM. The introduction of the CAPB to the polymeric blends resulted in very hydrophilic and rough surfaces. A negatively charged carboxylate head of the surfactant was able to interact with a positively charged amine group of chitosan. It was observed in the infrared spectra where the biggest changes were seen in the range of amide bands. However, the rise in surface roughness of the films with CAPB, also with increasing PVA content in the blends, indicated weak interactions due to the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant. Especially higher presence of PVA, more polar and less compatible component, resulted in higher Ra and Rq values. Moreover, the presence of the plasticizer and/or CAPB in the PVA/CTS blends reduced the stiffness and increased ductility of the samples. The type of plasticizer was an important factor which determined the properties of the matrices. It was found that the PVA/CTS films with glycerol and with glycerol and surfactant were more flexible and had higher affinity for water than those with sorbitol due to less compact structure of these films. Furthermore, mechanical properties, water absorption capacity, and surface morphology clearly depended on the blend composition. Flexibility, humidity, and surface roughness increased with raising PVA content in the matrices on account of suppleness and good affinity for the moisture of this polymer. The polymeric samples with sorbitol and CAPB seemed to be better than those with glycerol and CAPB owing to the high ductility, flexibility, and the lack of surface stickiness. The obtained films can be the starting point for developing new materials to replace personal hygiene products made for industrial and household cleaning due to the presence of surfactant. The components of the prepared materials are used for the production of cosmetics, so the product in the form of wet wipes will not harm and not irritate the skin. The matrices loaded with the surfactant and the plasticizer were studied as an alternative to the currently used wet wipes based on non-degradable polymers. The directive from 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment (Single-Use Plastics Directive, in abbreviation SUP Directive) limits the usage of wet wipes by labelling requirements, awareness raising measures, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) [44]."
