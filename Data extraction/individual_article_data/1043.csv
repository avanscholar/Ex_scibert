0,Introduction,"The inevitable depletion of fossil fuels and the controversy that surrounds their use makes it imperative to develop sustainable, economical, and efficient alternatives to petrochemicals. Plant biomass is the most recognized alternative and is widely regarded as the most promising renewable resource to replace petroleum feedstocks [1]. Of plant biomass, lignin is the only large-scale source of aromatics. As such, there has been a significant amount of effort devoted and progress made to efficiently harvest the aromatics in a cost-competitive manner [2]. The obvious and urgent needs for more sustainable chemical processes will likely lead to the development of lignin-based technologies and allow it to become a significant source of renewable aromatics [3]. However, to take full advantage of renewable aromatic feedstocks, sustainable and economical downstream processes that convert the depolymerization products into high-value commodity chemicals need to be developed [4]. Lignin is a phenolic-based polymer and therefore a significant portion of the depolymerization products are phenolics [5,6]. Phenol finds its major use as a precursor for plastics often by reaction with other compounds or molecules. For example, phenol can be reduced to afford cyclohexanone and/or cyclohexanol. The ketone (K) and alcohol (A) products, either separately or in a mixture (KA oil), are predominantly used as precursors for nylon [7]. Industrial processes that convert phenol to precursors used in nylon production rely on high pressure molecular hydrogen as the reductant [8]. Therefore, it is advantageous to develop catalysts and catalytic systems that lower the hydrogen pressure needed for phenol reduction or eliminate the need for molecular hydrogen all together. Recently, there have been several catalytic systems developed for phenol reduction at or near atmospheric hydrogen pressures [9]. Far fewer systems have been developed that eliminate the need for molecular hydrogen through transfer hydrogenation [10–13]. Thus, there is a present and forecasted need to develop catalytic transfer hydrogenation systems that can transform biomass platform molecules into high-value commodity chemical precursors and lessen our reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks for downstream processing of biomolecules. In recent years there has been a surge in the development of heterogeneous transfer hydrogenation catalytic systems [14]. Oftentimes, these systems contain two components: one to activate the donor molecule for hydrogen liberation and the other to activate the liberated hydrogen for reduction of the unsaturated functionality. Noble metals are widely used to promote the latter, while homogenous inorganic or organic bases (e.g. NaOH, K-OtBu) have traditionally been used for the former. From an advanced catalyst design standpoint, it is beneficial to incorporate the necessary promoters within the solid catalyst to achieve the desired activity and avoid the undesired homogeneous components. In a previous study, we showed that ceria supported palladium was active for room temperature phenol hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen at atmospheric pressure [15]. Ceria is a mildly basic, redox active metal oxide and as such, a seemingly good candidate for transfer hydrogenation reactions. Considering its potential, ceria has been poorly studied for transfer hydrogenation catalysis. Catalytic systems involving iridium oxide [16], gold [17,18], and nickel [19] supported on ceria have been reported for transfer hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes without the use of a base promoter. Shimizu et al. [19] studied the transfer hydrogenation of ketones over Ni/CeO2 catalyst using 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor. The catalyst showed good activity for aromatic and aliphatic ketone reduction. Although a base metal was used, the catalyst was not stable in air and thermal regenerative treatments were needed between recycling experiments. Ceria and ceria-based materials are best known for their redox properties, which are related to the number and type of oxygen vacancies within the material [20–31]. The significant effort and progress made to understand the role of oxygen vacancies during catalytic processes has enabled the design of defect-engineered ceria-based materials [32–38]. Perhaps most notable are ceria materials with well-defined shapes that expose specific crystallographic planes, which dictate the amount and type of defect sites present [39–43]. The redox properties of these materials are oftentimes probed with short-chain alcohols, whose adsorption, reactions, and product distribution/desorption temperature are believed to depend on the defect sites present [44–48]. Typically, the more defect-rich ceria materials give rise to higher yields of dehydrogenation products. With this in mind, the development of ceria-based materials with high concentrations of defect sites should translate into high dehydrogenation activities and therefore be excellent candidates for transfer hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we report the combustion synthesis of ceria and sodium-modified ceria using cerium nitrate and cerium/sodium nitrate precursors, respectively. Sodium modification was found to increase the number of redox active sites on the surface that lead to 2-propanol dehydrogenation. Palladium was supported on both materials and their activity for phenol transfer hydrogenation using potentially renewable 2-propanol [49] is reported. Keeping along the lines of sustainable biomass upgrading, the reactions were run in liquid flow mode, which has the added advantages of high throughput and catalyst recycling efficiency [50]."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Catalysis,"2.1 Catalysis Ceria (CeO2) and the cerium-sodium oxide material (Ce-Na) with nominal 20at.% Na loading were prepared using a modified solution combustion synthesis (SCS) with Pluronic polymer as fuel and metal nitrate salts. The SCS method was chosen due to its precedence for forming homogeneous multi-metal oxide composites [51]. Palladium was deposited onto Ce-Na (Pd/Ce-Na) and CeO2 (Pd/CeO2) through impregnation with palladium(II) acetate, followed by oxidative and reductive thermal treatments at 350°C. The physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized supports and catalyst are summarized in Table S1. The liquid flow transfer hydrogenation of phenol using 2-propanol as the sacrificial hydrogen donor with Pd/Ce-Na and Pd/CeO2 catalysts proceeded through the formation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol in various proportions depending on reaction conditions (Table 1 ). Both catalysts displayed outstanding stability during 7-day continuous catalytic runs (Fig.1 a). However, Pd/Ce-Na showed a marked increase in transfer hydrogenation activity over Pd/CeO2. For instance, under the conditions given in Table 1 for Entries 2 and 7, the rate of phenol conversion was nearly five times higher over Pd/Ce-Na than Pd/CeO2 and about six times as high for Entries 5 and 10. As evident from Table 1, Pd/Ce-Na showed higher phenol conversion rates under all the reaction conditions tested. Both catalysts showed initial deactivation attributed to decreased surface area and/or Pd dispersion with TOS (Table S2). Pd/CeO2 showed a higher initial deactivation than Pd/Ce-Na likely owing to operation of the latter near equilibrium conversion (83% conversion) and better catalyst stability (Table S2). For Pd/Ce-Na, the ketone to alcohol yield ratio (K:A) varied from about 10:90 to 40:60 through control of the flow rate and phenol concentration (Table 1, Entries 1–5). The ketone yield was more or less constant when varying these parameters, while the alcohol yield was more sensitive to these variations (Table 1, Entries 1–5). For Pd/CeO2, the K:A ratio was larger than for Pd/Ce-Na, giving almost exclusively the ketone (Table 1, Entries 6–10). Both catalysts showed a higher conversion rate as the 2-propanol-water ratio was increased. Interestingly, neat 2-propanol resulted in a monotonic, yet significant decrease in conversion rate as a function of time over both catalysts which was not observed in the presence of water (Fig. S1). Washing the catalysts with water overnight at 140°C after the reaction in neat 2-propanol resulted in regeneration of the original activity. This suggests that the decreased activity may be related to hydroxyl disproportionation, which results in the removal of lattice oxygen through water formation [52–55]. In absence of water, the hydroxyl disproportionation equilibrium lies to the right in Scheme S1, giving oxygen deficient ceria, which is a poor oxidation catalyst [52]. The regeneration data imply that water is able to dissociatively adsorb on partially reduced ceria [55–57], and shift the equilibrium in Scheme S1 to the left. Thus, water appears to be a necessary component to maintain hydroxyl disproportionation equilibrium in a way that favors the redox process. Arrhenius plots were constructed for [phenol]=0.1M and the apparent activation barriers for phenol conversion over Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Ce-Na were 115±3kJmol−1 and 48±2kJmol−1, respectively (Fig.1b). Physicochemical properties are often invoked to explain differences in activity and were found to be similar for both catalysts after the reaction (Table S3). That is, the specific surface area of Pd/CeO2 decreased by an order of magnitude over the course of the reaction, which made it comparable to Pd/Ce-Na. Likewise, the Pd dispersion value on both catalysts decreased to about 10% during time-on-stream, suggesting that Na does not enhance Pd dispersion [58,59]. Both catalysts showed the same Pd loadings before and after reaction, which is consistent with the long-term catalyst stability. The similar post-reaction physicochemical properties between the catalysts suggest that sodium modification was able to promote transfer hydrogenation activity. In order to understand the role of sodium promotion more clearly, preferential attention was given to support characterization. The role of palladium was studied where deemed relevant."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization Elemental analysis of as-synthesized Ce-Na support confirmed sodium was present at 18at.% and agreed well with nominal loading of 20at.% (Table 2 , Entry 1). DRIFTS (Figs. S2–S4) and XPS (Fig. S5) analysis showed that sodium was present as a carbonate. ICP analysis of Ce-Na after continuous-flow aqueous treatment at room temperature for twelve hours showed a drastic reduction in sodium content from 18 to 4.0at.% (Table 2, Entries 1, 3), with most soluble sodium species removed after two hours during washing (Fig. S6). The data presented in Fig. S6 were obtained after washing the material at catalytic temperatures (i.e. 140°C) and showed a further decrease in sodium loading to 2.6at.% (Table 2, Entry 4). Quite surprisingly, sodium was retained even after 7days on stream (Table 2, Entry 5). While ICP analysis confirmed the presence of sodium after washing, XPS (Fig. S5g) indicated that there were minimal amounts of sodium on the surface, suggesting that sodium species are contained within the material. Bearing in mind the aqueous conditions used during catalysis, all Ce-Na and Pd/Ce-Na characterizations were performed after aqueous washing at room temperature (Table 2, Entry 3). The PXRD pattern of the supports (Fig.2 a) and catalysts (Fig. S7) exhibited diffraction peaks that could be indexed to the fluorite structure of ceria, with no other reflections observed. The absence of sodium-containing reflections (e.g. Na2O, Na2CO3) in the diffraction pattern suggests that sodium species could be amorphous or have a crystallite size below the detection limit of the instrument. Since XPS analysis indicated that sodium was not present on or near the surface, it is also possible that sodium was doped into the ceria matrix. Rietveld analysis showed no significant difference in lattice constant between Ce-Na and CeO2 (Table 2, Entries 1–3). The identical lattice constants between Ce-Na and CeO2 could be an indication that residual sodium species were not contained within the bulk ceria lattice. Alternatively, it could reflect the similar sizes of Ce4+ (0.97Å) [60] and Na+ (0.99Å) [60], which has been observed for Pr-(0.99Å) [60] doped ceria [61,62]. The identical lattice parameters from PXRD analysis were also supported by HR-TEM imaging for several crystallites of Ce-Na that gave an average d-spacing of 0.31±0.03nm (Fig. S8). This value corresponds to the (111) surface termination and is also the predominant facet observed for CeO2 (Fig. S9) [15]. The result rules out structural promotion (i.e. surface termination) for the higher rate of phenol turnover and lower activation barrier for conversion. Given the comparable size of sodium and cerium (IV) cations, PXRD may not be suitable for determining whether sodium was doped into the ceria lattice. In direct contrast to PXRD, which primarily gives information related to the cationic sublattice, Raman spectra of fluorite-type oxides are sensitive to bulk oxygen lattice vibrations, which are related to MO bond symmetry and defects. The Raman spectra for CeO2 and Ce-Na are shown in Fig.2b. Both samples exhibited Raman bands around 462cm−1 and were attributed to the F2g triply degenerate Raman-active phonon of the cubic CeO2-fluorite phase [41,63,64]. This band can be viewed as a symmetrical stretching vibration of the oxygen atoms surrounding a cerium cation (i.e. CeO8). Thus, the location of the band is sensitive to the MO bond lengths and symmetry present in ceria-based materials [62,64]. The band positions for the two materials were identical suggesting similar bond lengths in accordance with the lattice constants obtained from PXRD analysis. Both samples also exhibited bands around 600cm−1 that have been suggested to result from the presence of intrinsic oxygen defects [41]. The ratio between the defect band (D-band) and the F2g band (i.e. A D:A F2g) is used to compare the amounts of intrinsic defects between different ceria-based materials [41,65]. Ce-Na showed a higher A D:A F2g ratio (1.7×) indicating more defects compared to CeO2 even with the former having a larger crystallite size [64]. However, the exact nature of these defects, either vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel) or Ce3+ substitutional in an octahedral environment, is still debated [41,63]. Another defect band around 570cm−1 has been observed for ceria during thermal treatment under reducing environments and is attributed to oxygen vacancies formed during reduction (i.e. extrinsic oxygen vacancies) [44]. The same band has also been observed upon substitutional doping of cerium cations with aliovalent metals and is thought to result from charge compensation and is thus associated with extrinsic oxygen vacancies [62]. The absence of this band in Ce-Na suggests that sodium is not acting as a substitutional dopant that exhibits charge-compensation. Charge compensation through formation of Na+-Ce3+ cationic pairs could also be possible and would not involve formation of oxygen vacancies. However, this motif would be expected to result in differences of lattice constant between the two materials due to the larger ionic radius of Ce3+, which was not observed in PXRD analysis. Thus, the PXRD and Raman data together suggest that sodium was not acting as a dopant. Structural analysis of the Ce-Na support indicated that sodium was not contained within the ceria lattice, but it was shown through chemical analysis that sodium species are still present even after washing with water at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time (Table 2). Considering that the predominant sodium species before washing were carbonates, the residual sodium may be in the form of carbonates that are trapped at the grain boundaries within the bulk of the particles (Table S1, Fig. S8). Fig. S10 shows the CO2-TPD profile while monitoring the heat flow and weight loss for the Ce-Na support. The TGA-DSC-MS analysis showed two high temperature CO2 desorption peaks around 700–800°C and 900–1100°C. The former CO2 desorption peak was exothermic while the latter was endothermic. The exothermic transition with evolution of CO2 suggests carbonate decomposition and likely arises from sodium carbonate decay. Anhydrous sodium carbonate is known to decompose at temperatures higher than 800°C, but metal oxide additives have been shown to lower the decomposition temperature [66]. Furthermore, the decomposition of sodium carbonate is an exothermic process in agreement with the thermal data and is expected to result in the formation of sodium oxide. The endothermic CO2 evolution peak could be due to CO2 desorbing from sodium oxide. The total weight loss from the onset of the exothermic transition to the end of the endothermic transition (i.e. 700–1100°C), assuming sodium carbonate decomposition, allowed an estimation of residual sodium to be 3.8at.%. This result is in excellent agreement with that obtained from elemental analysis (Table 2, Entry 3). Furthermore, XPS depth-profiling experiments showed that the Na 1s binding energy was characteristic of sodium carbonate (Fig. S11) [67]. Thus, it appears that the insoluble sodium fraction was sodium carbonate and that it was largely inaccessible to water (Table 2). 23Na solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy was also performed on the Ce-Na support. 23Na is a 100% naturally abundant I =3/2 quadrupolar nucleus which normally gives rise to relatively narrow solid-state NMR spectra. The 23Na spin echo SSNMR spectrum of Ce-Na support possessed a relatively broad, featureless resonance (Fig. S12A). A 2D triple quantum multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) experiment suggested that the broadening of the 23Na SSNMR spectrum was primarily due to a distribution of isotropic 23Na chemical shifts in the range of 10 to −10ppm; broadening from the second order quadrupolar interaction was minimal (Fig. S12A). This suggests that there are many distinct sodium sites/environments, and within these sites the sodium ions must reside at sites of relatively high spherical symmetry (i.e., pseudo-octahedral coordination environments). A 23Na{1H} rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) experiment was performed to assess the spatial proximity of the Na ions to protons. The REDOR experiment indicates that ca. 60% of the Na ions are proximate (within 5Å) of 1H nuclei (Fig. S12B and Fig. S12C). This would suggest that the majority of the sodium carbonate is present as a hydrated phase or nearby to sorbed water. This is perhaps to be expected since the Ce-Na support was thoroughly washed to remove excess Na. Several distinct crystalline anhydrous and hydrated sodium carbonate phases have previously been reported [68,69]. Therefore, the range of isotropic 23Na chemical shifts most likely arises from the presence of a variety of hydrated and anhydrous sodium carbonate phases/environments. Keeping the XPS results in mind, these sodium carbonate phases are likely trapped in between the ceria grains. The role of residual sodium carbonate during catalysis remains unclear. The insolubility under aqueous conditions at elevated temperatures for 7days suggests that it is not accessible to the environment and thus should not participate directly in the catalysis. To better understand the role of sodium carbonate a control sample was prepared through impregnation of CeO2 with aqueous NaNO3 (20at.%) followed by calcination at 450°C (Na/CeO2). Pd was then deposited on the support (Pd/Na/CeO2). It is expected that decomposition of the sodium precursor should yield surface sodium carbonate species that are easily removed with water and thus clarify the role of sodium carbonate. Quite remarkably, the control catalyst was slightly more active than Pd/Ce-Na (Fig. S13). ICP analysis revealed that Pd/Na/CeO2 contained 1.1 Na-at.% after reaction, which is about a 60% decrease of Na content compared to Pd/Ce-Na (Table 2, Entry 5). XPS depth profiling experiments showed that the Na 1s binding energy for Na/CeO2 (washed with water at room temperature) was consistent with sodium carbonate (Fig. S14). The result suggests that the physical amount of sodium carbonate during catalysis does not affect activity, at least from about 1–3 Na-at.%. Although the results provide some insight into the role of sodium carbonate, they are not conclusive. Considering that bulk characterization techniques did not support the formation of sodium-doped ceria and that the physical amount of sodium carbonate doesn’t appear to correlate with activity, it is possible that sodium modification affects the surface properties of the material. XPS analysis was conducted on both supports to probe possible electronic structure differences that could provide insight into the different catalytic activities. The Ce 3d spectral region (Fig. S15a) showed characteristic peaks attributed to Ce(IV) [70–73], with no obvious difference between the two supports. The O 1s spectral region shown in Fig. S15b displayed subtle differences between CeO2 and Ce-Na. The O 1s spectrum peak maximum, assigned to lattice oxygen, shifted from 529.5eV (CeO2) to 529.3eV (Ce-Na). The shift signifies, on average, a more electron-rich environment of lattice oxygens. Since sodium is present it would seem plausible that the apparent increased oxygen electron density for Ce-Na could be due to higher material basicity, which has been observed for other metal oxides modified with sodium [74,75] and could explain the different reaction rates observed. However, the basic properties and CH activating ability [76] of the two materials were found to be identical by testing with basicity probes and base-catalyzed reactions (Figs. S16–S18, Tables S4–S5). For completeness, the acidic properties were also found to be unmodified (Figs. S19 and 20). These data indicate that the acid-base properties for Ce-Na were unaltered relative to CeO2 and that these reactivity descriptors are not relevant for the activity difference observed during phenol transfer hydrogenation."
4,Redox properties and kinetic analysis,"2.3 Redox properties and kinetic analysis The most notable reactivity descriptor for ceria-based materials is the redox property. The redox property of ceria correlates with the number of defects within the material, especially as they relate to oxygen vacancies [20,35,41,42,44,77]. Since 2-propanol oxidation is a prerequisite for phenol turnover, the 2-propanol reactivity over both CeO2 and Ce-Na was studied. The temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of 2-propanol was used to determine the relationship between acetone formation and the transfer hydrogenation activity of the two materials. At this point it should be noted that 2-propanol was adsorbed dissociatively [52,78–80] on both materials as evidenced by two ν(CO) stretching bands at 1162 and 1132cm−1 corresponding to end-on and bridging coordination of isopropoxide to cerium cations, respectively (Fig. S21). The materials were saturated ex situ with 2-propanol and heated under Ar while monitoring evolved 2-propanol (m/z =45), acetone (m/z =43, 58), and propylene (m/z =41). The characteristic acetone signal at m/z =58, whose intensity is weak relative to the somewhat uncharacteristic signal at m/z =43, was monitored to ensure that the signal at m/z =43 is primarily due to acetone desorption. The identical profiles observed for all samples at m/z =43 and m/z =58 indicate that the intensity of the m/z =43 signal is primarily due to evolved acetone (Fig. S22). Fig.3 a and b shows the 2-propanol, acetone, and propylene signal intensity profile versus temperature for CeO2 and Ce-Na, respectively. For CeO2, acetone desorption occurred over a broad temperature range. Onset desorption occurred around 50°C and continued to about 320°C. There were two major desorption maxima centered at 133°C and 237°C, with a significant shoulder around 300°C. Unreacted 2-propanol also desorbed over a broad temperature range spanning 50–275°C, with two maxima observed at 105°C and 208°C slightly below the acetone maxima. A small propylene desorption was found at 307°C. For Ce-Na, onset desorption also occurred around 50°C with a dominant acetone desorption maximum at 150°C and a significant shoulder at 228°C. Unreacted 2-propanol desorbed over 50–250°C with single maximum at 120°C. There were negligible amounts of propylene observed. The signals corresponding to acetone (m/z =58) for Ce-Na and CeO2 were normalized to the material mass and are shown in Fig.3c. The formation rate of acetone is clearly higher on Ce-Na indicated by the increased slope before the first maximum. Curiously, the temperature at maximum acetone desorption was similar for Ce-Na and CeO2. In addition, both materials showed an acetone desorption shoulder around 240°C. Typically, the desorption maximum is proportional to the activation energy for the rate limiting step. This implies that the higher rate of acetone formation observed for TPSR of 2-propanol on Ce-Na was not due to a reduced activation barrier during an elementary reaction step. This result also indicates that the higher rate can be attributed to more active sites present on the surface of Ce-Na in spite of the large difference in surface area between the two materials. According to Redhead [81,82], the activation energy of acetone formation on the two materials using the first desorption maximum was 106±21kJmol−1 and 101±20kJmol−1 for Ce-Na and CeO2, respectively. Considering that formation of adsorbed isopropoxide occurs at room temperature (Fig. S21) and that acetone shows little affinity for the surface of ceria above room temperature [52], it seems likely the observed activation barrier is due to CH scission of adsorbed isopropoxide to form acetone. This elementary reaction step is a redox process implying that there are more redox active centers on Ce-Na and that these redox centers are equivalent. The relative areas of the mass-normalized acetone TPD-MS profiles on the two supports showed 2.9× more acetone evolving from Ce-Na, suggesting that this support had about three times more 2-propanol dehydrogenation sites than CeO2. Additionally, the 2-propanol desorption profile for the two supports indicated a higher amount of desorbed 2-propanol on Ce-Na (Fig.3d). TPSR of adsorbed 2-propanol clearly showed that the rate of acetone formation is higher for Ce-Na than for CeO2, but the actual catalytic conditions are quite different and the reactant-limited TPSR results of the supports may not be representative during catalysis. Therefore, the rate of acetone formation under catalytic conditions was monitored by trapping with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and quantified using 1H NMR. The acetone formation rate was monitored at 140°C under liquid flow conditions with 90 v/v% aqueous 2-propanol. For CeO2 and Ce-Na the rates were 7μmolg−1 h−1 and 13μmolg−1 h−1, respectively (Table 3 , Entries 1, 2). For Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Ce-Na, the average acetone formation rate observed over three trials was 2920±80μmolg−1 h−1 and 6270±40μmolg−1 h−1, respectively (Table 3, Entries 3, 4). The increased 2-propanol dehydrogenation rate of both catalysts was likely due to the activity of Pd for 2-propanol dehydrogenation [83]. The TPSR study of adsorbed 2-propanol over the supports indicated that the average acetone formation rate (i.e. from 40 to 400°C) was about three times higher over Ce-Na, which was more than observed with the catalysts under catalytic conditions (2.1×). However, the TPSR study spanned a much broader temperature range than the catalytic study and is an average over each temperature within that range. Comparing the two y-maxima (130–150°C) from the TPSR TPD-MS curve for evolved acetone (Fig.3c) should indicate the relative dynamic acetone formation rate under reaction conditions (Table 3, Entries 3, 4). The relative maxima for evolved acetone between the two materials from TPSR of 2-propanol (2.4×) was in good agreement for the relative rates under dynamic liquid conditions using the catalysts (2.1×). Thus, given the acetone formation rates for the supports, it appears that palladium increases the acetone formation rate over both catalysts more or less equally, but the support largely dictates the difference in the observed acetone formation rate. The similar 2-propanol dehydrogenation rate ratios between the supports and catalysts (Table 2, Entry 3 and 5, respectively) indicate that the amount of sodium species does not significantly affect dehydrogenation activity and that sodium carbonates are mere spectators in the reaction. This is also consistent with sodium species residing below the surface. Although there was a clear enhancement in the rate of evolved acetone for Pd/Ce-Na, it did not match the difference in phenol transfer hydrogenation rates observed (3-6×). To ensure that our assumption of a one-to-one acetone to molecular hydrogen stoichiometric relationship was valid, the amount of acetone formed during phenol transfer hydrogenation was measured under the conditions found in Table 1, Entries 2, 7. The evolved acetone for Pd/Ce-Na and Pd/CeO2 was 3680μmolg−1 h−1 and 576μmolg−1 h−1, respectively (Table 3, Entries 5, 6). These results agree well with the expected amount of acetone that should be formed considering the yield of products (Table 3). A series of kinetic experiments were run to understand the cause of the lower activation barrier for Pd/Ce-Na (Fig.1b) since 2-propanol TPSR suggested that there should be no difference. The experimental data showed that the acetone formation rate over both catalysts decreased in presence of phenol, likely due to their affinity for the same adsorption sites [15,52]. However, the relative percent decrease was much more severe over Pd/CeO2 (80%) than over Pd/Ce-Na (33%) (Table 3). In addition, the difference between phenol conversion rates for the two catalysts increased with phenol concentration (Table 1). These results suggest that the difference in apparent activation barrier may be related to the barrier for 2-propanol adsorption in the presence of phenol. Here, we are assuming that the surface kinetics follow Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism for competitive binding. That is, increasing the phenol concentration should lead to higher binding site occupancy, which would hinder 2-propanol adsorption and limit turnover. Evidence for this type of behavior was obtained by monitoring the phenol conversion rate as a function of phenol concentration (Fig. 4 ). Both materials showed a nonlinear dependence of rate versus phenol concentration at conversions less than unity. The reaction rate profiles are characteristic for competitive adsorption [82]. The rate data also suggest there are more 2-propanol/phenol adsorption sites that lead to phenol turnover on Pd/Ce-Na shown by the up- and rightward shift of the rate profile relative to Pd/CeO2. That is, if the amount of 2-propanol/phenol adsorption sites was equal, the curve would be expected to shift straight up due to the increased number of redox active sites previously shown. This was supported through phenol adsorption isotherms that showed there were more phenol/2-propanol adsorption sites on the Ce-Na support even with the surface area of CeO2 being five times greater (Fig.5 a). The y-intercept of the linear region was taken as the approximate monolayer coverage and gave 77μmolg−1 and 36μmolg−1 for Ce-Na and CeO2, respectively. This ratio (2.1) agrees well with the mass normalized area summation of all monitored reactants and products from the TPSR-MS profiles for Ce-Na and CeO2 (2.4) (Fig.3c and d). Furthermore, the ratio is identical to the ratio of acetone formation rates observed over the two catalysts in the absence of phenol (Table 3, Entries 3, 4). Although the latter comparison is made between the supports and catalysts, it does suggest that the phenol adsorption sites are the same as 2-propanol and that these adsorption sites are active for 2-propanol dehydrogenation. Further evidence for the apparent activation barrier arising from the barrier for 2-propanol adsorption in presence of phenol was obtained by monitoring the phenol conversion rate as a function of aqueous 2-propanol concentration. Under the reaction conditions shown in Fig. S23, the apparent order for 2-propanol during the transfer hydrogenation of phenol over Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Ce-Na was 3.7 and 0.9, respectively. The dependence of phenol conversion rate on the 2-propanol concentration over both catalysts indicates that water competes for the same binding sites as 2-propanol/phenol. The higher dependence of conversion rate on 2-propanol concentration for Pd/CeO2 is consistent with phenol blocking a larger percentage of 2-propanol adsorption sites (i.e. Langmuir-Hinshelwood competitive binding) since all other conditions are equal. This was also made apparent by the drastic color change of CeO2 in the presence of a 2-propanol/phenol solution (Fig. S24) [15]. If the observed activation barrier for phenol transfer hydrogenation reflects the adsorption barrier for 2-propanol, the apparent activation energy should be a function of phenol concentration. Thus, Arrhenius plots were constructed to determine the variation of activation energy as a function of phenol (Fig.5b). Indeed, at high concentrations of phenol, Pd/Ce-Na showed an apparent activation barrier of 110kJmol−1 while at low concentrations Pd/CeO2 gave 54kJmol−1. The transition from low to high activation barrier occurs at higher phenol concentrations for the Pd/Ce-Na catalyst. This is consistent with the Ce-Na support having more hydroxyl group binding sites than the CeO2 support and suggests that the high activation barrier over both catalysts is due to the 2-propanol adsorption barrier in the presence of phenol. The higher amount of phenol/2-propanol adsorption and redox sites is likely related to the higher amount of O-vacancies observed from Raman studies (Fig.2b) [46,47,54]."
5,Conclusions,"The 2-propanol dehydrogenation activity of ceria is enhanced through modification with sodium by increasing the number of adsorption and redox active sites. This effect was an intrinsic property of the Ce-Na support and independent of Pd. Sodium is neither on the surface of the active material nor is it doped into ceria, but exists likely as a subsurface carbonate species of varying degrees of hydration. Deposition of palladium onto ceria and sodium-modified ceria provides catalysts active for the transfer hydrogenation of phenol using 2-propanol. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of phenol was conducted in flow mode and required water for stability. The higher activity of the sodium-modified catalyst was attributed to the higher amount of 2-propanol/phenol adsorption sites and redox sites active for 2-propanol dehydrogenation. The apparent activation energy transitioned from low to high upon increasing phenol concentration over both catalysts and was attributed to the barrier for 2-propanol adsorption. This transition occurred at higher phenol concentrations for Pd/Ce-Na owing to the higher amount of substrate adsorption sites. Additional studies are in progress to determine the precise location of Na in the catalyst and the mechanism by which it increases the number of adsorption and redox-active sites on ceria. Nonetheless, the enhancement of hydroxyl adsorption and redox active sites on ceria through facile sodium modification is expected to be broadly applicable to other ceria-based catalysis."
