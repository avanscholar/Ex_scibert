0,Introduction,"Semiconductor photocatalysts are attracting intense research attention and offer an eco-friendly route for the complete degradation of pollutants, production of hydrogen (H2) from water as well as conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons [1–3]. TiO2 has been widely adopted as one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its excellent properties such as nontoxicity, stability, and high photocatalytic activity, etc. However, the dependence of efficient photoactivity of TiO2 on ultraviolet light limits its overall applications owing to the wide band gap. Since wang et al. [4] reported the new metal-free polymeric semiconductor graphite carbon nitride for an efficient visible-light-induced photocatalysis, it has been extensively employed owing to its high chemical, thermal stability and narrow band gap (~2.7eV). Nevertheless, pure g-C3N4 gives low visible-light-induced photocatalytic performance due to its high recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole (e−/h+) pairs and low specific surface area [5]. With the continuously growing comprehensive applications of visible-light-induced photocatalysts, researchers and scholars have shown great interest in Bi2WO6 due to its inherent structural and physicochemical properties [6–8]. Bi2WO6 is one of the most attractive photocatalysts in O2 evolution [9,10], and in the Aurivillius oxide family the decomposition of organic contaminants is very simple [11]. Nonetheless, the rapid recombination of the photo-induced e−/h+ pairs prevents the photocatalytic activity to some extent [12]. Extensive efforts have been put forwarded for integrating Bi2WO6 with g-C3N4 to reduce the possibilities of recombination so as to enhance the photocatalytic performance. A hydrothermal approach was employed by Wei et al. to synthesize Bi2WO6 hierarchical microspheres modified with g-C3N4 [13]. The Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructures were synthesized and investigated by Yin et al. [14] and other researchers [15–17]. Though the composite system of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 photocatalyst outperforms the single component systems g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6, it is not easy to recycle and separate multicomponent photocatalysts from the aqueous solution. Hence, an economical and facile approach should be developed for efficient recycling of the coupled Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Here we report, an efficient alternate method of synthesizing magnetically retrievable Bi2WO6 based composite photocatalyst using Fe3O4@SiO2 microspheres. The hierarchical composites of Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6@g-C3N4 displayed better photocatalytic activity and recoverability. Thus it is noteworthy to estimate that the composites of the Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 and magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2 cores can provide the multifunctional photocatalyst of better photoactivity and recoverability. To the best of our knowledge, to date, no reports are found for the magnetically recoverable Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 composites. In the present work, a hydrothermal approach is employed to synthesize a new Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Moreover, RhB degradation and the production of H2 from water were carried out to evaluate the visible-light-induced photocatalytic activities for various samples."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure,"2.1 Synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure All the raw materials were brought from Sino pharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Following the approaches reported previously [18] the magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2 (FS) cores were prepared and improved using 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane (APTES). Subsequently, magnetic cores were dispersed in the diluted HNO3 solution for a quick protonated process. A layer of positive chargers was formed on the surface [19]. Synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 (FSBG) heterostructure in Scheme 1: The positively charged Fe3O4@SiO2 cores (0.10g) were aged for 60min after the addition of aqueous solution of Na2WO4 (4mM, 100mL) which enables the surface of modified Fe3O4@SiO2 cores to absorb WO4 2− ions through electrostatic interactions. The obtained black precipitate was separated magnetically, washed with deionized water, and then dispersed in 65mL of aqueous solution with 5mL of 6M HNO3. The solution was added to the mixture of 0.092g of g-C3N4, 0.165g of Na2WO4·2H2O and 0.485g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and the suspension was heated at 180°C for 24h after being sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The final product was magnetically separated, followed by drying at 80°C for 12h. Thus the composites of magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 (FSBG) were obtained. The hierarchical microspheres of Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6 (FSB) were synthesized using the same method for comparative study without the addition of g-C3N4."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using D8, Bruker AXS X-ray diffractometer, Germany. The surface morphology of samples was monitored using the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) and energy dispersive spectroscope. The porous structures and the specific surface areas (SBET) were studied on a nitrogen adsorption apparatus at 77K (JW-BK122W, China). The BaSO4 based reference sample was used to measure the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) on spectrophotometer of Shimadzu UV-2550. Using a standard configuration of three-electrode system, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the surface photocurrent (SPC) spectra were collected at room temperature by an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-660C, CH Instruments Co.). The samples are employed as working electrodes, a platinum wire as counter electrode was set parallel to the working electrodes and the saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode [5,8,19,20]. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were evaluated at room temperature by Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 425nm of excitation wavelength."
4,Photocatalytic evaluation,"2.3 Photocatalytic evaluation The photocatalytic degradation test was performed with the Rhodamine B (RhB, 20ppm, 100mL) and the catalysts (100mg) under a high-stress Xe-lamp (350W) with a cut-off filter (λ>420nm). In order to attain adsorption equilibrium between the RhB and photocatalysts, the suspensions were stirred for 60min in darkness and then illuminated by lamp. 1.6mL of solutions was withdrawn after 10min of illumination and centrifuged. After being diluted for four times, the variation in absorption bands at 554nm was recorded and the clear solutions were studied by a spectrophotometer of Shimadzu UV-2550. During the process of photoreaction, the function of major active species, such as superoxide radical (•O2−), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and holes (h+) were investigated by the addition of 1,4-Benzoquinone (BQ), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), and disodium ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA). The PL technique and coumarin as probe molecule were used to detect the content of • OH. The 100mg of present photocatalyst was suspended in 100mL aqueous solution with 15vol% of triethanolamine (TEOA). The experiments of H2 production were carried out at ambient temperature (6°C) in a Labsolar-III (AG) photocatalytic reactor, which was connected to a closed gas-circulation system. The gas chromatography was used to analyze the evolved gases. The H2 production experiments of g-C3N4@Ag@MoS2 were performed for every 4h and repeated for 5 times to test the stability."
5,Results and discussion,"The X-ray diffraction patterns of various catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. The comparative structural studies of g-C3N4, Fe3O4, FS and the FSB hierarchical microspheres were carried. The pure g-C3N4 has shown two significant XRD peaks at around 27.3° and 13.1°, correspond to the (002) and (100) reflections, respectively [13,15]. The diffraction peaks from the FSB composites are considered to be pertaining to the cubic Fe3O4 cores (JCPDS no. 65–3107) and orthorhombic Bi2WO6 (JCPDS no. 39–0256) [19,21]. The hierarchical composite of FSBG also exhibits similar diffraction peaks but broader than that of FSB indicating the formation of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure [16], in addition a peak that correspond to (101) plane of g-C3N4 is also observable. Fig. 2 displays the morphology and microstructure of the Fe3O4, FS, FSB, and FSBG photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 2a, the pristine Fe3O4 products show spherical morphology with a diameter of ~500nm. SiO2 coated Fe3O4 (Fig. 2b), has not revealed any significant variation in its overall morphology, while an obvious core-shell structure can be clearly observed. The magnified TEM image (Fig. 2c) of FSBG composites reveals a typical structure of grape-like microspheres of average diameter of 1.4µm. Plenty of square shaped nanosheets of Bi2WO6 which linked mutually to each other are found to be dispersed on the surface of microspheres. Fig. 2d represents a peculiar morphology of FSBG, where the g-C3N4 is dispersed on the surface of Bi2WO6 in the outer shell and the black semicircle is adhered to the cores of Fe3O4@SiO2. Fig. 2e describes the lattice planes of component materials of the composite. The inter-planar distances corresponded to the (113) plane of Bi2WO6 and the (002) plane of g-C3N4 are ~0.315nm and ~0.323nm, respectively. The EDS (Fig. 2f) demonstrates that the grape-like FSBG microspheres consisting of the elements of Fe, W, Bi, O, C and N. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 sheets exist on the surface of FSBG microspheres and thus form a heterostructure during the growth of the Bi2WO6 nanosheets. The pore-size distribution curves (inset) and isotherms of nitrogen adsorption-desorption are taken for the FSBG hierarchical microspheres. Fig. 3 describes type IV isotherms of H3 hysteresis loop. This renders the emergence of mesopores of slit-shape [18]. The composites of FSBG possess small mesopores and the average pore size of ~11.33nm. The specific surface area and the pore volume of FSBG are 36.56m2/g and 18.81×10−2 cm3/g, respectively, which are larger than that of composites of FSB (30.92m2/g and 8.79×10−2 cm3/g). This suggests an introduction of more mesopores by the modification of g-C3N4 into the grape-like FSBG microspheres which may lead to improve the photocatalytic activity [22]. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the present samples are presented in Fig. 4. The pure Bi2WO6 demonstrates the characteristic light absorption spanning from ultraviolet region to visible region. Note that Bi2WO6 is suitable for visible-light-induced photocatalytic decomposition of contaminants [23]. Due to the introduction of Fe3O4 which has black body properties that has broad absorption in the visible, the FB and FSB show a stronger absorption than pure Bi2WO6 in the visible region which suggests that the composite catalysts can harness more visible light than pure Bi2WO6. The surface photocurrent (SPC) response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to probe the efficiency of the photo-induced charge separation. Fig. 5 shows the SPC response of the present samples. The visible-light-induced photocurrent produced by the pure Fe3O4, FS, Bi2WO6, g-C3N4, FSB, and FSBG electrodes are 0.089, 0.092, 0.296, 0.328, 0.401, and 0.586 μA, respectively. The highest photocurrent observed for FSBG composites suggests an efficient separation and less recombination of photo-induced e−/h+ pairs due to the presence of interfaces. The variation in EIS for the samples is shown in Fig. 6. The diameter of the characteristic semicircular portion of the Nyquist plots represents the surface charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the samples. Smaller the radius, lower the resistance for charge transfer [24,25]. The radius of semicircle is found to be in the order of FSBG<FSB<g-C3N4<Bi2WO6<FS<Fe3O4 (Fig. 6). Therefore, it can be concluded that the FSBG composites have the optimal efficiency of the separation and transfer of photo-induced e−/h+ pairs. The present results are in good agreement with the SPC measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the different samples is measured by the degradation of RhB in Fig. 7. According to the blank test carried out in the absence of catalysts, it can be found that the photolysis process is almost negligible. The FSBG hierarchical microspheres show a maximum photocatalytic activity. The apparent rate constants of g-C3N4, FSB and FSBG are measured as 0.0363min−1, 0.0579min−1 and 0.1109min−1, respectively. The rate of reaction for the FSBG microspheres is 3.06 and 1.92 times of that of g-C3N4 sheets and the FSB composites respectively. It indicates that the photoactivity is appreciably enhanced by Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure for the FSBG hierarchical microspheres. The superior activity of degradation is shown in the photographs of the insets. The concentration of dye solution significantly decreases in comparison with the pristine RhB solution (Fig. 7a and 7b). A transparent solution is obtained (Fig. 7c). The composite FSBG is recycled using an external magnetic field. This demonstrates a sound property of magnetic separation. The improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the formation of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Bi2WO6 stimulates and generates electron-hole pairs when illuminated by the visible light. The photocatalytic activity of FSBG is remarkably improved as the separation efficiency of photo-induced e−/h+ pairs is decreased by the quicker interfacial charge transfer that takes place across the Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure [17,26]. To interpret the mechanism of photodegradation, the trapping experiments were performed and the major active species were evaluated by using three different sacrificial agents during the photodegradation process. The addition of 1mM of BQ effectively suppressed the photocatalytic efficiency of FSBG composites ( Fig. 8). It can be therefore, inferred that the superoxide radicals are the major active species during the RhB photodegradation process. Further, the presence of 1mM of t-BuOH suppresses the efficiency of degradation of RhB from 0.1109min−1 to 0.0681min−1 suggesting that the hydroxyl radical plays a crucial role in the photocatalytic oxidation process. In contrast, the addition of EDTA (1mM) induces minute changes in the photocatalytic activity of FSBG composites, implying a negligible role of the holes and hence holes are not the main oxidation species in the degradation process. The most important active groups in photocatalytic reaction may be Hydroxyl radical (•OH). In order to realize the impact of different samples, the formation rate of •OH radicals was investigated by monitoring the generation of 7-hydroxycoumarin. The •OH radicals are generated from the oxidation of H2O molecules or OH− ions by the electron-induced, photo-based, multi-step decrease of O2 − radicals, or the photo-generated holes (h+) are the main active species accountable for the photocatalytic reaction [27,28]. Fig. 9 illustrates that the intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the amount of produced photo-induced •OH radicals. The FSBG hierarchical microspheres exhibit the strongest PL intensity, which ensures the existence of more •OH radicals on their surface during a span of fixed time (60min). The I-t analysis, reveals an abundance of electrons and holes on the surface of FSBG microspheres, which can easily be caught by the surface adsorbed O2 and H2O resulting the formation of more •OH radicals which further participate the photocatalytic reaction, and thus a higher photoactivity. The present results also reveal that •OH radicals play crucial role in the photocatalytic process. Fig. 10 represents the evolution of hydrogen from the water under visible light irradiation using Triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor, which shows the mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activities of as-prepared photocatalysts. The FSB and FSBG catalysts exhibit significantly higher photoactivity compared to pure g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6. Typically, FSBG catalysts provides an activity of H2 production of 127.61μmol/h, which is about 7.85-fold (16.25μmol/h), 3.89-fold (32.74μmol/h), and 2.31-fold (55.19μmol/h) that of the pure Bi2WO6, pure g-C3N4 and FSB samples, respectively. It can be seen that FSBG hierarchical microspheres composites have Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism. The stability of H2 production by FSBG hierarchical microspheres was also measured. After the fifth run, absence of apparent decline in the rate of hydrogen evolution, implying that the FSBG hierarchical microspheres catalyst possesses excellent recycling stability. In conclusion, a scheme corresponding to the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges in the FSBG composite hierarchical microspheres is put forward and illustrated in Scheme 2. The valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) potentials of g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6 are −1.33eV, 1.38eV, 0.42eV and 3.21eV, respectively [29–31]. Based on the recent reports [15,32,33], it is dominating when the g-C3N4 shell harvested visible light in the FSBG composites, the holes from Bi2WO6 transfer to the VB of g-C3N4 and electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 enter the CB of Bi2WO6 as the earlier is higher than that of the later. Thus, the photo-induced e−/h+ pairs are speared across the different semiconductors, implying the significant increase in the separation and transfer processes of charge carriers. The strong photocatalytic performance may be attributed to the inhibition of carrier's recombination processes. Such heterojunction-transfer mechanism can effectively explain the photodegradation phenomenon of the RhB. However, the mechanism cannot interpret the results shown by FSBG composites in photocatalytic H2 generation. Bi2WO6 shows the poor ability in reducing H+ into H2 which may be due to the position of its CB band edge (−0.05eV). On the other hand, the enhanced photoactivity in the generation of H2 can be explained properly based on Z-scheme transfer mechanism in the case of Bi2WO6@g-C3N4 composites in which the CB of Bi2WO6 transfers the photo-generated electrons in to the VB of g-C3N4 again. The separation of photo-induced e−/h+ pairs can also be efficiently promoted by the process and the electrons still retain in the CB of g-C3N4, while holes in the VB of Bi2WO6. Because of the negative ECB of g-C3N4, these electrons provide strong reducibility and can easily reduce H+ to H2, which agrees well with the results from the experiments of H2 evolution."
6,Conclusion,"A novel Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 hierarchical structure of the microspheres exhibiting sound magnetic recoverability and photocatalytic activity is successfully fabricated. A surface shell of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 composites and a core of Fe3O4@SiO2 constitute the composite photocatalysts. A grape-like Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure was easily built by initiating the support from Fe3O4@SiO2. The Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst exhibits enhanced visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity of the degradation of RhB, when compared with Fe3O4@SiO2@Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4 hierarchical microspheres. The formation of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterostructure is considered to be responsible for the higher photocatalytic performance. A novel synthetic method that involves preparation of other multifunctional composites capable to exhibit improved magnetic recoverability and photocatalytic activity using the magnetic composites is demonstrated. The photocatalyst may have potential applications in the removal of pollutants and overall water splitting."
