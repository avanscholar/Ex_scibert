0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean, renewable and efficient energy carrier which is being considered as a potential alternative to fossil fuels [1,2]. Hydrogen can be produced by thermochemical, electrochemical, and biological processes [3]. The biological processes of dark fermentative hydrogen production have advantages over photo fermentation by having greater hydrogen production rate, greater versatility of the substrates used and ability to operate in the absence of light. The substrates mainly used for dark hydrogen fermentation are carbohydrate-containing feedstocks such as glucose [4,5], sucrose [6,7], and starch [8,9]. Recent research has considered using lignocellulosic materials as potential feedstock for bioenergy production because they are in abundance and locally available [10,11]. Sugars that are obtained in the hydrolysate after the hydrolysis pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials are hexose (glucose) and pentose (xylose and trace amounts of arabinose). Glucose is easily biodegraded during hydrogen fermentation [12] while fermentative hydrogen production from xylose is generally inefficient [13]. Therefore, in order to be able to efficiently utilize the sugars obtained from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials for hydrogen production, hydrogen producers capable of utilizing pentose sugar, especially xylose, are needed. Theoretically, xylose can be converted to hydrogen with a maximum hydrogen yield (HY) of 3.33 mol H2/mol xylose with acetic acid as a by-product (Eq. (1)), or 1.67 mol H2/mol xylose with butyric acid as a by-product (Eq. (2)). (1) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 1 . 67 H 2 O → 1 . 67 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 1 . 67 CO 2 + 3 . 33 H 2 (2) C 5 H 10 O 5 → 0 . 83 C 4 H 8 O 2 + 1 . 67 CO 2 + 1 . 67 H 2 Eqs. (1) and (2) show that in order to improve the HY, an acetic acid end–product reaction is recommended while preventing a butyric acid, lactic acid, or ethanol end–product reaction [6]. This can be achieved by using a high temperature fermentation process. Thermophilic conditions increase the rate of the biochemical process, which could result in a higher HY and a lower variety of fermentation end-products than mesophilic conditions [14]. Normally, a HY of 0.79–2.01 mol H2/mol sugarconsumed can be obtained using mesophiles, while a HY greater than 2.28 mol H2/mol sugarconsumed can be obtained using thermophiles [15,16]. Some thermopiles are able to convert pentose and mixed sugars (pentose and hexose) into hydrogen. For example, the Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain W16 has been reported to simultaneously utilize mixed sugars (xylose and glucose in a ratio of 1:1) and pure xylose to generate hydrogen with a HY of 2.32 mol H2/mol mixed sugarconsumed and 2.19 mol H2/mol xyloseconsumed, respectively [13]. To the best of our knowledge, information on the conversion of xylose into hydrogen by pure culture is still limited. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to isolate, identify and characterize a thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacterium from hot spring sediment that effectively converts xylose into hydrogen. Important factors that affect hydrogen production including nitrogen source, initial pH, temperature and initial xylose concentration were investigated in order to identify the optimum conditions for hydrogen production by pure isolate in batch fermentation. Kinetic parameters for hydrogen production from xylose were also identified. The information from this study could pave the way towards better usage of lignocellulosic materials, especially pentose sugar (xylose), which could subsequently increase the net energy yield of the feedstock."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Enrichment and isolation of a thermophilic hydrogen-producing strain,"2.1 Enrichment and isolation of a thermophilic hydrogen-producing strain Hot spring sediments from Betong, Yala Province, Thailand, (Kindly provided by Dr. Sompong O-Thong, Thaksin University) were used to enrich the thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria. The temperature and pH of the sampling site was 80 °C and 7.80, respectively. The cultivation was conducted under anaerobic conditions in 120 mL serum bottles with a 70 mL working volume. The enrichment broth contained 14 mL of sediment-rich water and 56 mL of basic anaerobic medium (BA medium) [17] plus a glucose/xylose mixture at 5.00 g/L each as a carbon source. The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 6.00 using either 3 N NaOH or 3 N HCl. The bottles were incubated in a 60 °C water bath. Every 2 days, the sub-cultures were conducted by transferring 14 mL of fermentation broth into 56 mL of a fresh BA medium. This process was repeated until a constant HY production was observed in comparison with the previous cultivation. The final enrichment culture was serially diluted (10−1–10−16) in BA medium, solidified by 0.3% (w/v) Gelrite (Kelo) and incubated anaerobically in a 60 °C water bath for 4 days [6]. Single colonies from each dilution series were transferred to a fresh BA medium before being subsequently tested for their hydrogen production performance. Biogas samples were taken every 6 h and analysed using gas chromatography. At the end of cultivation, substrate concentration and pH were measured. The isolate with the highest cumulative hydrogen production was identified and biochemically characterized."
3,Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis,"2.2 Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis Total genomic DNA of selected isolates was extracted using a modified phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol method [18]. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a universal primer set including forward primer PA (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and reverse primer PH (5′-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3′) that corresponded to positions 19–38 and 1541–1561, respectively. The PCR amplification was conducted in a Px2 thermal cycler (Thermo IEC Inc, Milford, MA., USA) using the following protocols: initial denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 95 °C; annealing for 1 min at 55 °C; extension for 2 min at 72 °C; and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C [11]. The PCR products were purified using a Gene JET™ PCR purification Kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA) and sequenced using an ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by searching in GenBank using BLAST [19]. CLUSTAL X was used to align the obtained sequence with sequences of reference microorganisms retrieved from GenBank [20]. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the neighbour-joining method [21] with PHYLIP 3.69 [22]. Bootstrapping analyses [23] for 1000 replicates were performed to estimate the confidence of the tree topologies."
4,Microscopic examination and biochemical tests,"2.3 Microscopic examination and biochemical tests The morphology and characterization of the isolates were determined according to Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology [24]. Gram staining was conducted by the Hucker method [25] and investigated using a light microscope CH-2 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The isolated cells were investigated in the fermentation broth under optimum conditions using a LEO-1455VP scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Leo Electric Systems, Cambridge, UK) at 10 kV. Preparation of the cells for examination by SEM was performed following the method of Woo et al. (2002) [26]. For biochemical characterization, the ability of selected isolates to utilize 5.00 g/L of xylose, arabinose, glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, xylan, starch, cellulose, dextran, pectin, glycerol, yeast extract and peptone were investigated using batch fermentation at 60 °C and initial pH of 6.00."
5,Batch cultivation of the isolate in synthetic medium,"2.4 Batch cultivation of the isolate in synthetic medium The effects of carbon and nitrogen types and sources, initial pH, temperature, and substrate concentration on hydrogen production were investigated using batch fermentation. All fermentation batches were conducted in 120 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 70 mL. The fermentation broth contained 63 mL of sterile BA medium and 10% inoculum (cell concentration of 106 cells/mL) with various kinds of carbon sources and different types and sources of nitrogen. The effect of carbon sources (glucose, xylose, arabinose, xylan, carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), cellulose powder and alpha cellulose) were conducted at a concentration of 10.00 g/L, initial pH of 6.00, and at 60 °C. The effect of the inorganic (urea) and organic (peptone) nitrogen sources were studied at various C/N ratios from 10.00 to 70.00 using 10.00 g/L of suitable carbon source, initial pH of 6.00 and at 60 °C. The effect of pH was then performed at levels from 4.00 to 8.00 (with 0.50 incremental steps) (adjusted by 3N HCl and 3N NaOH) using 10.00 g/L of suitable carbon source, optimum C/N ratio of suitable organic nitrogen source and at 60 °C. Next, the effect of temperature was conducted at various levels from 35 to 70 °C using 10.00 g/L suitable carbon source, optimum C/N ratio of suitable organic nitrogen source and initial pH. Finally, the effect of concentration of suitable carbon source was conducted at various concentrations between 1.00 and 35.00 g/L, optimum C/N ratio of suitable organic nitrogen source and temperature. Biogas samples were taken every 4 h. The fermentation ended when biogas was no longer produced. At the end of fermentation, substrate concentration, pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and biomass concentrations were measured. All experiments were done in triplicates."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Cell dry weight was determined by following the method of Niu et al. [27]. The cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a Biophotometer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). One unit of absorbance measured 0.5731 g dry cell/L. The concentrations of glucose, xylose, arabinose, VFAs (acetic, butyric, propionic and formic acids), and alcohol (ethanol) in the liquid samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu LC-10AD, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector using Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Oven temperature was 45 °C. 5 mM H2SO4 was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The concentrations of CMC, cellulose powder, α-cellulose and xylan were determined using the phenol sulphuric acid method [28]. Total nitrogen was measured using the persulfate method [29]. The volume of the biogas was measured by releasing the pressure in the serum bottles using wetted glass syringes that ranged in size from 20 to 50 mL [30]. The biogas produced was collected every 6 h and analysed for hydrogen content by a Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with a 2 m stainless steel column packed with Shin carbon (50/80 mesh), following the method of Fangkum and Reungsang [31]. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and total volume of hydrogen produced, at each time interval, using the mass balance equation [32]. The volumetric hydrogen production rate (HPR) (mL H2/L h) was calculated from the maximum cumulative hydrogen production (HP) (mL H2/L culture) divided by fermentation time (h). The HP was calculated by the modified Gompertz equation [33]. The molar HPR (mmol H2/L h) was calculated using the ideal gas law as molar HPR = volumetric HPR (mL H2/L h)/(RT), where R = 0.08205784 L atm/K mol, and T = 333 K [34]. The HY (mol H2/mol substrate) was calculated as the total molar amount of hydrogen (mol H2) divided by the molar amount of substrate consumed (mol substrate). Cell growth was investigated based on the simple Monod equation [35]. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was drawn to determine kinetic parameters such as μmax (specific growth rate; h) and K s (half saturation constant; g/L)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Isolation and screening,"3.1 Isolation and screening Among 25 strains isolated, four of them, encoded as KKU7, KKU12, KKU19 and KKU20, efficiently produced hydrogen from mixed glucose/xylose with the cumulative HP in the ranges of 1478 ± 87 to 1826 ± 102 mL H2/L (data not shown). Strain KKU19 showed the highest cumulative HP whereas KKU7 showed the lowest. Hence, strain KKU19 was further examined for its hydrogen production capability."
9,Characterization of the strain KKU19,"3.2 Characterization of the strain KKU19 Strain KKU19 was gram positive, rod shaped, with a length of 2.0–3.0 μm (Fig. 1 ). The cell had rounded ends, occurred singly or in pairs and was spore forming. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (1387 bp) of strain KKU19 was deposited in GenBank (Accession no. JN020648). The 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that strain KKU19 exhibited the highest similarity value of 99% with T. thermosaccharolyticum DSM571 (formerly Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum). The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain KKU19 in the cluster comprising members of the genus Thermoanaerobacterium (Fig. 2 ). The phenotypic characteristics of strain KKU19 were also consistent with those of T. thermosaccharolyticum. Strain KKU19 showed an ability to grow on a wide variety of simple and complex carbohydrates (Table 1 ), which is the characterization of T. thermosaccharolyticum. The bacterium could utilize almost all of the ranges of substrate except rhamnose and dextran, similar to T. thermosaccharolyticum strain DSM571 [36], while except peptone was similar to T. thermosaccharolyticum strain FH1 [37]. The ability of strain KKU19 to utilize the substrate was identical to strain PSU-2 [6]. However, the G + C content of strain KKU19 was 36.8 while the G + C content of strain PSU-2 was 33.2. Therefore, based on the ranges of substrate utilized and 16S rRNA gene analysis, strain KKU19 is considered a new strain within the species of T. thermosaccharolyticum."
10,Effect of carbon sources on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of carbon sources on hydrogen production Various types of carbon based on the types of sugars contained in compositions of lignocellulosic material such as cellulose (glucose, CMC, cellulose powder and alpha cellulose) and hemicelluloses (xylan, xylose, and arabinose) were used to produce hydrogen using KKU19. The maximum cumulative HP and maximum HPR were 2633 ± 96 mL H2/L and 3.44 ± 0.04 mmol H2/L h, respectively, and these results were achieved when xylose was used as the carbon source (Table 2 ). This indicates the ability of KKU19 to use pentose sugar. Strain KKU19 was able to use arabinose and glucose fairly well and could utilize a complex carbohydrate such as xylan, CMC, cellulose powder and α-cellulose. Since strain KKU19 could utilize xylose, cellulose and xylan, the results implied that the production of hydrogen from the hydrolysate of lignocellulosic materials is possible. The ratio of acetic acid to butyric acid was 1.02–1.75, respectively, indicating that hydrogen production by strain KKU19 is an acetate-butyrate type fermentation."
11,Effect of nitrogen type and source,"3.4 Effect of nitrogen type and source The effects of the nitrogen type and source on hydrogen production and cell growth were investigated in batch fermentation. Concentrations of peptone (organic nitrogen source) and urea (inorganic nitrogen source) were varied with total nitrogen concentration from 0.14 to 1.00 g/L, while an initial xylose concentration was fixed at 10.00 g/L. The maximum cumulative HP and HY of 2891 ± 110 mL H2/L and 1.98 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively, were achieved at 4.00 g/L of peptone while the maximum cell dry weight of 1.62 ± 0.04 g/L was achieved at 8.00 g/L of peptone (Table 3 ). At a low concentration of peptone, the peptone was utilized as a nitrogen source for enhancing the cell growth and hydrogen production [38]. However, at a high concentration of peptone, amino acids and proteins in the peptone were used for cell synthesis [39]. The maximum cumulative HP and HY of 1954 ± 108 mL H2/L and 1.34 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively, were achieved at 1.07 g/L of urea, whereas the maximum cell dry weight of 1.41 ± 0.05 g/L was achieved at 2.14 g/L of urea. An increase in cumulative HP and HY was found when the urea concentration was increased from 0.31 to 1.07 g/L. The addition of urea resulted in an increase in alkalinity, which helped to stabilize the pH during hydrogen fermentation. A further increase in urea concentration to 2.14 g/L decreased the cumulative HP and HY. This could be caused by the excess ammonium ions generated from urea degradation which inhibits cell growth and hydrogen production [40]. The production of acetic and butyric acids was at the same level in the organic and inorganic nitrogen-amended media. Propionic acid was not produced in the presence of either the organic or inorganic nitrogen sources (Table 3). Our results indicated that strain KKU19 tends to grow and produce more hydrogen when the medium contains peptone as the nitrogen source. Therefore, peptone is the preferred nitrogen source for the fermentation of xylose by strain KKU19. This is due to the fact that peptone is not only a source of nitrogen but also a source of growth factor, alpha amino acid and salt; urea (inorganic nitrogen source) lacked some of the growth factors that are necessary for microbe growth and hydrogen production [1]."
12,Effect of environmental factors on hydrogen production and cell growth,"3.5 Effect of environmental factors on hydrogen production and cell growth 3.5.1 Effect of initial pH The effects of initial pH on hydrogen production from xylose and cell growth of strain KKU19 were investigated at various initial pHs from 4.00 to 8.00 with an increment of 0.50. The xylose concentration was initially fixed at 10.00 g/L and at 60 °C. The HY, HPR and cell dry weight increased as the initial pH level increased from pH 4.00 to 6.50 and decreased when the initial pH was greater than 6.50 (Fig. 3 A). The maximum HY, HPR and cell dry weight of 2.02 ± 0.12 mol H2/mol xylose, 3.94 ± 0.25 mmol H2/L h and 1.34 ± 0.16 g/L, respectively, were obtained at the initial pH level of 6.50. This agreed with the results of Fang et al. [8], who reported that the initial pH value of 6.25–6.50 was the optimum initial pH range for hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum. At the initial pH level of 4.00, strain KKU19 could not produce hydrogen from xylose. This may have been due to the protonation of undissociated weak acid in the medium, where the higher H+ concentration could pass through the cell membrane into the cytoplasms and inhibit the growth of microorganisms and their ability to produce hydrogen [41]. Too high or too low pH inhibited the activity of FeFe-hydrogenase, resulting in low hydrogen production [42]. Khanal et al. (2004) [33] reported that a low initial pH of 4.50 caused a long lag phase. Conversely, a high initial pH of 9.00 decreased the lag phase, but yielded a low hydrogen production [9]. The dominant SMPs of hydrogen fermentation were acetic, butyric, and propionic acids and ethanol (Fig. 4 A). At a low initial pH level, ethanol was the main SMPs whereas acetic acid was the main SMPs at a high initial pH level. The pH level could affect the metabolic pathway of microorganisms. Lenz and Moreira (1980) [43] reported that the formation of solvents such as ethanol and butanol in the metabolic pathway of the Clostridia species was due to enzyme synthesis or enzyme activation at a low pH. 3.5.2 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on hydrogen production from xylose and cell growth of strain KKU19 in batch fermentation was investigated. Temperatures varied from 35 to 70 °C with a fixed initial pH of 6.50 and an initial xylose concentration of 10.00 g/L. HY, HPR and cell dry weight increases were observed with an increase of temperature from 35 to 60 °C which later decreased when higher than 60 °C (Fig. 3B). Temperatures higher than the critical temperature (more than 65 °C) increases the denaturation rate of enzymes system (ferredoxin oxidroreductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase and hydrogenase) in the fermentative hydrogen production process [39,44]. This could have led to enzyme inactivation and a decrease in HY. The maximum HY, HPR and cell dry weight of 1.90 ± 0.12 mol H2/mol xylose, 3.70 ± 0.20 mmol H2/L h and 1.33 ± 0.04 g/L, respectively, were obtained at 60 °C (Fig. 3B). This is the optimum culture condition previously reported for the genus Thermoanaerobacterium [6,13]. Fig. 4B shows that the dominant SMPs of hydrogen fermentation were acetic and butyric acids and ethanol. Acetic acid is the main SMPs at high temperature whereas butyric acid is the main SMPs under low temperature. Under high temperature, the hydrogen production by thermophilic anaerobic bacteria followed the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. On this pathway, the energy is conserved from acetyl-Co A catalysed by acetyl-Co A synthetase (ADP forming) to form acetic acid [39]. However, at low temperature, the inhibition of some essential enzymes such as hydrogenase and acetyl-Co A synthetase occurred resulting in a shift of by-product composition [45]. 3.5.3 Effect of initial xylose concentration The effect of the initial xylose concentration on hydrogen production and cell growth of strain KKU19 in batch fermentation was investigated. The initial xylose concentration varied from 1.00 to 35.00 g/L, with the initial pH fixed at 6.50 (optimum initial PH) and incubated at optimum temperature of 60 °C. A HY, HPR and cell dry weight increase was observed as the initial xylose concentration increased from 1.00 to 10.00 g/L and slightly decreased afterwards (Fig. 3C). This might have been due to substrate and products inhibition [1,6,13]. The HY, HPR and cell dry weight of 2.09 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol xylose, 3.95 ± 0.16 mmol H2/L h and 1.43 ± 0.10 g/L, respectively, were obtained at a xylose concentration of 10.00 g/L (Fig. 3C). Other studies reported an optimum initial substrate concentration range for hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum at 10.00–20.00 g/L [6,13]. Fig. 4C shows that the initial xylose concentration affected the type of SMPs in which acetic acid was the main SMPs at a low initial xylose concentration, while ethanol was the main SMPs at the high initial xylose concentration. Substrate concentration apparently influenced the hydrogen production and VFAs production. An increase in substrate concentration could increase hydrogen production up to a certain level due to acetic and butyric acids production. However, an excessive substrate concentration can cause a build-up of VFAs in the system leading to a decline of pH in the fermentation broth, which could inhibit the growth of the hydrogen producer [46]. Moreover, at high concentration of VFAs, the ionic strength of solution will increase, resulting in a switch from hydrogen production to solvent production [47]."
13,Hydrogen fermentation characteristics under the optimum conditions and growth kinetics,"3.6 Hydrogen fermentation characteristics under the optimum conditions and growth kinetics Hydrogen production from xylose under the optimum conditions was investigated. Hydrogen production began after 8 h of fermentation (Fig. 5 A). The maximum HPR was registered from hour 8 to hour 28, and then drastically reduced over a prolonged fermentation (32 h). Cell growth and cumulative HP corresponded during the fermentation. The maximum cumulative HP, HY and HPR were 3020 ± 211 mL H2/L, 2.09 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol xylose and 3.95 ± 0.16 mmol H2/L h, respectively (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows that the decrease in pH from 6.50 to 4.01 was attributed to the accumulation of formic, acetic and butyric acids. Acetic (1.95 g/L) and butyric acids (1.76 g/L) were the two main SMPs (76.02% of total SMPs) in hydrogen fermentation, followed by small amounts of formic acid (0.26 g/L) and ethanol (0.91 g/L) (Fig. 5B). The high acetic and butyric acids concentrations showed that the fermentation process of xylose by strain KKU19 was of the acetate-butyrate type, which is considered to be the main fermentation type of hydrogen production by thermophilic bacteria. The maximum HY of strain KKU19 was compared to other literature (Table 4 ). Strain KKU19 had a HY that was almost equivalent to that of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, 2.19 mol H2/mol sugarconsumed [13], which are known to be thermophilic hydrogen-producing strains. Thermoanaerobacterium spp. demonstrate the ability to consume complex carbohydrate such as cellulose [6, 13, 49], starch [6,13], xylan [6,13], and simple sugars such as xylose [6,13,16], glucose [6,13,16], and arabinose [50] to produce hydrogen and VFAs. This implies its capability to produce hydrogen from renewable resources such as biomass [13]. For this reason, the strain KKU19 has the potential to utilize organic wastewater and hydrolysate of lignocellulosic materials that contain a mixture of sugars for thermophilic hydrogen production. The cell growth and substrate consumption kinetic during the growth of strain KKU19 in batch fermentative hydrogen production were investigated using the Monod model. Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 6 ) fitted the experimental results fairly well with an R 2 value of 0.97. The estimated μmax and K s values when xylose was used as the substrate were 0.24 h−1 and 1.31 g/L, respectively."
14,Conclusions,"T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19, a strictly anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, was isolated from hot spring sediments in Southern Thailand. The strain KKU19 efficiently utilized xylose, glucose, arabinose, cellulose and xylan for hydrogen production. Peptone was the preferred nitrogen source for hydrogen production and cell growth with the optimum concentration of 4.00 g/L (equivalent to a total nitrogen concentration of 0.50 g/L). Xylose was found to be the preferred carbon source. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production from xylose by strain KKU19 were an initial pH of 6.50, temperature of 60 °C, and an initial xylose concentration of 10.00 g/L, which resulted in an HP of 3020 ± 211 mL H2/L, an HPR of 3.95 ± 0.16 mmol H2/L h and HY of 2.09 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol xylose. The SMPs were predominantly acetic and butyric acids."
