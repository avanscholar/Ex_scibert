0,Introduction,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a family of linear polyesters produced by many bacteria, have attracted increasing attentions as bio-based, biocompatible, and biodegradable “green plastics”. Potential PHA applications include packaging materials, mulching films, 3D printing materials, textile, medical implants, drug delivery carriers, animal nutritional supplements, drugs and fine chemicals, as well as a new type of biofuel (Chen, 2009). PHA production, applications and degradations do not have negative ecological impacts, it is promising as alternatives for replacing conventional plastics and creating cleaner and sustainable society (Kumar et al., 2013; Jiang and Chen, 2015; Elhadi et al., 2016; Nissila et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2012a, 2012b). PHA production, however, cannot compete with petrochemical plastics due to their high production cost (Hori et al., 2008; Choi and Sang, 1997). Many efforts have been made to reduce PHA production cost (Hori et al., 2008) including the use of inexpensive substrates such as cellulose, glycerol or waste materials et al. However, PHA production cost has not yet been reduced significantly. PHA co-productions with other chemicals have been demonstrated in previous studies to reduce the production cost and achieve an economic downstream processing (Mothes et al., 2008; Hori et al., 2008). It has been demonstrated the feasibility of the synthesis of intracellular PHA combined with extracellular products, the co-production process economic balance could be further improved under optimized conditions (Liang and Qi, 2014; Kang et al., 2010, 2011). It was reported that PHB synthesis had a positive effect on the accumulation of other products (such as hyaluronic acid and L-glutamate) in Streptococcus zooepidemicus (Zhang et al., 2006) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (Liu et al., 2007), respectively. Moreover, a previous study revealed that the transcription of tryptophan operon in E. coli was increased when the PHB biosynthesis pathway was introduced (Gu et al., 2013). PHA synthesis is strongly related to carbon and energy metabolism, its usages are suitable for regulating other cellular metabolism (Xu et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2010, 2011). If the integrative production of multiple products can be obtained in high yields without negatively affecting the balance of cellular metabolism, this approach can also improve the economy of the fermentation process (Cai and Bennett, 2011). This paper reviews various strategies applied for developing co-production methods of PHA with other large molecules and/or small molecules ( Figs. 1 and 2). Major challenges and prospectives will be discussed."
1,Co-production of PHA with large molecules,
2,Co-production with protein,"2.1 Co-production with protein 2.1.1 Co-production with α-amylase PHA and commercial bulk α-amylase were simultaneously produced using unhydrolysed corn starch by Bacillus sp. CFR-67. Since α-amylase has only low value applications in food, paper and textile industries (Gangadharan et al., 2006; Shamala et al., 2012; Carvalho et al., 2008), it has to be produced at low cost. Both bacterial growth and PHA production were improved with the addition of hydrolysates of wheat bran (WBH) or/and rice bran (RBH) (5–20g/L, based on weight of soluble substrates-SS). During the batch cultivation, a mixture of WBH and RBH (1:1, 10g/L of SS) along with ammonium acetate (1.75g/L) and corn starch (30g/L) produced maximum quantity of biomass (10g/L) and PHA (5.9g/L) as 3-hydroxybutyrate and 5–10% 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) ( Table 1) (Shamala et al., 2012). Addition of WBH and corn starch (10–50g/L) improved α-amylase production (2.0–40.0U/ml/min) (Table 1). Using low cost substrates such as hydrolysates of wheat bran (WBH) or/and rice bran or starch can reduce α-amylase production cost. Additional values can be added during the α-amylase production process via providing effective PHBV polymer recovery (Shamala et al., 2012). The effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on simultaneous production of PHA with α-amylase was evaluated by submerged fermentation. Glucose and sucrose resulted in production of higher amount of α-amylase (66 U/ml) and PHA (0.4g/L), respectively. Beef extract and ammonium acetate led to the production of maximum amount of α-amylase (36U/ml) and PHA (0.5g/L), respectively. Addition of wheat bran hydrolysate (50ml/L) led to higher production of amylase (73 U/ml) and PHA (0.5g/L) (Table 1) (Sreekanth et al., 2013). These studies indicated the potential of agricultural wastes for the production of valuable products together with PHA. 2.1.2 In vivo display recombinant proteins on the surface of PHA granules Developing convenient methods for protein purification is an important goal in bioseparation technology. Downstream processing using the traditional method especially chromatography purification, is increasingly becoming an obstacle due to its high cost. Accordingly, more interests have been devoted to innovative alternative approaches (Gottschalk, 2008; Shukla and Thommes, 2010). It has been reported that various proteins can be displayed on the PHA granules surface via fusing to PHA synthase (PhaC) (Peters and Rehm, 2005). In addition to PhaC, phasins (PhaPs) are the dominant proteins adhered to PHA granules surface for granules stabilization. PhaPs have been successfully used as affinity tags to in vivo display recombinant proteins on the surface of PHA granules (Barnard et al., 2005; Geng et al., 2010), which can be conveniently separated via centrifugation. 2.1.2.1 Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) The tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has proven to be an effective drug for thrombolytic therapy by activating plasminogen to form plasmin (Geng et al., 2010). It has been reported that the recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rPA) can be expressed in bacteria forming inactive inclusion bodies (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004; Geng et al., 2010). Previous studies confirmed that rPA possesses enhanced ability for thrombolysis compared with that of tPA. Accordingly, rPA is more effective drug than tPA for treating the acute myocardial infarction (Smalling, 1997; Wooster and Luzier, 1999; Nordt and Bode, 2003). It was confirmed that PHB biosynthesis provides a suitable environment for rPA proper folding and expression (Fig. 2). This system can be successfully applied to other eukaryotic protein expressions (Geng et al., 2010). 2.1.2.2 Anti-galactosidase single chain variable fragment (scFv) An astonishing protein production/purification strategy was demonstrated as antibody-displaying PHA granules coupled with overproduction of an anti-galactosidase single chain variable fragment (scFv) fused with PhaC in E. coli KRX (Grage et al., 2011) (Fig. 2). PHB beads were successfully used for antigen purification, facilitating gravity separation via centrifugations (Grage et al., 2009). This fusion approach has some advantages including simplicity, higher purity, facilitated folding, scalability, and most importantly, reduced production costs. Additionally, this protein production/purification strategy can in particular benefit difficult-to-fold proteins or for proteins that form inclusion bodies and require long refolding steps associated with protein losses (Grage et al., 2011). Recombinant protein production was also reported by fusing the target protein to phasin (PhaP), which is hydrophobically adhered to PHB inclusions (Banki et al., 2005). This approach was not completely successful due to the non-covalent attachment of the fusion protein that results in protein loss during the washing steps. On the other hand, PHA synthase fused with target protein(s) can strongly overproduced and remain covalently attached (Peters and Rehm, 2006) to PHB inclusions, allowing extensively washing without loss of fusion protein (Brockelbank et al., 2006). In addition, using PHA synthase (PhaC) as a fusion partner covalently attached to PHB inclusions is advantageous as it cannot be displaced by target proteins with a high affinity to PHB, as observed during treatments of PhaP fusion proteins (Peters and Rehm, 2006)."
3,Co-production of PHA with exopolysaccharides (EPS),"2.2 Co-production of PHA with exopolysaccharides (EPS) Exopolysaccharides (EPS) play an important role for supplying cells with energy and protection when subjected to adverse growth conditions and nutrient limitation. Both PHA and EPS are produced intracellularly and extracellularly, respectively, when microorganisms are under stress conditions. Simultaneous production of EPS and PHB was reported in various microorganisms (Lama et al., 1996; Pal et al., 1999; Wang and Yu, 2007; Devi et al., 2012) (Table 1). Azotobacter chroococcum is known to produce EPS and PHB during nitrogen limitation utilizing fructose and glucose as carbon sources (Quagliano and Miyazaki, 1999) (Table 1). The effects of various carbon and nitrogen sources on EPS and PHB production were evaluated in Rhizobium meliloti strains Su47 and M5N1. Moreover, cells grown in glucose and fructose showed differences in various behaviors in some strains (Tavernier et al., 1997). A lag phase in EPS production was observed when cells grown in glucose, which may be related to organic acids production (gluconic or 2-ketogluconic acids) from carbohydrates conversion. Moreover, no lag phase was found in EPS production from fructose. In contrast, no lag phase in PHB production was visible when cells grown in both carbon sources (Tavernier et al., 1997). Alginate possesses physical properties suitable as a stabilizer and gelling agent in cosmetics, foods and medical fields (Licciardello et al., 2016). Simultaneous production of medium chain length (mcl) PHA and alginate oligosaccharides by Pseudomonas mendocina NK-01 was reported by Guo et al. (2011). Cultivation in glucose-containing medium (200-L fermentor) led to production of 0.316g/L mcl PHA consisting of 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO), together with 0.57g/L alginate oligosaccharides (AO) (Guo et al., 2011) (Table 1). In addition, co-production of alginate with mcl PHA from glycerol was recently studied in Pseudomonas mediterranea (Licciardello et al., 2016). After 48h of cultivation, cell dry mass (CDM) reached 2.89g/L accumulating 0.52g/L of crude mcl-PHA. Additionally, the partially purified EPS reached 6.93g/L (Table 1). Interestingly, large number of alg genes were found activated during the fermentation processses leading enhanced alginate synthesis (Licciardello et al., 2016)."
4,Co-production of PHAs with small molecules,
5,Co-production with amino acids,"3.1 Co-production with amino acids Various studies have been conducted in an effort to construct microbial strains capable of co-producing amino acids and other products such as L-tryptophan and other aromatic amino acids (Gu et al., 2013; Juminaga et al., 2012). L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid for animals and human, it can be used for nutritional therapy, treatment of pellagra and sleep induction (Gosset, 2009; Ikeda, 2006). L-tryptophan production was enhanced via expressing the PHB synthesis pathway in recombinant Escherichia coli GPT1002 (Gu et al., 2012). E. coli GPT1002 generated 10.15g/L of L-tryptophan from glucose (5-L fermentor) (Gu et al., 2012). The formation of by-product acetate has strongly affected the substrate conversion ratio. Introducing PHB biosynthesis pathway in E. coli GPT1002 led to the conversion of acetyl-CoA, the precursor of acetate, into PHB biosynthesis, and thus reduce acetate secretion. Accordingly, it was found that the transcription levels of tryptophan operon genes in GPT2000 increased compared to the wild type. This result indicates that PHB biosynthesis changed the physiological state of the strain and improved L-tryptophan production. Addition of xylose for enhancing the precursor supply of PHB synthesis increased both extracellular L-tryptophan production (14.4g/L) and intracellular PHB accumulation (9.7% (w/w)) (Gu et al., 2013) ( Table 2). Obviously, PHB synthesis may change the cellular metabolism such as the cellular oxidation/reduction potential and metabolic flux in the microbes (Zhang et al., 2006). It was found that expressing PHB synthesis pathway enhanced L-glutamate production in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Liu et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). When PHB synthesis operon phaCAB from Ralstonia eutropha were expressed under the Ptrc promoter in C. glutamicum, the recombinant yielded less metabolite intermediates or by-products, such as α-ketoglutarate, L-glutamine and lactate compared with the wild type did (Liu et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). The expression of phaCAB reduces the energy level, providing oxidation potential for the cells. When acetyl-CoA is transformed to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, NADPH is oxidized to NADP under the PhaB catalysis. Energy metabolites such as ATP, NADH, and NADPH are precisely balanced with other metabolites. To balance the energy in cells, more metabolic flux is directed to TCA cycle, one of the major NADPH generation pathway (Liu et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). As a result, more carbon sources flowed to L-glutamate biosynthesis pathway via TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. Finally, the recombinant strain produced approximately 23% more L-glutamate (17.2g/L) compared to the wild type did, with PHA content of 12.1wt% (Table 2). PHB synthesis was successfully employed for regulating glutamate metabolism, increasing glucose consumption rate and reducing by-products formation (Liu et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). Another attempt benefiting from co-production with PHA was the microbial synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its coproduction with PHB using both E. coli and Halomonas TD01 (Li et al., 2016). ALA has many potential applications for cancer treatments, plant growth regulation and as a key precursor of the cytochrome c, heme, and vitamin B12 biosynthesis (Liu et al., 2014). A recombinant E. coli harboring the synthesis pathways of PHB and ALA resulted in co-production of 43wt% intracellular PHB in the cell dry weights and 1.6g/L extracellular ALA, this led to further reduction on the production cost by producing two valuable products simultaneously. The cost of the production process was further reduced by employing a Halomonas sp. TD01 able to produce ALA (0.6g/L) and PHB (22wt%) under continuous conditions and without the need of sterilization (Li et al., 2016) (Table 2). Co-production of amino acids with PHA was also reported using crude glycerol (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). Solving the problem of crude glycerol disposal has been a big challenge, Hence, efficient processes are needed for its reutilization (Gallan et al., 2009). A simultaneous production method was developed for producing 0.2g/L extracellular ε-polylysine and 64.6% (w/w) intracellular PHA (PHBV) by Bacillus licheniformis PL26 in1 L shake flask utilizing Jatropha biodiesel waste materials (Bhattacharya et al., 2016) (Table 2). ε-polylysine is an important biopolymer with various applications including water absorbable hydrogels, anticancer agents, drug carriers et al. (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). This bioconversion method effectively converted the wastes of biodiesel production into two valuable products. This method could be further optimized to obtain a better yield. The effect of PHB synthesis on L-arginine production was evaluated in recombinant Corynebacterium crenatum (Xu et al., 2016) (Fig. 1). L-Arginine is involved in diverse applications including food flavor, pharmacology and physiology (Hristina et al., 2014). Corynebacterium crenatum SYPA 5 is an industrial strain for L-arginine production. As introduction of the PHB synthesis pathway into some microbial strains has been known to regulate global metabolic pathways (Xu et al., 2016) (Fig. 1), e.g., C. crenatum P1 harboring PHB synthesis pathway accumulated PHB up to 12.7% of the dry cell weight together with 38.54g/L L-arginine, an increase of 20.6% compared with the control study; overexpressions of PHB synthesis pathway together with NAD kinase (for enhancing NADPH supply required for both PHB and L-arginine biosynthesis) in C. crenatum P2 increased transcription levels of key L-arginine synthesis genes, and enhanced PHB and L-arginine synthesis up to 15.7% and 41.1g/L, respectively (Table 2). These results confirmed that PHB accumulation in bacteria can regulate the global cellular pathways (Xu et al., 2016) (Fig. 1). Accordingly, PHB biosynthesis can be employed for regulating the cellular metabolism and enhancing the yield of the aimed product."
6,Co-production with biosurfactants,"3.2 Co-production with biosurfactants Biosurfactants produced from renewable substrates still cannot compete with the chemically synthesized surfactants (Saharan et al., 2011). Therefore, new strategies should be developed for enhancing their commercial competitiveness for replacing the chemically synthesized surfactants that cause environmental toxicity (Makkar et al., 2011). Palm oil can be hydrolyzed into glycerol and fatty acids that can be utilized as substrates for co-production of rhamnolipids and PHA, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was employed for PHA and rhamnolipid co-production from palm oil in a single stage batch culture using Pseudomonas aeruginosa generating 36% PHA in cell dry weight (CDW) and 0.4g/L rhamnolipid from 7g/L of palm oil (Marsudi et al., 2008) (Table 2). Medium-chain-length (mcl) PHA and rhamnolipids were reported to be co-produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa IFO3924 grown at various temperatures. Proposed metabolic pathways for the syntheses of PHA and rhamnolipids from fatty acids are demonstrated (Fig. 1). Mcl-PHA were synthesized via fatty acid de novo synthesis and β-oxidation. For rhamnolipid, HAA synthetase (rhlA) transforms the conversion of (R)−3-hydroxyacyl-ACP, short as (R)−3HA-ACPs, an intermediate of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis, into 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy) alkanoic acids (HAAs), a precursor of rhamnolipid synthesis. Subsequently, the HAAs were converted to monorhamnolipid and dirhamnolipid by rhamnosyl transferase I (rhlB) and rhamnosyl transferase II (rhlC), respectively (Hori et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). The optimum temperatures for rhamnolipid and PHA production were 28 and 30°C, respectively. Thus, ratios of mcl-PHA and rhamnolipids can be controlled by changing temperatures (Hori et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). Recombinant P. aeruginosa was able to produce 0.05g/L rhamnolipids together with 24wt% PHB (Table 2). The lower concentration of rhamnolipids was produced by the recombinant compared with that of the wild-type possibly attributed to the channeling of intermediate substrates for PHB production (Rashid et al., 2015). It was reported that PHA and rhamnolipids were co-produced by Thermus thermophilus HB8 utilizing glucose or sodium gluconate as carbon source. The accumulated PHA co-polymers mainly consisted of 3-hydroxyoctanoate as a monomer, this coproduction strategy resulted in 0.2g/L and 34.8wt% rhamnolipids and PHA, respectively (Table 2). T. thermophilus HB8 is a non-pathogenic, has thermophilic nature with natural capability of producing these metabolites, making it promising for co-production processes (Pantazaki et al., 2011)."
7,Co-production of PHA with alcohols and biogas,"3.3 Co-production of PHA with alcohols and biogas 3.3.1 Co-production with methanol PHA co-production with methanol was reported by Methylosinus trichosporium. The reduction of carbon dioxide into methanol requires a considerable amount of reducing equivalent for driving the reaction against the laws of energy (Xin et al., 2004). Methanotrophs have a limited capacity for reducing carbon dioxide into methanol due to the low intracellular reducing power. Thus, PHB storage can serve as a source of endogenous reductant to be used as a source of NADH (serving as a reducing power) (Henrysson and McCarty, 1993; Chu and Alvarez-Cohen, 1996). It was reported that methanotrophic cells harboring PHB synthesis pathways were capable of long term reduction of carbon dioxide into methanol accumulating 38.6% and 0.031mmol/g dry cell wt PHB and methanol, respectively (Table 2) (Xin et al., 2007). 3.3.2 Co-production with ethanol It was reported that technologically important recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae could simultaneously produce PHB and ethanol anaerobically. The final PHB content reached 3.5% of the cell dry weight with ethanol concentrations of approximately 4.5g/L (Table 2) (Carlson and Srienc, 2006). The feasibility of anaerobic co-production of PHB with fuel ethanol in recombinant S. cerevisiae offers many advantages such as removing the need of aeration and thus simplifying the production process. This co-production strategy using S. cerevisiae is promising for co-production of valuable chemicals such as PHB and the industrial important ethanol (Carlson et al., 2002; Carlson and Srienc, 2006)."
8,Co-production with hydrogen,"3.4 Co-production with hydrogen Biological production of H2 gas is a promising due to its purity and less energy requirements. Various bacteria such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Bacillus sp. were reported to co-produce H2 and PHA under nutrient limitation (Wu et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2011). Examples of co-productions of PHB with hydrogen are summarized below. Anaerobic co-production of PHB with hydrogen was reported using recombinant Escherichia coli (Wang et al., 2012). In this recombinant pathway (Fig. 1), glucose is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, formate and acetyl-CoA. Phosphoenolpyruvate is metabolized to succinate by fumarate reductase (frdC), and pyruvate is converted to either lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), or to acetate by pyruvate oxidase (poxB), or even to formate and acetyl-CoA by pyruvate formate lyase (pflB). Formate is metabolized by formate dehydrogenase-N (fdnG). Acetate is used to form acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (acsA). Hydrogen is produced from formate catalyzed by a formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) system consisting of hydrogenase 3 (hyd 3), then uptaken via hydrogenase 1 (hyaB) and hydrogenase 2 (hybC). FHL is repressed by hycA. Some acetyl-CoAs are condensed to PHB by joint actions of PHA synthase, beta-ketothiolase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase encoded by phbC, phbA and phbB, respectively. To weaken the by-products formation for enhanced coproduction (Wang et al., 2012), genes frdC, ldhA, poxB, fdnG, hycA, hyaB and hybC were deleted, while genes hyd 3 and acsA were overexpressed (Fig. 1), resulting in improved PHB and hydrogen co-production. It was confirmed that hydrogen production stimulates more conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (PHB precursor) enhancing PHB accumulation (Wang et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). Moreover, hydrogen production in PHB synthesis strains was increased comparing with the strains without PHB synthesis. Acetyl-CoA consumption by PHB synthesis accelerated pyruvate degradation which led to more formate formation (carbon sources conversion into formate is required for hydrogen production) and thus more hydrogen production. Importantly, co-production of PHB and hydrogen with overexpressing hydrogenase 3 resulted in strengthened metabolic flux from formate to hydrogen and improved hydrogen production. The rapid consumption of formate then led to activation of pyruvate formatelyase (PFL) for catalyzing pyruvate degradation to formate, resulting in more acetyl-CoA formation for PHB synthesis (Fig. 1). Additionally, hydrogenase 3 overexpression enhanced hydrogen yield up to 260mmol/mol glucose in a mineral salt (MS) medium supplemented with glucose, and increased PHB yield up to 2.7wt% in MS medium supplemented with glucose and acetate (Wang et al., 2012) (Table 2). This co-production strategy is mutually beneficial for both PHB and hydrogen production, and is important to be employed for converting toxic compounds (formate, acetate, acetyle CoA) into useful compounds (hydrogen, PHB) (Fig. 1). Co-production of hydrogen and PHB from glucose and numerous biowastes was reported using Bacillus thuringiensis EGU45 (Singh et al., 2013). The maximum hydrogen production reached approximately 460mmol/mol glucose. Effluent from hydrogen production process was used for PHA accumulation aerobically and led to PHB accumulation up to 5.3wt% (Table 2) (Singh et al., 2013)."
9,Co-production of PHA with organic acids,"Succinate has considerable industrial values for pharmaceuticals, detergents and polymers (Kang et al., 2010; Sauer et al., 2008). Succinate and PHB co-production pathways were constructed in E. coli MG1655. During batch cultivations, intracellular PHB and extracellular succinate were simultaneously produced. PHB accumulation improved succinate production and reduced formation of by-products pyruvate and acetate. With a consumption of 45g/L glucose, 24.6g/L succinate was produced and PHB content reached 41.3wt% (4.59g/L) with cell dry weight of 12g/L (Table 2) (Kang et al., 2010). The designed metabolic pathways for co-production of succinate and PHB in E. coli QZ1112 was successfully demonstrated (Fig. 1). Succinate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle, is formed under aerobic conditions by succinyl-CoA synthetase and subsequently converted to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase (SdhABCD). To realize succinate accumulation, sdhA gene is inactivated to block the conversion of succinate to fumarate in TCA cycle. Meanwhile, PHB accumulation in E. coli also consumes large amount of acetyl-CoA. To provide more acetyl-CoA for PHB accumulation and for TCA cycle, genes encoding phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase (pta) and pyruvate oxidase (poxB) were deleted, reducing the acetate secretion approximately 90%, which promoted conversion of more acetyl-CoA to PHB and succinate accumulation. Furthermore, a ptsG deletion was designed to increase phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool, balance carbon metabolism and decrease acetate production. Gene iclR encoding the repressor of glyoxylate operon aceBAK, was also used to activate the glyoxylate bypass. The PHB biosynthesis pathway was constructed in the host by subcloning phbCAB operon from R. eutropha (Kang et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). This pathway engineering strategy effectively utilized the substrates with reduced by-product accumulations. On the other hand, PHB synthesis consumes a large amount of NADPH, accelerating TCA cycle and simultaneously benefiting succinate production (Kang et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). Another attempt for succinate and PHA co-production was evaluated using mixed substrates of fatty acids and glycerol by E. coli KNSP1 (Kang et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). The recombinant can co-utilize a substrate mixture of glycerol/glucose and fatty acid. By deleting fadA gene (ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), the engineered strain accumulates PHA intracellularly and succinate extracellularly from fatty acid and glycerol/glucose, respectively. Inactivation of fadA gene not only achieves PHA biosynthesis from R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA but also partially decouples the inter-conversion between TCA cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. Therefore, the engineered strain becomes a promising alternative to make the best of the biodiesel byproducts glycerol and fatty acid. To build up the PHA biosynthesis pathway from fatty acids in the succinate producing strain, phaC gene was cloned from P. aeruginosa and overexpressed. (Kang et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). This coupled production method led to accumulation of 21.07g/L succinate, with a PHA content reaching 5.62wt% of cell dry weight (0.54g/L). The PHA was a mixture of 41.3mol% 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD) and 58.7mol% 3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO) (Table 2) (Kang et al., 2011). This co-production approach is useful for the efficient utilization of biodiesel wastes."
10,Co-production of PHA with ectoines,"Many halophilic bacteria are capable of intracellularly accumulating both PHA and compatible solutes such as ectoines. Ectoines have gained attentions in biotechnology as promising protective agents for enzymes, DNA and cell membranes against stress conditions (Andersson et al., 2000; Borges et al., 2002). Simultaneous production of ectoines and PHB was also achieved by Halomonas elongata in a fed-batch culture using glucose containing medium (Mothes et al., 2008). PHB accumulation by H. elongata reached a maximum of 55wt% within 120h, while the maximum ectoines content reached approximately 14% of the cell dry weight after 45h of growth (Table 2) (Mothes et al., 2008). Another integrative production of PHB and ectoines has been documented by H. Boliviensis using a two-step fed-batch process (Guzman et al., 2009). Firstly, H. boliviensis was grown under its optimal conditions for achieving a high cell density, then a higher salt concentration was added to induce ectoines and PHB synthesis. This method resulted in an ectoines content of 13.2% after a production period of 22h while the highest PHB accumulation reached 68.5wt% with a productivity of 1.06g/L/h (Guzman et al., 2009) (Table 2)."
11,Discussion and future prospects,"Due to increasing public concerns on accumulation of plastic wastes in environment, mankind is forced to exploit renewable materials. Although bioplastics (PHA) production has been studied for many years, its co-production with other products has not much been paid attentions to. Designing systems for the production of multiple products has great potential in lowering manufacturing costs and utilizing raw materials more efficiently. Efficient utilization of resources is important for sustainable economies as a zero-waste policy is the aim of bioprocesses. Published studies evaluated the potential and value of co-production of PHA with other value added products. Co-productions with PHA have several advantages (Fig. 2). Accumulation of PHB in E. coli has been proven to improve microbial stress resistance (Wang et al., 2009; Leong et al., 2014). Additionally, co-production with PHA can help partially solve the waste issue, both the cells and the supernatant, or even biogas become useful. Taking Jatropha biodiesel waste materials as an example, the “wastes” become substrates for co-production of PHBV and ε-polylysine (Bhattacharya et al., 2016) Co-production of PHA and succinate was confirmed by Kang et al. (2011) based on the biodiesel wastes. Waste materials were found useful for co-production of EPS with PHB providing a strong support for waste removal (Wang and Yu, 2007). Agricultural wastes were successfully used for co-production of PHA and a thermostable α-amylase (Shamala et al., 2012). The co-production of PHA and rhamnolipid can be controlled between these two products by changing temperature using whole or part of the substrates, making the process more economic (Hori et al., 2011). The ability of Thermus thermophilus HB8 to naturally co-produce rhamnolipids and PHA is advantageous under thermophilic conditions without cost associated with cooling the reactors (Pantazaki et al., 2011). Co-production of PHA with ALA, a value-added photodynamic anticancer medicine, could significantly reduce cost associated with both products (Li et al., 2016). Anaerobic metabolic pathways dedicated to co-production of hydrogen and PHB are useful for converting toxic formate and acetate into valuable products (Wang et al., 2012). The co-production of PHA and ectoines in integrated fermentative process also looks promising (Strazzullo et al., 2008; Mothes et al., 2008). Recombinant protein production by fusing to the PHA synthase (PhaC) was attractive and can be applied for adverse eukaryotic proteins (Barnard et al., 2005; Peters and Rehm, 2005; Geng et al., 2010). It was confirmed that PHB biosynthesis provided a suitable environment for the proper folding and expression of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rPA) (a drug for thrombolytic therapy) with a simple recovery process (Geng et al., 2010). PHA co-production can balance the in vivo metabolism, including redox and carbon balances, as PHB synthesis was proven to change the global metabolic regulation, such as the cellular oxidation/ reduction potential and metabolic flux in microbes (Xu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2006) (Fig. 1). Moreover, PHA synthesis is strongly related to energy and carbon metabolism, its global regulatory properties makes it a useful tool to be employed for regulating other cellular metabolism. It was demonstrated that PHB synthesis has a positive effect on L-glutamate, L-tryptophan, L-arginine and succinate production (Liu et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2010, 2011). Additionally, the storage of PHB can be used as a source of endogenous reductant (NADH source) for converting carbon dioxide to methanol in methanotrophs (Henrysson and McCarty, 1993; Chu and Alvarez-Cohen, 1996; Xin et al., 2007). The feasibility of anaerobic co-production of PHB with ethanol in engineered S. cerevisiae offers advantages of removing the need of aeration and simplifying the process (Carlson and Srienc, 2006). Some coproduction pathways are intertwined in bacteria cells (Fig. 1). For example, coproductions of succinate and PHB (Kang et al., 2010), glutamate and PHB (Liu et al., 2007), and L-arginine and PHB (Xu et al., 2016), all are related to TCA cycle. Concerning the in vivo metabolic balance, PHB accumulation improved succinate production and reduced formation of by-products pyruvate and acetate. The PHB synthesis also consumes NADPH which accelerats TCA cycle (Kang et al., 2010). For coproduction of glutamate and PHB (Liu et al., 2007), PHB synthesis enhances L-glutamate production by increasing glucose consumption rate and reducing formations of by-products including α-ketoglutarate, L-glutamine and lactate. Coproductions of succinate and mcl-PHA (Kang et al., 2011), and rhamnolipid and mcl-PHA (Hori et al., 2011), are examples of coproduction via fatty acid β-oxidation involving genes fadB, fadE and phaJ. Coproduction of hydrogen and PHB is a good example of mutual benefits (Wang et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). On one hand, hydrogen production stimulates more conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (PHB precursor) enhancing PHB accumulation. On the other hand, the acetyl-CoA consumption by PHB synthesis accelerates pyruvate degradation, which strengthens carbon flux to formate and then to hydrogen production. The rapid consumption of formate enhanced by overexpressed hydrogenase 3 also leads to activation of pyruvate degradation to formate, resulting in more acetyl-CoA available for PHB synthesis. Meanwhile, PHB synthesis consumes NADPH, a redox sink for the metabolic balance, resulting in improving hydrogen production. In conclusion; engineering microbial cells capable of producing multiple products are attractive because they yield several advantages in balancing the metabolic flux and restoring the optimal cell physiology. Many efforts have been made to develop and evaluate various co-production systems for PHA with other valuable products and fine chemicals. Challenges must be encountered before turning these systems into industrial settings. The uses of appropriate strains and inexpensive carbon sources are important to obtain a commercially successful co-production of PHA with other chemicals. Optimization of the co-production parameters can further enhance the yields of these valuable molecules. The future looks much better if a mutually beneficial co-production system is optimized for each product."
