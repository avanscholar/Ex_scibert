0,Introduction,"High-efficiency vegetable oils application has been attracting a growing academic and industrial concerns owing to the sustainability, biodegradability, and environmental friendliness of vegetable oils [1]. Epoxidized vegetable oils derivatives are considered as promising materials for large-scale production of various industrial products, including polymers precursors, adhesives, coatings, lubricants, and so on [2–5]. In industry, Prilezhaev reaction is the universally employed process to produce epoxides [6], however, which features a low efficiency as well as negative environment impact [7–9]. Alternatively, the emerging Ti-containing silicates represent a series of promising and environmentally benign catalysts [10–19]. However, most the oxidation processes require a solvent, which is environmentally unfriendly and uneconomic. The development of heterogeneous catalysts for liquid − liquid − solid triphase epoxidation without solvent is imperative because of the advantages in facile separation of not only the solid catalyst but also the product from the triphasic system, as well as avoiding the utilization of toxic media. Recently, Wei et al [20,21]. reported the synthesis of HTS-1 using polyquaternium-6 as mesopore template, exhibiting higher catalytic activity than mesoporous titanosilicates for the epoxidation of MO, with H2O2 and acetonitrile as oxidant and solvent, respectively. However, their catalytic performance for MO epoxidation under solvent-free conditions is still relative low. From economic and environmental prospective, the solvent-free oxidation process displays a great application potential. Nevertheless, the mass transfer in oil-aqueous biphasic catalysis becomes challenging if without solvent-assisted homogenization, which puts forward higher request on catalyst [22]. Specifically, pore structure, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, active sites, and hydrothermal stability of catalysts should be delicately engineered comprehensively [23]. As such, proper modification of HTS-1 catalysts has been regarded as an effective strategy towards high-efficiency solvent-free oxidation. Given that wide industrial applications of titanium silicalite catalysts [24], their modification is of great significance for large-scale production of epoxidized MO as well as other fine chemicals in the future. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of titanosilicates, involving the main concerns on their diffusion efficiency, adsorption properties, and active sites. Modulating the coordination environment and electronic structure of Ti centers in the silica matrix are the key to boosting the catalytic performance [25–28]. For example, acid treatment has been conducted to remove partial non-framework TiO6 species, which reduces the ring opening of epoxide product [29]. In addition, using Ti[OGeiPr3]4 as precursors, site-isolated Ti(IV) centers can be introduced onto the surface of mesoporous SBA-15 support, facilitating the electrophilic oxygen transfer [26]. Moreover, diffusion and mass transfer are also crucial in liquid-phase oxidation over porous catalyst, especially for bulky substrate. Reducing the crystal size and introducing secondary pore system are resultful to accelerate bulky molecules transportation [30–33]. For instance, desilication post-treatments with alkali can create some mesopores, but such aggressive routes also result in the damage of zeolitic structure and formation of defects [30]. Besides, superficial hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of Ti-containing catalysts is also of significant concern, which is one of the most critical parameters in deciding both the catalytic activity and selectivity to the corresponding epoxides [34–38]. In general, the hydrophobic modification of Ti-zeolites containing rich hydroxyl groups can greatly increase their oxidation activity in the epoxidation of various alkenes [35,39,40]. So far, Wang et al reported that hydrophilicity improvement of TS-1 can significantly enhance their catalytic activities in hexene oxidation, which is associated with the relative higher hydrophobicity of pristine TS-1 [41]. Compared with TS-1, HTS-1 is more hydrophilic due to the presence of defects caused by mesopore directing agent. Thus, its pore environment around Ti sites is favorable to adsorb and enrich the H2O2. In this case, the first step of oxidation reaction to activate H2O2 and form Ti−OOH or Ti-(η2-O2) intermediates can be accelerated. However, the water molecules in aqueous H2O2 would be absorbed easily onto the hydrophilic surface, blocking the Ti sites and inhibiting their accessibility to alkene molecules [42]. Especially for the epoxidation of long-chain organic olefins, the hydrophobicity of catalyst is particularly vital. Only in this way, the extent of desired alkene molecules in the pore could be maximized, ensuring their sufficient contact with active intermediates. The hydrophobicity can be remarkably improved by introducing hydrophobic organic groups into the zeolites through direct incorporation or secondary modification. Covalently modifying silanol and Ti−OH groups on the surface with silylation reagents (hexamethyldisilazne, phenyltriethoxysilane, 1, 2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane, etc) is the usually used approach to enhance hydrophobicity [35,43,44]. NH4F modification is also valid to enhance hydrophobicity and acidity of Ti zeolites via the formation of SiO3/2F units [45,46]. All the above hydrophobic modification processes are usually conducted with uneconomical or pollution-carrying reagents under harsh operation condition. Worse still, they may exert negative influence on the pore structure and active sites. Therefore, it is necessary to explore novel modification approaches circumventing such limitations. Guided by the above three principles of improving oxidation activities, the strategy can be designed to achieve the maximized facilitated catalysis. Alternatively, esterification of silanol groups by alcohols is available to mediate the superficial wettability of silica-based materials. Esterification of layered polysilicate is usually applied to tune the interlayer spacing for transesterification [47]. Moreover, such studies exclusively focus on the hydrophobicity contribution of alcohol modification, while the reaction mechanism and spectroscopic characterization have not been deeply elucidated. Methanol, 1-butanol, and 1-hexanol usually have been employed for zeolite modification, which was usually performed at high temperature and with longer reaction period [48]. Due to the high energy consumption and environment pollution, the industrial application of these methods is impeded. Therefore, it is very vital to enhance the activity and products selectivity of Ti-containing catalysts with relatively green alcohol by a cleaner route. Herein, we present a facile modification strategy of HTS-1 with alcohol to achieve greatly enhanced activities and selectivities for MO epoxides under solvent-free conditions. Impressively, such modification underlies multiple merits: (i) reducing non-framework Ti species; (ii) affording improved hydrophobicity along with defects mending; (iii) elevating electrophilicity of the Ti active sites. In consequence, as-treated HTS-1 exhibits a remarkably boosted oxidation activity and enhanced selectivity for MO epoxides. Compared with methanol, ethanol is more favorable for the functionalization of HTS-1, which features a very mild but effective and optimal modification at room temperature (RT). In addition, the influence of treatment conditions of post-modification on catalytic performance of HTS-1 was also investigated systematically."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Parent HTS-1 was synthesized with polyquaternium-6 as mesopore template according to our previous method [21]. Before alcohol treatment, all samples were degassed at 120 °C for 8 h in vacuum. Typically, 0.3 g HTS-1 sample was immersed into 10 ml alcohol (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) contained in round-bottom flask, and kept stirring at certain temperature for different time. When the reaction temperature was above the boiling point of alcohol, the experiments were conducted under reflux conditions. After alcohol treatment, all the samples were dried in vacuum at 100 °C overnight to remove adsorbed alcohol molecules. The modified samples were denoted as HTS-1-M (x, y) for methanol, HTS-1-E (x, y) for ethanol, and HTS-1-FE (x, y) for 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, where the x and y represent treatment temperature (oC) and time (h), respectively."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods The crystalline structure was recorded by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA). The porosity properties were measured by N2 adsorption (Quantachrome Autosorb-1MP). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (DR UV–vis) were captured with a JASCO UV550 spectrometer. FT-IR spectra were measured with a Bruker EQUINOX55 spectrometer. The morphology and element mapping were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, NOVA NanoSEM 450) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were observed with a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope with an accelerating voltage at 120 kV. Solid state 29Si cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP MAS NMR) spectra were tested by an Agilent DD2 500 MHz spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument. A binding energy of 284.6 eV for C (1 s) was chosen as the internal reference. Thermal analyses were performed using a thermogravimetric (TG) apparatus (NETZSCH/STA 449 F3 Jupiter) in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Ti contents were determined by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers (XRF, Bruker/SRS-3400) analysis. The contact angles of water or oil droplets on the solid surface were obtained by an optical contact angle meter (Kino/SL 150E). The geometries of the materials were obtained by energy minimization of the structures using a density functional theory DFT method and the details are shown in ESI."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The epoxidation of MO was carried out following the procedure reported in our previous work [21]. Typically, 50 mg catalyst, 4.4 ml MO and H2O2 (3.0 mL) at 2.9:1 M ratio to CC bonds were sequentially added into glass reactor. The reaction was performed at 90 °C for 9 h under stirring. Substrate conversion and selectivity to products were calculated using 1H NMR method, [49] (Bruker Avance II 400 NMR Spectrometer, the details are shown in ESI) while the efficiency of H2O2 was determined by iodometric titration."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts 3.1.1 Skeleton and pore structure of modified HTS-1 The powder XRD patterns (Fig. 1 A) identify that all the ethanol-modified HTS-1 samples retain the MFI structure, as indicated by the peaks at 2θ of 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.1°, 23.9°, and 24.4°, so do the methanol-modified samples (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, such modified samples own much stronger diffraction peaks (particularly characteristic triplet in the 2θ range 22–25°), indicating their higher crystallinity than the original zeolite. The result could be attributed to the decrease in amorphous compositions. HTS-1-M/E (RT, 10) even treated under very mild conditions can achieve high crystallinity, which demonstrates the high efficiency of alcohol modification. However, with the treatment temperature raised to 100 °C, the crystallinity improvement is slightly lower. Furthermore, a single peak at 24.5° confirms the orthorhombic phase of all samples [50]. The FT-IR spectra of all the ethanol-modified HTS-1 samples show the characteristic signals of MFI type zeolite structure (Fig. 1B). The bands at 800, 1100, and 1230 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of [SiO4] units in MFI framework structure [50]. The band at 960 cm−1, which is ascribed to the stretching vibration of Si–O … Ti bond, keeps intact after ethanol treatment, suggesting that this treatment does not change the coordination state of framework Ti sites. However, the slightly red-shift of the peak position reflects the chemical environment change of Ti centers, possibly due to ethoxy groups' covalently attaching. Three identified new peaks at 2962, 2926, and 2857 cm-1 are related to asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching vibrations, [47] which can be assigned to the ethoxy groups. The appearance of these new bands is due to the reaction of ethanol with silanols and Ti−OH groups on HTS-1 surface. The same tendency can also be observed for methanol-modified samples (Fig. S1B), suggesting a universal modification effect of alcohols. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples are revealed in Fig. 1C. HTS-1 samples before and after alcohol treatment exhibit similar isotherms with both characteristic of type I and IV shapes. The sharp uptake at relative pressures P/P0 < 0.05 confirms the presence of micropores. In addition, an H4 hysteresis loop at relative pressure P/P0 > 0.8 indicates the presence of mesopores. The BJH pore size distribution curves (Fig. 1D) show that alcohol treatment mainly has impact on the smaller mesopores concentrated at 5–10 nm, and the maximums of pore apertures distributions tend to shift towards lower size. The textural parameters of the samples are summarized in Table 1 . The micropore volume and specific surface area of HTS-1-E (RT, 10) and HTS-1-M (100, 34) are smaller in comparison with untreated HTS-1. The reduction of micropore volume is more remarkable for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (17%) than HTS-1-M (100, 34) (8%), which is consistent with ethoxy/methoxy molecular dimension. Such results indicate that the alcohol molecules may be incorporated into the MFI framework. In addition, the mesopore volume increases after alcohol treatment due to the removal of amorphous impurities occluded in the channels. The increase of mesopore volume can provide open channels, thus promoting the diffusion of bulky MO molecules and accessibility of Ti sites in the pores. 3.1.2 Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of HTS-1 TG-DTG analysis was performed to determine the thermal stability of the grafted ethoxy/methoxy moieties. Fig. 2 A exhibits TG and DTG curves of the parent and alcohol-treated HTS-1 samples. In the TG curves of alcohol-treated HTS-1, the weight loss below 150 °C is mainly due to the removal of physisorbed water and alcohol. The temperature range for the removal of organic groups and hydroxyl condensation are usually recognized as 150–800 °C [51]. As shown in DTG curves of treated HTS-1, a signal peak centered at 340 °C is observed, which is ascribed to oxidative decomposition of the attached methyl or ethyl groups. This result supports the conclusion based on IR characterization, that CH3O-/CH3CH2O- groups are grafted to the internal or external surface of HTS-1 to form Si-O-C bonds. Because adsorbed alcohol molecules desorb at lower temperature, the covalently-bonded effect of alcohol in the system can be adequately proved by the high weight loss temperatures. The amounts of grafted methoxy and ethoxy groups incorporated into HTS-1 are calculated by TG mass loss in the temperature range of 150–800 °C. The alkoxy loading of HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (0.72 mmol g−1) is approximately close to that of HTS-1-M (100, 34) (0.74 mmol g−1), which is consistent with the CHN analyses (0.73 mmol g−1 for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) and 0.77 mmol g−1 for HTS-1-M (100, 34)). The similar loadings of organic groups indicate that the insertion of ethyoxyl is easier than methoxyl, which can be achieved at mild condition. Such loadings are also comparable to the content of the tetrapropylammonium (TPA) structure-directing agent in the as-synthesized MFI materials before calcination (0.81 mmol g−1 SiO2) [48]. The alcohol molecules can functionalize both the internal and external surface sites, and the grafted alcohol contents match with the concentration of the silanol defects. To confirm the effect of alcohol modification on remedying Si−OH defects in the HTS-1, we acquired the 29Si CP MAS NMR spectra of HTS-1 before and after functionalization. The CP technique is sensitive for the Si atoms that are coupled with the protons of the hydroxyl groups by dipolar 1H → 29Si interaction [52]. The resonance around -103 and -116 ppm are assigned to the Si[(OH)(OSi)3] (Q3) and Si[(OSi)4] (Q4) groups, respectively [50,52]. The amount of Si defects (silanol groups) can be estimated from the Q3/Q4 ratio in 29Si CP MAS NMR spectra. As shown in Fig. 2B, after deconvolution and integration of the spectra, the Q3/Q4 area ratio for HTS-1 falls sharply after alcohol functionalization. The calculated ratio of Si atoms grafted ethoxy and methoxy groups is about 21.9% and 23.0%, respectively. This result is corroborating evidence that alcohol molecules react with the silanol defects to form Si-O-R covalent bonds instead of hydrogen-bonded compounds. The remediation of Si−OH and Ti−OH defects by esterification reaction can enhance the hydrophobicity of HTS-1 effectively. To further examine the wettability of the modified HTS-1, videos of contact angle tests were acquired (Fig. 3 ). The water droplets are almost immediately absorbed when they contact with the parent sample. In contrast, the water droplets show slower spread and permeation rate on the alcohol-treated samples. The contact angles of water on HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (≈ 50°) and HTS-1-M (100, 34) (≈ 45°) samples are larger than that on HTS-1 (≈ 0°) within 0.05 s, demonstrating the hydrophobicity improvement of HTS-1 samples after functionalization of methoxy/ethoxy groups in the zeolite frameworks. The MO droplets are absorbed slightly faster on HTS-1-E (RT, 10) and HTS-1-M (100, 34) surface compared with HTS-1, indicating their stronger affinity for modified HTS-1 samples (Fig. 3B). 3.1.3 Alcohol-modified active Ti sites The UV–vis spectra (Fig. 4 A) show that the samples ethanol-treated under different conditions (temperature/time) exhibit similar bands. To obtain a clear insight into the Ti coordination environment in the modified HTS-1, the deconvoluted UV–vis spectra using the Gaussian fitting method are shown in Fig. 4B. The band position is almost well retained while the shape and intensity change slightly after modification. The bands at 220, 267, and 320 nm are assigned to framework TiO4, extra-framework TiO6, and small TiO2 aggregation species, respectively [53]. The area percentage of deconvoluted peak corresponding to framework Ti species for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (47.4%) is higher than that for HTS-1 (34.0%), suggesting the extraction of oligomers and TiO2-like nanoclusters species by ethanol, which is consistent with the XRF results (2.876 wt.% Ti for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) vs 2.992 wt.% Ti for HTS-1). The stronger peak at 220 nm after ethanol treatment also implies more exposed and available active Ti sites. The chemical state of the Ti in HTS-1 was also investigated by XPS. The core levels of Ti 2p and C 1s in HTS-1 samples before and after alcohol modification are shown in Fig. 5 . The peaks around 460.0 and 458.5 eV are assigned to the Ti4+ in tetrahedral coordination within the silica matrix and octahedral-coordination Ti4+, respectively. After ethanol treatment, the relative area ratio of the peak at 458.5 eV assigned to octahedral Ti species decreases, suggesting the removal of partial extra-framework titanium, which is consistent with the UV–vis results. Interestingly, the ethanol modification lowers the binding energy of framework Ti 2p3/2 from 460.1 eV for patent HTS-1 to 459.6 eV for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (Fig. 5A), indicating that the chemical environment change of framework Ti4+ with electropositivity enhancement around them [46,54]. To further verify this hypothesis, trifluoroethanol with high electronegativity was used to modify pristine HTS-1. As shown in Fig. 5A (c), the binding energy of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti species shifts to 459.2 eV, clearly demonstrating the more electrophilic Ti active sites. This blue-shift in binding energy is attributed to the strong inductive effect of CF3CH2. Based on the above results, it is likely that some of the alkoxy may coordinate directly to the Ti sites while the others connect to Si, as shown in Scheme 1 . In the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra of ethanol-modified samples (Fig. 5B), two peaks around 286.0 and 284.0 eV are corresponding to C–O bond close to Si atoms and CC bond, respectively. Compared with ethanol, the binding energy shift of C 1s for trifluoroethanol is also related to the high electronegativity of F. DFT calculation was used to confirm the speculation about the electropositivity change around the Ti active sites caused by the CH3CH2O units. The charge distribution around Ti is 1.360 (Fig. 6 a) and 1.363 (Fig. 6c) for HTS-1 with defects, while the value increases to 1.363 (Fig. 6b) and 1.366 (Fig. 6d) after ethyoxyl implanted in the HTS-1 lattice by defects repair. Moreover, the value rises to 1.365 and 1.380 for the trifluoroethanol-modified counterpart. These results are in good accordance with the aforementioned XPS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that alcohol functionalization is proved to alter the charge distribution of Ti4+ ions for titanium-containing zeolites, and then enhancing their electrophilic activity in olefin epoxidation by forming more active Ti−OOH intermediates with H2O2. 3.1.4 Morphological features of the samples The morphology of the samples was investigated by SEM/EDS and TEM, as shown in Fig. 7 . The crystal morphology of the functionalized HTS-1 displays no obvious change after ethanol treatment (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, methanol-treated HTS-1-M (100, 34) also shows well-preserved morphology (Fig. S2). Nevertheless, HTS-1 particles tend to be more dispersive after alcohol treatment, resulting in more exposed external surface than untreated counterparts. The EDS mappings of HTS-1-FE (RT, 10) (Fig. 7e–i) reveal that Ti, C, F elements are homogeneously distributed over the zeolite crystals and their distribution ranges are almost consistent with that of Si atoms. Also, HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (Fig. S3) and HTS-1-M (100, 34) samples (Fig. S2) exhibit uniform element distribution well-matched with corresponding SEM images. Such results are in good agreement with that revealed by IR, TG, and XPS characterizations, confirming a successful grafting of organic groups from alcohols into the zeolite framework. Besides, the HTS-1-E (RT, 10) particles unfold clear intracrystal voids communicating directly with the surface (Fig. 7c), which are beneficial to boost the diffusion and permeation of substrate."
7,Catalytic performances,"3.2 Catalytic performances The catalytic performances of modified HTS-1 for MO epoxidation under solvent-free conditions were studied carefully. The MO conversion (XMO) over HTS-1 and HTS-1-E (RT, 10) combined catalyst efficiency (converted MO related to the amount of Ti atoms per unit time) versus time are shown in Fig. 8 . For HTS-1-E (RT, 10), conversion of MO rises almost lineally within the first 7 h (up to XMO = 78.9%), implying a nearly zero-order reaction with respect to MO. Afterwards, the conversion increases slightly from 78.9 to 92.7% in the next 2 h. Evidently, the initial rate of MO epoxidation on HTS-1-E (RT, 10) at the reaction time of 1 h is approximately four times higher than that on pristine HTS-1, suggesting that mild ethanol treatment dramatically boosts the epoxidation process. The reaction rate of MO epoxidation over HTS-1-E (RT, 10) exhibits a volcano-shaped change and reaches a maximum value at 7 h. In addition, as high as 525 mol mol−1 Ti of TON value (defined as the moles number of MO epoxide produced per mole of titanium atom) can be achieved. Meanwhile, the effective utilization of H2O2 is also improved (34.0% for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) vs 24.9% for HTS-1). Due to the presence of large quantity of extraframework Ti species in HTS-1, the contribution of effective Ti species (isolated “TiO4’’, peak at 220 nm in UV–vis spectra) was calculated quantitatively according to the PeakFit program and integral area. The TON value of tetra-coordinated Ti4+ species for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) (1108 mol mol−1 Ti) is higher than that for HTS-1 (830 mol mol−1 Ti), indicating the Ti sites in HTS-1-E (RT, 10) are more active than that in HTS-1. The following two factors are vital for the alkene epoxidation catalysts: i) stronger Lewis acids which could obtain more electrophilic M-(O2) intermediates; ii) pore environment which could provide enough reaction space and hydrophobic/hydrophilic character surrounding the active sites to facilitate the interactions. Meanwhile, the coordination environment of Ti species is also a key factor influencing the catalytic properties of Ti-containing zeolites. Based on the spectroscopic characterizations, the significant improvement of catalytic performance of HTS-1 after alcohol functionalization can be ascribed to the following three reasons. Firstly, alcohol treatment is efficient to reduce extraframework Ti species and other amorphous impurities in the pore, promoting the diffusion of MO molecules with bulky molecular dimension to the active sites. Simultaneously, the decrease of non-framework Ti species could alleviate the further conversion of epoxides effectively [55,56]. Secondly, abundant silanols are formed as a result of incomplete condensation caused by the mesopore template in synthesis, affording a high hydrophilicity of HTS-1. Via esterification of silanols and Ti−OH with alcohol molecules, the hydrophobicity of samples is effectively enhanced by incorporation of organic groups into the framework. In this case, Ti sites exist mainly in the form of high symmetric Ti(OSi)4 species rather than relatively low symmetric Ti(OSi)3OH species. The improved hydrophobicity around Ti sites strengthens their interaction with hydrophobic MO molecules, accelerating the epoxidation reaction. In addition, the remediation of framework defects (Si−OH and Ti(OSi)3OH), which are commonly believed to act as Brønsted acid sites, can restrain the ring opening of epoxides groups [57]. Hence, the selectivity of epoxide also increases after alcohol modification. Thirdly, benefiting from the electron-withdrawing effects of alkoxy units, the electrophilicity of active Ti sites is enhanced, facilitating the transfer of peroxide oxygen next to Ti in intermediates to the double bond, resulting in a tremendously improved catalytic performance for MO epoxidation. Such results could be verified by the higher activity (XMO = 96.5%, reaction time of 9 h) of trifluoroethanol–modified sample HTS-1-FE (RT, 10), which is attributed to the strong inductive effect of CF3CH2 groups. The influence of treatment parameters (temperature/time) with ethanol/methanol on the catalytic performance of modified HTS-1 was also investigated systematically. As revealed in Table 2 , the improvement of catalytic performance of alcohol-modified HTS-1 is closely dependent on the alcohol type and treatment conditions. HTS-1-E (RT, 10) shows an optimal activity for MO epoxidation. This result strongly suggests that ethanol functionalization is a remarkably effective strategy to boost MO epoxidation over HTS-1, accompanied by both increasing MO conversion and epoxide selectivity. The modification by nontoxic ethanol is eco-friendly, cost-effective, and easy to perform. In the case of methanol treatment, harsh conditions such as higher processing temperature and longer time are needed to reach comparable catalytic performance to that of ethanol. This further demonstrates that the covalent linkage of ethanol is more facile than methanol. Thus, ethanol is more favorable to afford highly active catalysts than methanol as a modifier. Moreover, catalysts treated at an appropriate temperature with proper time deliver evidently enhanced catalytic properties. In contrast, excessively high temperature or long time for ethanol treatment could result in redundant alkoxy groups immobilized in the framework, preventing from the diffusion of bulky MO molecules to Ti sites due to the steric hindrance (entry 2–7). We also found the isopropanol-modified sample exhibited inferior performance (XMO = 69.0%) due to the more serious space confinement exerted by isopropanol. The ethanol-modified HTS-1 at RT was also used as catalyst in the epoxidation of propylene with oil-soluble oxidant cumene hydroperoxide. The conversion of cumene hydroperoxide and propylene oxide yield are 94.4% and 49.5%, respectively. Such values drop to 87.6% and 47.5% over unmodified HTS-1. These results indicate that the ethanol modification exerts positive influence on the catalytic performance of HTS-1 for olefin epoxidation, including short or long-chain substrates. We also found that ethanol-modified Ti-HMS show improved catalytic selectivity for MO epoxide. Thereby, this strategy is universally applicable, holding a great promise from the perspective of cost efficiency and green operation."
8,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability The catalyst stabilities and regeneration properties are vital for practical applications, thus the stability of HTS-1-E (RT, 10) was explored (Fig. 9 ). After the first cycle, the used catalyst was removed from the reaction medium and washed, subsequently subjected to the next run. The conversion of MO decreases apparently, with the value dropping to 69.6%. Nevertheless, the MO conversion is preserved in further run. To find out whether this degradation is caused by carbon deposition on the active sites, the catalyst annealed at 550 °C for 8 h was used in run 3. Obviously, the MO conversion is even lower than that over uncalcined samples, indicating that the pore blocking by organic residues could not be the main reason. Therefore, the slow hydrolysis of Si-O-C bonds and loss of ethyoxyl in framework could take the major responsibility for the performance degradation. The well-kept conversion after run 2 can be attributed the presence of stably grafted ethoxy groups on internal surface. Furthermore, during the regeneration processes, the selectivity of MO epoxide (SME) keeps well. For a clear understanding, both reused catalysts with and without calcination after run 2 were treated with ethanol for catalytic properties test. Unexpectedly, the conversion of MO over ethanol-retreated samples basically recovers compared to the initial one. The minor conversion loss of reused catalyst after calcination and ethanol retreatment results from the condensation of Si-OEt or Ti-OEt yielding TOT bridges during calcination, and the resulting decreased anchor sites for grafting ethoxy groups. Meanwhile, for ethanol-modified HTS-1, simple repetitive operation can restore their crystalline texture, as supported by the XRD characterization (Fig. S4A). Organic deposits mainly lead to the weakened peak intensity of lattice plane (101) and (200) around 7-8° while ethanol washing contributes to the strengthened peak intensity of lattice plane (501), (303), and (133) around 23°. Besides, ethanol retreatment can also remove partial organic residues, which is suggested by the FT-IR spectra (Fig. S4B)."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we report an effective alcohol-modified strategy towards catalytic activity enhancement of HTS-1 in solvent-free olefin epoxidation (XMO = 92.7% for HTS-1-E (RT, 10) vs 56.9% for pristine HTS-1). Ethanol functionalization is superior to methanol in terms of achieving highly active catalysts for solvent-free MO epoxidation. Especially, the optimal HTS-1 catalyst can be obtained via a facile ethanol functionalization at moderate operation condition (ambient temperature). The remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of HTS-1 has been realized via a three-in-one process, in which: (i) more open mesopores can be achieved with the reducing of non-framework Ti species and amorphous impurities by alcohol extraction, exposing more active sites; (ii) alkoxy groups are covalently bonded to silanol and Ti−OH defect sites in HTS-1, which remedies such defects and simultaneously enhances the hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of catalyst. Such effects promote the mass transfer of organic substrate to active sites, resulting in the high-efficiency aliphatic MO epoxidation; (iii) the electron-withdrawing alkoxy units render the titanium centers and the transferred oxygen atoms more electron-deficient, facilitating electrophilic oxygen transfer. This is the first example of ethanol, which is nontoxic and widely available, is used to modify Ti-containing zeolite. The proposed facile method holds a great promise for functionalization of other metal-containing porous silicate catalysts with crystal defects, which will enlighten to develop high-efficiency catalysts for green epoxidation processes."
