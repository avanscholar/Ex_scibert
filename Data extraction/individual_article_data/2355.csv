0,Introduction,"Food waste (FW) as a major fraction of municipal solid wastes is largely produced in residential area and business sectors. Current disposal methods, mainly landfill and composting, are limited by either the availability of disposal sites or the stringent regulations for emission of greenhouse gas, odor and volatile organic compounds which could be generated with these methods. Moreover, the existing methods do not consider the utilization of energy contained in FW. There is clearly a demand for an alternative which could divert FW from land fill and composting. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of municipal food waste to produce methane is well established (Ghosh et al., 2000), and a two stage AD process which separates acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes spatially was proposed in 1970 (Pohland and Ghosh, 1971). However, these processes have not been widely applied due to problems associated with nutrient deficiency, slow digestion rates and incomplete degradation of large particles (Ghosh et al., 2000). More importantly, energy recovery from waste has not been of interest to municipalities until relatively recently. A modified two stage AD process in which the acidogenesis and methanogenesis are separated and the acidogenesis stage is optimized for hydrogen production has been proposed (Benemann, 1998) and demonstrated to be promising using feed stocks such as glucose (Cooney et al., 2007), municipal food waste (Han and Shin, 2004; Ueno et al., 2007a,b), and agricultural and food process wastes (Zhu et al., 2008a). This process produces both hydrogen and methane and the mixture, when combusted, is cleaner than methane gas because less NO x is produced (Benemann et al., 2004). It has also been reported that methane production in this process is more stable and effective than one stage AD processes (Cooney et al., 2007). Previous studies have suggested that the hydrogen producing acidogenesis require stricter pH conditions than conventional acidogenesis without hydrogen production. The optimal pH for hydrogen production has been reported to be approximately 5.5 (Fang and Liu, 2002). Without pH control, the pH of the acidogenesis can readily decrease to below 4 which could significantly suppress hydrogen production. To control the pH in the optimal range for hydrogen production, a large quantity of base may be needed, thus the cost of operation could be drastically increased. Kraemer and Bagley (2005) have proposed a method to reduce the base requirement by 40% by reusing the alkalinity contained in the methane reactor effluent. However, recycling of the methanogenic effluent inevitably diluted the feedstock and reduced the volumetric capacity of the hydrogen reactor. An alternative way to reduce the base required for pH control might be the co-digestion of FW with municipal sewage sludge. Municipal sewage sludge contains considerable alkalinity which could be an ideal source of base for neutralizing pH. The organic fraction of sewage sludge which is dominated by proteinaceous substances and bacterial cells can be hydrolyzed and acidified in the hydrogen reactor and used for methane production in the following methane reactor. Batch experiments on co-digestion of FW and municipal sewage sludge for hydrogen production have shown that co-digestion of FW and municipal sewage sludges (primary sludge and waste activated sludge) can significantly increase hydrogen production as compared to those from the individual wastes (Kim et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2008b). It was demonstrated that the effect of co-digestion on hydrogen production was, at least partly, due to better control of the pH (Zhu et al., 2008b). In this research, bench scale semi continuous flow reactors were for the first time operated to further study the feasibility of the two stage process for co-production of hydrogen and methane from a mixture of food waste and sewage sludge. Problems with the long term operation of hydrogen reactor, especially the emergence of methanogenic activity in this reactor were addressed. Measures for removal of the methanogens from the feedstock, mixed liquor and reactor walls were assessed. The methane production efficiency of the two-stage process was compared with that of a conventional single stage process by conducting separate biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests using the co-digestion feedstock and the effluent of the hydrogen reactor as substrates."
1,Methods,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock The food waste employed in this study was collected from a cafeteria of an office complex, and sorted manually with removal of any inert components. It consisted of a mixture of grains, vegetables and meats and was homogenized using a Waring blender. The FW slurry that was obtained was stored at −70°C for further use. When required, the frozen slurry was thawed, diluted with water and strained through a No. 40 standard sieve (0.425mm opening). Ten milliliters of water were added per gram of frozen slurry. The primary sludge was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant and screened with a No. 40 mesh sieve before use. The co-digestion feedstock was made from the diluted FW slurry and the primary sludge with a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. This ratio had been previously found to be optimal for hydrogen production (Zhu et al., 2008b)."
3,Reactor setup and operation,"2.2 Reactor setup and operation Two bioreactors (BioFlo 110, New Brunswick Scientific, USA) with working volumes of 1 and 5L were used as hydrogen and methane reactors, respectively. The two reactors were consecutively connected and both operated in semi-continuous mode. The start-up procedures for both reactors have been described by Zhu et al. (2008a). The original inocula used for both reactors were primary digested sludge collected in a local wastewater treatment plant. Semi-continuous operation involved draining 800mL of the mixed liquor from the hydrogen reactor and replacing this with an equal volume of the feedstock at the beginning of each day using a peristaltic pump. Half of the drained mixed liquor (400mL) was used as the feed to the methane reactor. The methane reactor was fed and drained in the same way as hydrogen reactor. The operating parameters and conditions of the two reactors are summarized in Table 1 . The initial pH in the hydrogen reactor was adjusted to 7 using 1M NaOH immediately after feeding. A previous study using a similar feedstock had shown that an initial pH of 7 was optimal for hydrogen production (Zhu et al., 2008b). The pH in the methane reactor was not adjusted because it remained in an optimal range (6.8–7.2). The gas produced from the hydrogen reactor was collected in a volumetric cylinder using the water displacement method. The gas produced from the methane reactor was measured using a bubble counter and collected in a Tedlar gas bag. Gas samples were taken from the gas reservoirs (volumetric cylinder for hydrogen reactor and the Tedlar bag for methane reactor) for gas content analysis at the end of each day. The hydrogen reactor (including the mixed liquor and the reactor vessel) was periodically treated to eliminate or suppress the methanogenic activity in this reactor using various partial pasteurizing methods, if necessary. The pasteurizing methods tested include heat treatment of the feedstock and the mixed liquor, aeration of the mixed liquor, filtration to remove large biomass particles in the mixed liquor and removal of the biofilm on bioreactor walls by washing. The details of the methods used are described in the Results section."
4,BMP tests,"2.3 BMP tests To evaluate the potential methane production of this two stage process, the co-digestion feedstock (heat treated) and the hydrogen reactor effluent (sampled in high hydrogen production period) were tested for their biological methane potential (BMP) using an anaerobic respirometric cultivation system (CES, USA). In this test 112.5mL of each substrate and 37.5mL of inoculums (mixed liquor sampled from methane reactor) were added into a serum bottle (250mL) and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 35°C. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0 using 1M NaOH and 1M HCl solutions. Details of this method are described by Zhu et al. (2008b)."
5,Chemical analysis,"2.4 Chemical analysis All the biogas samples were analyzed using a micro-gas chromatograph equipped with MolSieve 5A and PLOT U column modules (Agilent 3000, Wilmington, DE, USA) for hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide content according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The concentration of dissolved carbohydrates in the feedstock and effluents was determined using the anthrone method (Gaudy, 1962). Total solids (TS), total volatile solids (VS), total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (tCOD and sCOD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and PO 4 3 - -P in liquid samples, and alkalinity were measured according to Standard Methods (APHA, 2004). Alcohols in the liquid sample were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (5890 Series II Plus GC, Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Restek Stabilwax-DA (30m×0.25mm) capillary column. The VFAs were analyzed using an Ion Chromatograph (ICS-2000, Dionex, CA, USA) equipped with a AS15 column at a temperature of 30°C with a gradient carrier solution (8–60mM KOH). Details of all the analysis methods has been described by Zhu et al. (2009)."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterization of the co-digestion feedstock,"3.1 Characterization of the co-digestion feedstock The characteristics of the co-digestion feedstock that consisted of the FW and the sewage sludge are shown in Table 2 . The average total solids (TS) concentration of the feedstock was approximate 26g/L and the volatile fraction was approximately 73%, indicating that a large fraction of the solids in the feedstock were organic in nature. The total suspended solids (TSS) contributed approximately 50% of the total solids, and about 84% of the TSS was volatile. Hence, a majority of the organic matter was contributed by the suspended solids. These characteristics were also apparent from the COD data as the soluble COD contributed only about 24% of the total COD. Carbohydrates have been demonstrated to be precursors of H2 production in previous studies (Li and Fang, 2007; Hallenbeck, 2009). Soluble carbohydrates were a relatively minor component of the feedstock with a concentration of approximately 1.5g/L. However it was anticipated that there were additional carbohydrate present in the particulates and these would be made available by hydrolysis in the reactors. VFAs are typically the byproducts of fermentation and are precursors of methane production but are not typically major substrates for hydrogen production. The presence of VFAs in the feedstock was likely due to their presence in primary sludge and fermentation of materials during storage. The concentrations of the fatty acids in the feedstock were in a range of 180–850mg/L and hence they did not represent a large fraction of the feedstock COD. Hence, it was anticipated that much of the organic matter was in a fermentable form that might support H2 production. Alkalinity is important in hydrogen production as it is essential that the pH be poised in the appropriate range to maintain vigorous H2 production. The total alkalinity of the feedstock was relatively low with a value of approximately 1g/L, which was consistent with the low pH of 5.2. This alkalinity was much higher than the FW alone which was only approximately 40mg/L (Zhu et al., 2008b). The relatively low values of pH and alkalinity required that the reactors be pH adjusted after each reactor feeding in order to maintain the pH in a reasonable range for H2 production."
8,Performance of hydrogen reactor,"3.2 Performance of hydrogen reactor The hydrogen reactor was operated for a total of 280days. The daily gas production along with the elapsed days and the final pH observed at the end of each day are shown in Fig. 1 . From Day 1 to Day 50 the reactor was fed with the feedstock without heat treatment. In this period of time, the hydrogen yield was only 0.05–0.18mL/mL (feedstock). A methane concentration of 0.5–8% was observed in the gaseous phase, corresponding to a methane yield of 0.00–0.13mL/mL (feedstock). Since the reactor was mostly operated under acidic conditions (pH 4.6–6.0) which was expected to be challenging for methanogen growth, it was concluded that the methanogens present either in the feedstock, or in the reactor where the local pH remained neutral (i.e. inside the biomass floc). To eliminate methanogenic activity in the reactor, several partial pasteurization methods including heat treatment of the feedstock and the mixed liquor, filtration of the mixed liquor with washing of the reactor walls and air flushing of the mixed liquor were tested in the experiments. Starting from Day 50, the feedstock was heated in a microwave oven for about 10min (approximate 100°C) except for the period between Days 181–226 when the heat treatment was stopped to evaluate pathogenic destruction in the reactor (dada on pathogen destruction will be published elsewhere). On Days 50 and 87 the reactor was treated by placing the whole reactor (reactor vessel and mixed liquor) in an autoclave (at 121°C) for 5min. On Day 129 the mixed liquor was poured out and heated (∼100°C) in the microwave oven for 10min and the reactor walls were washed using tap water. On Day 167 the mixed liquor was screened using No. 40 standard sieve (with an opening of 0.425 mm) and the reactor vessel was washed. On Days 230, 247, 264 and 270, the reactor and the mixed liquor were flushed with air (flow rate 1.9L/min). On Day 230, the flushing was performed for 15min, while on the other days; the flushing lasted for 1h. All the treatments were conducted immediately before feeding. As shown in Fig. 1, after Day 50 when the feedstock was heated and the whole reactor was heat-treated, hydrogen production increased substantially to 0.5–0.9mL/mL (feedstock) with a negligible amount of methane production (below 0.01mL/mLfeedstock). This efficient hydrogen production continued for approximate 30days until methane production increased again to around 0.2mL/mL (feedstock), and the hydrogen production reduced to 0.2mL/mL (feedstock). After the whole reactor was heat-treated again on Day 87 a similar trend was observed: hydrogen production was revived to a high rate of 0.6–0.9mL/mLfeedstock and was maintained for approximate 40days. Corresponding to a slight decrease of hydrogen production at the end of this period, a slight increase of methane production of 0.05mL/mLfeedstock was observed. Similar trends were observed after the reactor was treated by washing the walls and either microwave heat treatment (on Day 129) or filtration (on Day 167) of the mixed liquor. However, the efficient hydrogen production observed in these periods lasted for only 1–2weeks. The results suggest that the majority of the methanogenic bacteria in the reactor were living in suspended particles (larger than 0.425mm) which could not pass through No. 40 standard sieve in the mixed liquor or attached to the vessel. Visual inspection suggested that the attached biofilm was mostly grown on the wall near the water surface. When heat treatment of the feedstock was stopped between Days 181–226 the hydrogen production immediately decreased to below 0.1mL/mLfeedstock, and methane production was dominant, reaching 0.25mL/mLfeedstock near the end of the period. After heat treatment of the feedstock was resumed on Day 227, hydrogen production did not recover until Day 230 when the next treatment of mixed liquor and reactor was conducted. The results suggest that the methanogenic archaea existed in both the non-treated feedstock and in the reactor contents. Flushing the reactor with air on Day 230 resulted in a recovery of the hydrogen production to an efficiency of 0.2mL/mL (feedstock), although methanogenic activity was significantly suppressed after the treatment. This level of hydrogen production was maintained for about 15days when it decreased to around 0.1mL/mLfeedstock. Similar trends were observed when the reactor was treated with prolonged air flushing on Days 247, 264 and 270 and hydrogen production increased to 0.4–0.5mL/mLfeedstock. The results indicate that air flushing suppressed methanogenic activity; however it also affected hydrogen production. The observation that elevated hydrogen production was maintained for a shorter period of time than the other treatment methods indicates that air flushing only suppressed the methanogenic activity to a limited extent as compared with the other methods tested. Although hydrogen production changed drastically with emergence of methanogenic activity and treatment of the feedstock and mixed liquor, the final pH observed in each batch was relatively stable, varying between 5 and 6 (Fig. 1). This was within the optimal pH range for hydrogen production. The time course of hydrogen production and pH change in a typical batch during effective hydrogen production (Days 91–94) is shown in Fig. 2 . The pH decreased from 7 at the beginning and stabilized at 5.7 after 5h while hydrogen production lagged about 1h and reached exponential production at around 4h and then slowed at 6h. The observation that the final pH was relatively stable indicated that the methanogenic activity emerged in the hydrogen reactor was likely hydrogenogenic. The methanogens grown in the reactor used only the hydrogen produced, while as will be subsequently demonstrated other intermediates such as volatile fatty acids were not significantly affected. To obtain the average hydrogen production rates during different phases of the operation, the cumulative hydrogen production was plotted versus time (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3, the operation could be categorized by three phases: low hydrogen production during the period without any treatment, intermediate hydrogen production in the period with heat treatment of feedstock and periodic air flushing and high hydrogen production in the period with heat treatment of the feedstock and periodical heating, filtration and washing of the mixed liquor and reactor walls. The average hydrogen production rates for the three phases obtained by the linear regression were 0.04, 0.12, and 0.33mL/(mLfeedstockday), equivalent to the hydrogen yields of 2, 6, and 17.5mL/mgVS added. These yields were far less than a yield of 112mL/mgVS added observed in our previous bench scale batch test using a similar co-digestion feedstock (Zhu et al., 2008b), and at the low end of the yield range (2.5–360mL/gVS) reported in the literature (Li and Fang, 2007). The relative low average yield was probably due to the emergence of methanogenic activity. The maximum rate obtained when the methanogenic activity was largely eliminated was in a range of 0.6–0.9mL/mLfeedstock, equivalent to 32–48mL/gVS added, much closer to the typical rates reported in the previous literatures. The characteristics of the liquid effluents in each hydrogen production phase are shown in Table 3 . There were only minor differences observed in TS, VS, tCOD, sCOD and dissolved carbohydrates between the three phases. The results indicate that the hydrogen and methane production in the different operational phases only had minor effects on the removal of solids and COD content. The TS and VS removal in the reactor were about 17–20% and 25–33% with the maximum removals observed in high hydrogen production phase. The removals of tCOD were minimal in all phases with the highest tCOD removal observed in the phases with high and intermediate hydrogen production and this was only about 6%. It was expected that soluble carbohydrates would be readily fermented in the hydrogen reactors. From Table 3 it can be seen that the soluble carbohydrates in the effluents of all three were in the range of 105–120mg/L, indicating a removal efficiency of 99.9%. The results indicate that the fermentation of carbohydrates was essentially complete in the reactor. It was expected that in addition to H2 significant VFA production would be observed in the reactor. From Table 3 it can be observed that all the VFAs in the effluents increased significantly as compared with the feedstock. However, the extent of the increase for each VFA was different in different operational phases. Acetic acid increased by 39.2%, 58.9%, and 83.2% in the high, intermediate and low hydrogen production phases respectively. Propionic acid increased by 81.3%, 27.5%, 146.2% and butyric acid increased by 497.8%, 558.8%, and 357.2%, respectively. Valeric acid was consistently detected in the effluents while it was not detected in the feedstock. The differences in VFA production in the different operation phases suggest that the metabolic pathways of the fermentative biomass may have shifted. Fermentation processes that produce H2 can be thermodynamically impacted by its accumulation (or lack thereof) in solution (Mizuno et al., 2000). Hence, the shifts in the metabolic products that were observed were likely due to the impact of the treatment methods on H2 consumption and production in the reactor. As previously demonstrated the treatments were able to substantially eliminate the removal of H2 by methanogens. With the co-digestion of sewage sludge and municipal FW, the requirement of base for the pH control for the hydrogen production was minimized. Only small amounts of base (approximately 0.8g/L) were added to adjust the pH from around 5.5 to 7 in each batch. In the most of the batches, the resulting pH was maintained in an optimal range of 5–6 for hydrogen production without additional pH control."
9,Performance of methane reactor,"3.3 Performance of methane reactor Operation of the methane reactor started on Day 87 after hydrogen had been vigorously produced in the first stage reactor. Methane production in this reactor is presented versus time in Fig. 4 . As can be observed in Fig. 4 methane was vigorously produced from the beginning of the operation. Methane production between Days 87 to 136 fluctuated between 3.6–6.5mL/mL (feedstock) with an average of 5.5mL/mL. It increased slightly to an average of 7.3mL/mL (feedstock) between Days 136 and 169, and further increased to an average of 9.8mL/mL (feedstock) between Days 169 and 180. The maximum yield, equivalent to 522mL/gVS added, was similar with the methane yield obtained by Sosnowski et al. (2003) using a similar co-digestion feedstock and a two-stage process, although the first stage was operated in thermophilic condition and the total retention time used was 28.4days in that research. Overall, methane production in the methane reactor was vigorous during the high hydrogen production phase. In the low hydrogen production phase (Days 181–226) the methane production fluctuated between 3–6mL/mL (feedstock) with an average of 4.4mL/mL. In the intermediate hydrogen production phase (after Day 226) the overall methane production increased again to an average of around 7mL/mLfeedstock and then slightly decreased and stabilized at 5mL/mLfeedstock. The methane production rates in the high, intermediate and low hydrogen production phases were 3.4, 2.4 and 1.5L/d/reactor, respectively. These observations indicate that the methane production in the second stage was significantly affected by fermentation conditions in the first stage. As the TS, VS, tCOD and sCOD of the hydrogen reactor effluent in the three operational phases were similar the improvement in methane production was likely due changes in the composition of these components. It appears that enhanced hydrogen production in the first phase also resulted in the formation of metabolic products that were more readily metabolized in the second stage. The pH in the methane reactor varied between 6.8 and 7.2 over the entire operation, with it became slightly acidic at the beginning of each day and slightly basic at the end of the day. A typical pattern of pH and methane production over a daily period in the methane reactor is shown in Fig. 5 . Quite different from that observed in the hydrogen reactor, the pH increased gradually to 7.13 at the end of the batch from 7.0 at the beginning. The methane production had a higher rate in the initial 5h and then continued at a lower rate until the end of the batch and there was an inverse pattern between pH and methane production. These results indicate that the organic acids were utilized in the methane reactor thereby causing an increase in the pH. The characteristics of the effluent of the methane reactor in the three operation phases (high, intermediate and low hydrogen productions) are shown in Table 4 . The tCOD in the high hydrogen production phase was the lowest, with an average value of only 8.9g/L, while the tCODs in the other two operation periods were quite similar, 11.2 and 10.7g/L respectively. The tCOD removed in the methane reactor corresponded to the COD equivalence of the produced methane with a discrepancy of less than 10%. The sCOD in all the effluents were only 5–7% of the tCOD; the concentration of dissolved carbohydrates was only about 40mg/L; and no significant VFAs were detected in the liquid phase. Hence, all responses indicated that methanogenesis was complete in all the three phases. All effluents had high alkalinity that ranged from 3.4 to 4.0g/L, which increased by 110% as compared with that observed in the hydrogen reactor effluents."
10,Comparison of methane production potential of the feedstock and hydrogen reactor effluent,"3.4 Comparison of methane production potential of the feedstock and hydrogen reactor effluent To further evaluate the methane production in the two stage process, a separate BMP test was conducted using the hydrogen reactor effluent (sampled on Day 91 in the efficient hydrogen production period) and the heat treated feedstock as substrates. The resulting cumulative methane production is shown versus time in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6 it can be observed that both the rate of methane production and the ultimate methane production of the effluent of the hydrogen reactor were enhanced as compared to that of the feedstock. The latter was increased by approximately 8%. Theoretically, hydrogen production in the hydrogen reactor consumed COD and should have reduced the methane production potential of this feedstock. However, the actual ultimate methane production potential from the hydrogen reactor effluent was enhanced. The results of the BMP test support the observations made in the two stage reactors in that hydrogen production significantly improved the availability of substrates for methane production. This increase in availability appears to extend beyond the production of readily degradable COD in the hydrogen reactor that would yield increased CH4 in the methane reactor if conversion of complex substrates were kinetically limited. Complex COD appears to be made available in the hydrogen reactor that would not be made available in a stand-alone methanogenic reactor."
11,Conclusions,"When co-digesting sewage sludge and FW using the two-stage process, both the feedstock and the mixed liquid in hydrogen reactor required treatment to obtain substantial hydrogen production. Heat treatment of feedstock (100°C, 10min) and periodical treatment of mixed liquid and reactor walls by heat-treatment (121°C, 5min or 100°C, 10min), removal of biomass particles or flushing with air (15min–1h), were effective to eliminate the methanogenic activity in the reactor. Methane production in the second stage was significantly improved by the hydrogen production by a factor of more than 2-fold."
