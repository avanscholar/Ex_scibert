0,Introduction,"With rapid development of tissue engineering in recent years, many studies have focused on the application of electrospun nanofibers, especially for the formation of specialties fabrics. Biological materials such as natural protein, polylactic acid, PVA and so on could be electrospun into fiber membrane [1–3]. Functional polymers used for electrospinning process usually will be dissolved in a suitable solvent for the fabrication process. Many functional polymers are dissolved in different solvents and electrospun to form fabrics for different applications. The electrospun nanofiber membranes have large surface area per mass ratio, high porosity along with small pore sizes, flexibility and superior mechanical properties [4]. So that they are an excellent candidate for various applications in many important technology areas such as electronics, photonics, and mechanics [5,6]. The most remarkable feature associated with electrospinning process is the development of nano-size fiber in which the diameter of the fiber could reduce to tens of nanometers. Because of distinctive features as well as the simplicity and versatility of this technique, electrospinning has gained much attention in the past several years. SA is a polyelectrolyte that is superior to other materials in terms of the biodegradability, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity and proven antibacterial properties [7–9]. The abundancy of SA makes them as an attractive natural resource, reevaluated into many applications especially in biomedical fields [10]. This polysaccharide is extracted from seaweed and demonstrated outstanding water solubility, but due the rigidity, the mechanical weakness of SA membranes is a downside. PVA/SA polymer blending was reported to be synergistically miscible have solve the relaxation of SA membrane polymeric chains [11,12]. Blended solutions of PVA/SA were reported, but formations into fiber membrane with optimizations conditions comprises SA content, electric voltage, receiving distance and the nozzle velocity were seldomly reported. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques that can be useful for modelling and optimizing the effects of several independent variables on the response [13]. The main advantage of RSM is that it can reduce the number of experimental runs and provide sufficient information for statistically acceptable results also predict the mathematical model between the influence factor and the response value. Meanwhile, it can predict the best experimental scheme and improve experimental efficiency [14]. Although this method is suitable for optimizing experimental conditions, few attempts have been made on the PVA/SA electrospinning process [5,15,16]. In this study, the effect of SA addition on chemical properties of PVA fiber membrane was investigated through molecular analysis and thermal analysis. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to evaluate the coefficients in a quadratic mathematical model. Also, RSM was applied to predict the optimum conditions in the fabrication of PVA/SA fibers. The effects of four parameters (SA content, electric voltage, receiving distance and the nozzle velocity) were investigated within the context of RSM that incorporates design of experiments and regression [17–19]. So, a systematic statistical approach was adopted to obtain the optimum diameter of the electrospun fibers with different process conditions. And we also studied the mechanical property and liquid absorption property of fiber membranes."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material PVA (No.217, 20.5–24.5 cps) was purchased from Kuraray, Japan. SA (1.05–1.15 cps) was obtained from Tianjin Fucheng Chemical Reagent Factory, China. Electrospinning machine (Lab self-assembly); deionized water was used in all the experiments."
3,Electrospinning of PVA/SA fiber membranes,"2.2 Electrospinning of PVA/SA fiber membranes The 10 wt% PVA solutions were prepared by 10 g PVA stirring in 100 mL distilled water at 90 °C for 5 h, and 2 g SA was also dissolved in 100 mL water at room temperature for 2 h to obtain 2 wt% SA solutions. 10 wt% PVA and 2 wt% SA were blended with 50:50 proportion. Based on previous preparation experience [20], the electrospinning parameters of exit orifice diameter, voltage, receiving distance and nozzle velocity were 0.6 mm, 16 kV, 16 cm and 0.6 mL/h, respectively. As the PVA/SA precursor solution jet travels in the air, most of the solvent was evaporated, and the fiber was collected on the grounded target as fine fibers."
4,Molecular analysis,"2.3 Molecular analysis Infrared absorption spectra of SA powder, pure PVA membrane, and PVA/SA (50:50) composited membrane was recorded on a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet iS50). The samples were loaded in a sample holder and placed in the FTIR system. The measurements were conducted at ambient temperature from 400 to 4000 cm−1. X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) patterns of SA powder, pure PVA membrane and PVA/SA (50:50) were obtained using an advance diffractometer (D8-ADVANCE, Bruker, German) with Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40 kV, and the scanning scope of 2θ ranged from 5 to 40° at a scanning rate of 4°/min. The elements of C, O, Na and N on the PVA/SA membrane were analyzed by Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDX) - ultimMax 100 on Gemini SEM500, at 20 kV accelerating voltage and 1500× magnification."
5,Thermal analysis,2.4 Thermal analysis DSC (Netisch DSC200F3) analysis was performed using nitrogen gas at a 10 mL/min flow rate. The samples were ramped from room temperature to 350 °C at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min using aluminium pans. TGA was performed using a Netisch STA449F3 under nitrogen gas at a 20 mL/min flow rate. The samples were heated from 50 to 800 °C at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min using alumina pans.
6,Optimization of PVA/SA fiber membranes by response surface methodology,"2.5 Optimization of PVA/SA fiber membranes by response surface methodology A response surface model (RSM) for predicting the diameter of electrospun PVA/SA fibers was developed using the Box–Benkhen design (BBD) technique to find the optimum conditions in preparation of the PVA/SA fibers with the least diameter and the best morphology. The four variables at three levels (−1, 0, 1) in the BBD design were the SA content (X1 = 20–40%), electric voltage (X2 = 14–18 kV), receiving distance (X3 = 14–18 cm) and the nozzle velocity (X4 = 0.5–0.7 mL/h), as shown in Table 1 . The BBD included 29 experimental trials, which had six trials as a replication of the central points. These fine diameters (Y/nm) of 29 trials based on BBD were responses for each trail, as shown in Table 2 . After obtaining the optimal spinning parameters and the optimal proportion through BBD, the nanofibrous films with four different proportions (PVA:SA = 100:0, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40) were prepared by optimal parameters to check the reliability of optimal proportion double."
7,Physical characterization,"2.6 Physical characterization 2.6.1 Morphological observation Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TM3030 JAPAN Hitachi) was used to measure the diameters and to observe the fiber morphology. For observation of fibers with SEM, the fiber membranes were coated with gold using a sputtering technique. To determine the average fiber diameter, about 100 randomly selected fibers were used. Based on the SEM images, measurement and Image-J software were used to determine fiber diameters and estimation of bead percent, respectively. 2.6.2 Tensile strength Before tensile testing, all the samples need to stay at the standard condition (Temperature 20 °C, humidity 65%) for 24 h. The average thickness of each sample was measured by three testing points of the nanofibrous film. The tensile strength of fiber membranes was obtained by an electronic universal strength testing machine (Instron3369, USA). The sample size was 90 × 10 mm, the clamping gauge was 30 mm, and the tensile speed was 5 mm/min. 2.6.3 Contact angle The water contact angle was an indicator of membrane surface wettability. The contact angle was measured by Rame-hart goniometer using a sessile drop method. 20 μL water drop was deposited onto the membrane surface by a syringe. In minimizing the experimental error, contact angles at five different points of each sample were measured at room temperature and analyzed by ImageJ software. The average value of the five spots was reported."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Chemical characterization of PVA/SA fiber membranes,"3.1 Chemical characterization of PVA/SA fiber membranes PVA/SA electrospinning fiber membranes were fabricated following the electrospinning process, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Before response surface analysis and parameters optimization, chemical properties of SA blended PVA with 50:50 proportion were characterized to explain the effect of SA addition on PVA. Fig. 2 (a–c) shows that SA was blended with PVA to produce the PVA/SA membrane and Fig. 2(d) presents that the four elements were tested by EDX for PVA/SA membrane. The elements on the membrane were carbon (C), oxygen (O), sodium (Na) and nitrogen (N), which were about 45%, 32%, 17% and 6%, respectively. According to the chemical structures of PVA and SA displayed in Fig. 2(a), the elements of C and O were both abundant in the PVA and SA. While the Na element uniquely existed in the SA, the N element was from the original alga. The presence of aluminum (Al) in the spectrum was mainly due to the aluminum foil for collecting. Furthermore, due to the Na element uniquely existing in the SA and the Na element uniformly distributing in Fig. 2(d), it is evident that SA was evenly blended in PVA. According to the chemical structures of PVA and SA, the actual C/O ratio of PVA/SA membrane is higher than the theoretical C/O ratio of PVA and lower than that of SA. Molecules of SA powder, pure PVA membrane, and PVA/SA (50:50) composited membrane were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode, illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The apparent characteristic peaks of SA powder are indicated as 3416.98 cm−1 (hydroxyl groups –OH stretching vibrations), 1638.49 and 1128.8 cm−1 (asymmetric and symmetric –COO– stretching vibrations). The wide peak at 3416.98 cm−1 shows the self-associated peak of hydrogen bonding (O⋯H) in the intramolecular. Hydrogen bonding fetters the vibration of free hydroxyl groups for the broader peak. Moreover, the band appears at 3301.21 cm−1 for the hydroxyl groups from pure PVA membrane. The band at 2912.06 cm−1 is C–H stretching vibrations, and the bands at 1731.99 and 1089.68 cm−1 are stretching of the asymmetric and symmetric carboxyl group, respectively. After SA blending with PVA, the peak of -OH groups of PVA/SA membrane is broader and the stretching strength of PVA/SA membrane is weaker than that of SA powder, which strongly supports that hydrogen bonding could be formed between the -OH groups of SA and PVA [21]. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds are including the O⋯H between two –OH groups and the C–H⋯O–C between the –OH group and –COOH group. The peak of hydrogen bonding should be shown around 3460 cm−1, but which is close to the band of hydroxyl groups, so only one band would be observed. The band of hydroxyl groups at 3301.21 cm−1 of PVA is changed to –OH groups and hydrogen bonds 3310.01 cm−1 of PVA/SA. Another piece of evidence is that the peak of the asymmetric –COOH groups of PVA/SA membrane weakened due to the consumption of the ether bond of PVA with the –OH groups of SA [22]. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the chemical structure of PVA and SA consists of –OH groups as one of the active groups to compose the chain. When the PVA and SA are dissolved and blended in water, the sodium carboxylate (-COONa) converted to carboxylic acid with a negative charge (-COO-). It is plausible to form hydrogen bonding among –OH groups or between -COO- and –OH groups [23,24]. Thus, it can be concluded that PVA can improve the electro-spinnability of SA by increasing the interaction between molecules. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the XRD pattern of SA, PVA, and PVA/SA. The XRD of SA displays sharp absorption crystalline peaks at 2θ = 18.85°, which means that the crystallinity of SA powder is relatively high. PVA membrane shows a characteristic peak at 2θ = 19.15°, indicating that PVA is predominantly amorphous, displaying a semi-crystalline feature [25]. For PVA/SA membrane, the diffraction peak of the composited membrane at about 19.36° with lower intensity and broader peak than the PVA membrane. Even though SA is highly crystalline, the addition of SA into the PVA membrane does not improve its crystallinity and fiber orientation, and the high crystallinity of SA powder would not reduce the electro-spinnability of PVA [26]. Nevertheless, the degree of crystallization of SA powder should be reduced after it is dissolved and blended into PVA. That is because when the SA is dissolved in water, the distortion of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of SA macromolecule occurred [27] and opened, subsequently reducing the crystallinity of SA. This is supported by the low intensity and broader peak shown by PVA/SA membrane in Fig. 1(c). Furthermore, in the electrospinning process, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds may be formed arbitrarily between SA and PVA macromolecules [28], promoting irregularities in the PVA/SA macromolecular structure. FTIR analysis supporting this as there are many hydrogen bonds formed between PVA and SA as depicted in 3310.01 cm−1 in line with the chemical reaction mechanism as shown in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, it can be concluded that the PVA/SA membrane still manifests the semi-crystalline state as the PVA. Fig. 1(d) shows the DSC analysis of PVA/SA composite fibers membrane. The temperature approximately 100 °C corresponded to the vaporization temperature of the water. It has nothing to do with the thermal property of the composite itself because this phenomenon was caused by the good hydrophilicity of PVA [29]. The endothermic peak for both graphs with and without SA approximately at 190 and 200 °C respectively corresponded to the melting temperature of the fibers. PVA/SA fibers showed a lower melting point than those fibers with PVA only. Even though in nature, SA having a higher melting point at approximately 300 °C in comparison to PVA at 200 °C, but in this study with the presence of SA, thermal stability was disrupted. This is probably corresponding to the crystallinity of the fibers. In the electrospinning process, the long molecular chains were rapidly solidified, and the crystal structure was not formed. Thus, the crystallinity of the material was reduced. This explains to lower melting point of PVA/SA fibers. Nonetheless, the difference is not substantial, and PVA/SA fibers prone to mimic the thermal property of PVA fibers. This probably is due to higher PVA content, embody the characteristics of the fibers. The endothermic peak appearing at around 320 °C was due to the removal of some of the stronger hydroxyl groups of the hydrogen bond. With the addition of SA, the peak area decreased, and the crystallinity of the corresponding material also reduced. This could be that a larger number of hydroxyl groups in SA molecule formed hydrogen bonds with the PVA molecular chain. The effect of the stabilization process on the thermal degradation behavior of electrospun PVA/SA fibers membrane was characterized by TGA. The typical result is shown in Fig. 1(e) exhibited three-stages of decomposition. Decrement from 100 °C to 289.1 °C for PVA and from 100 °C to 270.7 °C for PVA/SA membrane indicated the loss of moisture and trapped solvents. The result is consistent with the endothermic reaction in DSC analysis at similar temperature zone, which is caused by evaporation of fibers during heating. Good hydrophilicity of PVA is the major contributor to this event. The steepness of curves indicated that the rate of mass loss. The mass of the material decreased significantly after 289.1 °C for PVA and 270.7 °C for PVA/SA, corresponding to the thermal decomposition of the material. It showed that with the addition of SA, the decomposition initiation temperature of the PVA/SA fibers membrane is lower than that of the PVA membrane. Moreover, the degradation rate of PVA/SA fibers is higher than PVA, as shown in the first derivative curves of DTG. This finding aligns with the mass loss graph where PVA/SA fibers have a steeper degradation process. This has highlighted that the thermal stability of PVA/SA composite fibers decreased with the addition of SA into PVA. Even though SA is proven to thermally stable than PVA, the physical interaction between PVA and SA is echoed with the inferior thermal stability of the PVA/SA membrane than its precursors. As aforementioned, initiation temperature for PVA/SA fibers is lower than PVA, indicating the decomposition of amorphous areas of site reaction between PVA and SA. Further decomposition at higher temperature disrupting fibers actual components. The decomposition peaks of SA are shown at approximately 422.0 °C for both TG and DTG graphs. At about 705.3 °C, the second decomposition peaks of SA are formed. This perhaps due to the decomposition of the larger polymer chain of SA. SA is thermally more stable than PVA resulting in PVA/SA fibers having a higher residual than PVA fibers."
10,Estimation of coefficients of mathematical polynomial functions,"3.2 Estimation of coefficients of mathematical polynomial functions Based on single-factor pre-experiment, the range of SA content, electric voltage, receiving distance and nozzle velocity was determined by observing the diameter variation and surface morphology of PVA/SA fibers. According to the levels of input variables in Table 1, the four factors are carried out as the independent variable of response surface experimental design, and the mean diameter of the PVA/SA fibers collected by electrospinning is the response value. The experimental results of BBD are shown in Table 2. Multiple regression analysis is applied to fit the response function with the data in Table 2. Design-Expert software in RSM environment is used to analyze the data, and then a quadratic mathematical regression analysis model is depicted as shown in Table 3 . The efficiency of the correlated model is checked by the coefficient of determination R2. In this case, the correlation coefficient of the model is R2 = 0.8807, which shows that the prediction model agrees well with the experimental results. It is also indicated that the model does not explain only 11.93% of the total variations. Coefficients in the equation with p > 0.05 or with a significance level greater than 5% are considered statistically significant [30,31]. The P-value of the model is 0.0003, which indicates that the model is highly significant and can be used to predict the diameter of electrospun PVA/SA fibers. Therefore, predicted values are calculated by this quadratic multiple regression predicted model. Fig. 3 expresses the actual and predicted values of PVA/SA fiber diameter. It can be seen that the experimental value of the design fits well with the predicted value. As analyzed by Design-expert software and based on response surface plots, optimum conditions are determined as SA content of 31.85%, electric voltage of 18.00 kV, receiving distance of 14.19 cm, nozzle velocity of 0.61 mL/h for producing PVA/SA fibers with a minimum diameter of 242.12 nm in theory. By the way, the regression equation is analyzed by variance analysis and significance test as shown in Table 4 . It shows that the lowest P-value of X1 is 0.0018 among four single factors, which indicates that the SA content has the most significant effect on fiber diameter. The effect of four factors on the diameter of PVA/SA fibers is X1>X3>X4>X2. The P-value of X1X2 and X2X3 is less than 0.05, which means the SA content and voltage, voltage and distance have the interaction effect. However, as for X1X3, X1X4, X2X4 and X3X4, they are not significant; thus, there is no interaction between the two factors."
11,Effect of the two-factor interaction on fiber diameter by response surface,"3.3 Effect of the two-factor interaction on fiber diameter by response surface Visualizing the predicted model equation can be obtained from the response surface and contour plot. The response surface plot is a theoretical three-dimensional plot showing the relationship between the response and independent variables. The bottom of the response surface plot is the contour plot. In the contour plot, lines of the constant response are drowning in the plane of the independent variables. These plots have given a piece of useful information about the model fitted, but they may not represent the actual behavior of the system. The predicted values of Y (fiber diameters) based on the range of X1, X2, X3 and X4 in RSM are estimated as contour and response surface plots (Fig. 4 ). A wide range of parameters can be manipulated to produce fibers with different diameters and parameters [32]. From these prediction profilers, the operating conditions for producing fibers with the desired diameter are predicted. Fig. 4(a) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of SA content and voltage. When the SA content is 20%, with increasing the voltage, the diameter of fibers decreased. However, when the SA content is 40%, the diameter of fibers increased with the increase of voltage. Thus, the interaction between SA content and voltage is remarkable. With the increase of SA content, the rigid material in spinning liquid increased, and macromolecules' adhesion in spinning solution decreased. With increasing the applied voltage, the jet of polymer electrospun liquid has a higher surface charge density and has more substantial electrostatic repulsion. When the electrostatic force and macromolecule solution are balanced, a more uniform and finer diameter is formed. From Fig. 4(a), it shows when the SA content is 35%, and the applied voltage is 16 kV produced the smallest diameter of fibers. Fig. 4(b) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of SA content and distance. When the SA content is 20%, the fiber diameter decreases first and then increases with the increase of distance. However, the diameter of fibers increases with the increase of the distance when the SA content is 40%. As the SA content in the PVA increases, the fibers' diameter shows a different trend as the distance increases. Distance is the main factor that is affected by the degree of solvent volatilization. When the reception distance is small, the solvent has little time to evaporate, resulting in the formation of beads on the surface of the fibers membrane. When the receiving distance increased, the electric field intensity decreases, resulting in insufficient jetting. Therefore, the diameter of fibers becomes larger. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the diameter of the fibers is the smallest when the SA content is 34% with a distance of 15 cm. Fig. 4(c) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of SA content and flow rate. When the SA content is 20%, the fiber diameter decreases firstly and then increases with increasing flow rate. And at each fixed point of SA content between 20 and 40%, the fiber diameter shows a similar trend. When the SA content is 34% and the flow rate is 0.6 mL/h, the diameter of the fibers reaches the smallest size. When the flow rate is lower, the fiber diameter distribution is relatively concentrated, related to the lower amount of solution used. However, when the flow rate is higher, the amount of spinning dope drafted at the same time interval becomes larger, resulting in instability in drafting and differentiation and then the solution is not thoroughly dispersed. Fig. 4(d) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of voltage and distance. When the distance is 14 cm, the fiber diameter decreases with the increased voltage. But when the distance is 18 cm, the fiber diameter increases with the increased voltage. When the voltage is 18 kV, and the distance is 14 cm, the diameter of fibers reaches the smallest. The interaction between voltage and distance is notable. As the distance increased, the spinning receiving area increases in the equal spinning time and the electric field strength is weakened. So that the jet cannot fully stretch as well as the fiber diameter increases. As the voltage increases, the electric field strength also increases, which causes the cracking to accelerate tailed with fiber stretching. The differentiation is at the fullest so that the diameter of the fibers obtained is the smallest. Fig. 4(e) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of voltage and flow rate. When the voltage is 14 kV, the fiber diameter decreases at first and then increases with the increase of flow rate. At each fixed point of voltage between 14 and 18 kV, the fiber diameter always decreases at first and then gradually increases. The diameter of the fibers is the smallest when the flow rate reaches 0.6 mL/h. As we can see from Fig. 4(e), once the flow velocity is fixed, the diameter of fibers changes slightly with the change of voltage. Fig. 4(f) shows the contour and response surface plot of fiber diameter of distance and flow rate. When the distance is 14 cm, the fiber diameter decreases at first and then increases with the increase of flow rate. At each fixed point between 14 and 18 cm, the fiber diameter always initially decreases and then increases. When the flow rate is 0.5 mL/h, and the distance is 15 cm, the fiber diameter achieves the smallest diameter. When the flow rate is lower, the fiber diameter arrangement is more concentrated, which may be related to the smallest amount of solution. When the flow rate is higher, the drafting solution also increases, which leads to the incomplete evaporation of the solution and the drafting and differentiation instability."
12,Verification of optimized PVA/SA fiber membranes by physical properties,"3.4 Verification of optimized PVA/SA fiber membranes by physical properties The obtained result shows that one of the most effective parameters affecting the diameter size and morphology of PVA/SA fibers was the SA content. Therefore, to study the effect of SA content on fiber diameter and morphology with comparison, SEM images with SA content of 0, 20, 30 and 40% were selected, respectively. The surface morphology of electrospun fibers under different experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 5 (a–d). The average diameters of electrospun fibers at PVA:SA content of 10:0, 8:2, 7:3 and 6:4 are 319.56±(62.51) nm, 376.18±(71.94) nm, 261.01±(31.31) nm and 372.55±(76.46) nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(e–h). It shows that as the SA content increasing, the bead percent also increases. This is due to the increase of the SA content leads to the increase of the rigid substances in the spinning solution, resulting in an increase of the polyelectrolyte in the spinning solution. Furthermore, the spinning liquid has a gel-like reaction, making them viscous and difficult to inject during the electrospinning process [33]. When the SA content is decreased, the viscosity of the spinning solution decreases gradually, which causes chain entanglement to be inadequate. Thus, the jet becomes unstable, and the continuity of the jet cannot be maintained. Therefore, fibers with uneven diameter are obtained. In jet flow, electrostatic repulsion causes the jet to split and atomized into droplets, which are also caused by the formation of beaded fibers. However, the surface morphology of electrospun fibers at 7:3 content shows uniform distribution without a bead, which has the lowest average diameter and the highest tensile strength indicated by Fig. 5(i). SA content seems to reach the threshold value, resulting in optimum fiber diameter and mechanical properties. Moreover, Fig. 5(i) also shows that the smaller the fiber diameter is, the stronger the tensile strength of the fiber membrane is. For pure PVA fiber membrane, due to the good entanglement of PVA macromolecular chain and the strong hydrogen bond between the molecular chains, PVA fiber membrane has excellent mechanical property [34]. With the increase of SA content, some beads emerge on the fiber, and the diameter of PVA/SA nanofibers is coarser. Thus, the entangling structure of PVA/SA fiber membranes is destroyed, so the tensile strength decreases. With PVA/SA fiber membrane at threshold content, the disappearing beads and the reducing diameter result in more tightly entangled fibers, which makes the tensile strength improve. Fig. 5(j–m) shows the contact angle at 15 s of fiber membranes with different SA content in the testing. Fig. 5(i) displays the dynamic contact angle to reflect the liquid absorption speed of fiber membranes in wound dressing application. With the addition of SA, the contact angle of the membrane decreases at 15 s, and hydrophilicity also decreases gradually. Furthermore, with the increase of SA content, the decreasing trend of contact angle decreases gradually, which means the liquid absorption speed slows down. The initial contact angle is 97°. From 0 to 5 s, the falling rate of contact angle at 30% SA content is 8°/s, and from 5 to 15 s the falling rate is 1.63°/s. With the development of time, hydrophilicity and water absorption are improved."
13,Conclusions,"It is proven that the blending of PVA/SA had a nice electro-spinnability, blending uniformity, low crystallinity, good thermal properties as portray by the FTIR, EDX, XRD, DSC and TGA analysis. Based on the RSM analysis, optimum conditions to produce PVA/SA fibers with a minimum diameter as low as 242.12 nm with the least beads were successfully attained. From the RSM analysis of PVA/SA solution, the concentration of SA significantly impacted the fiber diameter of the produced membrane. When the SA content is 30%, the obtained diameter is the smallest, and the tensile strength is the best. The optimum SA content by RSM analysis is 31.85%, which is adjacent to the experimental verification result. Compared with the other works, the optimized electrospun PVA/SA membrane of this study has a fine diameter level, excellent mechanical properties, and high liquid absorption properties, which has the potential to be used as the carrier of medical dressings to promote wound healing process."
