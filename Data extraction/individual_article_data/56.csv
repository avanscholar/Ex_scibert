0,Introduction,"To address the challenges of impending global energy needs and worsening environmental problems, conversion of solar energy into sustainable H2 by photocatalytic splitting of water has been identified as a promising solution and has attracted more and more global attention [1–7]. Although great progress has been achieved in designing photocatalyst and understanding the microscopic mechanism, photocatalytic H2 evolution still faces many challenges for practical application [8–17]. For example, the use of sacrificial reagents undesirably wastes the energy of holes, increases the system cost and brings along some oxidation products such as CO2 [18–20]. How to realize highly efficient production of H2 along with its intrinsic clean, non-carbon feature and effective use of holes is still a huge challenge. Recent progresses on photocatalytic selective organic transformations have demonstrated that this green and promising technology can obtain diversiform fine chemicals by selecting appropriate photocatalysts and fine control of reaction conditions [21–24]. For instance, aromatic alcohols could be efficaciously converted into aldehydes by holes photogenerated on visible-light-driven photocatalyst with appropriate conduction band position under mild conditions [24–29]. It is preferable to the conventional synthetic pathways (strong chemical oxidants (e.g., CrIV, ClO− and Cl2), environment unfriendly heavy metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and high pressure) [27–35]. Consequently, construction of a dual-function photocatalytic reaction system composed of a dehydrogenation of alcohols and a H2 evolution may be an ideal approach to solve the above problems. In the system, the photogenerated holes are utilized for selective dehydrogenation of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and H+, and the produced H+ are reduced by the photogenerated electrons to form H2. This cooperative photoredox reaction not only offers us a promising avenue to reducing the overall cost of water spitting by simultaneously recovering sustainable energy H2 and high-value fine chemicals, but also provides a new horizon for direct use of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, this reaction (ΔG = 28 kJ mol−1) requires much less energy than water splitting reaction (ΔG = 238 kJ mol−1) [36]. Therefore, compared to the photocatalytic selective organic transformation under O2 atmosphere and the water splitting with sacrificial reagents, such designed dual-purpose photocatalytic reaction system could be more feasible and practical in the perspective of the sustainable development of the whole human society. However, little success has been realized because of the difficulty in controlling the selectivity of hole-induced oxidation [18,19,36–40]. For example, under sunlight irradiation, Pt/CdS favored dehydrogenation (88.9%) over hydrogenolysis to produce H2, whereas Pd/CdS0.4Se0.6 favored hydrogenolysis (75%) over dehydrogenation to form toluene [36]. Although Pt/TiO2 [18,37,38] and Pd-nanocubes/TiO2-nanosheets [19] showed high selectivity for simultaneous 2,3-butanediol (1,1-dibutoxybutane or 1,1-diethoxyethane) production and H2 evolution under 300 W high-pressure Hg-lamp (λ = 365 nm) and UV–vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), respectively, up to now, few of literatures have been reported visible-light-driven heterogeneous photocatalytic splitting alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and H2 in a stoichiometric manner [40]. Therefore, to realize simultaneously photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols into H2 and corresponding aldehydes with high selectivity under visible light irradiation in one photocatalytic reaction system is still a worthy research area. Moreover, exploring the reaction mechanism is also necessary to design photocatalysts with high performance (selectivity, quantum efficiency and stability) for practical applicationas early as possible and expand the research field of photocatalysis such as reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation. Herein, we report a multi-function photocatalytic reaction system for simultaneous decorating atomic Ptx (x = 1–4) onto 2D-3D Zn3In2S6 hierarchical structure and visible-light-driven splitting of aromatic alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes at room temperature. Zn3In2S6 is a visible-light-absorbing semiconductor with a bulk electronic band gap of about 2.8 eV [41,42]. The Zn3In2S6 valence band (VB) has a potential of 1.9 V (vs. NHE), providing adequate oxidizing capacity for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols (taking p-methoxybenzyl alcohol as an example, the oxidative potentials of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol/p-methoxybenzaldehyde and p-methoxybenzaldehyde/oxidized p-methoxybenzaldehyde are about 1.56 V and 2.01 V (vs. NHE), respectively) [25,42]. The Zn3In2S6 conduction band (CB) located at about −0.9 V (vs. NHE) has sufficient driving force for H+ reduction [42,43]. In addition, 3D Zn3In2S6 microspheres assembled by 2D nanosheets are conducive to the deposition of metallic nanoparticles and harvest the induced visible light via multi-layers reflection [44]. Atomically dispersed Pt could offer the maximum atom efficiency and significantly promote separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrids exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activity for visible light-driven splitting of aromatic alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes at room temperature. The rates of H2 evolution and PhCHO production for Pt/Zn3In2S6 are much higher than that of the individual Zn3In2S6, Pt-nanoparticle/Zn3In2S6 and noble metal-free photocatalysts (MoSe2/Zn3In2S6, MoS2/Zn3In2S6 and TiN/Zn3In2S6). Moreover, this approach is also suitable for other metal sulfide (such as ZnIn2S4 and CdS). The high photocatalytic performance of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrids toward visible-light-driven splitting of aromatic alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes was investigated by a series of control experiments. The possible mechanism was proposed and proved by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and isotopic tracing experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts All chemicals used in the experiments were analytical grade and used without further purification. Zn3In2S6 was prepared by a hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 0.86 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.58 g InCl3·4H2O, 0.65 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and a double excess of CH3CSNH2 were dissolved in 70 mL of deionized water. The solution was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the yellow precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water for several times. Finally, the obtained sample was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. Pt/Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst was prepared by an in situ photodeposition method. The preparation procedure was the same as that in the activity test."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared photocatalysts were tested by a Bruker D8 advance X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. The morphologies and microstructures of the photocatalysts were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova Nano 450), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray beam. Additionally, the binding energies were corrected with reference to C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy test (DRS) was performed to measure the optical properties of the photocatalysts by a UV–VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, SHIMA-DZU, Japan) with BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. Photoluminescence (PL) properties were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer (RF530, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Japan). The values of Pt amount in Pt/Zn3In2S6 photocatalysts were detected by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, X-Series2, ThermoFisherScientific, Germany). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured on an EPR Spectrometer (A300, Bruker, Germany). High-angle annual dark-filed scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained on a FEI Titan Themis 200 equipped with a Bruker super-X EDS. The photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a three-electrode system (CHI-660E, Chenhua Instruments Co., China). A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst powder was deposited on the fluoride tin oxide (FTO) substrate to serve as working electrode (The 4-mg sample was dispersed in 500 μL of deionized water by sonication to get uniform slurry. Then, the 20 μL slurry was deposited as a film on a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm FTO substrate. After dry at room temperature, the working electrode was obtained.). A quartz cell filled with 0.1 M Na2SO4 or 0.1 M KCl electrolyte containing 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] was used as the reaction system."
4,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic splitting of aromatic alcohols were performed in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a glass-closed gas circulation system. In a typical experiment, 0.18 g Zn3In2S6 powders and 125 µL H2PtCl6 solutions (the weight content of Pt in Pt/Zn3In2S6 is 0.54%) were added into 50 mL benzotrifluoride containing 0.2 M benzyl alcohol. The reaction suspension was then degassed by using a mechanical pump and stirred for 30 min in the dark to attain an adsorption-desorption equilibrium. A 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was applied as a visible light source. A bandpass filter of 400 nm was used to obtain a 400 nm monochromatic light, the light intensity is 3.43 mW cm−2, and the irradiation area is about 25 cm2. The suspension temperature was controlled at about 10 °C by using a water cooling system. After the reaction, the amount of H2 generated from the reaction system was measured by using an online gas chromatograph (GC 2014, Shimadzu). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen generation is calculated according to following equation: (1) AQE = N e / N p × 100 % = 2 × N H / N p × 100 % Ne, NH and Np are the numbers of reacted electrons, evolved H2 molecules and incident photons, respectively. Turnover number (TON) was calculated based on the quantity of H2 and the quantity of metallic Pt: (2) TON = Numbers of evolved H 2 / Numbers of metallic Pt After reaction, the suspension was centrifuged to obtain the precipitate and the clear liquor. The precipitate was then washed with benzotrifluoride and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. Thus, the photocatalyst Pt/Zn3In2S6 was obtained. The clear liquor was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Agilent 7890A). Yield of aromatic aldehydes and selectivity for aromatic aldehydes were calculated with following equations: (3) Yield = C aldehyde / C 0 × 100 % (4) Selectivity = C aldehyde / C 0 - C alcohol × 100 % Here C0 is the initial concentration of aromatic alcohols; Calcohol and Caldehyde are the concentrations of the residual aromatic alcohols and the corresponding aromatic aldehydes at a certain time after the catalytic reaction, respectively. According to the theoretical reaction equation, in the photocatalytic splitting of one aromatic alcohol process, one aromatic aldehyde molecule would be formed by consuming of two holes and dehydrogenating of two protons; one H2 molecule would be produced by consuming of two electrons and two protons. Thus, the utilization rate (RU) of photogenerated electrons to holes could be calculated with following equation: (5) R U = Numbers of evolved H 2 / Numbers of aromatic aldehyde × 100 %"
5,Result and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized Zn3In2S6 sample were studied by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1 , all the XRD peaks of Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 can be well indexed to a hexagonal phase of Zn3In2S6 (cell parameters of a = b = 3.85 Å, c = 21.79 Å, JCPDS No. 24–1453). The peaks located at about 20.3°, 26.7°, 28.1°, 31.5°, 47.1°, 51.8°, 55.1° and 56.5° are attributed to the diffraction of the (0 0 5), (1 0 0), (1 0 2), (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (1 1 5), (2 0 0) and (2 0 3) crystal planes of hexagonal Zn3In2S6, respectively. No other new peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of Zn3In2S6, indicating that the as-prepared Zn3In2S6 is a pure phase. In addition, no peaks belonging to Pt nanocrystal are found in Pt/Zn3In2S6 sample when the weight ratio of Pt is 2.14%, which might be attributed to its low loading amount or small crystalline size. Moreover, it is notable that no peaks belonging to impurities can be found in the XRD pattern of Pt/Zn3In2S6 sample, indicating that Zn3In2S6 keeps pure hexagonal phase, and no impurities are formed in Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. Additionally, the diffraction peaks of Pt/Zn3In2S6 are as broad as that of Zn3In2S6. This indicates that the crystallographic structure of Zn3In2S6 has not been changed after deposition of Pt. 3.1.2 DRS analysis The light absorption properties of Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 samples were detected by UV–vis DRS. As shown in Figs. 2 and S1, it is clear that Zn3In2S6 exhibits a strong absorption edge at about 420 nm. Compared with absorption spectrum of Zn3In2S6, the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid exhibits stronger visible-light absorption. Moreover, the intensity of visible-light absorption increases with increasing Pt amount. It is often attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Pt nanoparticles which depends on its shape, size, and dielectric environment [14]. Herein, the particle size of Pt (about 1.5 nm, see the below analysis) is much smaller than the incident light wavelength, the electric field of light can be almost assumed to be uniform across the Pt nanoparticles. In this situation, the electron oscillation is described in a dipolar electric mode, and the red shift of the absorption for metal-semiconductor composite can be attributed to the near-field scattered light of the semiconductor [11,45]. Therefore, the enhanced visible-light absorption of the Pt/Zn3In2S6 composite can be mainly attributed to the near-field scattered light of the 2D-3D Zn3In2S6 spherically hierarchical structure. Thus, the visible-light driven photoactivity of Zn3In2S6 is expected to be improved by deposition of Pt. It is known that the optical band gap energy (Eg) of a direct band semiconductor Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 can be calculated from Kubelka-Munk function: (F(R)E)2 = A(E − Eg). (F(R), E and A are the absorption coefficient, photon energy and proportionality constant, respectively) [24]. By calculation, the band gap (Eg) of pure Zn3In2S6 is 2.95 eV. The band gap of Zn3In2S6 is slightly larger than the theoretical value (2.8 eV) [41], which can be attributed to the relatively low-dimensional structure of Zn3In2S6 nanoflakes (Fig. 3 ). Meanwhile, the band gap (Eg) of Pt/Zn3In2S6 is about 2.90 eV. It is clear that, compared with pure Zn3In2S6, the Pt/Zn3In2S6 sample may absorb more visible light. 3.1.3 SEM and TEM of pure Zn3In2S6 The morphology information and microscopic structure of the as-prepared Zn3In2S6 were investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3). It is clear that Zn3In2S6 exhibits regular microsphere-like shape with a diameter of about 1–2 μm. The magnified SEM image (inset in Fig. 3A) shows these microspheres with smooth surface are comprised of crisscrossed nanoflakes with thickness of about 10 nm. It indicates that the as-prepared Zn3In2S6 sample possesses 3D hierarchical structure by self-assembling of 2D nanoflakes (like marigold). This 2D-3D hierarchical structure can be further confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. 3B and C). The clear lattice fringes of the 2D nanoflakes (Fig. 3D) demonstrate the highly crystalline characteristic of Zn3In2S6. The d spacing value of 0.19 nm corresponds to the (1 1 0) crystal plane of the hexagonal Zn3In2S6 (JCPDS No. 24-1453). It is coincident with the XRD result (Fig. 1). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) equipped on the SEM (Fig. 3E) reveals that the as-prepared Zn3In2S6 sample is composed of zinc (Zn), indium (In) and sulfur (S), whereas carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are probably ascribed to the graphite conductive adhesive or the absorbed gaseous molecules. The EDX quantitative analysis gives an average Zn:In:S ratio of 1.76:1:3.15, which is in accordance with the stoichiometry of Zn3In2S6. In addition, EDX-mapping analysis (Fig. 3F) performed on SEM indicates that Zn, In and S uniformly enrich the entire microsphere. Based on the above characterization, it is concluded that the Zn3In2S6 with hierarchical structure has been successfully synthesized by this facile approach. 3.1.4 SEM, TEM and HAADF-STEM of the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid The microscopic structure and elementary composition of the typical Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid are presented in Fig. 4 . It can be seen from Fig. 4A and B that the morphology of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid is also identical to that of Zn3In2S6 in general, including 3D spherical shape and 2D layered nanoflakes (marked in Fig. 4C). However, when the TEM image was magnified 400,000 times (Fig. 4D), many ultrafine Pt particles with diameter of 0.4–1.6 nm dispersed on the (1 1 0) crystal plane of hexagonal Zn3In2S6 can be clearly found. Because the diameter of one Pt atom is about 0.366 nm, the ultrafine Pt particles are made up of 1–4 atoms. Thus the ultrafine Pt particles could be called atomically dispersed Ptx (x = 1–4), and that is why no peaks belonging to Pt nanocrystal are found in the XRD pattern of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. TEM-EDX-mapping analysis was applied to clarify the composition profile of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. As shown in Fig. 4E and F, besides Zn, In and S, Pt uniformly enriches the entire microsphere of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, implying that the diameter of Pt is very ultrafine (because of the small amount of Pt, the big particles or aggregation for the distribution of Pt would be not uniform or full of the entire microsphere). Moreover, the EDX spectrum (Fig. 4G) also reveals that the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid is composed of Zn, In, S and Pt, whereas C, O and Cu come from the carbon membrane and copper wire mesh. Furthermore, the dominance of isolated Pt atoms on 2D Zn3In2S6 can be confirmed by atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. S2). The HAADF-STEM image clearly shows many bright dots of atomic size as highlighted by the red circles, corresponding to heavy Pt atoms with a mean size of ∼1.5 nm, are well dispersed on the surface of 2D Zn3In2S6. It is in accordance with the recent report that a stable atomically dispersed Pd-TiO2 (Pd1/TiO2) was prepared by a photochemical strategy [46]. These results indicate that photodeposition may be an efficient method to prepare metal single-atom materials. 3.1.5 XPS of the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid To further determine the surface chemical composition and element valence states of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, the 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid was characterized by XPS (Fig. 5 ). The peaks at around 71.2 and 74.5 eV are attributed to metallic Pt0 (Fig. 5A) [14]. Furthermore, the amount of metallic Pt0 in 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid is measured to be about 1.3%, which is consistent with the measurement result of ICP-MS (1.5%). Meanwhile, the high resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p peaks at 1021.8 and 1044.8 eV (Fig. 5B), In 3d peaks at 445.0 and 452.6 eV (Fig. 5C) and S 2p at 161.8 and 162.9 eV (Fig. 5D) can be assigned to Zn2+, In3+ and S2− of Zn3In2S6, respectively. The XPS analysis corroborates the presence of metallic Pt0 in the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, and demonstrates that the chemical states of Zn3In2S6 had no change after deposition of Pt on it."
7,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst was evaluated by the dual-function photocatalytic system toward H2 evolution along with the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde under mild conditions (visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) and temperatures remained at 10 °C by using a water cooling system). The effect of the amount of photocatalyst on the photoactivity was investigated. As exemplified in Fig. 6 A, the rates of H2 evolution and PhCHO production increased along with the increasing amount of Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst and then decreased. The optimized amount of Zn3In2S6 in the dual-function photocatalytic system was about 0.18 g. The rates of H2 evolution and PhCHO production for the pure Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst are 21.0 and 26.7 µmol h−1, respectively. The selectivity is about 80%. A similar phenomenon had been reported by others when studying photocatalytic degradation of dyes [47]. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of availability of active sites on the catalyst surface and the penetration of light into the suspension [47]. Different amounts of H2PtCl6 solution were introduced into the photocatalytic system for studying the optimum content of Pt on improving the photoactivity of Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 6B. The photocatalytic H2 evolution and PhCHO production both display tendencies to increase with increasing Pt content and achieve maximum values at the weight content of 2.14%, indicating that a cooperative interaction between Pt and Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is required to optimally improve the photoactivity of Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. The rates of H2 evolution and PhCHO production for 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid can reach up to 158.1 and 165.9 µmol h−1, respectively, around 7.5 and 6.2 times higher than that of the pure Zn3In2S6 sample, respectively. A higher selectivity (>93%) can also be achieved on Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. These indicate that the photoactivity of Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst for H2 evolution and selective oxidation of PhCH2OH can be significantly enhanced simultaneously by depositing Pt as co-catalyst. Additionally, after keeping Zn3In2S6 in a glass vial for 12 months, the photocatalytic activity of 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid for H2 evolution (166.9 µmol h−1) displays no deactivation (Fig. S3). To demonstrate the superior of this dual-function reaction system for simultaneous visible light-driven photoredox of aromatic alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes by directly using photogenerated electrons and holes, two half-reactions (the photocatalytic selective oxidation of PhCH2OH under O2 atmosphere and the water splitting with sacrificial reagents) were performed on 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. It is inspiring that 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid exhibits higher photocatalytic activity in this cooperative photoredox catalysis than in the conventional water splitting using lactic acid as a hole scavenger (the rate of H2 evolution is about 21.4 µmol h−1) and selective oxidation of PhCH2OH using O2 as an electron scavenger (the rate of PhCHO production is about 118.3 µmol h−1) (Figs. S4 and S5). The primary product for PhCH2OH oxidation over Pt/Zn3In2S6photocatalysts is detected by GC–MS (Fig. S6). As shown in Fig. S6a, the peaks at about 7 and 9 min coincide with the peaks of standard PhCHO and PhCH2OH samples. A peak located at less than 6 min belongs to the impurity of benzotrifluoride solvent. The raw material PhCH2OH and the product PhCHO can be further demonstrated by MS spectra. Four strong mass peaks (m/z = 108, 107, 79 and 77) labeled at 9 min had been observed and could be attributed to PhCH2OH (Fig. S6b). While three strong mass peaks (m/z = 106, 105 and 77) come from 7 min belong to PhCHO (Fig. S6c). Moreover, No over oxidation products such as PhCOOH in solution were detected by GC–MS; CO2 in the evolved gas was also not detected by GC. The utilization rate (RU) of photogenerated electrons to holes was further investigated by the molar ratio of H2 and PhCHO. Compared with the pure Zn3In2S6 sample (Fig. 6A), the molar ratio of H2 and PhCHO over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid is dramatically improved (Fig. 6B). It is similar to the previous reports that metallic Pt0 is an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic splitting of H2O into H2 by reducing the over potential of H2 evolution [13–15]. These indicate that the efficient dual-function photocatalytic system toward H2 evolution along with the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde under mild conditions can be realized on Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. However, it can be seen that the rate of H2 evolution is always lower than that of PhCHO production whether Zn3In2S6 (Fig. 6A) or Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid (Fig. 6B). For single Zn3In2S6, because a quantifiable byproduct PhCH3 had been formed in the photocatalytic process, negligible amount of PhCH3 were detected in the whole process of photoredox reaction over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. The result is in line with the recent report that Pt loaded on CdS favors dehydrogenation (evolution of H2) over hydrogenolysis (selective transformation of PhCH2OH into PhCH3) [36]. In this work, preparation of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid and H2 evolution were performed in one reaction system by an in situ photodeposition method (Zn3In2S6 powder, chloroplatinic acid and PhCH2OH were simultaneously added into the reaction system. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on Zn3In2S6 could oxidize PhCH2OH into PhCHO and H+, while the photoinduced electrons could be trapped by Pt4+ and H+ to form Pt0 and H2, respectively.). Consequently, for Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, it may be mainly caused by the fact that part of the photogenerated electrons are robbed by [PtCl6]2− ions to form metallic Pt0 (competitive process, see TEM and XPS analyses in Figs. 4 and 5). As shown in Fig. 6C, the molar ratio (RU) of H2 and PhCHO over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid first increases with the increase of light time and then reaches a plateau. At the beginning of the photocatalytic splitting of benzyl alcohol (1 h), the amount of H2 (41 µmol) is far lower than that of PhCHO (126 µmol). The RU is only 32.5%, while RU increases fast along with the reaction time (1–4 h). At this stage of the reaction, reduction of [PtCl6]2− ions into metallic Pt0 may dominate the reaction, which can be proved by XPS analysis (Fig. 5, about 60.7% [PtCl6]2− ions were reduced into metallic Pt0 after reaction for 6 h) and the obviously enhanced photoactivity. After 6 h, RU increases slowly, implying the competitive process exists in the photocatalytic reaction. Nevertheless, RU can reach up to 98.2% at 12 h (that is close to 1), suggesting a stoichiometric cooperative photoredox reaction would be achieved by extending reaction time and photogenerated electrons-holes could be utilized simultaneously and effectively in one reaction system. At this point, 1962.1 µmol H2 and 1998.3 µmol PhCHO are produced. Therefore, the turnover number (TON) based on the amount of metallic Pt0 is calculated to be about 163.5, and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 4.6% is achieved for H2 evolution under monochromatic light irradiation at 400 nm. The relationship between the productions of H2 evolution and PhCHO generation from PhCH2OH and the wavelength of incident light was also investigated. As shown in Figs. 6D and S7, the H2 and PhCHO generation trends match well with 0.54%, 1.14%, 1.74%, 2.14% and 2.74% Pt/Zn3In2S6 optical absorption spectra. It demonstrates that the cooperative photoredox reaction is truly driven by a photocatalysis process on Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid under 600 nm incident light irradiation can be attributed to the hot-electron injection mechanism [45,48]. In addition, to fair evaluate that the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst gives high activity and selectivity, and differs from those of conventional co-catalysts [49–52], Pt-nanoparticles/Zn3In2S6 (Pt-NPs/Zn3In2S6), MoS2/Zn3In2S6, MoSe2/Zn3In2S6 and TiN/Zn3In2S6 were prepared by reported procedures (Fig. S8) [53–56]. It is clear that atomic photocatalyst Pt/Zn3In2S6 not only shows higher activity than Pt-NPs/Zn3In2S6, but also presents superior to MoS2/Zn3In2S6, MoSe2/Zn3In2S6 and TiN/Zn3In2S6 photocatalysts (Fig. 7 ). These results strongly suggest that Pt/Zn3In2S6 can be used as an efficient, visible-light-driven photocatalyst toward the photocatalytic selective splitting of aromatic alcohols into clean energy (H2) and fine chemicals (aromatic aldehydes or ethers) simultaneously under mild reaction conditions. To extend the general applicability of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid for the photocatalytic selective splitting of aromatic alcohols to H2 and corresponding aldehydes, a series of aromatic alcohols with different substituent groups (RPhCH2OH, R = MeO, Me, H, Cl, OH and NO2) were taken as examples. It can be seen that the Pt/Zn3In2S6 displays higher activity than Zn3In2S6 for photocatalytic splitting of aromatic alcohols (p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, p-chlorobenzyl alcohol and p-nitrobenzyl alcohol) (Fig. S9). In case of several aromatic alcohols with functional groups (Cl, OH and NO2), the productions of the aromatic aldehydes are relatively low due to electron-withdrawing effect [42], but the corresponding selectivity is high because of metal-support interactions (see the following mechanism discussion) [45,50]. To illustrate the general applicability of this dual-function photocatalytic reaction system for other photocatalysts, two hot photocatalysts (CdS andZnIn2S4) studied for photocatalytic H2 evolution were prepared. As shown in Fig. S10, XRD analysis revealed that the as-synthesized metal sulfides are well crystallized. The as-prepared CdS and ZnIn2S4 can be well indexed to the hexagonal structures of CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049) and ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No. 65-2023), respectively. Moreover, the hexagonal CdS exhibits microsphere shape constituted by nanoparticles; the sample ZnIn2S4 shows a typical marigold-like morphology (Fig. S11). The photocatalytic activities of CdS, Pt/CdS, ZnIn2S4 and Pt/ZnIn2S4 for selective splitting of benzyl alcohol into corresponding benzaldehyde and H2 are shown in Fig. S12. It can be seen that compared with pure metal sulfides, the photocatalytic activities (yields of benzaldehyde and H2) of Pt/metal sulfide are all remarkably enhanced. It is demonstrated that visible light-driven splitting of aromatic alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes could be achieved on usual photocatalysts. In the traditional solar-driven CO2 reduction, the photogenerated electrons are reacted with CO2 to produce chemicals, while the photogenerated holes are wasted by hole-scavengers [44]. Thus, this proposed strategy would also be extended in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, that is simultaneously visible-light-driven CO2 reduction and selective oxidation of alcohols were performed in one reaction system. The experimental details were enclosed in the supporting information. The result show that the deoxygenative CO2 reduction with CO-evolving and the dehydrogenative alcohols oxidation with aldehydes-producing could be realized in one reaction system under visible light Irradiation. The production rates of PhCHO and CO are about 17.5 and 6.3 µmol h−1, respectively. Therefore, there will be a big enough space and opportunity to establish the novel photocatalytic system for practical application such as H2 production, reduction of CO2 and N2 fixation."
8,Mechanism,"3.3 Mechanism 3.3.1 Mechanism of Ptx formation Based on the above characterization and analyses, the hybrid Pt/Zn3In2S6 with 0D-2D-3D hierarchical structures could be successfully prepared by this facile in situ approach and is stable in the cooperative photoredox catalysis. It is known that the formation of noble metal nanocrystals generally involves two stages: nucleation and growth [19]. In a typical process, [PtCl6]2− ions are reduced to Pt0 atoms, which subsequently aggregate to generate nuclei, which then grow into nanocrystals via sequential reduction of [PtCl6]2− into Pt0 on the formed nuclei. In the previously reported photodeposition for preparing a stable atomically dispersed Pd-TiO2 (Pd1/TiO2), formation of ethylene glycolate radicals on TiO2 nanosheets by UV light irradiation could forestall growth of Pd1 and was critical for fabrication of Pd1/TiO2 [46]. In this work, [PtCl6]2− ions, the reactant (PhCH2OH) and Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst exposed (1 1 0) crystal plane co-existed in the cooperative photoredox reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The crystal structure of hexagonal Zn3In2S6 shows that lots of S atoms are exposed on (1 1 0) plane of Zn3In2S6 nanosheets (Fig. 8A), which facilitate Pt atoms adsorbing and anchoring. Therefore, when the photoexcited electrons (reductant) are produced on the surface of Zn3In2S6 via visible light irradiation, Pt0 atoms are formed and anchored on the surface of Zn3In2S6 by reaction of [PtCl6]2− and photoexcited electrons (Fig. 8B). Consequently, the Schottky junction could be established by direct contact of semiconductor (Zn3In2S6) with noble metal (Pt0) and can act as a sink for the photoexcited electrons to facilitate the electrons from semiconductor to noble metal. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the computed work function of Zn3In2S6 (3.6 eV) is lower than that of Pt (5.65 eV). Along with the formation of Pt-Zn3In2S6 contact, an appropriate height of Schottky barrier (2.05 eV) between Zn3In2S6 and Pt is formed due to the difference between the work function of Zn3In2S6 and the work function of Pt (Fig. 9B). Under visible light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons in the Zn3In2S6 with a lower work function flow into the Pt with a higher work function. Moreover, the as-formed Schottky barrier can act as a sink for the photogenerated electrons to inhibit the backflow of electrons from the Pt to the Zn3In2S6. Such a Pt/Zn3In2S6 Schottky junction thus boosts the flow of electrons from the Zn3In2S6 to the Pt and leaves holes in the Zn3In2S6, preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 9C). On the other hand, it has been well assigned that metallic Pt0 is an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic reduction H+ into H2 [13–15], which was also proved in this work (see photoactivity analysis). Thus the electrons on the Pt0 atoms would be robbed by H+ to from H2, which inhibits (or completes with) the [PtCl6]2− ions are further reduced on the formed Pt0 atoms and prevents its growth. Thus, 2D Zn3In2S6 nanoflakes decorated with atomically dispersed Ptx (x = 1–4) are formed in the photocatalytic reaction. 3.3.2 Mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity It is known that in the photocatalytic process, a photocatalyst could be photoexcited by the induced light with energy larger than the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst to produce the photoexcited charges (electrons and holes), which then separate and transfer on the surface of the photocatalyst to react with reactant molecules [29,56–58]. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst is influenced by many factors such as crystalline phase, morphology, light absorption, and the photoexcited charges separation and transportation, etc., among which the last one is documented to be the most crucial factor [31–35]. Herein, after deposition of Ptx on Zn3In2S6, the crystallographic and microscopic structures of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid are the same as pure Zn3In2S6. Consequently, photoluminescence (PL) and photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out to study the charge production, separation and transportation [59–62]. The PL spectra in Fig. 10 A exhibit a broad emission peak, which is assigned to the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. After deposition of Ptx on Zn3In2S6, the PL intensity of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid become weak compared with that of pure Zn3In2S6. It is attributed to the fact that noble metal Ptx can act as a sink to trap the photogenerated electrons from Zn3In2S6 (Fig. 9), thus suppressing the undesirable recombination process of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Importantly, the introduction of Ptx results in rapid charge transfer in the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid compared with pure Zn3In2S6, as confirmed by time-resolved PL spectroscopy tests. The average PL lifetimes of Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid and pure Zn3In2S6 are 1.3 and 0.7 ns, respectively (Fig. 10B). Moreover, the high efficiency of the charge production, separation and transportation on Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid can also be confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements. As shown in Fig. 10C, the generation of an enhanced photocurrent for Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, which is about 3.5 times higher than that of pure Zn3In2S6, obviously illustrates that the production and mobility of the charge are promoted. Consistently, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study of the charge transfer rate reveals the expected semicircular Nyquist plots for pure Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid (Fig. 10D). EIS data are analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit model, and the values of charge transfer resistance are about 416 and 580 Ω/cm2 for Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid and pure Zn3In2S6, respectively. The linear-sweep voltammograms of the Zn3In2S6 and 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 photoelectrodes under visible light irradiation were also detected (Fig. S13). The cathodic current found in the range of −0.6 to −1.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl) can be attributed to H2 evolution. The significantly enhanced photocurrent of the 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid in comparison with the pure Zn3In2S6 indicates a more effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes over the 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. On the above analysis, Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid exhibits higher visible light absorption than pure Zn3In2S6 (Fig. 2), which could facilitate the production of the visible-light photoexcited charges. Additionally, the atomically dispersed Ptx can be prepared on the active sites of Zn3In2S6 and intimate contacts with it by this in situ photo-deposition method (Fig. 4), which can promote separation and transportation of the photogenerated charges (Fig. 10). Moreover, the atomically dispersed Ptx could offer the maximum atom efficiency and provide more reactive sites in comparison with Pt nanoparticles (NPs). Thus, the reaction kinetics could be improved significantly and resulting in enhancement of photoactivity. The pure Zn3In2S6 exhibits relative low selectivity due to generation of a small quantity of deoxidized product in the photocatalytic reaction via electron reduction [25]. However, negligible deoxidized product was detected on the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. The high selectivity can be attributed to the intrinsic properties of atomic Pt cocatalyst and metal-support interactions [45,50], The enhanced selectivity on the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid could be attributed to the fact that the photogenerated electrons can be effectively separated and transferred to the atomically dispersed Pt and the atomically dispersed Pt can improve the reaction kinetics of H2 evolution significantly (it has the largest work function and the lowest over-potential for H2 evolution). Therefore, the electrons will react with protons to form H2 but not deoxidized product of alcohols. These encouraging results strongly demonstrate that the atomic Ptx can effectively promote the production, separation and transfer of the photogenerated charges, and eventually result in higher photocatalytic activity and selectivity of the Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid than that of pure Zn3In2S6 toward simultaneous RPhCHO production and H2 evolution in one reaction system under visible light irradiation. 3.3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic redox reaction To understand the process of photocatalytic splitting of PhCH2OH over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid, a radical trapping experiment and an isotopic labelling study were performed. As shown in Fig. 11 , six EPR peaks over both Zn3In2S6 and Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid emerged when DMPO was added into the reaction system under visible light irradiation. They can be assigned to carbon-centered radicals [25]. However, no EPR signals were detected on the blank tests (the reaction system with the addition of DMPO in the dark; the reaction system with the addition of DMPO but without photocatalyst under visible light irradiation), indicating that the process of splitting of PhCH2OH is truly triggered by visible-light-driven photocatalysis. It is consistent with the above photoactivity test. Additionally, the intensity of the EPR signal over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid is obviously stronger than that over pure Zn3In2S6, demonstrating that much more carbon-centered radicals are formed after deposition of Ptx on Zn3In2S6. This also proves that the Ptx can effectively promote the separation and transfer of the photogenerated charges, because photogenerated holes make contributions to the formation of carbon-centered radicals. Fig. S14 shows mass spectra of PhCD2OH (m/z = 110) and its product (benzaldehyde) over Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid. It can be seen that the dehydrogenation product is PhCDO (m/z = 107) when PhCD2OH was introduced in the reaction system instead of PhCH2OH. It demonstrates that H atoms of OH and α CH are dehydrogenated in the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, on the basis of the above experimental results and analysis, a possible reaction mechanism for photocatalytic splitting of PhCH2OH by Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid with simultaneous H2 evolution and PhCHO production under visible light irradiation was proposed. As illustrated in Fig. 12 , the semiconductor Zn3In2S6 is firstly excited by visible light and generates photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The electrons are transferred from the conduction band of Zn3In2S6 to the deposited Ptx due to the presence of the Schottky junction, leaving the holes in the valence band of Zn3In2S6. An adsorbed PhCH2OH molecule is deprotonated to form one H+ ion (from OH group) and an alkoxide anion, and then reacts with a photogenerated hole, affording one corresponding carbon radical and one H+ ion (from the α CH of PhCH2O group). This carbon radical further reacts with one photogenerated hole to produce a PhCHO molecule. Simultaneously, two dehydrogenated H+ ions react with two photogenerated electrons accumulated in the Ptx to evolve a H2 molecule. In this cooperative photoredox reaction, photocatalytic selective oxidation reaction consumes one PhCH2OH molecule and two holes, and produces one PhCHO molecule and two protons; photocatalytic selective reduction process depletes two electrons and two protons, and affords one H2 molecule. Therefore, a cycle and efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion of biomass-relevant substrates reaction system was established."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, the 3D microsphere Zn3In2S6 assembled by 2D Zn3In2S6 nanoflakes decorated with atomic Ptx (x = 1–4) can be prepared by the in situ photocatalytic reaction, and can be used as an efficient, dual-functional and visible-light-driven photocatalyst toward the photocatalytic selective splitting of aromatic alcohols into clean energy (H2) and fine chemicals (aromatic aldehydes or ethers) simultaneously in one reaction system under mild reaction conditions. In the reaction system, the photogenerated electrons and holes were effective used, and it shows much higher photocatalytic activity than two half-reactions: the photocatalytic selective oxidation under O2 atmosphere and the water splitting with sacrificial reagents. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H2 evolution at 400 nm over 2.14% Pt/Zn3In2S6 hybrid could be achieved 4.6%. The Ptx as a co-catalyst can effectively promote the production, separation and transfer of the photogenerated charges and eventually result in the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Benzyl alcohol is first dehydrogenated into benzaldehyde and H+ ions via the corresponding carbon-centered radical by photoexcited holes, then H+ ions dehydrogenated from OH group and α CH of benzyl alcohol are evolved into H2 by photogenerated electrons. This study not only provides a promising way to directly use of photogenerated electrons and holes, but also supplies a dual-purpose, economic and sustainable way for synthesis of fine chemicals and H2 evolution (or carbon dioxide reduction and nitrogen fixation)."
