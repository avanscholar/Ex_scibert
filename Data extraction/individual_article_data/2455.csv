0,Introduction,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a major compound found in waste gases from some industries such as steel producing plants and it is also a major component of synthesis gas or syngas (Abubackar et al., 2011). In biorefineries, CO-rich syngas can be obtained from the gasification of biomass, solid waste or other carbonaceous feedstocks. Some of those feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, can also be hydrolyzed to obtain carbohydrates that can then similarly be fermented to generate high value metabolites, biofuels or platform chemicals (Fillat et al., 2017). CO can be converted anaerobically by acetogenic bacteria into a spectrum of commercially useful metabolites. This gas-fermentation technology represents an environmentally-friendly alternative to the more conventional crude oil-based refineries or other petrochemical processes for the production of fuels or chemicals. Several acetogenic bacteria assimilating CO are also able to metabolize CO2 and H2 as well as syngas, e.g. Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium autoethanogenum, Clostridium ragsdalei, Clostridium carboxidivorans (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a; Huhnke et al., 2010; Philips et al., 2015). Recent research on CO, CO2/H2 and syngas fermentation has focused on the production of different end-products, such as ethanol (Van Groenestijn et al., 2013), higher alcohols such as butanol or hexanol (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a; Philips et al., 2015), 2,3-butanediol (Köpke et al., 2011), biomethane (Sancho Navarro et al., 2016) or biopolymers, e.g., polyhydroxyalkanoates (Lagoa-Costa et al., 2017). Some biofuels obtained from C1-gas fermentation like biogas or biomethane (López et al., 2012) may need to be upgraded to remove CO2 or other by-products such as hydrogen sulphide (López et al., 2013). Many studies have been done with available pure cultures and only a few with mixed cultures (Rachbauer et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2015). Metabolic engineering is used as an additional opportunity to broaden the range of potential biocommodities that can be produced through anaerobic gas (CO, syngas and waste gas effluents) fermentation (Bengelsdorf et al., 2013). Bioalcohols such as ethanol and butanol, among others, are interesting biofuels that can be obtained through anaerobic gas fermentation and are suitable to replace gasoline or to be mixed with it in different ratios (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). So far, only one pure acetogenic strain has unequivocally been described to produce higher alcohols through such gas fermentation, namely C. carboxidivorans (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a,b; Philips et al., 2015). Other bacteria should potentially be able to perform similar metabolic conversions. Acetogens generally first convert gases into organic acids at relatively high (near-neutral) or slightly acidic pH, e.g. pH 6. The production of these acids induces a pH drop if the latter is uncontrolled. Such acidic conditions will then stimulate solventogenesis and the production of alcohols, i.e. either ethanol or higher alcohols. Although some studies have been done on the enrichment of ethanol producing communities (Singla et al., 2014), to the best of our knowledge no thorough enrichment studies have been performed for the production of higher alcohols through anaerobic gas fermentation. Therefore, this study aimed to enrich an anaerobic sludge for solventogenic bacteria able to ferment C1 gases, i.e. CO, CO2 and syngas, to ethanol and higher alcohols, applying specific conditions such as the alternation of high and low pH values of the bioreactor medium or the addition of a specific inhibitor of methanogens (i.e., bromoethane sulphonate, BES) in order to select and facilitate the growth of solventogens instead of methanogens. The effect of yeast extract and l-cyseine–HCl on the metabolism of the solventogenic acetogens was also studied."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass and medium composition,"2.1 Biomass and medium composition The anaerobic sludge (120 mL) was obtained from Biothane Systems International BV (Delft, The Netherlands) and it originated from an anaerobic digester producing biogas from industrial wastewater (Van Lier et al., 2015). The sludge was pregrown on CO (in triplicates in 40 mL bottles) for 14 days at uncontrolled pH (initial pH of 5.5 to favour solventogenesis) at a shaking speed of 120 rpm. The acclimatized sludge of 120 mL was used as inoculum in the reactor. A modified basal anaerobic unautoclaved medium was used as described elsewhere (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a) with a variation in the initial concentrations of yeast extract (YE – 0.3 g/L) and l-cysteine–HCl (0.6 g/L). No vitamin solution was added to the bioreactor, contrary to other studies focusing on solventogenic clostridia (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b,c) as some CO fermenting cultures have been shown to be able to metabolize gases in the absence of vitamins (Abubackar et al., 2015, 2016). 2.1.1 Set-up and operation of the continuous gas-fed bioreactor Bioreactor experiments were performed in a 2 L BIOFLO 110 bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) containing 1.2 L medium (working volume). A microsparger was introduced inside the reactor for sparging CO (100%) as the sole gaseous substrate, fed continuously at a rate of 10 mL/min using a mass flow controller (Aalborg GFC 17, Müllheim, Germany). The temperature of the bioreactor was maintained at 33 °C by means of a heating water jacket. Four baffles were symmetrically aligned to avoid vortex formation of the liquid medium and to enhance mixing. The bioreactor was supplied with a DO probe connected to a bio-flow controller and the dissolved oxygen in the bioreactor was less than 0.5% (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b,c,d). The agitation speed maintained thoroughout the experiment was 120 rpm. The bioreactor was operated at a constant pH of 5.5 from days 0 to 6 to inhibit methanogenesis and induce acetogenesis. On the 7th day, 2 mM of BES was added to inhibit methanogenesis and a pH of 6.2 was maintained to induce acetogenesis. On the 21st day of bioreactor operation, 1 g/L of YE and 0.9 g/L of l-cysteine–HCl were added for inducing growth of biomass, as it was low originally and thus allowing to reach a redox potential of −189 mV which was found to be suitable for CO metabolizing biomass to grow and simultaneously produce acids. On the 31st day, the pH was changed to 4.9 to stimulate solventogenesis. 2.1.2 Batch studies on syngas utilisation by the enriched sludge The enriched sludge and dissolved biomass collected from the reactor at the end of the experiment (46th day) were studied in the presence of syngas (mixture of CO, CO2, H2 and N2 in the ratio 20:20:10:50) to check the production of metabolites at initial pH 6.2, a temperature of 33 °C and 120 rpm. pH was not controlled in the batch bottles, but the initial pH was used as it is favourable for biomass growth and production of acids. The experiments were carried out in three 100 mL bottles with 40 mL medium and 10% inoculum. After inoculation, the bottles were sparged with syngas. The overhead pressure was 1 bar. The composition of the medium was described earlier (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a)."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods 2.2.1 Gas-phase CO and CO2 concentrations Gas samples (1 mL) were taken from the outlet sampling ports of the bioreactor to monitor the CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations. A HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Technologies, Madrid, Spain) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for measuring the gas-phase concentrations. The GC was fitted with a 15-m HP-PLOT Molecular Sieve 5A column (ID – 0.53 mm; film thickness – 50 μm). The initial oven temperature was kept constant at 50 °C, for 5 min, and then raised by 20 °C/min for 2 min, to reach a final temperature of 90 °C. The temperature of the injection port and the detector were maintained constant at 150 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Another HP 5890 gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Technologies, Madrid, Spain) connected with a TCD was used for measuring CO2 and CH4. The injection, oven, and detection temperatures were maintained at 90, 25, and 100 °C, respectively. The area obtained from the GC was correlated with the concentration of the gases. 2.2.2 Fermentation products The water-soluble products, “acetic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, ethanol, butanol and hexanol”, were analysed from liquid samples (1 mL) taken about every 24 h from the bioreactor medium using an HPLC HP1100 (Agilent Technologies, Madrid, Spain) equipped with a Supelcogel C610 column and a UV detector at a wavelength of 210 nm. The mobile phase was a 0.1% ortho-phosphoric acid solution fed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 30 °C. Before analysing the concentration of the water-soluble products by HPLC, the samples were centrifuged (7000 × g, 3 min) using a bench-scale centrifuge (ELMI Skyline ltd CM 70M07, Riga Latvia). 2.2.3 Redox potential and pH measurement In the bioreactor, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode connected to a transmitter (M300, Mettler Toledo, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) was used to measure the redox potential. An on-line pH controller (Hamilton, USA) was also placed in the bioreactor in order to maintain a constant pH during its operation. The pH was measured on-line with an (in built) sensor and adjusted using either 1 M NaOH or HCl solutions. 2.2.4 Measurement of biomass and specific growth rate of the solventogenic acetogens An UV–visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Model U-200, Pacisa & Giralt, Madrid, Spain) was used to measure the optical density (OD600 nm) of 1 mL of liquid samples withdrawn periodically from the bioreactor."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Sludge enrichment and production of acids and alcohols,"3.1 Sludge enrichment and production of acids and alcohols An initial relatively low pH of 5.5 was first applied to the continuous gas-fed stirred tank bioreactor in order to convert CO and the residual acids of the inoculum into alcohols, as acidic conditions have been reported to favour the production of solvents (e.g., alcohols) in gas fermentation (Abubackar et al., 2012; Kennes et al., 2016). The pH was maintained constant through automatic pH regulation. However, during the first week of operation, there was no production of alcohols at this pH value (pH 5.5), though there was some methane (CH4) production. Production of H2 was not observed in the bioreactor. It was probably readily consumed by the anaerobic microbial community present in the inoculum. Since the goal of this study was to enrich for gas fermenting anaerobic alcohol producing bacteria rather than for methanogens, 2 mM BES was added to the bioreactor medium on the 7th day, which completely inhibited methanogenesis. Simultaneously, there was a slight increase in the ethanol production up to ∼150 mg/L (Fig. 1 a). The lag phase continued till the 21st day with hardly any detectable biomass increase, measured in terms of optical density (Fig. 1b). During this initial period, nutrients, trace metals and vitamins were not added to the medium, as mixed populations in sludges generally require less rich media than pure cultures for their growth and activity (Kafkewitz and Togna, 1999). However, syngas or CO fermenting acetogens may require some additional nutrients as most studies reported that vitamins are required, mainly for the growth and metabolism of pure cultures (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a, 2017a,b,c,d). Because of this low activity and long lag phase, YE and l-cysteine–HCl were added on the 21st day as YE is expected to induce biomass growth and hence improve the production of acids and, later on, presumably their bioconversion to alcohols. Besides, 0.9 g/L l-cysteine–HCl, which was higher than the previous amount of 0.6 g/L of l-cysteine–HCl, was added in order to lower the redox potential of the bioreactor medium. Complete absence of YE in the culture medium of C. carboxidivorans has been found to produce butanol (1.0 g/L), hexanol (0.9 g/L) and ethanol (3.0 g/L) with a lag phase of less than 2 days in the presence of syngas as the sole substrate (Philips et al., 2015). But, in case of mixed cultures, one of the reasons for the longer lag phase of the solventogenic acetogens may be due to the presence of CO as the sole carbon substrate, which is more difficult to convert compared to when it is present in a mixture with H2 (in lesser percentage) as in the case of syngas. Wan et al. (2017) reported that in the absence of YE, there was limited growth of the syngas fermenting strain C. carboxidivorans P7 with a lag phase of 5 days, even in the presence of easily consumable sugars like glucose and fructose. The presence of YE has also been found to improve the availability of essential amino acids in C. carboxidivorans P7, while these amino acids, particularly aspartate and glutamate, were not synthesized de novo. Low YE concentrations or its absence have been observed to induce solventogenesis (Abubackar et al., 2012), while the initial presence of YE would be required in order to stimulate cell synthesis and growth of gas fermenting clostridia. Its addition in this study was thus mainly aimed at stimulating the required initial biomass growth, as shown in Fig. 1b, rather than solventogensis. There are studies on the production of alcohols and acids from CO by pure cultures by replacing YE with corn steep liquor (Maddipati et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014a,b), e.g. a pure culture study with Clostridium strain P11 produced 6.1 g/L of ethanol from syngas in the presence of YE, and still 1.7 g/L more when corn steep liquor was present in the medium (Maddipati et al., 2011). In comparison to all reported studies, this study could produce hexanol and butanol using CO as the sole substrate in the reactor study (Fig. 1a). Batch experiments were also perfomed with syngas in order to find out the capability of the enriched culture to use H2 and CO2 as the substrate (Fig. 3). In the presence of CO, this is the sole carbon substrate used for growth and as electron donor, but in case of syngas, H2 is also used as electron donor (Bertsch and Müller, 2015). Moreover, no vitamins were supplied to the medium which can be a reason for the longer lag phase. YE was primarily used in this study for enrichment as it is mostly used in CO fermentation (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a). Further research is required on decreasing the YE concentration or replacing it with alternative nitrogen sources. l-cysteine–HCl, a non-essential amino acid, is reported to be a crucial component to decrease the redox potential of anaerobic systems and stimulate cell growth (Sim and Kamaruddin, 2008). A more reduced medium or the presence of a higher concentration of reducing agents such as l-cysteine–HCl have been reported to improve solventogenesis and alcohol production in C. autoethanogenum (Abubackar et al., 2012). The redox potential kept gradually decreasing down to a minimum value of −400 mV on the 28th day of operation and a typical sigmoid bacterial growth was then observed during that period, as inferred from the OD600 values (Fig. 1b). The production of acetic acid and ethanol was observed (Fig. 1a) from the 23rd day onwards. The highest amounts of acetic acid and ethanol produced were 6.18 g/L and 11.1 g/L on the 29th and 44th day, respectively, confirming that the acid was produced first to be later converted into the alcohol. The ethanol, butanol and hexanol concentrations detected in the fermentation broth on day 25 were 439, 91 and 400 mg/L, respectively, indicating the initiation of solventogenesis in the fermentation medium already at pH values of 6.2. Indeed, although only alcohols are usually produced at low pH in solventogenic anaerobic bacteria, both acids as well as alcohols can be found at higher pH values (6.2) by many gas fermenting acetogens (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). From Fig. 1a and b it is evident that once biomass growth stopped there was a net fast decrease of the volatile fatty acids concentrations with a similarly fast increase in the concentrations of the corresponding alcohols (C2, C4, C6). Nevertheless, before biomass growth completely ceased, the volatile fatty acid accumulation rates decreased and levelled off with the production of alcohols during that period. This indicates that at the end of the high pH period, solventogenesis can already start. Butanol and hexanol were produced later than ethanol and somewhat more slowly. Ethanol appears generally first in anaerobic gas fermentation processes, while the production of higher alcohols occurs at a later stage (Philips et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b,c; Ukopong et al., 2012). The highest amounts of butanol and hexanol were 1.8 and 1.46 g/L, detected on the 41st and 42nd day, respectively. Finally, the highest production of butyric acid and hexanoic acid was 1.33 and 0.42 g/L on the 25th day and 42nd day, respectively (Fig. 1a). However, the butyric and hexanoic acids were consumed later on and rapidly disappeared. The lower production of those longer chain organic acids was partly due to their conversion into alcohols. Overall, it can thus be concluded that the applied strategy, based mainly on evaluating the effect of medium composition and alternating its pH, was successful in the enrichment of solventogenic anaerobic populations. Table 1 summarizes the approximate CO utilisation for the production of different metabolites in the enrichment phase. Fig. 1c shows that some lactic acid, formic acid and propionic acid were detected at low concentrations (≤200 mg/L), but both their production and subsequent consumption took place during the high pH stage. Lactic acid was mainly present during the first 2 weeks, reaching a maximum concentration of 187.2 mg/L on the 11th day. Formic acid had an initial concentration of 98 mg/L, provided by the inoculum. It was completely utilised during the initial phase, suggesting that formic acid was used as the substrate for methanogenesis along with CO. However, on suppression of methanogenesis, during the 2nd week of operation, formic acid was found to sharply increase again to values of ∼120 mg/L on the 7th–8th day, but was then readily consumed again during the 2nd week of operation. With the onset of acetogenesis on the 21st day, the formic acid concentration was again found to transiently increase up to 200 mg/L on the 24th day. Thereafter, from day 25 onwards, the formic acid concentration decreased again and it was completely consumed on the 31st day of operation. The profile of propionic acid fluctuated during the course of bioreactor operation with a somewhat similar pattern as that of formic acid. The concentration of propionic acid increased from 0 to 63 mg/L during the 1st week of operation. Later on, the suppression of methanogenesis increased the concentration of propionic acid up to 123 mg/L on the 11th day, but it again started decreasing to 20.4 mg/L on the 18th day of operation. On the 2nd day and 28th day, the measured propionic acid concentrations were 110 mg/L and 178 mg/L, which were relatively higher than its detected concentrations during the course of experiment. But the propionic acid concentration decreased on day 29, no more propionic acid was detected in the enriched medium anymore from day 30 onwards (acetogenesis has started). All those metabolites were, in any case, produced at low concentrations compared to even carbon-numbered fatty acids and had completely disappeared before solventogenesis started or when lowering the pH value. During CO fermentation, the production of these acids is siginificant as they can be co-metabolites, even produced in minor amounts). Future experiments can be performed using varying concentrations of these acids, while determining their effect on the production of other metabolites."
6,Biomass profile of the enriched culture of solventogenic acetogens and specific growth rate,"3.2 Biomass profile of the enriched culture of solventogenic acetogens and specific growth rate Fig. 1b shows the steady increase in the biomass concentration in the liquid phase from the 21st day of operation, after an initial lag phase. The first reading of OD was 0.065 and it then dropped down to 0.04 on the 2nd day. The subsequent optical density (OD) readings decreased further and dropped down to 0.03 on the 21st day of operation (Fig. 1b). This suggested that probably the medium composition was rather unfavourable to biomass growth, as parameters like pH can be manipulated to stimulate CO utilisation by growth of solventogenic acetogens (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). During the following acidogenic phase, the measured OD increased to 1.2 on the 31st day. Then, on application of a low pH to induce solventogenesis, the OD started dropping somewhat, down to 1.14 on the 32nd day, to finally stabilize around 1.0 on the 40th day. Acidogenic conditions are known to be related to biomass growth and ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) generation, while it is not the case with solventogensis (Abubackar et al., 2011). Acidification resulted almost instantaneously in the termination of biomass growth or even some decline (Fig. 1b). This drop in OD reading indicates a sudden shock to the bacterial community, which could have induced some cell lysis. Ethanol reached its highest concentration of 11.1 g/L on day 41 at the highest biomass concentration with an OD of 1.23. This observation indicates that once the biomass got adapted to solventogenic conditions, the metabolic capability to produce solvent-metabolites (ethanol in this case) was activated. After reaching a threshold concentration of 11.1 g/L ethanol, the cells started decaying with simultaneous reduction in the production of solvent-metabolites. The decay of the bacterial biomass may sometimes be attributed to the effect of solventogenic stress induced by the organic solvents produced (Alsaker et al., 2010). However, although a concentration of 11.1 g/L ethanol may exert some inhibition on gas fermenting clostridia, it has been shown that inhibition and eventually cell disruption can be limited at such modest ethanol concentrations (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016b). Though the highest concentrations of butanol and hexanol, i.e., 1.18 g/L (41st day) and 1.46 g/L (42nd day), were achieved during the solventogenic stage, the concentrations of these alcohols dropped somewhat later for an unknown reason, which could have involved some butanol and hexanol degradation, although this was not confirmed and has not been reported before. Being more hydrophobic and hence more toxic to the bacterial cells, butanol and hexanol may perhaps also level off to a concentration that is non-toxic to the biomass (Wilbanks and Trinh, 2017). Microbial community analysis may give a better idea about the metabolism and operating strategies for optimum production of alcohols during CO fermentation."
7,Profile of CO consumption and CO2 production,"3.3 Profile of CO consumption and CO2 production The profile of CO in both the influent and effluent gas and the CO2 production and consumption profiles are shown in Fig. 2 . These profiles are related to the production of acids and alcohols. The initial influent and effluent CO concentration (start-up, day 0) was 1145 g/m3. The effluent gas concentration was then found to already drop down to 923 g/m3 of CO on the 1st day of operation to subsequently further decrease to 672 g/m3 on the 4th day. The addition of BES immediately decreased CO consumption and, for the next 2 weeks, there was only 10–15% CO metabolized. The effluent CO concentration fluctuated between 1145 and 1017 g/m3 from the 7th to 21st day of operation. The minimum concentration of effluent CO was 465.8 g/m3 (removal efficiency of 59.3%) on the 28th day of operation to again increase to 695 g/m3 on the 29th day of operation. The minimum redox value of −400 mV was observed on this day (Fig. 1b) and a sharp increase in the ethanol production started from this day of operation (Fig. 1a). This indicates that a maximum CO removal efficiency of 59% is achieved, after which solventogenesis is accelerated. The effluent CO concentration increased again to around 1100 g/m3 on the 36th day and remained approximately constant on the 46th day of operation. The production of CO2 (Fig. 2) was observed from the start of the operation already, indicating the active metabolism of the anaerobic sludge. During the 1st week of operation, CO2 in the effluent increased from 1.56 to 6.23 g/m3 to later decrease to 1.76 g/m3 on the 7th day of operation. From the end of the 1st week of operation till the 20th day, the effluent CO2 concentration remained below 1 g/m3. This was in agreement with the low CO consumption, low biomass growth and reduced activity in general during that initial phase. On the 21st day, the concentration of effluent CO2 increased again up to 6.23 g/m3 and reached its maximum value of 65 g/m3 on the 27th day of operation, corresponding to the maximum CO consumption. This can be easily understood, as CO2 is a co-product in some conversion reactions of CO into acids or alcohols, while CO2 would usually be used up later on (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). On days 28–29, the effluent CO2 concentration dropped to 56 and 11.34 g/m3 consecutively (Fig. 2). Simultaneously, biomass reached its maximum concentration as well as some metabolites, such as acetic acid and the effluent CO concentration was low (i.e., high consumption). The effluent concentration of CO2 was around or below 11–12 g/m3 between days 30 and 37 of operation, probably due to low CO consumption. Between days 39 and 46, the CO2 concentration in the effluent decreased rapidly. A low value of only 2.67 g/m3 was detected on day 46 (Fig. 3 )."
8,Operating pH and redox potential,"3.4 Operating pH and redox potential A low pH is expected to favour solventogenesis (Abubackar et al., 2012). However, using a low pH during bioreactor start-up may impede good biomass growth. Nevertheless, the operating pH during the 1st week of operation was maintained at a relatively low value of 5.5 in order to try to suppress the production of CH4 and to convert the residual acids in the sludge/inoculum into alcohols. Such low pH was, however, not effective enough to suppress methanogenesis, requiring the addition of BES. Thereafter, the pH was increased to 6.2 and maintained at this value till the 31st day of operation, when the pH was again changed to 4.9 and then kept constant till the 46th day to stimulate solventogenesis and favour the conversion of acids, produced at high pH of 6.2, into alcohols (Fig. 1a). The redox potential of the fermentation broth changed from −96 mV to −110 mV during the 1st week of operation. From the 8th day of operation, after adding BES, the redox value became positive with a value of 11–12 mV, indicating inhibition of the metabolism. From the 15th day, the redox value again became negative and reached values of −23.9 and −30.0 mV between days 16 and 18. From the 21st day, the redox value dropped to −189 mV and kept decreasing steadily to −342 mV when reaching the 31st day, i.e. during the acetogenic phase. The drop of the redox potential (Fig. 1b) was accompagnied by the sudden growth of biomass (Fig. 1b), concomitant to a significant gas consumption (Fig. 2) and metabolite production. Changes in redox potential are known to be affected by the pH value and the metabolic activity. From day 40, the redox value increased to −162.3 mV, and thereafter it continued increasing steadily from the 41st day up to the 45th day to reach a value of −89.23 mV. The redox value at the end of the bioreactor operation, on the 46th day, was −98.14 mV (Fig. 1b)."
9,Syngas as potential substrate mixture for the enriched anaerobic sludge,"3.5 Syngas as potential substrate mixture for the enriched anaerobic sludge CO metabolizing acetogens may also be able to grow on H2/CO2 or syngas mixtures. The ability to metabolize such mixtures is interesting and relevant from a practical point of view (Rachbauer et al., 2017). Bottle experiments showed that the CO enriched sludge is indeed also able to use the mixture of CO /CO2/H2 as carbon and energy source. The highest concentrations of the metabolites were recorded and reached the following values: acetic acid, 1.9 g/L, ethanol, 0.89 g/L, butyric acid, 0.98 g/L, butanol, 0.6 g/L and hexanoic acid, 0.34 g/L (Fig. 3a). H2 and CO were completely utilised after 7 days batch experiment, while there was still CO2 as a major metabolic co-product of syngas fermentation and as measured from the headspaces of the bottles (Fig. 3b). Since these are bottle experiments, pH was not regulated and was allowed to drop freely as a result of acids production, reaching a final pH value of 5.1."
10,Practical application and future perspectives,"3.6 Practical application and future perspectives Only very few acetogenic isolates are able to produce (bio)ethanol through C1 gas fermentation, while the production of longer chain alcohols (butanol and hexanol) is still scarcer and has mainly been studied in the single species C. carboxidivorans (Philips et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a,b,c). Enrichment of additional microbial populations is therefore highly interesting. This study shows the possibility to enrich for solventogenic acetogens from a methanogenic sludge for producing biofuels and alcohols such as ethanol, butanol, and hexanol, as an approach for a potential larger scale production of such compounds. These products can be obtained through fermentation of waste gas emissions or from syngas produced from waste or renewable resources. Although most research done so far has focused on pure cultures, mixed cultures present some interesting features such as their ability to be used in bioreactors under non sterile conditions, their generally lower requirements for micronutrients, their good resistance to inlet shock loads or starvation compared to single strains or their higher resistance to toxic or inhibitory conditions. Working under non sterile conditions reduces operating costs. Conversely, one issue would be to be able to select for the desired end products whenever working under non sterile conditions. A recent study on the enrichment of a mixed culture has focussed on the production of acetate (350 mg/L) in batch bottles by BES (50 mM) treated anaerobic sludge in the presence of biogas containing CO2, H2 and CH4 (Omar et al., 2018). The medium used in that study was supplemented with vitamins. Besides, a hollow fibre membrane biofilm reactor has been found to produce acetate (4.22 g/L), butyrate (1.35 g/L), caproate (0.88 g/L) and caprylate (0.52 g/L) at 35 °C, but no alcohols were detected (Shen et al., 2018). Also, when modulating the partial pressure composition, i.e. pH2 and pCO2, the amount of alcohol produced by a mixed culture could reach 16.9 g/L in a hollow fibre membrane bioreactor (Wang and Wan, 2009). Still in another report, a mixed culture predominantly composed of Alkalibacterium bacchi CP15 and Clostridium propionicum enriched from a monoculture syngas fermenting reactor produced, respectively, 1.3 g/L and 2.36 g/L ethanol in medium supplemented with yeast extract and cornsteep liquor. According to Liu et al. (2014a), the efficiency of CO utilisation was 40.4% and 50.3% in medium supplemented with, respectively, YE and corn steep liquor. In a continuous syngas fermenting reactor with cell recycle, a mixed culture of Alkalibacterium bacchi CP15 and Clostridium propionicum produced a maximum of 8 g/L ethanol, 6 g/L propanol and 1 g/L butanol, corresponding to 61% CO consumption in YE free medium (Liu et al., 2014b). In this study, the CO utilisation reached 59% with higher metabolite concentrations, though a longer time was required to enrich the solventogenic sludge and activate CO metabolizing microorganisms."
11,Conclusions,"Sequential selective enrichment of solventogenic acetogens from a highly active methanogenic sludge was possible, with methane production during the 1st week and a prolonged lag phase for acetogens (2nd week). Acetogenesis was induced upon addition of YE and l-cysteine–HCl, with subsequent solventogenesis. The successful enrichment strategy first allowed the growth of acetogens, followed by acidification which ended biomass growth and stimulated solventogenesis. 11.1 g/L ethanol was obtained, which is higher than most values reported in pure culture studies under similar conditions. Mixed cultures may produce higher concentrations of alcohols, though a longer lag phase may be required for stimulating solventogens. This study shows that it is possible to stop the bioconversion steps at the level of solvent (alcohols) production by acetogens, while limiting or inhibiting the activity of methanogens, which are more sensitive to non-optimal operating conditions besides exhibiting low growth rates."
