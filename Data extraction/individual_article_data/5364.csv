0,Introduction,"The development and utilization of lignocellulosic biomass resources represent a long-term solution for alleviating the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels. The worldwide production of bananas is approximately 113.28 million tons per year, with China accounting for around 11.76% (FAO, 2016). As a main agricultural waste in tropical and subtropical regions, banana pseudo-stem (BPs) is an abundant, renewable and low-cost resource. It has been widely recognized that lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose (30–35 wt%), hemicellulose (15–35 wt%) and lignin (20–35 wt%) (Peng et al., 2012). Generally, the plant biomass is mainly gasified for power generation, processed to briquette fuels, fermented for ethanol production, and thermochemically converted to liquid fuels (Cao et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2016). However, these processes are usually conducted under remarkably high temperature and pressure. Alternatively, solvolytic liquefaction is commonly performed at relatively mild temperature and under atmospheric pressure using polyhydric alcohols or phenol as liquefaction solvents (Hu et al., 2014). In the past decade, researchers have focused on the preparation of liquid biopolyols with desirable functional groups (Belinda et al., 2014). The obtained polymeric products can be applied directly to the preparation of various bio-based chemicals, such as polyurethanes (PUs) (Huang et al., 2017b) and phenolic resins (Pan, 2011). Recently, the solid liquefaction residue (LR) has received additional attention, as it can be utilized to understand the liquefaction behavior and to prepare cellulose. Li et al. (2015) produced highly accessible cellulose microfibers from holocellulose by a combination of bleaching and liquefaction processes. Xie et al. (2016a,b) and Huang et al. (2017b) isolated cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals from liquefied straw and bamboo residues. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF) and nanocrystals (CNC) were successfully obtained by liquefaction and subsequently TEMPO-mediated oxidation from banana pseudo-stem (Meng et al., 2019). Kinetic studies have been previous carried out to investigate the biomass liquefaction process in detail. Calvini et al. (2007) used a two-stage model to analyze the kinetics of cellulose degradation. Yan et al. (2010) conducted kinetic analysis of cornstalk liquefaction in polyhydric alcohols. Zhang et al. (2014) examined the kinetics of liquefaction of wood and estimated the kinetic parameters of its major cell wall components. Based on thermogravimetric analysis, Shi et al. (2016a,b) employed different mathematical approaches to determine the kinetic parameters and mechanism functions of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin liquefied in polyhydric alcohols. Huang et al. (2017a) also studied the thermal decomposition characteristics of microwave liquefied rape straw residues obtained under various liquefaction conditions. da Silva Lacerda et al. (2015) conducted a kinetic study to determine the optimal conditions for hydroxymethylfurfural/furfural production through microwave-assisted conversion of cellulose and lignocellulosic waste. However, to date, there are few reports on the study of liquefaction kinetics for cellulose extraction from solid residues. To maximize the yield of cellulose isolation from liquefied residues, liquefaction of banana pseudo-stem (BPs) in polyethylene glycol (PEG 400)/glycerol was studied under four temperature levels (130, 150, 160 and 170 °C) in this study. The liquefaction kinetics and thermodynamics were analyzed to identify the factors that affect the course of reaction and cellulose characteristics in the residues. Meanwhile, the liquefied polyols were separated by water and acetone to assess the degradation of BPs components, resulting in an overall insight into the liquefaction behavior of BPs. Based on morphologies, crystallities and thermal properties of the liquefied residues, a mechanism of cellulose extraction from solid liquefied residues was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Banana pseudo-stems (BPs) from Hainan province (South of China) was washed clean, sun dried (moisture content about 8 wt%), milled and sieved to 50 meshes. The resulting BPs powders were dried in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h and then stored in a desiccator until further use. Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and glycerol were used as the liquefaction reagents, and sulfuric acid (98%) was applied as the acid catalyst. The other chemicals in this work were reagent grade and used without further purification."
3,Composition analysis,"2.2 Composition analysis Composition analysis of BPs was conducted based on dry weight. The acid-insoluble lignin content was determined by the ASTM D1106-2001 standard method: Standard Test Method for Acid-Insoluble Lignin in Wood. The determination of toluene-ethanol soluble contents was performed using the ASTM D1105-1996 (2013) standard method: Standard Test Method for Preparation of Extractive-Free Wood. Ash content was measured by applying the ASTM D1102-2007 standard method: Standard Test Method for Ash in Wood. Cellulose content was determined by the nitrate method (Zhang et al., 2012b). Water solubles and pectin content were analyzed according to the National Standards of People’s Republic of China (GB 5889-1986): Method of Quantitative Analysis of Ramie Chemical Components. The content of hemicellulose was calculated by difference."
4,Liquefaction reaction,"2.3 Liquefaction reaction Liquefaction of BPs was performed at four different temperatures (130 °C, 150 °C, 160 °C, and 170 °C). A typical run was carried out as follows: 25 g of PEG400 and glycerol (4:1, w/w), 0.5 g of sulfuric acid (98%) and 5 g of oven-dried BPs powders were charged into a three-necked glass flask and refluxed under continuous mechanical stirring for a certain time at set temperature. After the reaction mixture was quenched and cooled to room temperature, the black precipitate was diluted with 150 mL of ethanol. Next, the mixture was vacuum-filtrated through an 11 μm pore sized filter paper. The solid liquefied residue (LR) retained on the filter paper was thoroughly rinsed with excess ethanol. Liquefied BPs product (LBP) was obtained by removal of ethanol using a rotary evaporator. The solid LR was dried at 105 °C for 24 h in an oven to constant weight and stored in a desiccator. The residue content (φ) of the liquefied BPs was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) ϕ % = m m 0 × 100 % where m is the oven-dried weight of the residue, and m 0 is the weight of the original BPs. Bleaching treatment of LR was performed according to the literature (Meng et al., 2019). Briefly, residual lignin and polycondensate in LR were removed by treating with acidified sodium chlorite solution (6 wt%, pH 3.8–4.5) at 75 °C until the residue became colorless. Then, the residue was vacuum-filtered and rinsed with distilled water followed by freeze drying. The bleaching yield was defined as the mass percentage of BLR to the initial weight of LR."
5,Separation of the liquefied BPs product,"2.4 Separation of the liquefied BPs product The LBP was dissolved with excess distilled water under constant stirring for 3 h followed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore sized hydrophilic membrane. The water-soluble part (H2O-LBP) was obtained after evaporation of water from the filtrate. After thorough rinsing with distilled water and freeze drying, the water-insoluble part (H2O-insol) was thoroughly extracted with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus (about 24 h). The acetone-soluble part (At-LBP) was obtained by removal of acetone at 70 °C with rotary evaporation in vacuo. The acid number and hydroxyl number of At-LBP were measured according to the literature (Zhang et al., 2013). The yields of H2O-LBP and At-LBP were the mass percentages of their respective weights to the original weight of LBP. The yield of acetone-insoluble part (At-insol) was calculated by difference."
6,Kinetic models,"2.5 Kinetic models To better understand the liquefaction behavior of banana pseudo-stems and optimize the cellulose extraction procedure, exploration of reaction mechanism is essential. Biomass solvolysis is usually considered as an irreversible bimolecular reaction (Yan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014): (2) A + B ↔ A B * → Condensed products A and B respective represent the polyhydric alcohol reagents and BPs. The rate constant of reaction can be expressed in the following differential and integration form: (3) d [ B ] d t = - k [ A ] n 1 [ B ] n 2 where, n is the apparent reaction order, k is the apparent reaction rate constant, which is associated with the Arrhenius equation: (4) k = A e x p - E / R T where A is the pre-exponential factor (s−1), E is the activation energy (kJ mol−1). As the solvent is in excess, the concentration of liquefaction solvent is commonly considered as a constant and the reaction rate is only dependent on the LR content (Yan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014). Thus, the kinetic equation can be expressed as follows: (5) - d B d t = k [ B ] n In association with Eq. (1), the logarithmic form of the kinetic equation above is: (6) ln − d ϕ d t = ln k + n ln ϕ The plot of l n ( - d ϕ d t ) against l n ϕ is a straight line. n can be determined from the slope of the plot, and k can be calculated from the intercept. Considering the Eq. (4), the dependence of rate constant on temperature can be defined by the following equation: (7) l n k = l n A - E R T The plot l n k versus the 1 T is a straight line, the slope and intercept of which can be used to determine E and l n A , respectively. A more detailed explanation with regard to the transformation of reactants into liquefied products can be described by the transition-state theory (Acemioğlu and Mehmet, 2002; Yan et al., 2010). In Eq. (2), A B ∗ is the intermediate state which can be determined by the equilibrium constant. Then the activation free-enthalpy ( Δ G ) of the reaction can be estimated by the Eyring equation: (8) k = k B T h ∙ e - Δ G / R T where k B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10−34 J S). Thus, the apparent activation free enthalpy ( Δ G ) can be expressed as: (9) Δ G = R T ( ln k B T h - l n k ) Moreover, the apparent activation enthalpy ( Δ H ) and apparent activation entropy ( Δ S ) can be calculated from Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively: (10) Δ H = E - 2 R T and (11) Δ S = Δ H - Δ G T"
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the samples was conducted on a TENSOR27 spectrometer (Bruker) using the KBr disk technique. Each spectrum was recorded in a range of 500–4000 cm−1 at 4 cm−1 resolution and with 16 scans. Molecular weight analysis of the acetone-soluble fraction was carried out using a Waters 1515 chromatographic apparatus with Styragel HT-2THF and Styragel HT-4THF columns at 45 °C. High-purity tetrahydrofuran (THF) was employed as eluent, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The detection was performed with a 2414 Differential Refractometer (Waters, USA). The average molecular weight of the samples was determined using a calibration curve of monodisperse polystyrene. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of dried samples were captured on a Hitachi S3000N scanning electron micro-scope (10 kV). Before measurements, all samples were coated with platinum using the sputtering technique. Crystallinity of the original BPs and residue samples were analyzed using the Bruker D8 Advance AXS diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation source (30 kV and 20 mA). The diffraction intensities were recorded between 5 and 50° (2θ angle range) with a scan rate of 0.4°/min. The crystallinity index (Cr.I.) was calculated following Eq. (12) (Segal et al., 1959). I 002 is the diffraction intensity from the (002) plane at 2θ = 22.1°, and I am is the intensity of the amorphous part measured at 2θ = 18° (Jasiukaitytė et al., 2009). (12) C r . I . % = I 002 - I a m I 002 × 10 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was conducted using the NETZSCH5 209F3 thermogravimetric analyzer over a temperature range of 40–700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Residue content and compositions,"3.1 Residue content and compositions As presented in Table 1 , raw BPs consist of three main chemical compositions (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin). In addition to percentages of the components, the liquefaction behavior of lignocellulosic biomass is also influenced by various factors including reaction temperature, time, liquefaction solvents and catalysts (Zhou et al., 2016). In light of previous results (Li et al., 2015), the liquor ratio of 5:1 and catalyst loading of 1 mmol g−1 were fixed to facilitate the comparisons. A significant decrease in the residue content was observed during the first 15 min of liquefaction (Fig. 1 ). This rapid decrease was likely attributed to the degradation and hydrolysis reactions of hemicelluloses, lignin, and amorphous zones of cellulose (Soares et al., 2014). After 30 min, the reduction slowed down over time, possibly owing to the depolymerization of crystalline regions of cellulose (D’Souza and Yan, 2013; Jasiukaitytė et al., 2009). As the liquefaction temperature increased from 130 to 170 °C, the residue content at the reaction time of 90 min decreased from 34.95 to 22.93 wt%. This observation was consistent with previous studies of liquefaction of cornstalk and wood (Yan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014). Notably, from 90 to 120 min of reaction, a slightly increase of lignin fraction from 18.94 to 20.03 wt% was observed when liquefaction at 150 °C. This result was probably associated with lignin modified by glycols undergoing condensation reactions to produce condensed residues. Notably, when liquefaction was performed at 150 °C, a slight increase of lignin fraction from 18.94 to 20.03 wt% was observed from 90 to 120 min of the reaction. This result was probably associated with glycol-modified lignins, which underwent condensation reactions to produce condensed residues (D’Souza et al., 2016; Jasiukaitytė et al., 2010)."
10,Kinetic analysis and optimization of the liquefaction conditions,"3.2 Kinetic analysis and optimization of the liquefaction conditions In order to validate the kinetic model that Eq. (6), liquefaction reaction rates versus the experimental residue contents were plotted by differential operated liquefaction curves of BPs and its three main components in Fig. 1. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the good linear fitting indicated that the kinetic model is relatively satisfactory. The rate constants of reaction and apparent reaction orders were determined from the intercepts and slopes of the straight line plots of Eq. (6) at various temperatures and reaction times as presented in Table 2 . As listed in Table 2, the reaction rate constants and apparent reaction orders were determined based on the intercepts and slopes of the straight line plots of Eq. (6) at various temperatures and reaction times. The results demonstrated that the logarithm of reaction rates increased with the increase of reaction temperature for BPs and its components, indicating that increased temperature could expedite the degradation of BPs in polyhydric alcohols. However, excessively elevated temperature may promote re-condensation reaction and lead to an increase in the acid-insoluble lignin (D’Souza and Yan, 2013). Niu et al. (2011) concluded that longer reaction time results in greater content of new residues generated by polycondensation. It is noteworthy that the values of reaction orders for BPs and its three components differ considerably, suggesting that the liquefaction reaction mechanism was fairly complicated. In addition, hemicellulose had the largest liquefaction rate constant, while cellulose had the smallest liquefaction rate constant. It is commonly believed that the susceptibility of hemicellulose to degradation is owing to its amorphous structure (D’Souza et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016b). In contrast, the well-packed and highly crystalline structure of cellulose contributes to its resistance to solvent penetration. The reaction rates of BPs, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin follow the order of hemicellulose > lignin > BPs > cellulose. This order is in accordance with the results reported in the literatures (Shi et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2014). Herein, there is no doubt that the liquefaction process could be controlled by adjusting the liquefaction conditions. For the liquefaction of BPs in polyhydric alcohols, the linear fitting results of l n k and 1/T were shown in Fig. 3 . The values of activation energy, pre-exponential factor and correlation (R2) calculated based on Fig. 3 are presented in Table 3 . The activation energies for the alcoholysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 41.32 kJ mol−1, 18.74 kJ mol−1 and 26.14 kJ mol−1, respectively. In view of the substantially higher activation energy required for cellulose degradation, it may be feasible to selectively achieve liquefaction of hemicellulose and lignin while preserving cellulose at a proper temperature."
11,Qualitative analysis of liquefied products,"3.3 Qualitative analysis of liquefied products Component analysis of the liquefied products was performed in order to comprehensively understand the process variability of liquefaction and further indirectly provide insight into the changes of LR composition. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the raw BPs display typical FTIR spectra of lignocellulosic biomass, exhibiting the characteristic bands of carbohydrate and lignin. Besides, the broad hydroxyl peak at 3400 cm−1 indicates the presence of a large number of hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption peak at 2870 cm−1 is assigned to CH stretching vibrations. In comparison with raw BPs, the characteristic absorption bands of cellulose in LR90 such as the CH2 group absorption bands at 1430 and 1371 cm−1, the CO stretching vibration band at 1110 and 1160 cm−1, as well as the CO bending vibration band at 1062 cm−1 are much stronger, while the absorption peaks of lignin, including benzene ring skeleton vibration bands at 1375, 1514 and 1603 cm−1, the methoxyl CH deformations peak at 1463 cm−1 and the methoxyl groups absorption bands at 1247 cm−1 are weaker. The carboxyl peak at 887 cm−1 indicates the existence of carboxylic acids in the water-soluble fraction. Moreover, the signals of alcohols or ether bond (1105 cm−1) and carbonyl group (1706 cm−1) in the FTIR spectrum of water-soluble fraction were overlapped by the absorption peaks of the PEG/ glycerol solvent. The carboxylic acids may originate from the degradation of hemicellulose and amorphous cellulose (Chen and Long, 2016). Compared with the water-soluble fraction, the FTIR adsorption profiles of the acetone-soluble part exhibited remarkable differences. The aromatic absoption bands at 1514 and 1603 cm−1 become significantly stronger, while the bands of syringyl rings attributed to the lignin fragments appeared at 1254 and 1114 cm−1. The strong carbonyl peak at 1739 cm−1 is characteristic of aldehydes, ketones, esters and carboxylic acids (D’Souza and Yan, 2013), which are produced from decomposition of polysaccharides, especially hemicellulose. The peaks at 1254 and 1114 cm−1 are respectively assigned to the aromatic carbon-oxygen stretching vibration and CH in-plane bending of syringyl lignin. Therefore, the acetone-soluble fraction is mainly composed of aromatic compounds from degradation of lignin (Zhang et al., 2012a; Zou et al., 2009). The effect of liquefaction conditions on product distribution was further investigated. Polyhydric alcohol is a liquefaction solvent that serves an pivotal role in increasing the polarity of the reaction mixtures, and most of the LBP constituents are water soluble (Chen and Long, 2016). As illustrated in Fig. 5 , while the reaction temperature increased from 130 °C to 160 °C, the yield of acetone-soluble part of LBP increased substantially from 9.05 to 28.10 wt%, whereas the water-soluble fraction declined significantly from 87.13 to 59.50 wt%. With further increase of the liquefaction temperature, the acetone-insoluble part increased substantially. Similar trends were observed in term of the influence of reaction time on the product distribution. Specifically, the yield of acetone-insoluble part (At-insol) decreased slightly when the reaction time was 90 min at 170 °C, and then increased to 23.20 wt% when the reaction time was extended to 120 min. This finding could be attributed to the enhancement of condensation reactions. Zhou et al. (2016) and Celikbag et al. (2016) found that temperature was the main factor impacting the dielectric properties of the liquefaction system and subsequently affecting the composition of the reaction mixture. It is likely that condensation and repolymerization reactions consume certain reactive polar substances produced during the early stage of liquefaction. Considering the existence of residual liquefaction solvent in the water-soluble part of LBP (Budija et al., 2009), GPC analysis was performed mainly for the acetone-soluble fraction. As illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table 4 , all samples featured broad distribution of molecular weights below 4500 Da, indicating the generation of phenolic oligomer in the acetone-soluble products. The average molecular weight of the acetone-soluble fraction showed an initial increase and subsequent decline with an inflexion at 90 min. The molecular weight increase of the acetone-soluble fraction is likely attributed to soluble lignin with large size or condensation of phenolics (Chen and Long, 2016; Long et al., 2011). The longer reaction time of 120 min caused the degradation rate of lignin fragmentation to exceed the recondensation rate, thus leading to the slight decline of molecular weights (D’Souza and Yan, 2013; Long et al., 2015). The increased acid values and decreased hydroxyl values were attributed to various reactions including esterification, etherification and condensation that occurred during liquefaction, leading to the consumption of lignin phenolic hydroxyl groups or their conversion into phenolic acids (Amran et al., 2017; D’Souza et al., 2016). Researchers have previously revealed that both the lignin depolymerization and polycondensation are heavily dependent on temperature and reaction time (D’Souza and Yan, 2013; Long et al., 2015). Based on these findings and the results in this study, the most suitable liquefaction condition to avoid polycondensation and maximize cellulose content in the residues involve a liquefaction temperature of 150 °C and a reaction time of 90 min According to the Formula ((9)–(11)), the values of Δ G , Δ H and Δ S of BPs alcoholysis at different reaction temperatures are calculated and listed in Table 2. The values of Δ G for the liquefaction process of BPs and its three compositions increased constantly and slightly with the increase of reaction temperature. As shown in Table 2, the average values of Δ G for BPs, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are 99.92 kJ mol−1, 109.06 kJ mol−1, 99.18 kJ mol−1 and 99.86 kJ mol−1, respectively. The high activation free enthalpy indicated that the activated complex was fairly unstable. Consequently, polycondensation occurred between degraded BPs components, giving rise to condensation products. According to Table 2, the activation enthalpy is influenced minimally by the liquefaction temperatures. A 20 °C increase in reaction temperature resulted in a 0.17 kJ mol−1 decrease in activation enthalpy, indicating that the alcoholysis process of BPs was predominantly endothermic in nature. As shown in Table 2, the Δ S of BPs alcoholysis shows irregular changes in response to variations of reaction temperature, implying that the molecular motion was fairly slow, likely due to the high concentration of reaction mixtures."
12,Morphological observation of liquefaction residues,"3.4 Morphological observation of liquefaction residues SEM images of pristine BPs and residue samples are shown in Fig. 7 . The original BPs with diameter of 83.3 ± 4.4 μm present rough longitudinal surface and relatively intact structures (Fig. 7a). After 30 min of liquefaction, relatively smooth fiber bundles and fracture surface of the liquefied residues are observed (Fig. 7b). The observation was mainly attributed to the outer substances that enwrap the fiber bundles, which consist of wax, pectin and other parenchymas dissolved in the liquefaction solvent. Hemicellulose and lignin are known to surround the micro fibrils (formed by aggregation of cellulose molecules) and act as ""natural binders"" in lignocellulosic biomass (Abdul Khalil et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2015). As liquefaction proceeded for 60 min, the longitudinal slender fibers with diameter of 13.5 ± 11.7 μm are gradually exposed and dispersed (Fig. 7c). It can be inferred that a large amount of lignin and hemicellulose have been liquefied, resulting in the collapse of compact structure and the bareness of single fiber (Xie et al., 2016b). Some flat cell fragments and small spherical granules (3.5–5.3 μm) are found attaching to the fiber surfaces when BPs undergo liquefaction for 90 min (Fig. 7d). The former originates from the decomposition of cell wall, while the later is ascribed to the polycondensate produced among biomass derivatives and liquefaction solvents (D’Souza et al., 2016). As illustrated in Fig. 7e, the fiber bundles are divided into individual micro-sized fibers, which are regularly ordered and well-arranged. The results suggest that the middle lamella mainly composed of lignin and hemicellulose has been almost completely degraded, and the liquefaction of cellulose caused the surface cracking. Some small granules present on the residues were confirmed as recondensed lignin substrates (D’Souza and Yan, 2013; Liu et al., 2013). Owing to the exhaustive removal of lignin, the separation of fasciculus is observed after bleaching treatment (Fig. 7f). Eventually, 5.5–7.2 μm fibers with rough surfaces are isolated. The bleaching yield of BLR120 was calculated as 5.12 wt%."
13,Crystallinity of liquefaction residues,"3.5 Crystallinity of liquefaction residues The content and crystallinity of cellulose represent the rate-determining factors in lignocellulosic liquefaction (Amran et al., 2017). XRD spectra of the raw BPs, liquefied residues and bleached residues are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The diffraction patterns of all samples manifested a typical cellulose I crystalline structure with peaks at 2θ = 22.2° and 16.3°, corresponding to the (002) and (110) plane positions (Gan et al., 2015). Moreover, the XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.3° and 29.6° are assigned to inorganic matters. The crystallinity index of residues was determined using formula (12), and the values are 8.2 (BPs), 42.12 (LR30), 51.84 (LR60), 56.03 (LR90) and 62.7 (BLR90), respectively. The increased crystallinity with longer liquefaction time can be ascribed to the degradation of amorphous hemicellulose and the delignification process, which result in enrichment of cellulose in the residues. It is noteworthy that the higher crystallinity of bleached LR may be attributed to the removal of lignin derivatives (Meng et al., 2019). Besides, dissolved inorganic substances can also facilitate the exposure of crystalline cellulose in the residues. The bleaching yield of BLR90 was 7.59 wt%. The bleached liquefaction residue has been reported to possess application potential for the preparation of cellulose nanofibers (Meng et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2016a)."
14,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.6 Thermogravimetric analysis As the essential difference in chemical composition of biomass may be embodied with thermal stability (Meng et al., 2018), thermogravimetric analyses were performed for raw BPs and residues. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the weight loss processes for all samples can be divided into three main stages. The thermal weight loss below 135 °C is attributed to the volatilization of water or low-molecular-weight compounds. The slight weight loss in the range of 425–700 °C is corresponding to the rupture of soft segment or the carbonization of solid residues (Shi et al., 2016b). As depicted in Fig. 9b, there is a significant difference between the DTG curves (the differential of TG curves) of raw BPs and liquefaction residues. Due to the low degradation temperature of extractives, hemicellulose and lignin, the DTG curve of BPs exhibits a broad shoulder on the left side of the well-defined pyrolysis peak, which is attributed to the decomposition of cellulose (about 306 °C). In the range of 204–425 °C, the weight loss rate of LRs first increased and then decreased with the extension of liquefaction time. The rate decline can be attributed to the formation of lignin derivatives and wrapping of cellulose structures. Notably, the sharpest weight loss peak is found for BLR themolysis at 356 °C, and increased pyrolysis rate can be rationalized based on the relatively high purity of cellulose and high surface area exposed to heat. The lowest residue content of BLR supported the contention that liquefaction combined with bleach treatment removed most of the noncellulosic materials."
15,Extraction mechanism,"3.7 Extraction mechanism In light of the above experimental evidences and calculation of kinetic parameters, a plausible mechanism of cellulose micro-fibril extraction via liquefaction method is proposed (Fig. 10 ). First, waxes, extractives and trace elements were dissolved in the liquefaction solvent at the early stage of reaction. Then, hemicellulose was depolymerized, the chemical bonds between the carbohydrates and lignin were broken, and lignin in the middle lamella was decomposed with ongoing liquefaction, resulting in exposure and dissociation of the intact BPs bundles. The liquefied residues offer improved accessibility and enhanced efficiency for succedent chemical purification. Finally, bleaching treatment was employed to further remove the residual hemicellulose derivatives and lignin produced by polycondensation in the residues. Meanwhile, microfibril bundles were separated into individual fibers, which showed irregular and rough surface morphology."
16,Conclusions,"Cellulose extraction from banana pseudo-stem by liquefaction in polyhydric alcohols was examined in detail with kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. The mechanistic studies indicated that although the liquefaction was complex and multilevel, the order of reaction rate followed the order of hemicellulose > lignin > BPs > cellulose. Cellulose exhibited the highest activation energy among the BPs components, allowing it to be selectively preserved during the liquefaction process. Qualitative analysis of liquefied products by extraction with water and acetone confirmed the coexistence of degradation and recondensation. As a result, the optimum condition for maximizing the cellulose content in the liquefied residues was at 150 °C and with a reaction time of 90 min. The results of morphological characterizations, wet chemistry analyses, thermal analysis and crystallinity calculation demonstrated that almost all the hemicellulose and lignin in BPs could be removed by liquefaction and the subsequent bleaching treatment. The findings in this work provide valuable guidelines for the full utilization of liquefied residues."
