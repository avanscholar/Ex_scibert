0,Introduction,"Recently, the technologies have been explored for bio-oil to produce fuel to alleviate energy crisis and environmental pollution [1]. However, bio-oils are low-quality fuels due to their higher oxygen content that is up to 60% in weight [2]. Other challenges with pyrolysis oils are that they are acidic, have a high water content (25 to 50wt.%), and constitute an emulsion that will phase-separate when being stored and bio-oil derived transportation fuels require expensive upgrading techniques [3]. At present, it is not suitable to utilize bio-oil as the fuel directly. Therefore, some researchers had separated the pyrolysis oil and used the heavy oil at the bottom of the container (with water content (2–5%)) for the boiler fuel or mixed the heavy oil with diesel for the transportation fuel. However, the light liquid at the upper part of the crude bio-oil container can hardly be used. In this paper, we chose the wood vinegar (component of the upper light oil), as the feedstock for producing hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming with Ni/M/γ-Al2O3 as the catalysts. Moreover, due to the complexity of pyrolysis oil composition, many researchers choose model compounds such as acetic acid, ethanol, etc. instead of pyrolysis oil for investigating the characteristics of hydrogen production from pyrolysis oil [4], but the physical and chemical properties of pyrolysis oil are quite different from the model compounds. Therefore, we just use the wood vinegar as the feedstock in the study. Moreover, there are some researchers investigating hydrogen production from aqueous fraction of biomass pyrolysis oil by catalytic steam reforming in fluidized bed and the H2 yield rate researches 0.1056g/g organics, which confirms it is a promising method to produce hydrogen from the pyrolysis oil [5]. Besides, due to the smaller viscosity and the existence of some aromatic compounds, wood vinegar would not tend to be polymerized that results in clogging the feedstock inlet and sticking on the inner surface of the transportation pipeline. In China, the planting area of camellia oleifera is around 3.5×1011 m2 and the annual yield is 5.6milliontons. The shell of camellia oleifera is the by-product of tea oil processing, which could reach the percentage of 50%–60% of the total fresh weight. The yield of wood vinegar (including water) is 30% of the shell dry weight during the pyrolysis process. The resource of the shell of camellia oleifera is rich in China. However, the technology for utilizing the camellia oleifera shell has not been developed yet, and the discarded shell would cause serious pollution to the atmosphere, the water and the ecological environment. It is an urgent task to utilize camellia oleifera shell. Therefore, we chose camellia oleifera shell as the feedstock for pyrolysis. It was investigated that the nickel-based catalysts could help to realize higher hydrogen yield for steam reforming of both the model compounds and the aqueous fraction of pyrolysis oil. For instance, Vagia et al. [6] reported that calcium aluminates supported nickel and noble metal catalysts had played a positive role on steam reforming of pyrolysis oil components to get hydrogen, moreover, Co, Cr, and Fe are usually used in the catalyst as the active materials. Kaddouri et al. demonstrated that oxides of cobalt supported Al2O3 catalyst had a high catalytic activity for ethanol steam reforming [7]. The Co–P–B catalyst also showed higher efficiency for hydrogen production. The enhanced activity can be attributed to: the large active surface area, the amorphous short range structure, and the synergic effects caused by B and P atoms in the catalyst [8]. Bangala et al. [9] indicated that Cr reduced the encapsulation of nickel by inactive carbon filaments, and by the way of forming an alloy with Ni, geometrically rearranged the Ni crystal plane and altered the electronic properties of the Ni atoms. Xu et al. [10] found that Fe/γ-Al2O3 could fully convert biomass pyrolysis volatile into gaseous products, such as H2, CH4, CO, etc. Therefore, in this study, we added the active materials of Co, Cr and Fe to the catalyst Ni/γ-Al2O in order to enhance the activity and reduce the carbon deposit in the research."
1,Experimental,
2,Wood vinegar feedstock,"2.1 Wood vinegar feedstock The pyrolysis oil was produced by pyrolyzing the camellia oleifera shell at the pyrolysis box at 500°C for 3h. Wood vinegar is the light liquid at the upper part of the pyrolysis oil container. It appears as a dark brown liquid with a strong pungent smell. The composition of wood vinegar used in the experiment was detected by GC–MS. And the result is shown in Table 1 . The main component of wood vinegar is acetic acid, which tends to be catalytically cracked into H2. The phenolic compound is the one and only aromatic compound in the wood vinegar. The content of water in the wood vinegar is 84% in weight. The pH value of wood vinegar is 3.5 which could relief the corrosion to the equipment by comparison with the pyrolysis oil (pH=2.8), which was detected in our previous research. And the viscosity(1.08cSt)of wood vinegar was much smaller than the pyrolysis oil (128cSt), which would not clog the inlet."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The Ni/M/γ-Al2O3 (M=Co, Cr, Fe) catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. At first, impregnate the γ-Al2O3 with the aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O and M(NO3)n, and stir for 2h at room temperature, followed by drying at 70°C overnight, then, the material was calcined in air for 3h at 550°C. Except for Cr, the amount of Ni and M loaded on the catalyst was controlled at Ni/M/Al=0.07:0.07:1, while the ratio of Cr to Al is 0.1:1. (It can be calculated according to the equation, for instance: Ni/Al, Ni / Al = ω Ni m Ni NO 3 26 H 2 O ω Al m Al 2 O 3 , ω Ni: the mass fraction of Ni in Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O, mNi(NO3)2 ·6H2O: the mass of Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O, ω Al: the mass fraction of Al in Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O, mAl2O3: the mass of Al2O3.) The γ-Al2O3 carrier was purchased from Xinyu Chemical Packing Co., Ltd, which composition is as follows: SiO2 +Al2O3 ≦5%, Fe2O3 ≦1%, γ-Al2O3 ≧93%, D=3.6–4.7mm. The detailed property of γ-Al2O3 was reported in my previous research [11]."
4,Reaction setup and product analysis,"2.3 Reaction setup and product analysis The catalytic tests were conducted by using the continuous catalytic reforming system. The wood vinegar was transported to the quartz tube reactor by the peristaltic pump. And the flow rate of feedstock was 2.19g/min. The nitrogen flow (50cm3/min) was used as the carrier inert gas during the steam reforming process. The diameter and length of the quartz tube reactor are 3cm and 100cm respectively. And the thickness of the quartz tube is 0.3cm. The catalyst was placed in the catalyst bed supported by insulation spacers in the quartz tube reactor. And the quartz tube reactor was installed in the middle of the pyrolysis furnace. The catalyst bed temperature was monitored by the central thermocouple in the furnace. Before the catalytic tests, all the catalysts were reduced in H2/N2 (10/90vol.%) mixture that was heated to 700°C at the heating rate of 24°C/min and the temperature was held on for 2h. The gas flow rate was measured by a gas flowmeter. The bio-gas derived from wood vinegar catalytic steam reforming was collected in a gas bag. Then, the bio-gas was analyzed by the GC. The residue of wood vinegar after catalytic steam reforming was collected in the liquid bag for being analyzed by GC–MS. The GC analysis with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was performed by Agilent 6820 gas chromatograph (for H2, CO, CH4, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6) with N2 as the carrier gas and HP-PLOT-Q column (30m length, 30°C). The TCD temperature was 250°C. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Phillips XL30 Environmental) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the catalysts and the carbon deposit on the used catalysts. The condition of GC–MS: 19091IV-136INNOWAX capillary column was chosen. The initial temperature was set at 45°C and held for 10min and the temperature was increased to 120°C at the heating rate of 10°C/min. Finally, increase the temperature to 250°C at the heating rate of 5°C/min. The temperature at the entrance was 250°C and the ratio of diversion was 10:1 under the nitrogen flow rate of 1cm3/min. The condition of MS: EI was chosen as the ion source. The energy of the electron was 70EV and the spread of scanning was 35–395amu. At a heating rate of 10°C/min and a dry air flow rate of 3cm3/min, the thermogravimetric analysis (TG) on the spent catalyst was carried out on a STA 449 C Jupiter simultaneous TG-DSC analyzer produced in NETZSCH Co., Ltd of German. An Al2O3 crucible was used to contain about 0.7mg of sample for the thermogravimetric analysis. (1) The concentration of gas is calculated according to the equation: S gas = V gas / V H 2 + V CO + V CH 4 + V CO 2 + V C 2 H 4 + V C 2 H 6 × 100 % . For instance: SH2 =VH2 /(VH2 +VCO +VCH4 +VCO2 +VC2H4 +VC2H6 )×100%. (2) Gas yield = S gas ∗ V ∗ M 2.19 ∗ 22.4 ∗ 10 3 mg / g sample V : gas flow rate L / min M : molar mass of gas g / mol . The flow rate of the feedstock is 2.19g/min and the molar volume of gas under standard condition is 22.4l/mol. (3) The mass loss(%)=(M a −M b )∗100%/M c . M a : the residual mass of the sample at 156°C. M b : the residual mass of the sample after being calcined at 800°C. M c : the mass of the sample."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The experiments of wood vinegar non-catalytic steam reforming,"3.1 The experiments of wood vinegar non-catalytic steam reforming Initially, the reactor was filled with 50g of silica sands for non-catalytic tests. The flow rate of feedstock was 2.19g/min. As soon as the desired reaction temperature was reached, the wood vinegar was introduced into the reactor and the experiment began with nitrogen as the carrier inert gas at a flow rate of 50cm3/min. As shown in Table 2 , due to the reaction, the wood vinegar was converted into CO, H2, CO2, H2O, CH4 and hydrocarbons [12], the main gaseous products from wood vinegar steam reforming that were H2, CO, CH4 and CO2⋅C2H4 and C2H6 were also detected, while the light hydrocarbons presented in significantly smaller quantities. The concentration of H2 was increased sharply with the increasing of the reaction temperature. On the contrary, the concentrations of CO and C2H4 were decreased obviously from 26.76% to 8.45% and from 5.76% to 2.22%, respectively. It was attributed to the CO steam reforming (the WGS reaction) and C2H4 pyrolysis that produced H2 at high temperature [13]. And the concentration of CO2 and CH4 was almost kept individually at the same levels. Depending on the high temperature, it was also obvious that the gas flow rate of gaseous products soared from 77.59ml/min to 771.41ml/min, which caused the increase of the yields of all gases. Especially, the yield of H2 could be increased from 0.62mg/g sample to 13.28mg/g sample. It was possible that more heat energy introduced favored the further reforming of the organic matters in wood vinegar. After the test, there was also the carbon formation on wall of the quartz tube reactor during reaction, which may be from the polymerization of the organic matters in wood vinegar."
7,Catalytic reforming of wood vinegar with Ni-based catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic reforming of wood vinegar with Ni-based catalysts 3.2.1 The effects of different catalysts on the yield and the composition of the producer gas For all tests, the reactor temperature was kept constant at 600°C. The flow rate of the feedstock was 2.19g/min and the weight of catalyst was 50g with the nitrogen flow at the flow rate of 50cm3/min as the carrier inert gas during the steam reforming processing. The yield rate of the H2 (in Table 3 ) was increased from 3.43mg/g sample of the non-catalytic test to 7.10mg/g sample of the catalytic test when using the γ-Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial non-modified catalyst of γ-Al2O3 still showed a lower gas yield rate. In order to further improve the H2 yield rate, some active components had to be chosen to modify the catalyst of γ-Al2O3. The investigations of many researchers have shown that the metal of Ni is suitable for pyrolysis oil steam reforming to produce H2 due to its lower cost and the leaching of active components [14]. In this study, when Ni was chosen as promoter, the yield rate of H2 from the test was more than twice as likely as that from the test only with γ-Al2O3 as the catalyst. However, in the process of catalytic steam reforming, it is easy to form carbon deposit on the catalyst surface, especially for Ni-based catalyst [15]. Moreover, we had investigated the effects of Ni contents on the H2 selectivity in our previous work, and the rates of Ni/Al in the study are 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1 and 0.13 respectively. The results showed the H2 yield rate was increased when the rate of Ni/Al rose from 0.02 to 0.07. However, the H2 yield rate was almost kept the same when the rate of Ni/Al was increased from 0.07 to 0.1and and to 0.13. Therefore, in this study, the rate of Ni/Al of 0.07 was chosen for the catalyst, and the transition metals of Co, Cr and Fe were added to enhance the H2 selectivity and to inhibit the formation of carbon deposit. Except Co, the use of Cr and Fe resulted in the increase in the gas flow rate and the yield of gas together with a simultaneous increase in the H2 concentration. The best result was obtained for Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 with the H2 yield rate of 22.03mg/g samples and the H2 concentration of 64.33%, followed by Ni/Cr/γ-Al2O3 with the H2 yield rate of 18.54mg/g samples. Abelló et al. [16] illustrated that the iron played a crucial role in boosting the catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity of nickel-based catalysts by the enhancement in dispersion of nickel and the alleviation in carbon deposition. In the study, when added Cr in the catalyst Ni/γ-Al2O3, the gas flow rate was increased from 636.04ml/min to 821.65ml/min. Although the concentration of H2 was decreased from 58.95% to 55.36%, the yield rate of H2 was increased by 3.25mg/g sample. It was possible that active chromium species in Cr-catalysts were beneficial to the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon as well as gas reformation [17]. Moreover, Fernandes et al. [18] established that chromium oxide formed on the catalyst surface was beneficial to the dispersion of Co–B particles, which resulted in high catalyst active surface area and improved the catalytic activity. And the promoting Cr could decrease the activation energy for hydrogen production in Co–Cr–B catalyst. The principle of how Cr improves the activity of Ni/γ-Al2O3 would be investigated in next step of research. With the addition of Co, the gas yield as well as the gas flow rate was decreased, the later was from 636.04 to 459.65ml/min. For one thing, it was possible that the amount of Co was too much to cover the Ni active sites that speeded up the decrease of catalytic activity. For another thing, the metal Co, which is usually used for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, restricted the cracking of wood vinegar and gas reformation [19]. Moreover, the activity of Fe/Cr/γ-Al2O3 was also tested to investigate whether Fe and Cr are more favorable for the selectivity on H2 during the catalytic steam reforming of the wood vinegar. The result showed that H2 yield rate was much lower than those from the tests with any other Ni-based catalysts except the Ni/Co/γ-Al2O3. 3.2.2 The effects of different catalysts on the concentration of gas Experimental results for all catalysts in the wood vinegar catalytic reforming process of 1h duration were shown in Fig. 1 . Except the Fe/Cr/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, other catalysts showed an initial activity loss in the first period and then their activity were nearly kept constant in the following time. They were characterized by the concentration of H2 that led a dropping trend in the first period. The Ni/Cr/γ-Al2O3 and the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed similar behaviors to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It was possible that the Ni played a dominant role in the activities of the three catalysts during the reaction. Besides, the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 had been observed to have a noticeable upward tendency when the concentrations of H2 was decreased, which could be an indicative symbol of the decline of the methanation dry reforming: CH4 +CO2 =2H2 +2CO, as well as the steam reforming: CH4 +2H2O→CO2 +4H2. The differences among the three catalysts lied in the behavior changes of CO. It was noticeable that with the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of CO was decreased sharply after 35min of testing; in contrast, it was increased with the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/Cr/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. For one thing, it may be due to the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR): CO+H2O→CO2 +H2. For another thing, the CnHmO would produce gas during the catalytic reforming process. And the different active metals had various roles on the selectivity of gas. For example, the lattice oxygen in metal oxides can be utilized to reform hydrocarbons according to the reaction: (2n+m) FexOy +CnH2m →(2n+m)FexOy−1 +nCO2 +mH2O [20]. Inaba et al. investigated that Cr catalysts favored to the dehydrogenation and isomerization of butane [21]. When added Co to the catalyst Ni, the concentrations of H2 and CH4 showed a noticeable decline, while the concentrations of CO were decreased slightly. In contrast, the concentrations of CO2 and C2H4 went up. Presumably, Co was beneficial to gas synthesis but unfavorable for organic matter cracking and gas reformation. Although the selectivity on H2 was poor, the concentration of gas was almost kept constant during the whole process when used the Cr/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It was possible that Cr was a good structural stabilizer and a promoter for the Fe-based catalyst [22]."
8,The composition of wood vinegar after catalytic steam reforming,"3.3 The composition of wood vinegar after catalytic steam reforming Table 4 illustrates the composition of wood vinegar after catalytic steam reforming analyzed by GC–MS. The content of organics was decreased from 16% to 8% and to 6% with Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The result showed that the quantity and relative content of organics in wood vinegar had a significantly change for both Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalytic steam reforming. Especially, with Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the quantity of acids was decreased from 3 kinds to 2 kinds. Simultaneously, the content of acids decreased from 7.071% to 4.762%. It may be due to that the acids took the following reactions in the catalytic steam reforming process: Thermal decomposition: CH3COOH→2CO+2H2; CH3COOH→CH4 +CO2; CH3COOH→C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, coke; Steam reforming: CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +4H2; Acetic acid ketonization: CH3COOH→(CH3)2CO+H2O+CO2. Furthermore, the quantity of phenols was markedly decreased from 6 kinds to 2 kinds. And the content of phenols fell from 4.031% to 1.858%. However, the content of phenol was increased from 0.998 to 1.718. It was possible that the phenolic compounds in the crude wood vinegar took the demethylation or demethoxyation reactions and produced the phenol. For instance, 2-methylphenol and 2-methoxyphenol took the following reactions: Besides, the alcohols and aldehydes could hardly be detected after the catalytic steam reforming. The alcohols and aldehydes could easily be cracked by catalytic cracking or catalytic reforming and produced CHX and H2 according to the following pathways. Compared with the Ni/γ-Al2O3, the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was more effective for acids, ketones and cyclopentene catalytic steam reforming. However, it inhibited the phenols catalytic steam reforming."
9,Characteristics of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst,"3.4 Characteristics of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst Fig. 2 showed the XRD spectra of the fresh and spent catalysts. The diffraction peaks of the fresh and the spent Ni/γ-Al2O catalyst and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by XRD analyzing were quite different. In all samples, the special peaks of γ-Al2O3 were observed. The peak of NiO was surveyed in the catalyst and it was not reduced. For the spent Ni/γ-Al2O catalyst, the diffraction peaks represented the reduced Ni crystals were very obvious. The diffraction peaks corresponding to NiO were absent for the spent catalysts. It was possible that the NiOs of all phases were reduced into metallic Ni during the reduction. But some researchers also reported that the metal particles of small sizes or of high dispersion still cannot be detected by XRD pattern. During the catalytic reaction, the Ni which was the main active material in the reduced Ni/γ-Al2O catalyst was still kept in the state of metallic Ni. Based on the discovery, most of the nickels in our samples were in the form of NiO in the fresh catalyst. On the contrary, Huang et al. [23] observed most of the nickels in their samples were in the form of NiAl2O4 by performing the TPR test, even though the methods for preparing their catalysts were similar to ours. But a low interaction with the support led to high crystallite growth [24] and thus to the formation of carbon filaments with a large diameter. NiO and Fe2O3 as the only detectable phases by XRD had been reported for the fresh Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. However, there was no series of peaks assignable to FeNi3. After the reaction, the main Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst of crystalline phase was converted into the Fe and the Ni that were the main active material in the reduced Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst without other by products, e.g., NiFe2O4. And some research confirmed that the FeNi amorphous alloy structure was beneficial for the activity and selectivity due to the stronger synergistic effect between active sites [25]. In the next step of research, we will modify the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 from the preparation method and modify the rate of Ni, Fe and Al in order to gain more effective catalysts. Fig. 3 showed the coke deposit on the surface of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after wood vinegar catalytic reforming experiments. Carbon whiskers or filaments were not observed in these SEM images. It is found that the surface of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is quite different from the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the solid morphology. For Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst sample, the surface is inhomogeneous in porosity, the particles are big and the heap of particles is very compact. Moreover, there are some clusters on the surface. In contrast, the surface of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst becomes homogenous in porosity, the particles present a variety in size, and the heap of particles becomes very loose with no porosity. Above the results, the morphology of coke deposits on the surface of Ni takes a great change with the addition of Fe, although its anti-sintering effect is not so effective. The FT-IR spectra of the carbon deposit on the surface of the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were shown in Fig. 4 . The peaks stood for different chemical group on the FT-IR were almost the same, except for the peaks at 2853cm−1, 816cm−1 that were absent on the FT-IR spectra of the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Szabo et al. investigated that the peak at 3400cm−1 can be caused by the vibrating of the adsorbed water molecules and OH groups. The peak at 1600cm−1 can be attributed to the bending mode of H2O [26–28]. The peaks at 2924cm−1 and 2853cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of asymmetric (νasCH2) and symmetric (νsCH2), respectively. And the peaks at 2962cm−1 and 2872cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations of the asymmetric (νasCH3) and symmetric (νsCH3) [29]. The band in 1100cm−1 may be attributed to the stretching vibration of CN or the bending of CO bond [30]. The moving vibration of CH2 groups and the aromatics may arouse the infrared band among 800–500cm−1 [29]. It also can be deduced that some organic macromolecule substances which exist the structure such as loop, substituted phenyl group, branched chain and so on were included in the coke deposited. Fig. 5 showed the thermogravimetric analysis through the dry air for the spent catalysts. The total mass losses of γ-Al2O3, Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 significantly dropped from 5.53% to 3.03% and then to 2.66%. Bayrakta et al. reported that there were four peaks which were assigned to different types of coke on the spent catalyst surface by TPO. The first three peaks were corresponding to hydrocarbons desorbing from the coke, coke produced by contaminant-metal reactions and conversion coke produced by acid-catalyzed reactions, respectively. A graphite-like coke that was related to both feedstock properties and catalyst activity produced the last peak [31]. It was similar for the rates of mass losses for different mass loss peaks (in Table 5 ) with corresponding amount of lost masses in the area. Although the total mass loss of carbon deposit was decreased by 2.5%, the temperature for the maximum mass loss peak was increased from 497.4 to 606°C (Table 5) when Ni was added to the γ-Al2O3 catalyst. But it was decreased from 606 to 458°C (Table 5) when Fe was added to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. All the peaks were shifted to lower temperatures with the increasing of Fe in the catalysts. The coke species differed in their reactions to oxygen according to their aromatic, polymeric, or graphitic natures and their distances from the active metal [32]. This could be attributed to the catalytic effect of iron and nickel on the coke-oxidation reaction. And some researchers found the carbon deposit did not mean the loss of activity. However, the metal loss during the regeneration by calcinations at high temperature was the main reason of catalyst deactivation [33]. All the peaks of the carbon deposit were shifted to lower temperature, which would decrease the temperature of regeneration and improve the activity of regeneration. Fig. 5 showed the mass of Ni/γ-Al2O3 sample was almost kept the same after 600°C as well as for Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 sample after 680°C, which illustrated that the carbon deposit was nearly removed away. We had testified that the yield rate of H2 was decreased by 10.2% and 6.8% (not show in the paper) with Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 600°C and Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 680°C, respectively."
10,Conclusions,"(1) Wood vinegar was the lighter liquid in the upper part of the crude bio-oil container. It was chosen to produce H2 rich producer gas (including CO, CH4, C2H4, etc.) by catalytic reforming at lower temperature. (2) The experiments of wood vinegar catalytic reforming showed that except Co, Fe and Cr could effectively enhance the H2 selectivity of Ni-based catalyst due to the enhancement in dispersion of nickel and the alleviation in carbon deposition. The best result was obtained for Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with the H2 yield rate of 22.03mg/g sample and the H2 concentration of 64.33%, followed by the Ni/Cr/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with the H2 yield rate of 18.54mg/g sample. (3) After catalytic steam reforming, the content of compounds was decreased from 16% to 6% in the wood vinegar. Especially, the content of acetic acid was decreased from 5.599% to 1.859% by steam reforming to produce gas. Due to the demethylation and the demethoxyation of the phenolic compounds, the content of the phenol was increased from 0.998% to 1.904%. (4) The result of characteristic analysis of catalyst showed that the active centers of the Ni/Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were metal Ni and Fe during the wood vinegar catalytic reforming process. When adding Fe into the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the amount of carbon deposit was slightly decreased. But the species and the dispersion of carbon were significantly shifted to the low temperature area."
