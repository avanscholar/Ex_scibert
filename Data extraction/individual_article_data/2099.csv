0,Introduction,"Due to the potential depletion of petroleum and environmental concerns about air pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuel, the search for alternative fuel has gained much attention [1]. Waste cooking oil can be another cheap feedstock for biodiesel production. In most cases, waste oil is being used at restaurants for cooking and process of food. The number of times of re-use cooking oil could have significant impact on human health. Therefore, biodiesel production from the waste cooking oil could be suitable alternative to avoid their adverse effect on human health and environment. Homogeneous catalysts, although effective, lead to serious environmental and corrosion related problems make their use non-practical for biodiesel production [2]. The use of heterogeneous catalysts to replace homogenous ones can be expected to overcome the problem associated with homogenous catalysts. The solid base catalyst are easily regenerated and have a less corrosive nature, leading to safer, cheaper and more environment friendly operations. However, they can only be directly used as catalysts to prepare biodiesel when the FFA contents in the range of (0.5–1.0% feedstocks). Hence, the catalyst is not suitable for the waste cooking oils. Heterogeneous acid catalysts can simultaneously catalyze the transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of FFA. So, the use of heterogeneous acid catalysts to produce methyl ester is becoming more popular. It will also be reduced the environmental contamination, awful impact on human health and further reduced the biodiesel production costs. There are several reports about the use of heterogeneous acid catalysts to produce biodiesel, including zeolites [3] La/zeolite beta [4], Amberlyst-15 [5], Nafion [6], sulphonated solids [7], sulphated metal oxides [8] and supported heteropolyacids [9]. A survey of literature showed that no work has been done so far on the production of biodiesel using Fe(HSO4)3 acid catalyst. The main purpose of this study was to produce ferric hydrogen sulphate acid catalyst for the production of biodiesel over esterification and transesterification of mixed waste cooking oil (MWCO). The catalyst was prepared by displacement method and characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), Brunner-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement (BET), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (TPD - NH3). Moreover, the dependence of the conversion of waste oil on the reactions variables such as the molar ratio of methanol/oil, the amount of catalysts used, reaction temperatures, reusability were also appraised."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Different waste vegetable oil samples were obtained from various local markets. Waste palm oil sample was collected from restaurants inside University Putra Malaysia, Serdang Malaysia. Waste corn oil and sunflower oil samples were obtained from Arabian restaurants – south city area in Malaysia. The collected waste vegetable oils were mixed equally (by weight) to prepare mixed waste vegetable oils. A total of 3.0kg of oil was used for the optimization of biodiesel production process. Anhydrous ferric chloride, concentrated sulfuric acid of (98%) and methanol of (99.5%) purity were obtained from (Sigma–Aldrich, Malaysia)."
3,Pretreatment of mixed waste cooking oil,"2.2 Pretreatment of mixed waste cooking oil For a successful simultaneous reaction and high yield of FAME, the oil must be free of water and other impurities. Initially, the received mixed waste cooking oil was heated at 105°C to remove water by evaporation and food debris through filtration. Its free fatty acid (FFA) content was determined by a standard titration method [10]."
4,Characterization of mixed waste cooking oil,2.3 Characterization of mixed waste cooking oil Determinations of saponifcation value and acid value of the mixed waste oil were carried out according to the standard AOCS methods [11].
5,Catalyst Preparation,"2.4 Catalyst Preparation The replacement reaction (sulphation) was performed as follows. A 250ml suction flask was equipped with a dropping funnel. A gas outlet was connected to a vacuum system through an alkaline solution trap. Anhydrous FeCl3 (10mmol) was charged into the flask and concentrated sulfuric acid (30mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 30min at room temperature through dropping funnel. HCl gas evolved immediately (white fumes with ammonium hydroxide in glass rode). After completion of the addition, the mixture was shaken for 30minutes at 100°C, while the residual HCl gas was eliminated by suction. Finally, a pale-brown to yellowish solid Fe(HSO4)3 was obtained [12]."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu diffractometer model XRD 6000. The diffractometer employing Cu-Kα radiation to generate diffraction patterns from powder crystalline samples at ambient temperature. The Cu- Kα radiation was generated by Philips glass diffraction X-ray tube broad focus 2.7kW type. The acidity of the catalyst was studied by temperature programmed desorption using NH3 as probe molecule. TPD–NH3 experiment was performed using a Thermo Finnigan TPDRO 1100 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Catalyst approx 0.1g of catalyst was placed in the reactor, treated under 150°C for 15min in N2 (20mlmin−1). 10% NH3 in helium gas was ramped at 1°Cmin−1 for 60min. the purging with N2 was done at room temperature for 45min to remove NH3 in the gas phase. The analysis of NH3 desorption was then carried out between 50°C and 900°C under helium flow (15°Cmin−1, 20mLmin−1) and detected by thermal conductivity detector. The TGA analysis was carried out on a Mettler Toledo TG-SDTA apparatus (Pt crucibles, Pt/Pt–Rh thermocouple) with the purge gas (nitrogen) flow rate of 30mlmin−1 and the heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 from 25 to 1000°C. The Fourier transform Infrared analysis was carried out with PerkinElmer spectrometer model 100 series (sample preparation UATR). The quantitative chemical composition of the prepared ferric hydrogen sulphate acid catalyst was characterized using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental chemical analysis. Fe(HSO4)3 was characterized by the determination of its H+ content using titration method [13]. The total surface area of the catalysts was obtained using Brunauer–Emmer–Teller (BET) method with nitrogen adsorption at −196°C. Analysis was conducted using a Thermo Fisher Scientific S.p.A (model: SURFER ANALYZER) nitrogen adsorption-desorption analyzer."
7,Esterification and transesterification process,"2.6 Esterification and transesterification process The simultaneous esterification and transesterification of mixed waste vegetable oils containing 14.7wt. % free fatty acids was carried out using prepared ferric hydrogen sulphate acid catalyst in BERGHOF high pressure laboratory reactor. A certain amount of catalyst, methanol and oil were added to the reactor. The reaction was started by stirring at 350rpm and heated to specified temperature and time. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and separated by centrifuge (Kubota 4200) at rpm 350 for 20min. Finally, the product was analyzed by gas chromatography using PerkinElmer with FID detector, equipped with BP-21 capillary column. Dichloromethane was used as an internal standard. The gas chromatogram of the biodiesel product was shown in Fig. 1 and the FAME's composition in Table 1 . Yield of FAME's can be calculated as follow [14]: yield ( % ) = total weight of methyl esters total weight of oil in the sample × 100"
8,Catalyst reusability and leaching tests,"2.7 Catalyst reusability and leaching tests The catalyst separated from the reaction mixture through filtration was initially washed with hexane to remove non-polar compounds such as methyl esters on the surface. Further, the catalyst was washed with methanol to remove polar compounds such as glycerol and finally dried at 110°C overnight. The leaching of the catalyst into the reaction mixture was investigated by Leco CHSN- 932 elemental analyzer, BaCl2–KOH titration and, AAS analysis."
9,Fuel properties,"2.8 Fuel properties The fuel properties of the MWCOME were assessed subsequent ASTM methods: cloud point (ASTM D2500), pour point (ASTM D97), kinematic viscosity (ASTM D445), flash point (ASTM D93) and density (ASTM D5002). Triplicate determinations were performed for every experiment and the data are presented as mean±standard deviation."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterization of mixed waste oil,"3.1 Characterization of mixed waste oil The saponification value and acid value of mixed waste cooking oil were found to be 230mg KOH/g and 29.5mg KOH/g respectively, corresponding to a free fatty acid (FFA) level of 14.7%."
12,Characterization of the catalyst,"3.2 Characterization of the catalyst The synthesized catalyst samples a (before) and b (after) calcinations at 400°C were characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. 2a, there are very small peaks at 2θ of 15.1°, 17.7°, 21.8°, 24.7°, 25.06°, 27.9°, 29.9°, 31.4°, 34.8°, 49.5°, 50.9°, 59.3° (JSPDS file No: 00-016-0939 - Fe(HSO4)3). These peaks seem to be poorly crystallized and amorphous in structure. However, the strong and sharp characteristic diffraction peaks with 2θ at 15.1°, 17.7°, 21.8°, 23.8°, 24.7°, 25.06o, 26.7° 27.9°, 29.9°, 31.4°, 34.8°, 49.5°, 50.9° and 59.3° (JSPDS file No: 00-025-0421- Fe(HSO4)3) appeared in Fig. 2b showing a strong crystalline structure. As shown in the Fig. 2b, the crystalline phase for the catalyst after calcination was orthorhombic. An attempt has been by Konya [15] to correlate the catalytic activity of Mo3VOx catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and concluded that the catalyst with orthorhombic phase is the most active for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The NH3-TPD profile showed that Fe (HSO4)3 catalyst had four desorption peaks. Two peaks from 300 to 475°C and the other two from 550 to 750°C that were assigned to two types of acid site Fig. 3 . These temperature peaks corresponded to medium and strong acid sites, respectively with an acid site density of about 10.5mmol/g. The weak acidity is primarily related to interactions among ammonia molecules in the pores, whereas the strong acidity is primarily related to interactions between the NH3 molecules and the pore walls of the Fe(HSO4)3 catalyst. The ferric chloride exhibited a loose irregular network structure. The pores became larger when the FeCl3 was treated with concentrated H2SO4. The larger amounts of pores and larger pore size would increase the accessibility of sulfuric acid into the iron powder bulk, which would give a higher density of acid sites. The Fe(HSO4)3 would be expected to have a higher activity for the production of biodiesel from waste oil with a high content of FFA because it has more acid sites and stronger acidity [16]. The TGA analysis for the prepared catalyst was illustrated in Fig. 4 . The weight losses found from TGA measurements agree fairly well with those expected for the decomposition of Fe(HSO4)3, to different oxides of iron and sulphate. The thermo gravimetric curve of catalyst showed two-stage of weight loss the first one is due to water elimination of hydrated water (100–200°C) and The second major weight loss around (650–700°C) can be attributed to the decomposition of sulphate ion [17]. From the FT-IR result Fig. 5 . of the Fe(HSO4)3 solid acid catalyst, the peak at 1050cm−1 is typical of the S–O mode of vibration of a chelating bidentate sulphate ion co-ordinate to iron cation [18]. The vibration band around 1374cm−1 arises from the highly covalent character of the S=O [19], where as the bands around 1657cm−1 and 3115cm−1 corresponds to the bending and stretching modes of the –OH of S–OH groups. EDS spectrometer is used to analyze the percentage of elements present in the sample [20,21]. The quantitative percentage of Fe(HSO4)3 elements were found to be: oxygen (O)–82.42%, iron (Fe) – 4.72% and sulphur (S) – 11.91%. EDS analysis cannot detect percentage of hydrogen in a sample because hydrogen element does not emit X-rays. The alternative method was used for the determination of H + content of the catalyst by titrating with NaOH. The obtained value of H+ content was 0.98%. The average pore size of uncalcined catalyst was 5.6nm and the B.E.T surface area was 4.6m2 g−1. However, there was no significant change in surface area (4.9m2 g−1) of the calcined catalyst, but the pore size increased considerably to 34.4nm after calcination. Jacobson et al. [22] reported that, the pore structure was a primary requirement for an ideal solid catalyst for biodiesel production since a typical triglyceride molecule has a pore diameter of approximately 58Å (5.8nm). Therefore, the uncalcined catalyst diameter of 5.6nm would minimize diffusion of reactant molecules into the catalyst. Consequently, the activity of catalyst would be decreased. However, the higher pore diameter obtained from calcined catalyst may allow diffusing the fatty acid molecule into the interior of the catalyst easily and became in contact with more acid active sites as the catalyst had better catalytic activity."
13,Optimization of reaction parameters,"3.3 Optimization of reaction parameters 3.3.1 Effect of reaction temperature Reaction temperature can affect the reaction rate and was found to considerably influence the yield of biodiesel [23]. Thus, the experiments using the Fe(HSO4)3 acid catalyst were conducted at 145, 165, 185, and 205°C. Fig. 6 shows that ester yield increases with the increase in the reaction temperature. Both FFA and triglyceride initially require the activation of their respective carboxylic/carbonyl functions to start the reaction. In order to favour the methanol nucleophilic attack on fatty acids, a comparatively high reaction temperature is needed to activate this carbonyl group [16]. Similar result was obtained by Canakci and Gerpen [24]. According to their findings, reaction temperature dominates the rate of reaction, and the conversion increases with an increasing reaction temperature. The catalyst shows activity in catalyzing the transesterification reaction when the reaction temperature higher than 145°C. At high temperature above 250°C and long reaction time the triglyceride is decomposed [25]. Hence, the optimum reaction temperature was fixed at 205°C for further studies. 3.3.2 Effect of catalyst loading The amount of catalyst also affected the rate of the reaction. The higher catalyst loading is required to increase the availability of active sites [26]. The Fe(HSO4)3 acid catalyst was used to study the effect of catalyst loading (0.5 to 1.5% w/w) with reaction temperature of 205°C and molar ratio of methanol to mixed oil as 15:1 for a period of 4h as shown in Fig. 7 . The yield of methyl ester increased markedly from 84.2 to 94.5%. However, when the catalyst concentration was further increased to 1.5wt.% the reaction rate and methyl ester yield just slightly increased. The optimum catalyst concentration was chosen to be 1wt.% for further studies. 3.3.3 Effect of the molar ratio of methanol and mixed oil Since the transesterification and esterification are reversible reactions, the excess amount of methanol needs to force the reaction towards the formation of methyl esters [26]. Previous studies reveal that in order to shift the equilibrium towards forward direction, use of higher molar ratios of oil to alcohol such as 1:15, 1:40, and even 1:275 can enhance the rate of conversion catalyzed by heterogeneous catalyst [27–29]. In Fig. 8 , it has been observed that the yield of the process increased with increase in methanol to oil molar ratio up to 15:1 with further increase in molar ratio, the change in the yield was insignificant the excess methanol used in the reaction can be collected and reused. 3.3.4 Effects of stirring speed on biodiesel production The effect of stirring on solid acid catalyzed transesterification reaction was carried out at 205°C using 1wt% Fe(HSO4)3 acid catalyst and 1:15mol of oil to methanol ratio. When heterogeneous catalyst is used at high temperature of 205°C for transesterification the mixed waste vegetable oil reaction mixture shows three phases. The existence of three phases will reduce the reaction rate due to the strong mass transfer limitations [30]. The result was observed, at lower stirring speed of 150rpm, reaction proceeded slowly during the beginning of the reaction which produced low yield of methyl ester. The amount of the FAME yield was found to increase with increase in stirring speed, higher agitation promotes the homogenization of the reactants and thus leads to higher yields [31]. The maximum yield was obtained as 94.5% at above 300rpm then increased and at the end reached constant as equilibrium had approached. This clearly indicates that mass transfer limitations play major role during heterogeneous catalyzed reaction at high temperature. In order to overcome this problem, the reaction was carried out at higher stirring speed of 350rpm. 3.3.5 Catalyst stability and reusability A series of 240min simultaneous transesterification and esterification cycles were carried out to evaluate the activity of Fe(HSO4)3 acid catalyst. The catalyst recycling is an important step as it minimizes the cost of the process. In order to test the reusability, the Fe(HSO4)3 catalyst was recycled and used for five times. The reusability studies were carried out at reaction temperature of 205°C, stirring speed of 350rpm, 1:15 molar ratio of oil to alcohol, and 1% w/w catalyst loading. The results showed that the catalyst was reused five times and the yield of biodiesel decreased from 94.5% to 91.2%, a slight drop in the activity was detected after five recycles indicating the efficiency of the catalyst. Also, negligible leaching or dissolution of iron and sulphur into the biodiesel was detected by CHSN elemental analysis, BaCl2–KOH titration and, AAS analysis."
14,Fuel properties of mixed waste cooking oil methyl ester (MWCOME),"3.4 Fuel properties of mixed waste cooking oil methyl ester (MWCOME) Some of important fuel properties of MWCOME were measured, as depicted in Table 2 , according to biodiesel ASTM [32] and EN [33] standard methods, such as density, kinematic viscosity (40°C), flash point, pour point (CP) and pour point (PP). In comparison to POME [34], the major oilseed plant grown in Malaysia, and especially Diesel fuel, MWCOME showed increased kinematic viscosity (40°C, Table 2); however, MWCOME is still within prescribed ASTM D 6751 (1.9–6.0 mm2/s) and EN 14214 (3.5–5.0mm2/s) kinematic viscosity specifications. Both MWCOME and POME displayed flash point greater than Diesel fuel, as expected. In contrast, both MWCOME and POME [34] exhibited increased CP and PP in comparison to Diesel fuel, with MWCOME performing marginally better than POME [34]. Whereas, the density of MWCOME (0.867kg/L) was also well within the norms of ASTM (0.82–0.9kg/L) and European (0.86–0.9kg/L) standards."
15,Conclusions,"The catalytic activity of the solid acid Fe(HSO4)3 catalyst was evaluated for the production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil with high FFAs. The FAME yield reached 94.5% at the reaction time of 4h, catalyst of 1%, molar ratio of methanol to TG of 15:1, and reaction temperature of 205°C. The acid value of 14.7mg KOH/g before reaction reduced to 0.820mg KOH/g after reaction indicating the catalyst is highly effective for simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction. In addition, the recovery and reutilization of the Fe(HSO4)3 in consecutive catalytic processes suggested that the catalyst can be reused many times with slight loss of activity under the optimized condition. In conclusion, the application of Fe(HSO4)3 can potentially promote a reduction of the costs related to biodiesel production."
