0,Introduction,"The most recent European Union legislation requires that advanced biofuels must achieve greater than 70% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings as compared to the fossil fuel comparator (gCO2/MJ basis) [1]. Gaseous fuels (in the form of hydrogen or methane) can offer an opportunity to provide a renewable transport fuel whilst achieving great GHG emissions reductions [2,3]. The use of hydrogen produces only water instead of GHG and exhaust pollutants. As compared to traditional hydrogen production through energy intensive steam reforming of methane, a biological route (such as dark hydrogen fermentation) presents the possibility of being renewable, carbon neutral and less energy intensive [4–6]. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundantly available bioresource with a global yield of approximately 1.3 billion tons per annum [7]. These feedstocks (such as rice straw and switchgrass) are attractive and promising for the production of biofuels. Pretreatment is a key step for efficient conversion of recalcitrant substrates by microorganisms. Biological pretreatment (such as enzymatic hydrolysis) has been categorized as environmentally friendly and exhibits advantages of low energy consumption, mild treatment conditions and does not generate inhibitors. However, pretreatment using enzymes is not always practical due to the relative high cost, long pretreatment time and low efficiencies. For example, the effect of enzymes (including cellulase and laccase) on enhancing biogas production from anaerobic digestion of manure waste was found to be minimal [8]. In comparison, chemical pretreatments are typically more efficient and simpler to scale-up. Pretreatments using thermal acid hydrolysis and steam explosion, have been developed as effective approaches for biomass decomposition [6,9–14]. However, these methods inevitably generate several groups of toxic inhibitors, and pose inhibitory effects on fermentation [15,16]. Three major types of compounds are recognized as potential inhibitors [6,17]: (1) furan compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) arising from the dehydration of sugars; (2) phenolic monomers such as syringaldehyde and vanillin originated from lignin depolymerization; and (3) organic acids such as acetic acid derived from the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in hemicellulose. Among these inhibitors, furfural is one of the major inhibitors found in most hydrolysates of lignocellulose (such as corn stover and wheat straw) [18]. Recent studies also found that thermochemical pretreated algal biomass could also result in furfural generation [18,19]. The produced concentration of furfural in hydrolysate depends on various factors primarily including for biomass type and the severity of pretreatment (such as reaction time, pH, pressure and temperature). Gonzales et al. investigated the effect of pretreatment severity on hydrolysis of rice husk, which was treated in 5% (v/v) H2SO4 at 10% (w/v) solid/liquid ratio and 121 °C for 30, 60, and 90 min [10]. The authors found that with pretreatment time increased from 30 min to 90 min, the concentration of produced furfural increased significantly from 1.11 g/L to 6.41 g/L [10]. Furans are predominately generated at low pH during thermo-acid pretreatment, while a high pH normally favors lignin degradation, resulting in the formation of lignin monomers [18]. The presence of high concentrations of furfural in fermentation typically led to decreased hydrogen production due to its inhibition effect on key cellular enzymes [18,20]. Furfural has been reported as a potent inhibitor to glycolytic enzymes in various microorganisms, such as ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and hydrogen-producing bacteria Thermotoga neapolitana. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, furfural could cause an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (such as H2O2, O2 − and OH−) and cellular damage to mitochondria, vacuoles, actin, and nuclear chromatin [21]. The damage was less severe with furfural concentration of 25 mM as compared to that with 50 mM, which completely prevented cell growth for ethanol fermentation [21]. In Candida tropicalis, cell growth was inhibited by furfural during xylitol fermentation [22]. For hydrogen fermentation, the respective addition of 1 g/L of furfural and HMF resulted in a decrease in hydrogen yield by 69% and 76% compared to the control [23]. Clostridium beijerinkii was found to be more resistant to the inhibitors, making it an ideal candidate for hydrogen production in the presence of inhibitors [23]. Cao et al. investigated the effect of furfural on Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 and found a decreased hydrogen production by 50% with 1.0 g/L furfural addition [24]. Siqueira et al. observed that 2.0 g/L furfural led to the total inhibition on hydrogen production using mixed cultures [25]. Furfural and HMF exhibited different inhibition effects on dark fermentation of xylose using mixed consortia; the authors found that furfural (0.1–1 g/L) was completely degraded with no inhibition of hydrogen production, while HMF (0.02–0.19 g/L) was partially degraded exerting strong hydrogen inhibition [26]. Anburajan et al. demonstrated HMF at 2.7 g/L caused the maximum inhibition on hydrogen fermentation of glucose, and the presence of HMF particularly enriched the bacterial abundance of Lactobacillus sp [27]. When galactose was used as substrate, it was found that HMF inhibition was milder to continuous culture than that to batch culture [28]. It can be concluded that the efficiency of hydrogen production in fermentation is highly related to the nature and concentration of inhibitors; more research is needed to assess the impact of furfural on specific microorganisms during hydrogen fermentation. Progress has been made in optimizing biomass pretreatment methods to achieve a higher sugar yield and a lower inhibitor generation. Understanding the inhibitory mechanisms is significant in optimizing the production of biofuels. Knowledge on furfural inhibitions can contribute to making the use of lignocelluloses a more efficient way to produce fermentative hydrogen. The present study aims to fill the research gap in the understanding of the impact of furfural on hydrogen-producing bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes) in dark fermentation of a model carbon source (glucose), through comprehensive assessment of the hydrogen production, substrate consumption, metabolic products formation and bacterial morphology. E. aerogenes is a promising hydrogen-producing strain for practical hydrogen production owing to several advantageous merits, such as its rapid growth rate, strong adaptability to severe environmental parameters (such as pH, hydrogen partial pressure and dissolved oxygen), and ability to metabolize a wide range of substrates, [29–31]. The specific objectives of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the hydrogen production in the presence of different concentrations of furfural; (2) Identify the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of furfural in dark fermentation using E. aerogenes; (3) Propose the metabolism responses of E. aerogenes to furfural in dark fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and materials,"2.1 Microorganism and materials Wild strain E. aerogenes ATCC13408 used as the seed inoculum was obtained from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center. The Luria–Bertani medium (LB) was used for bacteria cultivation. The compositions of LB medium consisted of (per liter) 5 g yeast extract, 10 g peptone, and 10 g NaCl. All the chemicals and materials used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China)."
3,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen fermentation The 1 mL seed inoculum of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 was cultured with 100 mL of LB medium. The cultivations were conducted aerobically in an incubator shaker (working volume 90 L) at a speed of 250 rpm under 37 °C for 12 h to allow for exponential growth of the cells. The 100 mL bacteria cultures were then transferred into glass bottles (working volume 417 mL). Afterwards, 200 mL fermentative medium (containing 198 mL deionized water, 3 g glucose, 0.6 g yeast extract, 1.2 g peptone, 0.03 g FeCl2, 1 mL microelement liquid and 1 mL vitamin liquid) were added into the glass bottles. The total liquid solution in the glass bottles was approximately 300 mL for dark fermentation. The initial pH for dark hydrogen fermentation was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1. A previous study from the authors demonstrated that 15 mM of furfural induced a significant 28.9% decrease in peak hydrogen production in dark fermentation as compared to that in the absence of furfural [20]. A higher furfural addition of 20.8 mM resulted in a total inhibition of hydrogen production using mixed cultures [25]. Based on the above, the range of furfural concentration from 0 to 30 mM was selected to investigate the impact of furfural on hydrogen fermentation using E. aerogenes. In the experiments, different dosages of furfural were added to each bottle to set the concentrations as 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mM during fermentation. The bottles were then purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min, sealed with rubber stoppers, and kept at 37 ± 1.0 °C to initiate fermentation. Sterile conditions were maintained by autoclavation at 100 °C for 30 min. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Gaseous products including hydrogen and CO2 during fermentation were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7820A, USA). The GC system is equipped with a 5A column (Φ 3 mm × 3 m; Agilent, USA) and a thermal conductivity detector [30]. The soluble metabolic products (SMP) in the fermentation solution were quantified using another GC equipped with a DB-FFAP column (Φ 0.32 mm × 50 m; Agilent, USA) and a flame ionization detector [30]. The concentration of glucose was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Agilent 1200, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, USA) and a refractive index detector. The surface morphologies of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 cells collected after hydrogen fermentation were examined by a Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM SU8010, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV."
5,Calculations,"2.4 Calculations Hydrogen potential kinetics: The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) was employed to simulate the hydrogen yield. The derived kinetic parameters (Hm, maximum hydrogen potential, mL/g; Rm, peak hydrogen production rate, mL/g/h; and λ, lag-phase time of hydrogen production, h) were calculated using Origin software. (1) H = H m exp { − exp [ R m e H m ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Half-maximal inhibitory concentration analysis: The relative H m for the experiments associated with different furfural concentrations were obtained according to Eq. (2): (2) Relative H m = H m Furfural H m Control in which H m Furfural was derived from the Gompertz model for the experiments with different concentrations of furfural, whereas H m Control was the value achieved in the absence of furfural. These data related the relative hydrogen production to the concentration of furfural. The results were then fitted to an extended Monod kinetics for inhibition as shown in Eq. (3) [32]. (3) H m = H m Control × ( 1 − IC IC 100 ) n where IC is inhibitor concentration (mM), IC 100 is the lethal inhibitor concentration beyond which the reaction cannot proceed (mM), and n is a constant. IC 50 , the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, was determined based on Eq. (4). (4) IC 50 = ( 1 − 0 . 5 1 n ) × IC 100 Bacterial fractal dimension calculation: The changes of bacterial surface roughness were quantified by calculating the bacterial fractal dimension. The concept of fractal geometry was first proposed to study the irregular geometrical morphology [33]. Fractal dimension reflects the irregular degree of complex objects and is a parameter of the effectiveness of space occupation by complex objects. It can be determined by counting the minimum number of small cubes required for covering this irregular object [34]. The fractal dimension was calculated based on Eq. (5) after the SEM images of bacterial cells were binarized using MATLAB software. (5) d = lim ε → 0 [ logN ( ε ) / log ( 1 / ε ) ] where d is the fractal dimension, N is the number of grids covering the fractal and ε denotes the length of a grid side [35]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production from glucose during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural,"3.1 Hydrogen production from glucose during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural Fig. 1 presents the results of hydrogen production from glucose in the presence of different concentrations of furfural ranging from 0 to 30 mM. As shown in Fig. 1a, the hydrogen yield from glucose in the absence of furfural was found as 163.5 mL/g after fermentation of 72 h. When adding 5 mM and 10 mM furfural in fermentation, the hydrogen yield significantly increased to 193.7 mL/g and 177.5 mL/g, respectively. The presence of 5 mM furfural boosted peak hydrogen production rate to the highest value of 10.4 mL/g/h as compared to a value of 4.6 mL/g/h in the absence of furfural, as shown in Fig. 1b. This is an interesting phenomenon because furfural has been traditionally considered a potent biological inhibitor in fermentation processes (such as hydrogen fermentation and ethanol fermentation) [17,18]. A previous study showed that the presence of 15 mM furfural slightly decreased hydrogen production by 2.3% when using anaerobic sludge as inoculum, but significantly prolonged fermentation lag-phase time by 94.9% [20]. This suggested that 15 mM furfural was not the lethal concentration to the microorganism in the sludge for hydrogen fermentation [20]. Further increasing inhibitor concentration, hydrogen fermentation was severely inhibited [24,36]. In the present study, when increasing furfural concentration to 20 mM, the hydrogen yield decreased to 121.4 mL/g; equivalent to a decrease of 25.7% compared to no furfural addition. Further increasing furfural concentration to 30 mM resulted in a hydrogen yield of only 109.1 mL/g; equivalent to a decrease of 33.3% compared to no furfural addition. The inhibition effect was previously ascribed to the fact that the degradation of inhibitors required a significant consumption of reductive power in the form of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated in glycolysis [20]. The reductive capability of fermentative bacteria was a key driving force to convert protons to hydrogen in fermentation [37]. The consumption of reductive power thereby led to decreased hydrogen production. The kinetic parameters of the hydrogen production curves were calculated by fitting the data to the modified Gompertz model (Table 1 ). The correlation coefficient (R2) values of all groups were higher than 0.98, suggesting a satisfactory match with the experimental data. A hydrogen potential of 179.1 mL/g and peak hydrogen production rate of 4.2 mL/g were observed in the absence of furfural. In a similar trend with experimental data, the addition of 5 mM and 10 mM furfural significantly enhanced hydrogen potential and peak hydrogen production rate. The inhibition effects on fermentation in the presence of high concentrations of furfural (20 mM and 30 mM) were assessed in terms of hydrogen potential, lag-phase time, and peak production time. These results were consistent with the experimental data. Fig. 2 shows the effects of furfural concentration on the relative hydrogen yield from glucose. The correlations between relative hydrogen yield and furfural concentration fitted well with the model (R2 = 0.8693). The estimations of IC50 and IC100 were derived using the extended Monod kinetics model (Eqs. (3) and (4)). IC50 (the half-maximal inhibitory concentration) was calculated using the hydrogen potential obtained from the modified Gompertz model at each furfural concentration. The simulation results showed that the values of IC50 and IC100 were 32.5 mM and 45.2 mM, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the values of IC50 in hydrogen fermentation using different hydrogen-producing bacteria [25,38,39]. It shows that the IC50 values of furfural in hydrogen fermentation varied significantly in literature ranging from 1.4 mM to 41.6 mM. For example, Siqueira et al. found that 6.5 mM furfural inhibited 50% of hydrogen production from glucose in mesophilic condition [25], whereas a relatively higher IC50 value of 10.7 mM was observed by using mixed sugars as the substrate [39]. Under thermophilic condition, the IC50 of 5.2 mM was observed [39]. This result was likely due to the fact that mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation systems had different microbial communities, leading to different levels of tolerance to inhibition. These results suggest that the inhibitory concentration is associated with various factors, such as the type of microorganism, fermentation temperature, and whether there is a synergy effect with other compounds [18]."
8,Glucose consumption during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural,"3.2 Glucose consumption during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural Fig. 3 presents the consumption of glucose during dark fermentation with different furfural additions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the overall degradation efficiency of glucose in all conditions reached 100% after fermentation of 36–72 h regardless of furfural concentrations. The addition of 5 mM furfural resulted in a complete glucose consumption within 36 h approximately. The presence of low concentrations of furfural enabled a much quicker glucose consumption process throughout fermentation. The addition of 5 mM furfural led to the highest glucose consumption rate of 0.40 g/L/h as compared to 0.37 g/L/h without furfural addition. In comparison, the presence of 30 mM furfural significantly prolonged the consumption of glucose to 72 h with a decreased peak consumption rate of 0.37 g/L/h. This result is similar to a previous study, in which the presence of furfural adversely affected the bioconversion of glucose in hydrogen fermentation [20]. The authors found that the consumption of glucose by mixed bacteria decreased from 96.9% to 79.5% in 48 h [20]."
9,Soluble metabolic products formation during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural,"3.3 Soluble metabolic products formation during dark fermentation in the presence of furfural Fig. 4 presents the effect of furfural concentration on SMP distribution after dark fermentation. Hydrogen production via dark fermentation is always accompanied diverse SMP production, such as acetic acid and butyric acid. Previous research has summarized the metabolic pathways of glucose in dark hydrogen fermentation [40,41]. The metabolic pathways via ethanol, acetate and butyrate are shown in Eqs. (6)–(8) as follows. (6) Ethanol pathway: C6H12O6 + 2H2O = 2CH3CH2OH + 2H+ + 2HCO3 −, ΔG′0 = −225.3 kJ/mol (7) Acetate pathway: C6H12O6 + 4H2O = 2CH3COO− + 4H+ + 2HCO3 − + 4H2, ΔG′0 = −215.7 kJ/mol (8) Butyrate pathway: C6H12O6 + 2H2O = CH3CH2CH2COO− + 3H+ + 2HCO3 − + 2H2, ΔG′0 = −254.8 kJ/mol During fermentation, glucose is converted by bacteria into pyruvate coupled with NADH generation. NADH in the intracellular system is associated with the further reaction which reduces protons into hydrogen. 1 mol glucose can metabolically produce 4 mol NADH via the acetate pathway [42]. Therefore, 1 mol glucose can at a maximum produce 4 mol hydrogen (Eq. (7)). However, the production of other SMP (such as ethanol and butyrate) requires the consumption of NADH, leading to the decrease in hydrogen yield (Eqs. (6) and (8)). SMP analysis revealed that ethanol, acetate and butyrate were the major components, comprising over 85% in all groups as shown in Fig. 4. The control group without furfural addition yielded the SMP of 98.3 mM, of which ethanol, acetate and butyrate comprised 85.6% of total SMP. The addition of 5 mL furfural increased total SMP to 100.9 mM, of which ethanol, acetate and butyrate comprised 90.6% of total SMP. This suggests that the increased hydrogen production stimulated by furfural did not significantly affect the metabolic pathways during fermentation. The overdose of furfural (30 mM), however, greatly reduced SMP to 69.7 mM, due to the inhibition effect. This is in agreement with the decreased hydrogen yield in the presence of high concentrations of furfural. Monlau et al. reported that the presence of high concentrations of inhibitors resulted in no hydrogen production; and this was accompanied with a shift from hydrogen-producing pathways (such as acetate and butyrate) to low- or non-hydrogen-producing pathways (such as lactate and ethanol) [43]. This was also concomitant with a microbial population shift from Clostridium sp. to Sporolactobacillus sp [43]."
10,Effect of furfural on bacterial morphology of Enterobacter aerogenes,"3.4 Effect of furfural on bacterial morphology of Enterobacter aerogenes Fig. 5 shows the cell morphology of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 in response to different levels of furfural addition. The original bacterial cells exhibited a smooth and integrated cell membrane (Fig. 5a). In the presence of 5 mM furfural in fermentation, the surface of bacterial cells remained integrated, but a large amount of “extracellular dots” appeared on the surface of the cell membrane (Fig. 5b). This was presumably due to the stress response of bacteria to furfural, which can attack the hydrophobic sites of the cell membrane. When 30 mM furfural was added in fermentation, the structure of the cell membrane system was significantly damaged (Fig. 5c), thereby leading to abnormal microbial function during fermentation. To further quantify these differences in cell surface morphology, the concept of fractal dimension was introduced and calculated (Fig. 5d). With furfural concentration increased from 0 to 5 mM, the fractal dimension of bacterial cells increased from 1.21 to 1.38. When furfural concentration increased to 30 mM, the fractal dimension of bacterial cells was 1.54. This result suggested that a high concentration of furfural resulted in the increase of deformation and corrugation degree of cells. It has been found that ethanologenic cells were sensitive to furfural, and it could lead to membrane leakage of Escherichia coli [44]. Huang et al. studied the influence of aldehyde inhibitors (such as furfural and HMF) on the cell membrane integrity of oleaginous yeast, and found that the cell membrane integrity was well related to the hydrophobicity property of inhibitors [45]. These inhibitors could effectively attack hydrophobic sites of the cell membrane, leading to further disintegration."
11,Proposed response mechanism of E. aerogenes to furfural in dark fermentation,"3.5 Proposed response mechanism of E. aerogenes to furfural in dark fermentation Hydrogen is produced from glucose by E. aerogenes ATCC13408 mainly via two pathways [41]: formate pathway and NADH pathway. In the formate pathway, formate is readily converted to hydrogen gas by formate hydrogen lyase (FHL); in the NADH pathway, excess intracellular NADH produced is involved in hydrogen production catalyzed by hydrogenase [41]. Fig. 6 provides the proposed metabolic responses of E. aerogenes ATCC13408 to furfural addition in dark fermentation. When glucose is used as the substrate in fermentation, it is first converted to pyruvate with the release of NADH [42]. Pyruvate can be further transformed to acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), CO2 and hydrogen [42]. Acetyl-CoA is finally converted to different soluble metabolites such as ethanol, acetate and butyrate [42]. Some NADH are consumed by the generation of ethanol and butyrate, while the excess NADH can aid in the production of hydrogen with re-generation of NAD+ (NADH + H+ = NAD+ + H2) [46]. When a low concentration of furfural (5 mM) was added in fermentation, it could be transported through the cell membrane into intracellular metabolism. The degradation of furfural in fermentation involved a reduction reaction, which converted furfural to furfuryl alcohol [11]. Haroun et al. suggested the thermodynamic reaction of furfural degradation to acetate at a very low concentration of furfural (Eq. (9)) [47]. From a thermodynamic perspective, furfural can be degraded into acetate and hydrogen in the acidogenic phase of fermentation. This provides the theoretical evidence that explains why hydrogen production increased in the presence of a small amount of furfural. (9) C5H4O2 + 6H2O = CH3COO− + 2H+ + 2HCO3 − + 6H2, ΔG′0 = −152.0 kJ/mol The high concentration of furfural (30 mM) caused a significant cell membrane damage and the disfunction of normal metabolism, thus leading to decreased hydrogen production. It was reported that furan derivatives could cause detrimental effects on microbial cells by inducing DNA damage, inhibiting cell growth and inhibiting key cellular enzymes [20]. The detoxification of aldehyde inhibitors by microorganisms was attributed to the reduction activities of multiple enzymes coupled with NADH/NAD+ [48,49]. Lin et al. proposed that the reduction of aldehyde inhibitors (such as furfural and vanillin) in hydrogen fermentation required the consumption of NADH (R-CHO + 2NADH = R-CH2OH + 2NAD+) [20], and further experiments demonstrated that adding reducing chemical (such as sodium borohydride) in fermentation could ease the inhibition effect and recover most of hydrogen potential [50]. Wang et al. reported that the ratio of NADH/NAD+ in yeast Candida tropicalis decreased significantly with furfural addition; this indicated that the reduction of furfural in fermentation consumed NADH and adversely affected the redox balance [51]. Another study demonstrated that xylitol accumulation from xylose decreased with furfural addition, due to the fact that NADH was oxidized to NAD+ in the reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol [52]."
12,Conclusions,"This study found that low concentrations (5 mM and 10 mM) of furfural could facilitate hydrogen production from glucose using E. aerogenes ATCC13408. In a thermodynamic view, this phenomenon was presumably due to the bioconversion of low concentration of furfural to hydrogen. However, a high concentration of furfural (30 mM) significantly decreased hydrogen yield because of severe cell membrane damage. The fractal dimension calculation suggested the increase in deformation degree of cells with increased furfural concentrations. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration was obtained as 32.5 mM, which serves as an indicator of inhibition levels in fermentation. The findings from this study can advance the understanding of furfural’s impact on hydrogen fermentation, and contribute to effective optimization of biomass pretreatment."
