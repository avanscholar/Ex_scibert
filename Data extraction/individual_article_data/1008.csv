0,Introduction,"Boronic acids and derivatives can seldom be available in the nature and so, they can be classified as abiotic, which are synthetically obtained from primary sources of boron. The borate esters simply occurs by the dehydration of boronic acid with the various alcohols, are the main sources for the synthesis of boronic acid derivatives. Boronic acid has important advantages which make it a favorable class of synthetic intermediates such as being a mild Lewis acid, less reactivity, easy to handling and non-toxic. Boronic acid is an environmentally friendly acid, thus, it can be regarded as green [1–4]. Although most of the physical and chemical properties of boron are located between metallic and non-metalic behaviours, the compounds derived from the boron molecules display non-metallic characteristic. Boron based organic and inorganic compounds have widely been used in a number of fields such as textile, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical studies, agriculture and industry for long years, which makes the boron as a unique element in the present century [5]. Therefore, in the past decades, design and synthesis of novel boron compounds as well as the investigation of their broad applications have attracted an intense attention. Boron has a similar atomic size with carbon, which makes it study alloying experiments on the hydrogenation properties of TiFe [6]. In addition, strong electrophilic characteristic of boron due to the its tendency to fill the vacant orbital and complete the octet is the reason for the occurrence of the organoboron structures and the increased covalency of B–O and B–N bonds [7] make the organoboron compounds more stable than the organometallic ones. Thus, boron containing Schiff bases may provide extra stability to counteract the instability of CN bonds in salicylaldimines as catalyst compounds. Additionally, boron based complexes have been attracted the attention of many researchers due to the valuable properties in the area of catalytic studies [8,9], organic light-emitting devices [10,11], electron-transport materials [12], fluorescent biolabels [13], chemosensors [14]. The presence of vacant orbital on the valence orbital of boron element provides a strong electrophilic character and organoboron complexes were found to be more stable than organometallic compounds. The explained reason was the main milestone for the construction of the designated compounds. Moreover, the previous reports released by our group demonstrated that the stability of the complexes was increased by the presence of Schiff base ligands [8,9]. Recent studies have shown that boron complexes would be important candidates for the transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones. Our group has reported the 2-hydroxynapthalene based boron complexes as an enantioselective transfer hydrogenation for acetophenone [15]. Catalytic activity of fluorine/phenyl chelated boron complexes for a various aromatic ketones via transfer hydrogenation from i-PrOH was also demonstrated [8]. Ammonia-borane was also considered as important material for transfer hydrogenation of imines due to the high hydrogen storage capacity [16]. Homogeneous asymmetric catalysis with transition metal complexes is an active area of research [17] and the design and development of efficient ligands are of great interest [18]. Schiff base structured ligands and their chelated complexes are the most common molecules that have been used for catalytic investigations in many researches [19–28]. The transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric reaction is an important method for the preparation of various chiral compounds, specifically enantiomerically pure drugs [29]. The structures of the chiral ligand coordinated to the transition metal have been found to be crucial since the reactivity and stereoselectivity of an asymmetric transformation are related to the ligand systems. Due to the abovementioned reason, the design and synthesis of efficient chiral ligands have attracted the attention of researchers in the area of academia and industry [30–32]. As an alternative method, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation is achieved by the aid of a stable hydrogen donor for molecular hydrogen [33,34]. In this method, primary and secondary alcohols, formic acid and its salts have been used as the hydrogen sources. It is more advantageous to use a hydrogen donor instead of molecular hydrogen due to the fact that it has no risks and constraint associated with hydrogen gas and it does not require pressure vessels and other equipment. Moreover, the reaction uses inexpensive reagents and is usually easy to perform. The transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones is one of the most important and valuable method for the synthesis of secondary alcohols and notable success has been received by the researchers [17,35]. A range of transition metal complexes are known to be used as catalyst in this reaction [36]. The long synthetic pathways are one of the main reasons for the production of expensive catalysts systems. Hence, there is an urgent need for the preparation of economic, relatively mild and environmentally friendly catalyst system. Due to the abovementioned reasons, the preparation of boron based catalyst is our main interest for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones. To the best of our knowledge, a few numbers of studies have been reported on the use of boron compounds as catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones. This class of compounds is considerably interesting for their simple synthesis and easy accessibility. As part of our research program, in the current work, four boron containing Schiff bases (Scheme 1 ) were synthesized by the condensation of chiral amines and 4-formylphenylboronic acid. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopic methods. Then, these boron compounds were employed in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives to 1-phenylethanol derivatives in the presence of 2-propanol as the hydrogen source."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Synthesis of boron containing Schiff bases (1–4),"2.1 Synthesis of boron containing Schiff bases (1–4) Synthesis of compounds (1–4) is described in Fig. 1 . They were obtained in high yield by refluxing the 1:1 M ratio of chiral amines with 4-formylphenylboronic acid in methanol or absolute ethanol. The appearance of new resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of 1–4 at δ 8.33–8.92 ppm corresponds to azomethine (CH N) proton. Due to the lack of solubility of the compounds in DMSO‑d 6, their 13C NMR spectra could not be recorded. In the IR spectra, the stretching vibrations of CHN are seen from 1610 to 1653 cm−1. The other spectroscopic data and elemental analysis results were in good agreement with the proposed structures."
3,Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives with isoPrOH,"2.2 Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives with isoPrOH The catalytic activity of compounds 1–4 was investigated in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones to the corresponding alcohols under different conditions. As a general experiment, Schiff base (0.005 mmol) and ketone (0.5 mmol) were added to a solution of NaOH in iso-PrOH (0.025 mmol of NaOH in 5 mL iso-PrOH) and the reaction was monitored by GC. An argon atmosphere was used as an inert environment for the experiments. The reduction of ketones to the corresponding alcohols via hydrogen transfer from iso-PrOH was catalyzed by compounds 1–4. At room temperature, the reaction proceeded very slowly, with low conversion (<10%, 96 h). (Table 1 , entries 1–4). Furthermore, as can be inferred from Table 1 (Entries 5–8), the appreciable conversions were observed only in the presence of a base. The base abstracts proton of the alcohol to yield boron alkoxide and then, β-elimination of alkoxide gives boron hydride. This is an active species in this reaction. Moreover, it was found that type of base, such as KOH or NaOH, had little impact on the conversion and enantioselectivity (entries 9–12, [d]). Optimization studies clearly showed that the good activity was obtained for the reduction of acetophenone when the compounds 1–4 were used as the catalyst, with a substrate-catalyst molar ratio (100:1) in isoPrOH at 82 °C (Table 1, entries 9–12). Ratio of the base (KOH) was also changed from 100:1:3 to 100:1:9 and a ratio of 100:1:5 was the most proper. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that different reactivity was observed by the catalytic system 1–4. It was found that compound 2 is more efficient than the other examples. Due to the catalytic activities obtained from the preliminary studies, we encouraged to extend our investigations to include hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives. Acetophenone derivatives were reduced catalytically under the conditions optimized for acetophenone. As anticipated, the reduction degree of acetophenone derivatives were different depending on the electronic properties (the nature and position) of the substituents located on the phenyl ring. To be sure that the observed results could be attributed to purely electronic effects, acetophenone derivatives involving ortho- and para-substitutions on the aryl ring were explored. The results obviously demonstrated that the lower conversion was obtained by the introduction of an electron-donating moiety such as methoxy group to the p-position, while substitution to o-position gave rise to higher conversion and improved the enantioselectivity (Table 2 , entries 17–24). On the other hand, the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as CF3 on the p-positions on the aryl ring, led to higher conversion (Table 2, entries 13–16). The improved activity resulting in easier hydrogenation was achieved by the decreased the electron density of the CO bond due to the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to the p-position on the aryl ring [37,38]. The examination of the results clearly indicated that among the tested complexes, the usage of 2, as the catalyst precursor, resulted the best yield in the reduction of acetophenone derivatives. In Table 2, acetophenone derivative ketones were hydrogenated, while in Table 3 , non-acetophenone derivative ketones, mostly aliphatic ones were hydrogenated, although in some cases aromatic ones were also reduced."

6,General procedure for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"3.2 General procedure for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones Typical procedure for the catalytic hydrogen-transfer reaction: 1–4 (0.01 mmol), NaOH (0.05 mmol) and the corresponding ketone (1.00 mmol) in degassed iso-PrOH (10 mL) were refluxed until the reaction completed in a Schlenk tube. After the desired reaction time, a sample of the reaction mixture is taken off, diluted with acetone and analyzed immediately by GC. Conversion to the product was calculated from integration of its GC peak relative to that of residual unreacted ketone. Furthermore, 1H NMR spectral data for the resultant products were consistent with previously reported results."

8,Conclusions and perspectives,"In summary, four chiral boron containing Schiff bases were prepared and characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Then, their catalytic activity in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reaction of various ketones was explored. Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation conversions were calculated as enantiomeric excess (ee %). Although, the catalytic ability was found to be limited for the ketones and better activity was obtained in the presence of a base. The better activity was demonstrated by the optimized study for the reduction of acetophenone. The compound 2 was determined as the best catalyst. The further studies carried on the substituted acetophenone derivatives resulted that the electron donating groups located on the o-position were found to be more favorable for the higher conversion. Moreover, the better conversion was determined in the presence of electron with-drawing group on the p-position. Diverse substituted or designed boron bearing Schiff molecules can be applied in future researches, even obtained boron based chiral Schiff compounds were demonstrated lower efficiency on hydrogenation. The procedure is simple and efficient towards various aryl ketones."
