0,Introduction,"Hazardous and toxic wastewater pollutants have caused serious environmental problems (Chun and Yizhong, 1999; Kiwi et al., 1993). Ethanolamine (EA) is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. EA is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. Ethanolamine (EA) is produced by treating ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia. Its molecule is bifunctional, containing both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. It is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates (Frauenkron et al., 2002). Alkanolamines, such as EA, are combined bi-functional molecules with alcohol and amine groups on in the same molecule. These compounds are applied in a wide range of useful reactions common to alcohols and amines (Gunanthan and Milstein, 2008). EA is commonly used in the gas industry to eliminate acidic gases from natural gas. EA is also used to eliminate sour gases, such as CO2 and H2S, and for water alkalization in the steam cycle of nuclear power plants to prevent the formation of scale and corrosion on the pipes in the plant (Ndegwa et al., 2004). Water discharged from nuclear power plants contains high EA concentrations. The EA used in nuclear power plants are including a high COD and large amount of total nitrogen (Lee et al., 2017). Amine or ammonia can concentrate along with residual air in the coolest area of condensers. Some Cu alloys, such as brass can suffer from corrosion in these areas (Cattant et al., 2008). EA-included wastewater is generally recovered through a filtration process using the ion exchanging resins of condensate polishing plants in nuclear power plants. In the refresh process of ion exchange resins, strong acidic wastewater containing EA and larger ionic substances are discharged. The removal of EA naturally is difficult and the by-products generated from the process can deteriorate the water quality, increasing the amount of organic materials or nutrient salts. Ion-exchange resins (Raught et al., 2005), oxidation (Puttaswamy and Gowda, 2001), and biodegradation (Ndegwa et al., 2004) have been assess as a means of purifying wastewater containing EA. Some studies have reported the biodegradation of EA in water (Emtiazi and Knapp, 1994) and soil (Lee and Portier, 1999; Wong et al., 2004). These technologies, however, require a considerable quantity of chemicals, high cost, and long duration to maintain the degradation reaction. Therefore, an alternative technology is essential for efficient purification. The purification of wastewater aims to remove organic pollutants effectively. Electrical discharge is a non-equilibrium process involving a dielectric space being inserted into the discharging spaces. The removal of organic pollutants in wastewater has attracted considerable attention because of their reduction effects on the environment (Lee et al., 2015; Hao et al., 2007). Electrical discharge in the liquid state has been applied to remove organic pollutants because it can produce both atomic oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, which have higher oxidation ability (Xue et al., 2008; Magureanu et al., 2011; Narengerile et al., 2009). Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been considered an effective technology for water remediation in the various techniques for the treatment of wastewater (Panpa et al., 2008). Photodecomposition of organic wastewater by the liquid phase plasma (LPP) process promotes the simultaneous remediation of liquid and H2 evolution. A plasma reaction is generally performed in the gaseous state (Yan et al., 2009; Tao and Xiong, 2013). Only few reports of plasma discharged in pure water have been published (Zhang and Cha, 2015; Guo et al., 2012; Jeong et al., 2017). LPP is produced by discharging with a high voltage into the liquid directly. The discharge of pulse plasma at a high voltage is an efficient technology for wastewater treatment (Sun et al., 2000, 2012; Chung et al., 2018). LPP by high-voltage discharge for the removal of organic materials in wastewater has many advantages, such as no secondary pollution, faster degradation of pollutant materials, process at ambient temperature and pressure, and lower energy consumption. LPP can produce a higher plasma density and larger spatial distributions than ultraviolet lamp radiation (Wang et al., 2013). The LPP process has been induced the effective removal of organic pollutant materials and hydrogen production in previous work (Chung et al., 2017, 2018). However, it hasn't tried applying in photocatalytic decomposition of a refractive wastewater such as EA released from nuclear power plant. This paper suggests the application of discharging of the liquid phase plasma for degradation of refractive wastewater such as ethanolamine released from nuclear power plant. The photocatalytic decomposition of EA and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from EA-contained water was reported to remove the pollutant and to produce hydrogen using the LPP process. TiO2 and Ni-incorporated TiO2 nanocrystallites were employed used as photocatalysts. SBA-15 mesoporous material was introduced as a catalytic support for the Ni-incorporated TiO2 nanocrystallites. The photocatalytic potential of the photocatalysts was assessed from EA degradation and hydrogen production in EA-contained aqueous solution. The reaction pathway based on the product distribution is discussed in terms of the photocatalytic decomposition of the EA aqueous solution to define a mechanism of hydrogen evolution and EA decomposition."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium dioxide (TiO2; Degussa, P25) was used as a reference photocatalyst. Ni ions were incorporated onto the titanium dioxide surface as non-noble metal ion. Nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O; Junsei, 99.9%) was used as the precursor of the Ni-incorporated titanium dioxides. The Ni was incorporated on titanium dioxide according to the incipient-wetness impregnation method. The amount of Ni ion loaded on the titanium dioxide was adjusted to ca. 2 wt%. All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grades and used as received. SBA-15 synthesized according to literature was used as a support of the photocatalysts in the photocatalytic reaction. A TiO2 sol (TS) was synthesized by dissolving Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 (titanium isopropoxide; Junsei, 99.9%) in anhydrous ethanol (Junsei, 99%) to incorporate the titanium dioxide nanocrystallites on the support. The amount of Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4was controlled to 10% of the mass of titanium dioxide. The solution was stirred vigorously at 25 °C for 2 h. Distilled water was then inserted dropwise to initiate hydrolysis. Titanium dioxide nanocrystallites were obtained from the titanium dioxide sol by drying and calcining at 500 °C. Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 was prepared using the wetness impregnations methods for SBA-15 in a titanium dioxide sol. SBA-15 was soaked in the titanium dioxide sol. After stirring for 2 h, the samples were calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to afford the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide."
3,Photocatalytic degradation of EA,"2.2 Photocatalytic degradation of EA Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the photodecomposition reaction using the LPP process. The photocatalytic degradation of EA was carried out in water containing EA. Photocatalytic degradation was induced in a photocatalytic reactor irradiated with LPP. The gaseous products were carried by nitrogen gas and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC; Younglin, M1650D) with thermal conductivity detectors installed with molecular sieve 5A packing columns. The carrier gas was supplied at a constant flow rate using a mass-flow controller. The temperature of the photocatalytic reactors inside the installed electrodes of the LPP system was set to 20 °C and controlled using a circulating water bath. Liquid phase plasma was induced using a pulsed electric discharging system using a tungsten needle electrode. The inter electrode gap was maintained a 0.3 mm. The pulse width and frequency of the LPP discharged by the power supply were 3–5 μs and 25–30 kHz, respectively."
4,Characterization of the photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the photocatalysts The crystallinity and structure of the photocatalysts were examined by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku model Dmax-II/PS) using Ni filtered CuKα X-ray radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). The shape and size of the photocatalyst particles were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). TEM was measured using a LaB6 filament and operated at 200 kV. The chemical components of the photo-catalysts were measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS; NORANE Z-MAXI 350). The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using an UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadtzu, UV-2500) in the 200–1000 nm wavelength range adopting BaSO4 as the reflectance standards. The optical bandgap ( E gap ) were determined using the Kubelka and Münks theory. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to analyze the LPP radiation during electrical discharge in the reactants using a fiber optical spectrometer (Avantesi, AvaSpecs-3650). The spectrum was recorded using optical fibers installed perpendicular to the axis of the electrode. The measuring condition during acquisition of the spectra was a 240 V discharging voltage, 32 kHz frequency, and 4 μs pulse width."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Optical emission properties,"3.1 Optical emission properties Fig. 2 presents the OES data of the LPP recorded during discharging in EA-containing water. LPP leads to the generation of active species as well as strong ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. Strong atomic peaks for the active species in the photoreaction appeared during discharge in the water, such as Hβ (486 nm), Hα (656 nm), OI (777 nm), and the molecular bands of OH (A-X) radicals at 309 nm. This suggests that the light sources of LPP can induce photo-chemical reactions in both the UV and visible light ranges. Hydrogen gas was produced by the photochemical decomposition of water under LPP irradiation due to the active species without a photocatalyst. This confirmed that the amount of H2 gas evolution was not large in previous work (Jeong et al., 2017). The photoreaction on the photocatalysts under LPP irradiation occurs primarily by the strong UV and visible light. Therefore, H2 gas evolution by the photocatalytic reaction is dominated by the strong ultraviolet and visible light radiation rather than by the active species."
7,Characteristics of the photocatalysts,"3.2 Characteristics of the photocatalysts Fig. 3 presents the XRD patterns of SBA-15, TiO2/SBA-15, and titanium dioxide. The anatase TiO2 peak appeared at 25° 2θ with of TS onto SBA-15 material. The TiO2/SBA-15 was doped with Ni ions but the Ni peak was not defined because of the low doping amount of Ni ion. Fig. 4 presents TEM images and EDS results of Ni-incorporated titanium dioxides. The particle sizes of the Ni-incorporated titanium dioxides were <50 nm. Small particles (>10 nm) were estimated to be Ni incorporated on the titanium dioxide surface. The Ni loading was confirmed by EDS. The amount of Ni incorporated on the titanium dioxide surface was 1.8 wt% to the total weights of the photocatalysts. Ni/TiO2 particles were incorporated on the walls of the SBA-15 support. The Ni/TiO2 loading was confirmed by Ti mapping. The Ni/TiO2 loading on SBA-15 defined from the EDS results was ca. 21 wt%. The Ni/TiO2 particles were incorporated on the walls and inside the SBA-15 support. Fig. 5 presents the DRS results of Ni-incorporated titanium dioxide along with those of commercial titanium dioxide for comparison. The DRS results of the Ni/TiO2 supported on SBA-15 are presented as Kubelka-Münks units. The DRS results of the photocatalysts were comparable to those of titanium dioxide. The optical properties of the photocatalyst were initiated from light absorption in the photo-chemical reaction. The DRS of titanium dioxide exhibited an adsorption edge at 380 nm. In contrast, DRS of Ni-incorporated titanium dioxide moved to a longer wavelength range. Regarding Ni incorporation on titanium dioxide, the adsorption wavelength was increased to the visible light range. The adsorption edges were moved to the visible light region by Ni incorporation. The adsorption edges of Ni/TiO2 and Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 determined from the curves in Kubelka-Münks units were 410 nm and 395 nm, respectively. The bandgap of the Ni-incorporated titanium dioxide was 3.0 eV. In contrast, the DRS of Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 indicated a lower band gap than that of Ni/TiO2."
8,Photocatalytic degradation of EA and H2 evolution,"3.3 Photocatalytic degradation of EA and H2 evolution Fig. 6(a) presents the rate of H2 evolution on the TiO2 photocatalysts in pure water. Hydrogen was produced in the absence of photocatalyst by the LPP irradiation. This was caused by strong active species generated by irradiation of LPP into water (Jeong et al., 2017). The rate of H2 evolution increased with increasing dose of TiO2 and TS. The rate of H2 evolution increased significantly with Ni incorporation on TiO2 because the bandgap was reduced with Ni incorporation on TiO2, which can lead to better photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6(b) presents the rate of hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic water decomposition using LPP process on TiO2 and Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts. Ni loading on TiO2 brought out an increase of hydrogen evolution than TiO2 photocatalyst. The rate of hydrogen evolution on Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 was less than that of Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst. It seems that Ni/TiO2 dispersed on the surface of SBA-15 would be reduced because of incorporation inside its pores. Fig. 7(a) shows the rate of hydrogen evolution with different initial concentrations of EA on TiO2. Hydrogen was generated with degradation of ethanolamine in the photoreaction system, simultaneously. Rate of H2 evolution in ethanolamine solution was higher than that in pure water. This suggests that the increase of hydrogen evolution is attributed to additional hydrogen evolution from decomposition of water. Rate of H2 evolution became higher with increasing ethanolamine concentration in water. This indicates that the rate of hydrogen evolution is increased due to more additional photocatalytic decomposition of EA according to the increase of EA concentration. Fig. 7(b) presents the rate of hydrogen evolution in EA-contained water with an initial concentration of 10 mg/L on various photocatalysts. Hydrogen was also generated with degradation of ethanolamine in the photoreaction system. Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution. The amount of hydrogen generation was increased in the photocatalytic water decomposition on TiO2 photocatalyst with Ni loading. This suggests that Ni incorporation on TiO2 led to enhancement of H2 production due to the lower bandgap of Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst. The rate of hydrogen evolution on Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 photocatalyst was higher than that on TiO2 photocatalyst. However, it was reduced compared with that on Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst. This resulted that the exposed on the surface of SBA-15 support was reduced by loading on the support inside. Fig. 8(a) presents the variations in the EA concentration by degradation with different initial concentrations of EA on titanium dioxide. The EA concentrations decreased due to decomposition of EA by LPP irradiation. EA degradation was faster at lower initial concentrations than at higher initial concentrations. This resulted that a large amount of EA would be adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface, which can hinder the EA molecules from coming in contact with the free radicals and electron holes. Fig. 8(b) presents the photocatalytic degradation of EA on TiO2, Ni/TiO2, and Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 at the same initial EA concentration. The degradation of EA was faster on the Ni/TiO2 than that with titanium dioxide. This suggests that Ni/TiO2 has higher photocatalytic activity than titanium dioxide. The higher photocatalytic activity of Ni/TiO2 was attributed to its higher photo-sensitivity, which was defined in the DRS data. The Ni/TiO2 has a lower bandgap than titanium dioxide. The degradation of EA on Ni/TiO2/SBA-15 was also higher than on titanium dioxide, and was similar to that of Ni/TiO2. This suggests that the SBA-15 mesoporous material is a good support. The components of the gaseous and liquid products were analyzed by GC to identify the pathways of the photochemical reaction of EA degradation and H2 evolution. In the gaseous products, hydrogen was observed along with a small amount of carbon monoxide but no oxygen was found. A small amount of formaldehyde and acetic acid were detected as new liquid products in the photocatalytic reaction of the EA-containing water. From these results, the typical pathways of the photochemical reaction to the EA-containing water can be estimated, as shown in the following reaction equations: (1) H 2 O → H 2 + 1 / 2O 2 (2) 2C 2 H 7 NO → 2C 2 H 4 O + N 2 + 3H 2 (3) 2C 2 H 4 O + H 2 O → C 2 H 6 O + CH 3 COOH Eqs. (1) to (3) illustrates the typical photo-decomposition of EA-containing water as primary reactions. Eq. (1) outlines the catalytic decomposition of water-producing H2 gas. The EA in solution might be decomposed to ethanol and acetic acid, as shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). In addition, consecutive reactions might have taken place according to the following reaction equations (4) 2C 2 H 6 O + O 2 → CH 3 OH + HCHO (5) CH 3 OH → HCHO + H 2 (6) HCHO → CO + H 2 (7) CH 3 COOH → 2CO + 2H 2 Ethanol could decompose to methanol and formaldehyde, as shown in Eq. (4). The methanol might have decomposed to formaldehyde and hydrogen. CO gas and N2 gas are generated in the photocatalytic reaction from the process of EA decomposition. Additional hydrogen evolution can occur from the decomposition of formaldehyde, methanol or acetic acid, as shown in Eqs. (5)–(7). Amount of hydrogen production becomes increase conspicuously by additional hydrogen evolution from decomposition of these organic intermediates. Therefore, hydrogen evolution can be attributed to the photocatalytic decomposition of water. Therefore, the rate of H2evolution was higher than that of the photocatalysts for pure water. On the other hand, the increase in hydrogen evolution was not as high because the amount of EA in water was low."
9,Conclusion,The photocatalytic degradation of EA released from nuclear power plants was examined using the LPP process on Ni-incorporated TiO2. The decomposition of EA-containing water by LPP irradiation led to the degradation of EA and H2 evolution. The degradation of EA and H2 evolution were improved with a Ni loading on titanium dioxide. The SBA-15 material could be applied as a porous support to the Ni/TiO2 catalyst. The rate of H2 evolution in EA-containing water was higher than that in pure water. This suggests that H2 evolution is due mainly to the photodecomposition of EA in water.
