0,Introduction,"AD of solid substrates is a multi-step process, in which organic polymers are first degraded into soluble monomers during the hydrolysis step e.g., cellulose is degraded to glucose units. During the acidogenesis step, these soluble compounds are further degraded to e.g., VFA, H2 and CO2. Volatile fatty acids (e.g., propionic and butyric acids) are then degraded by acetogenic bacteria to acetic acid and H2, which are used as substrates during the methanogenesis (Demirel and Scherer, 2008; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). In the traditional AD process, biogas is mainly composed of methane (50–70%) and carbon dioxide (30–50%) with some traces of H2S and water vapor. Although H2 is produced during the AD process, it is not detected in the biogas as it is consumed immediately by the hydrogen consuming bacteria e.g., methanogens, homoacetogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). In Europe, energy crops are commonly co-digested with animal manure for methane production. However, monodigestion of energy crops in different reactor configurations viz., one- or two-stage have been also studied (e.g., Koch et al., 2009; Lehtomäki et al., 2008) and applied in full-scale plants (Resch et al., 2008) despite the possible drawbacks associated with the nutrient deficiency and lack of buffer capacity (Koch et al., 2009). Besides methane production, hydrogen production from energy crops through dark fermentation has been shown to be possible (Pakarinen et al., 2008, 2009). However, research on hydrogen production from energy crops in continuous experiments is limited. Previously, several studies have shown that H2 production in addition to CH4 production is possible from a wide variety of feedstocks by adjusting the process parameters and/or by inactivating H2-consuming bacteria (Chong et al., 2009; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Typically in batch hydrogen production, inoculum is generally heat-treated to inhibit H2-consuming bacteria e.g., methanogens (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008). However, heat-treatment is energy intensive and H2 consuming bacteria can be introduced along with the substrate in a continuous process. Recently, it has been shown that heat-treatment is not necessary to facilitate hydrogen production (Ohnishi et al., 2010). On comparison to methanogenic process, process parameters viz., shorter HRT, higher OLR and lower pH (e.g., 5–6) are favored for hydrogen production. Thus, simplest and most economic method for methanogen inhibition could be biokinetic control, mainly through utilization of low pH (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). In practical applications, hydrogen producing system should be easily established and thus shifting the ongoing (typically methanogenic) process to hydrogen production could be an interesting opportunity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of shifting the ongoing methanogenic process to hydrogen production by increasing the OLR and shortening the HRT. At first, two parallel mesophilic (35°C) CSTRs were operated with an OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 30days with grass silage as a substrate. After 79days of operation, the OLR of one of the two reactors was increased to 10kgVS/m3/d and HRT was shortened to 6days in order to inhibit H2-consuming methanogens and facilitate hydrogen production."
1,Methods,
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum Grass silage (mixture of timothy and meadow fescue) stored in a silo for about 5months (Kalmari farm, Laukaa, Middle-Finland) was used as substrate. At the laboratory, grass silage was packed in small plastic bags and stored at −20°C before further use. Before each feeding, the substrate was cut to a particle size of ca. 0.5cm with a coffee bean grinder (Krups). Inoculum was obtained from a mesophilic farm-scale reactor treating cow manure and confectionary by-products. The characteristics of substrate and inoculum are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Reactor experiments,"2.2 Reactor experiments CH4 production from grass silage was studied in two parallel semi-continuously fed CSTRs (M1 and M2) with a total volume of 2L at 35°C. During the start-up, reactors were filled with 1500mL of inoculum (working volume) and flushed with N2 for 5min to ensure anaerobic conditions. Semi-continuous feeding was initiated 14days after the start-up and considered as day 1 of the experimental period. Reactors were fed manually once on every weekday (Monday through Friday) with a plastic syringe. Digestate was removed just prior to the each feeding. The amount removed was about 5–10% less than the daily feed volume in order to maintain the constant working volume. The reactors were mixed continuously using a magnetic stirrer (300rpm). During the whole run, feed TS and VS was maintained at 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively, by diluting 7.4gFM of grass silage (3.3gTS or 3.1gVS) with 43g of water (days 1–27) or nutrient solution (day 28 onwards). Nutrient solution contained (mg/kg feed) 1183 NH4Cl, 1056 K2HPO4, 422 MgSO4, 42 CaCl2·2H2O, 8.45 FeCl2·4H2O, 0.21 H2BO3, 0.21 ZnCl2, 0.21 NiCl2·6H2O, 0.16 CuCl2·2H2O, 2.11 MnCl2·4H2O, 0.21 (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.38 AlCl3·6H2O and 8.45 CoCl2·6H2O. NaHCO3 was added as buffer at a dosage of 9g/reactor during days 23–30 and at 0.5g/d (9.8g/kg feed) during days 41–105. From day 106 onwards, NaHCO3 was added only in M1 at a dosage of 2g/d (38g/kg feed). On day 78, both reactors were opened and the reactor contents were mixed and distributed equally between M1 and M2. From day 79 onwards, M1 was continued as methanogenic reactor and operated at the same OLR and HRT as earlier (liquid volume 1500mL). On the other hand, hydrogen production was induced in M2 by reducing the working volume from 1500 to 300mL with constant amount of feed. Thus, the OLR in M2 was increased from 2 to 10kgVS/m3/d and HRT was decreased from 30 to 6days."
4,Analysis and calculations,"2.3 Analysis and calculations Analyses were done as described previously (Pakarinen et al., 2008, 2009). Gas composition was sampled and measured before daily feeding. OLR and HRT were calculated for five feeding days per week. H2 and CH4 yields were converted to standard temperature and pressure. When calculating the energy yields (in kWh) of hydrogen and methane yields, conversion factors of 3 and 10kWh/Nm3 were used for hydrogen and methane, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,CH4 production in CSTRs M1 and M2 at 35°C,"3.1 CH4 production in CSTRs M1 and M2 at 35°C Methane production from grass silage was studied in two parallel CSTRs at 35°C with an OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 30days (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 2 ). After the initial start-up of feeding, specific methane yield rose to around 200L/kgVSfed by day 15. Thereafter, methane production dropped sharply with a corresponding decrease in pH (Fig. 1) and increase in TVFA concentration (Fig. 2). In order to raise the pH, buffer (NaHCO3) addition was initiated on day 23 and was substituted with nutrient solution from day 28 onwards. However, TVFA concentration continued to increase further to reach 5.7–6.5g/l by day 31. The concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid, the main components of TVFA, were 4.2–5.1 and 0.6–0.7g/l, respectively (Fig. 2). Despite the addition of buffer and nutrients, both reactors did not recover and thus reactors were kept unfed between days 31 and 40 (Figs. 1 and 2). During this unfed period, TVFAs concentration decreased to 2.2–2.9g/l and pH increased to 7.7. Feeding was resumed on day 41 with an OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 30days. The mean methane production during days 41–78 was 198–218L CH4/kgVSfed with an average CH4 content of 50–54% (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Thus, the highest average methane yield corresponded to energy yield of 2180kWh/tVSfed. These methane yields were slightly lower than the methane yields of 260L/kgVSfed reported during the monodigestion of grass silage at an OLR of 3.5kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 50days in a loop reactor (Koch et al., 2009). However, the methane yields obtained in the present study were comparable to those obtained during the monodigestion of grass silage (197L/kgVSfed) in a two-stage systems consisting of leach bed and UASB reactor system with a total HRT of 55days (Lehtomäki et al., 2008). On the other hand, the volumetric CH4 yield of 0.40–0.44m3/m3/d and VS reductions of 49–57% (days 41–78) obtained in the present study were in the same range (0.4m3/m3/d and 41–52%, respectively) as those reported by Lehtomäki et al. (2007) during the co-digestion of grass silage with cow manure in CSTR. Between the days 41–78, SCOD concentration was between 12 and 15g/l. However, daily buffer addition (9.8g/kg feed) was needed in order to keep the pH close to 7. Nevertheless, TVFA concentration increased from 2.2 to 5.7g/l in M1 and from 2.9 to 6.3g/l in M2. Besides acetic acid, propionic acid accumulation was also noticed in both M1 and M2. The increase in propionic acid concentration was from 0.1 to 0.7g/l in M1 and from 0.5 to 0.8g/l in M2. Mixing the M1 and M2 reactor contents (day 78) and continuing M1 as methanogenic reactor with an OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 30days resulted in a mean specific methane yield of 140L/kgVSfed and volumetric methane yield of 0.28m3/m3/d (Table 2). This yield was lower than the methane yields of 218L/kgVSfed obtained prior to mixing of the reactors contents. The SCOD concentration during the days 78–105 increased from 13.8 to 17.6g/l with a corresponding decrease in pH (Fig. 1). Due to this decrease in pH, more buffer was added (38.2g/kg feed) from day 106 onwards. However, TVFA concentration increased from 5.5 to 9.9g/l. The main components of TVFA were acetic (6.1g/l), propionic (2.4g/l) and iso-valeric acids (0.5g/l). Iso-butyric (0.3g/l), butyric (0.3g/l) and valeric acids (0.1g/l) were also present but at a lower concentrations (Fig. 2). The results from the present study showed that the long-term monodigestion of grass silage at an OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 30days is not feasible and would result in low methane yields due to accumulation of VFA, which is attributed to the inhibition of acetate consumption by acetate utilizing methanogens and VFA degradation by acetogens. This was evident by the high concentrations of VFAs especially acetic acid (6.1g/l) and propionic acid (2.4g/l). This high concentration of propionic acid in the present study might have been a reason for the process failure. Previous studies have shown that propionic acid at a concentration of 0.9g/l has resulted in decreased methanogenic growth rates and thus methane yields (Wang et al., 2009). Propionate accumulation has been shown to inhibit propionate degradation while acetate accumulation inhibits both acetate and propionate degradation (Kus and Wiesmann, 1995). Besides direct VFA accumulation, other factors such as lack of trace nutrients or accumulation of inhibitory levels of Na+ through NaHCO3 additions may have also resulted in the process failure. For instance, the amount of nickel (Ni) supplied through nutrient solution addition in the present study (0.05mg/kg feed) might have been too low, as Ni has been reported to be an essential trace nutrient to achieve high acetate to methane conversion rate (Kida et al., 2001). On the other hand, no selenium (Se) or tungsten (W) was added in the present study, both of which have previously been shown to be advantageous for biogas process (Lebuhn et al., 2008; Plugge et al., 2009). However, the impact of nutrient addition in the present study was not clear, as the recommended concentrations for trace elements show high variation (Demirel and Scherer, 2011) and no control without nutrient addition was operated. Furthermore, addition of NaHCO3 for buffering the process had apparently resulted in accumulation of Na+ in the reactor. The calculated Na+ concentration was 2.7g/kg feed, which was apparently reached in the reactor around day 73 of the experiment and was further increased to 10.4g/kg feed at day 106. The role of NaHCO3 on decreasing process performance is however not clear as IC50 for sodium inhibition has been reported to show wide range, from 5.6 to 53g/l (Chen et al., 2008), depending on e.g., adaptation of the bacterial population. According to present and previous studies (e.g., Lebuhn et al., 2008), step-wise increase in OLR or generally lower OLR and/or longer HRT might be feasible in energy crop monodigestion. Higher methane yields have been obtained typically when the reactors were operated either with lower OLR and/or longer HRTs, as applied in the present study. When OLR was increased step-wisely from 1 to 3.5kgVS/m3/d (HRT decreased from 440 to 50days) during 300days, methane yields of 260L/kgVS were obtained without indication of reactor failure during monodigestion of grass silage in a loop reactor (Koch et al., 2009). Mähnert et al. (2005) on the other hand reported high methane yields of 300L/kgVS during the monodigestion of a mixture of three fresh grass species at a low OLR of 1.4kgVS/m3/d and long HRT of 153days (calculated from data given). Similarly, high methane yields of 455L/kgVS have been reported from perennial ryegrass silage in pilot-scale two-stage CSTR with relatively low OLR of 0.5kgVS/m3/d and long HRT of 221days (Thamsiriroj and Murphy, 2010). In addition to OLR and HRT, feeding regime and mixing can affect the process. In the present study the substrate was fed only once per day, which is the method typically applied in laboratory studies. However, it has been shown that feeding of the silage should be done several times (12–24) per day due to the high lactic acid concentration and the low substrate pH, which can affect the process stability and gas yield (Krieg, 2005). In mono-digestion of grass, special attention has to be given to proper mixing (e.g., Koch et al., 2009) as grass tends to float more easily when compared e.g. to maize (Thamsiriroj and Murphy, 2010), a phenomenon, which was observed in the present study as well."
7,Shifting methanogenic process to hydrogenic process,"3.2 Shifting methanogenic process to hydrogenic process Methanogenic process in M2 was shifted to H2 production by increasing the OLR from 2 to 10kgVS/m3/d and by decreasing the HRT from 30 to 6days (day 79). Immediately after the changes in operation strategy, CH4 concentration dropped rapidly from ca. 50% to below detection limit. H2 production was first detected 12days (on day 90) after the shift in operational strategy. Thereafter, H2 concentration increased steadily during the next 30days of operation and fluctuated between 10% and 24% depending upon the feeding cycle, with lowest H2 concentration of <10% noticed after the non-fed weekends (Fig. 1). This shift in operational strategy through increased OLR and decreased HRT resulted in a sharp drop in pH from 7 to 5.6 (day 90) and then increased slowly to reach 6 (since day 92). On the other hand, SCOD and TVFA concentrations increased from 15.3 to 31.6g/l and from 6.3 to 15g/l, respectively (day 106). Among the TVFA components, the increase in acetic acid concentration was small (from 4.8 to 6.8g/l) compared to caproic acid, which increased from negligible to 3.9g/l (day 106). Butyric acid concentration reached its highest concentration of 4.8g/l on day 99. On day 106, buffer addition was stopped (29days of addition) which resulted in a decrease in SCOD concentration to around 20g/l with a simultaneous drop in pH (Fig. 1). However, H2 content remained at the same level as noticed during the buffer addition period. In addition, the concentration of TVFA especially that of acetic acid decreased while the concentration of caproic acid remained more or less constant (Fig. 2). VS reduction was at the end of reactor experiment 18%. According to present results, shifting methanogenic reactor to hydrogenic is possible by increasing the OLR and shortening the HRT. High OLR resulted in the build-up of VFA and decrease in pH, which inhibited the methane production and hydrogen consumption by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The low pH (5.5–6.5) in the present study has apparently favoured acidogens instead of methanogens. The optimal pH for methanogens is in the quite narrow range close to 7, whereas the acidogenic H2 producing bacteria can grow at lower pH of <6 (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Thus, increase in OLR as an operational strategy was shown to be a proper method for inducing H2 production from an already operating mesophilic methanogenic system. The fact that CH4 production ceased and H2 accumulated in the reactor indicates the shift in microbial community (Demirel and Scherer, 2008) and the inhibition of methanogens throughout the experimental run. It has previously been reported that hydrogen production without treating the inoculum has been feasible e.g. from garbage waste (Ohnishi et al., 2010) and household solid waste (Liu et al., 2008) and load–shock method was found as a simple method for enriching H2 producers (O-Thong et al., 2009). Moreover, low pH (5.5) has shown to be an effective method for continuous H2 production from household solid waste (Liu et al., 2008) as methane production was noticed even with short HRT of 2–6days at pH controlled to 7. Short HRT of 0.5–12h (i.e. high dilution rate) can be used to wash out methanogens in continuous processes with liquid substrates, e.g., with sucrose or glucose containing wastewaters (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). However, with solid substrates, like grass silage, the hydrolysis is typically rate-limiting (Vavilin et al., 2008) and longer HRTs are needed to allow hydrolysis. HRT of 3days was found optimal for hydrogen production from household waste in CSTR, while HRT less than 2days limited hydrolysis and longer HRTs (up to tested 6days) stimulated methanogenesis (Liu et al., 2008). High OLR can be used to inhibit methanogens through shock–load, while too high OLR can result in solvent production and thus reduce the hydrogen yield. It is thus concluded that in the present study the high OLR was the main operational strategy that could affect the shift in the anaerobic digestion process from methane to hydrogen production rather than the short HRT of 6days. One possible way to increase H2 yield from grass silage could be through pre-treatment of the substrate and use of hydrolysate for H2 production, as in that case very short HRT could be used. The highest daily H2 yield of 42L/kgVSfed, which corresponds to an energy yield of 126kWh/tVSfed, is comparable to H2 yield obtained in batch assays (at most 44L/kgVSadded, data not shown). This yield is in the same range, as previously obtained in semi-continuously fed CSTR from household solid waste (Liu et al., 2006, Table 3 ), while the yield was slightly higher than obtained from sweet sorghum extract (Antonopoulou et al., 2008), olive pulp (Koutrouli et al., 2009) and garbage slurry (Ohnishi et al., 2010, Table 3). However, the yields from potato waste (Zhu et al., 2008) and cassava stillage (Wang et al., 2011) were higher than obtained in the present study (Table 3). The chemical composition of the substrate, together with operational parameters, affects the hydrogen yield. The effect of OLR and HRT on hydrogen yield in CSTR from solid substrates can be complex and research regarding this topic is limited. In the present study the OLR was lower and the HRT longer than in the above mentioned studies (Table 3), but it must be noted that we didn’t try to optimize the process parameters. In the present study, the mean daily biogas production showed a decreasing trend, being at highest around 400mL/d (Fig. 1). Thus, the highest specific and volumetric H2 yields obtained were 19L/kgVSfed and 0.19m3/m3/d (average between days 90 and 94), respectively, while, during the 40days of operation at a higher OLR of 10kgVS/m3/d, the average specific and volumetric H2 yields obtained were 9L/kgVSfed and 0.06m3/m3/d, respectively. This decrease in H2 yield might be due to high concentrations of VFAs. Previous studies have been shown that high VFA levels would inhibit hydrogen production (Chong et al., 2009; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009; Wang et al., 2008). For instance, H2 yield in the present study decreased with a corresponding increase in the concentration of caproic acid. A similar observation in the increased caproic acid production in continuous reactor processes under mesophilic condition was reported (Jung et al., 2010). This is attributed to the fact that at pH 4–5, caproic acid production is thermodynamically favoured by the consumption of 1mol of butyric and acetic acids along with 2mol of H2 (Jung et al., 2010). Based on the present results, it seems advantageous to adjust the pH close to 6 as higher H2 yields were obtained in the period with constant buffer addition. TVFA–COD accounted 68–80% of the SCOD during the shifting period (days 79–120), thus indicating high degradation efficiency. The remaining degradation products have most probably been lactic acid and alcohols (not measured). Lactic acid was probably present in the substrate, as in a typical ensiling process, water soluble carbohydrates of the crop are mainly degraded to lactic acid. Moreover, lactic acid can be produced during anaerobic digestion process as well. In addition, lactic acid can be converted to propionic acid and the produced propionate may accumulate during the subsequent methanogenic process (Wang et al., 2009). Furthermore, lactic acid bacteria (also present in silage) can inhibit H2-producers through the excretion of bacteriocins (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). In the present study, the highest H2 energy yield (19m3/tVSfed, 57kWh/tVSfed) was less than 3% of the highest methane energy yield (218m3/tVSfed, 2180kWh/tVSfed). In a similar study with potato waste, about 5% of the energy was obtained from hydrogen production (111kWh/tTS) compared to methane production (2040kWh/tTS) (Zhu et al., 2008). Thus, the energy value of hydrogen production remained rather low and hydrogen production alone clearly is not beneficial. However, in practical applications, H2 producing acidogenic stage could be coupled to traditional methanogenic stage converting VFAs and other degradation products to CH4, thus improving the overall energy efficiency. Moreover, the digestate of the hydrogenic process could be a good substrate for the subsequent methanogenic step as the propionic acid concentration was rather low and butyric and caproic acids can be rather easily converted to acetic acid by acetogenic bacteria (Ding and Wang, 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Two-stage H2 +CH4 system has been shown to improve CH4 yield when compared to traditional one-stage methane process (Liu et al., 2006; Pakarinen et al., 2009), mainly by improving hydrolysis and acidogenesis. For instance, Liu et al. (2006) reported 21% more CH4 in a two-stage system compared with one-stage system fed with household solid waste. Besides improving methane yield, H2 stage has been shown to enable higher OLR and shorter HRT in the subsequent methanogenic stage (Ueno et al., 2007) and better effluent quality with less propionate (Wang et al., 2011) when compared to one-stage system. Further research would be needed to find optimal conditions for both hydrogen and VFAs production, as high concentrations of VFAs can inhibit both hydrogen production (Chong et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2008) and hydrolysis (Vavilin et al., 2008). In the future it could be possible to produce both hydrogen and methane from energy crops in a two-stage concept. Hydrogen could be upgraded and used separately, or, on the other hand, it could be, up to at least 17% of the volume, injected into natural gas grid to improve the properties of methane (Haeseldonckx and D´haeseleer, 2007)."
8,Conclusions,"Methanogenic process can be changed towards hydrogen production by increasing the OLR and shortening the HRT. This leads to increase in TVFAs and decrease in pH, which inhibits hydrogen consuming methanogens. At most 42L H2/kgVSfed was obtained with OLR of 10kgVS/m3/d and HRT of 6days. According to present study at most about 218L CH4/kgVSfed can be obtained from grass silage monodigestion. However, initial OLR of 2kgVS/m3/d was shown to be too high and HRT of 30days too short for stable methane production, thus stepwise increase in OLR and/or longer HRT could be suggested."
