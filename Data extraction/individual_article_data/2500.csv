0,Introduction,"Recently, it has been accepted that an efficient and low cost method for storing and supplying hydrogen for fuel cells is in the form of chemical hydrides. Chemical hydrides are very reactive with water which results in generating a large amount of pure H 2 at ambient temperature. Among these chemicals, NaBH 4 appears to be an excellent hydrogen storage medium due to its high theoretical hydrogen yield by weight, 10.6%. NaBH 4 can be used in applications where H 2 gas is used, e.g., Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Especially PEM fuel cells are alternative options for producing clean energy using on-board systems [1–4]. NaBH 4 in aqueous alkaline solution generates hydrogen gas and sodium borate ( NaBO 2 ) as by product, via contact with catalyst according to the hydrolysis reaction as shown in Eq. (1) [5]: (1) Four mole of hydrogen is generated from the alkaline solution of NaBH 4 in the hydrolysis reaction which is known to run via zero order kinetics [6]. However, rate of the hydrolysis reaction can be accelerated by means of adding catalysis. Ru-based catalysts and Pt – LiCoO 2 are known as the most suitable catalysts for producing hydrogen [7,8]. Furthermore, it is noted that NaBO 2 is recycled back to NaBH 4 using coke or methane by the over all equation which is given below [9]. (2) NaBO 2 + 2 C + 2 H 2 O → NaBH 4 + 2 CO 2 . NaBH 4 can be produced from boron compounds such as trimethyl borate ( B ( OCH 3 ) 3 ) and sodium metaborate ( NaBO 2 ) [1,10]. (3) 4 NaH + B ( OCH 3 ) 3 → NaBH 4 + 3 NaOCH 3 , (4) NaBO 2 + MgH 2 → NaBH 4 + MgO . Other methods describe for preparing NaBH 4 in an electrolytic production from borates. Cooper concluded that borate ions from NaBO 2 can be reduced to borohydride ions in the electrolytic cell having the cationic-selective membrane separating the anode and cathode compartments [11]. Also, U.S. Patent no. 4931154 describes for preparing NaBH 4 in an electrolytical cell which comprises an anode compartment containing a solution of aqueous sulfuric acid and 25% solution of tetramethlyammonium borate is charged to the catholyte compartment. The anode and cathode compartments are separated by the means of cationic membrane Nafion 427 [12]. Although, there are many electrolytic production techniques of NaBH 4 , none of the experiments yielded any detectable amount of NaBH 4 due to its fusion temperature. Therefore, molten salts systems with NaBH 4 should be explained in detailed. Calabretta and Davis investigated the molten NaBO 2 – 4 NaH – NaBH 4 composition by employing the analytical techniques of PDTA, XRD and GEA to determine the conditions required for the electrolytic hydrating of NaBO 2 . They newly discovered quasi-ternary reciprocal system to improve mode of NaBH 4 synthesis from dissolved NaBO 2 [13]. In this study, we present an investigation on NaBH 4 production technique which combines borosilicate glass (BSG) production and its conversion with Na under high hydrogen pressure and this method proposed by the authors as the high pressure process (HPP). On the other hand, hydrogenation mechanism has been estimated through hydrogen pressure drops as function of reaction time in process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and characterization,"2.1 Materials and characterization Borax ( Na 2 B 4 O 7 ) , which contains 36.52% B 2 O 3 and 16.25% Na 2 O , was used as boron source for NaBH 4 production in our experiments and was obtained from Bandirma Eti Mine Works and is abundantly available in Turkey. A simple and easily method for obtaining BSG was applied according to the procedure shown in Fig. 1 (a). The glass transition temperature of our composition, which is given in Table 1 , was determined 1300 ∘ C . Na 2 B 4 O 7 and SiO 2 were mixed in an agate mill to finely powdered for 30 min and introduced into a refractory pot in a furnace where they were melted at 1300 ∘ C . The molten glass, which was highly viscous, was not allowed cooling slowly to room temperature to prevent to form annealed glass. For this purpose, it was poured into water and very brittle glass was formed due to thermal shock in water. Thus, obtained brittle BSG can be grinded easily to a particular size below 150 μ m to be used as starting material at NaBH 4 production process. The method of X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for qualitative identification of NaBH 4 formation by using a Philips Panalytical X’Pert-Pro diffractometer in the range of from 10 ∘ to 90 ∘ diffraction angle with CuK α radiation (45kV and 40mA) at a step size of 0 . 02 ∘ and speed of 1 ∘ / min ."
3,Process description,"2.2 Process description NaBH 4 was produced by the conversion of BSG with Na under high hydrogen pressure as given by Eq. (5). The flow chart of the HPP of NaBH 4 production is shown in Fig. 1(b). (5) x 1 Na 2 B 4 O 7 · SiO 2 + x 2 Na + x 3 H 2 → x 4 NaBH 4 + x 5 Na 2 SiO 3 . The conversion reaction was carried out in a stainless-steel autoclave which was designed specially. The autoclave equipped with a stirrer and a serpentine that allows water cooling. The reactor can be pressurized with hydrogen gas ranging from about atmospheric pressure to about 50atm. Reactives can be stirred and heated until 550 ∘ C under this atmosphere. The reactor was designed with taking precautions for isolations considering the H 2 permeation. Therefore, there was no observed H 2 permeation out of the reactor at 475 ∘ C reaction temperature under 22atm. For production of x 4 mole of NaBH 4 , x 1 mole of Na 2 B 4 O 7 · SiO 2 , x 2 mole of Na and x 3 mole of H 2 are required. Pure hydrogen gas was supplied from the hydrogen tube in order to generate hydrogen atmosphere in the autoclave. The amounts of BSG and sodium were fixed at 68g (0.109mol) and 40.25g (1.75mol), respectively. The reaction components were introduced and heated under a hydrogen pressure of 22atm until 450 – 550 ∘ C in a stirrer-type autoclave in the substantial absence of air and moisture. The reaction product was allowed to cool under hydrogen atmosphere to the ambient temperature after hydrogenation had completed. The reaction product (Fig. 2 (a)) was analyzed by XRD technique for qualitative identification of NaBH 4 and XRD pattern is given in Fig. 3 . Main diffraction peaks indicated by “ ” are indexed using the NaBH 4 structure. NaBH 4 has cubic crystal system with a , b , c = 6.1635 Å [PDF No.: 01-074-1891, space group Fm-3m (225)] and (200) diffraction peak corresponding to 28 . 95 ∘ diffraction angle had the maximum intensity (100%) matched with the characteristic peak of NaBH 4 . The resulting reaction product, which includes NaBH 4 and Na 2 SiO 3 , was extracted with isopropyl alcohol. Extraction solution was separated from the by product and remaining reactants by filter paper and was evaporated in the rotary dryer. Main product (Fig. 2(b)) and by-product (Fig. 2(c)) were subjected to XRD analysis for qualitative identification and XRD patterns are given in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. Moreover, temperature and pressure variations inside the reactor were monitored as function of reaction time by taking periodic readings on control panel to investigate the characteristic features of the hydrogenation mechanism. Data were plotted against reaction temperature and time as shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that required time is 70min for conversion reaction of BSG to synthesis of NaBH 4 at temperature 475 ∘ C under 22atm hydrogen pressure."
4,Results and discussions,"We have studied the conversion of BSG with metallic sodium under high hydrogen pressure for NaBH 4 production. Figs. 1–6 are analyzed and discussed in detail. The biggest advantage of the present method which does not require highly skilled operating technique is that the excellent NaBH 4 yield (97%) even at a short reaction time of 70 min . Another experimental study which is a part of our project (Project No.: 98-DPT-07-01-02) described that under low hydrogen pressure (about 4atm), the reaction time of NaBH 4 production is determined 4hours [14]. Therefore, under high hydrogen pressure the reaction time was achieved to reduce 70 min at present production technique. This production technique can be compared with current commercial Schlesinger process which is based on conversion of trimethyl borate ( B ( OCH 3 ) 3 ) and sodium hydride (NaH). In addition to this, B ( OCH 3 ) 3 is produced by another reaction between boric acid ( H 3 BO 3 ) , which is produced from colemanite ( Ca 2 B 6 O 11 · 5 H 2 O ) , and methyl alcohol. Furthermore, NaH is prepared from hydrogenation of Na in mineral oil slurry. However, this approach requires the pre-production reactions to prepared starting materials used in NaBH 4 production. As can be seen, Schlesinger process includes the four reactions to produce of NaBH 4 and applying of these four reaction steps limit the scalability and feasibility of this process. The present method is provided for producing NaBH 4 which includes the one conversion reaction of BSG, which is prepared from readily available minerals: Na 2 B 4 O 7 and SiO 2 , and Na can be abundantly found in the nature and produced from electro chemical reaction of NaCl and H 2 O . Consequently, this technique increases feasibility of NaBH 4 production and reduces manufacturing costs."
5,Preparation of BSG,"3.1 Preparation of BSG Generally in glass industry, the glass melting process is treated at temperature ranged between 1000 and 1650 ∘ C . The temperature of melting depends on the glass composition and nearly 1000 ∘ C temperature is accepted as a low melting temperature [15]. A simple and easily method for obtaining BSG was applied (Fig. 1(b)). To make BSG, we need only a typical, an uncomplicated design and low cost glass furnace and a water bath for practical applications. Consequently, this pre-treatment procedure is very feasible to preparing of BSG as a starting material to be used in NaBH 4 production. The experimental results show that if Na 2 B 4 O 7 and SiO 2 were introduced to reactor separately without melting, unacceptable hydrogen pressure increase was observed during heating them with sodium under 22atm hydrogen pressures. Therefore, NaBH 4 production reaction could not be controlled under this condition. At the same time, Na was not reacted completely with BSG which was introduced. A low production yield of NaBH 4 is not prevented at these operating conditions. In conclusion, the main point of the HPP of NaBH 4 production which we propose is to make the BSG at first by melting Na 2 B 4 O 7 with SiO 2 which brings a very high NaBH 4 production yield at short reaction time."
6,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis Fig. 3 presents the XRD pattern of the reaction product after conversion of borosilicate with metallic sodium under high hydrogen atmosphere. The diffraction peaks show the existence of NaBH 4 and Na 2 SiO 3 , as seen in the figure. Characteristic peaks of NaBH 4 are observed in diffraction angles of 28 . 97 ∘ and 41 . 41 ∘ 2 θ in the diffractometer spectrum. However, the diffraction peak positions of 29 . 40 ∘ and 34 . 93 ∘ 2 θ belong to Na 2 SiO 3 . This result proves that NaBH 4 can be produced by the conversion reaction of BSG under high H 2 pressure. Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern of the main product after extraction, filtration and evaporation. All of the diffraction peaks are mainly associated with NaBH 4 and they clearly show the existence of NaBH 4 and characteristic peaks of NaBH 4 have occurred at 29 . 01 ∘ and 41 . 40 ∘ 2 θ diffraction angles. Fig. 5 represents the XRD pattern of the by-product which was obtained after separation of NaBH 4 from the resulting reaction product. The XRD peaks demonstrate the presence of Na 2 SiO 3 and nonexistence of NaBH 4 . Furthermore, it was noted that Na 2 SiO 3 can be reused as a raw material in glass industry. The results have shown that all of the NaBH 4 crystals were separated form the by-produced with isopropyl alcohol."
7,Hydrogenation mechanism,"3.3 Hydrogenation mechanism Fig. 6 shows the variations of the temperature and pressure as a function of reaction time inside the autoclave during the reaction. As can be seen, hydrogenation of BSG could be divided into three stages. In the first stage, initial pressure of 22atm is increased from 23atm after heating 26 min and temperature is reached to 285 ∘ C . In the second stage, conversion of BSG has started slowly. Over the temperature range from 400 to 500 ∘ C , the hydrogen gas pressure drop from 23 to 4 atm and at this stage formation of NaBH 4 has occurred. At the last stage after 70 min , there is no more pressure drop as can be seen. The conversion time of the BSG to NaBH 4 is determined from the point after which the pressure of the hydrogen gas is stable. This indicated that the hydrogenation time for NaBH 4 formation is 70 min ."
8,Conclusion,"In the present study, a HPP for NaBH 4 production is discussed. The following points result from this study: • It is established that the “HPP of NaBH 4 Production” consists of two steps such as preparation of Na 2 B 4 O 7 · SiO 2 and synthesis of NaBH 4 . • It is suggested that, a mixture of borax and quartz, which was prepared according to the formulation (Table 1), should be melted at 1300 ∘ C and poured on the water. Therefore, it can easily be grinded to particular size below 150 μ m . • NaBH 4 can be produced by heating BSG in the presence of metallic sodium at 475 ∘ C under 22atm hydrogen pressure. • According to the study of the hydrogenation characteristics of BSG, it was found that the hydrogenation time for NaBH 4 formation is 70 min under 22atm hydrogen pressure at 475 ∘ C . • The NaBH 4 yield was calculated as 97% the amount of NaBH 4 formed by 1mol of Na 2 B 4 O 7 to the theoretical value based on the production reaction."
