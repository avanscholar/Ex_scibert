0,Introduction,"The world fossil fuel consumption is relentlessly increasing, led by the continuous growth in population and the energy demand of emerging large economies [1,2]. In the last 25 years, the oil consumption increased from less than 70 million barrels of oil per day to around 100 million barrels [2]. The resources, however, are not infinite and sooner rather than later we are going to need an alternative for the production of both chemicals and fuels. In this context, biomass-based materials are receiving growing attention from both an academic and industrial point of view, since they represent the most promising green and sustainable alternative to the conventional feedstock [3–5]. Lignin, in particular, is a natural cross-linked phenolic polymer that constitutes around 30 % of lignocellulosic biomass and it represents the second most abundant renewable carbon source on earth after cellulose [6,7]. The structure of lignin is composed of highly functionalised aromatic rings bound together by a combination of C-O and C-C inter-unit linkages [1]. For this reason, lignin valorisation often pass through a hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) step, where the C-O bonds are broken and the oxygen content of the final product is consequently reduced [8]. HDO of lignin model molecules, such as guaiacol, anisole, phenol and vanillin, has been intensively studied in the past 2 decades [9–18]. Vanillin, in particular, is a phenolic aldehyde containing both a hydroxyl and methoxy group (in position para and meta, respectively), and it is an important constituent of bio-oil [19]; for these reasons, it represents a good lignin model substrate for HDO reactions. Typically, vanillin HDO pass through a first hydrogenation step of the aldehydic group to form vanillyl alcohol, which is subsequently hydrodeoxygenated to creosol (Fig. 1 ). The formation of guaiacol and hydrocarbons is also sometimes reported, even though typically under harsh reaction conditions (i.e. 300 °C and 50 bar of H2) [20,21]. Homogeneous catalysts can effectively convert vanillin to the desired product [22–24], although heterogeneous catalysts are usually the preferred choice due to their added stability and recyclability. Supported noble metal nanoparticles, such as Pd [25], Ru [19], Au [26] and Pt [27], showed in recent studies high activity and selectivity to creosol. 96 % of yield was for example achieved by Yang and co-workers using Ru nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes [28], while 98 % of selectivity was reached at 99 % vanillin conversion by Jang et al. using Pd nanoparticles on a carbon nitride support in mild reaction conditions (70 °C and 10 bar of H2) [29]. A common trait can be identified from the several studies reported in literature on vanillin HDO: the preferred supports for metal nanoparticles are carbonaceous materials, due to their high activity and selectivity displayed [15–18,26–30]. Carbon-based materials such as activated carbons, carbon blacks, graphite, nanotubes and nanofibers have been used for decades in heterogeneous catalysis as support for metal nanoparticles due to their high surface area, high thermal stability in reducing atmosphere and their ability to facilitate the deposition of nanoparticles on surfaces that do not exhibit acid-base properties [31]. In addition, the recovery and recycling of the deposited metal is much easier compared to metal oxides based supports, as carbon materials can be burned off simply by heath treatment in oxidative atmosphere. However, compared to the predominant applications of carbonaceous materials (i.e. adsorbents for gas and water purification), their use in catalysis represents only a moderate share [31]. Carbonaceous-based materials have been successfully employed in the vanillin HDO. Bindwal and co-workers, for example, reported the production of vanillyl alcohol with a selectivity up to 91 % at 95 % of conversion using a commercial 5 wt% Ru/C catalyst in a slurry reactor [19]. Almost full conversion of vanillin into the desired product (creosol) was reached by Yang and colleagues using either Ru nanoparticles or Au nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) [26,28]. Both metals, however, required high reaction temperature (150 °C) and the use of a toxic and hazardous solvent (decalin). Milder reaction conditions can be achieved employing Pd as active metal. An almost quantitative conversion of vanillin to creosol (98 % yield), for example, was achieved by Jiang and co-workers using Pd nanoparticles supported on mesoporous carbon nitride at 70 °C and 10 bar of H2 [29]. Most recently, Santos and colleagues obtained 95 % of selectivity to creosol using a Pd/C catalyst in water (100 °C and 30 bar H2), although the authors reported a 30 % mass loss due to the formation of oligomers, probably due to the high pressure involved [27,32]. The choice of the appropriate carbonaceous support is extremely important, as already highlighted for several reactions of industrial and academic relevance, such as hydrogenation and oxidation of biomass-derived substrates [33–35], dehydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [36], and many other reactions [37–40]. In this study, four types of carbonaceous materials with different chemical-physical properties have been employed as support for Pd nanoparticles and tested in the reaction of HDO of vanillin in mild reaction conditions (50 °C, 5 bar of H2 and isopropanol as a solvent). The catalysts were thoroughly characterised with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2 adsorption (BET) in order to correlate the catalyst surface properties with the catalytic activity and selectivity towards the desired products. Finally, recycle tests were performed on the most active catalyst in order to assess the reusability of the used material."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium tetrachloropalladate (II) (99.99 %), polyvinyl alcohol (87-89 % hydrolysed) and sodium borohydride (99.99 %) were purchased from Merck. The four different carbonaceous supports were: Cabot Norit (Norit), Darco KB (KB), Darco G60 (G60), and Pyrograf-III carbon nanofiber PR-24 (HHT). For the catalytic reactions, vanillin (99 %, Merck) and isopropanol (99.8 %, Merck) were used."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Pd nanoparticles were synthesised and supported on four different carbonaceous materials (namely Norit, KB, G60 and HHT) by sol immobilization method (metal loading of 1 wt%)[41]. The supports have different physical-chemical properties such as surface area, pore size and type of surface functionalities. Pd colloids were prepared adding solution of the metal precursor (Na2PdCl4, 1 mL of a 1.26 × 10−4 mol L-1 solution) to the solution containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the capping agent (1 wt. % solution, PVA/Pd (wt/wt) = 0.5) to 400 mL of milliQ water. NaBH4 (3.7 mL of a 0.1 mol L-1 solution; NaBH4/Pd (mol/mol) = 8) was then added to the yellow-brown solution under stirring and left for 30 minutes to accomplish full reduction of the Pd species. Then, the support was added to the colloidal solution under vigorous stirring. The catalyst slurry was acidified to pH 2 adding sulphuric acid before being stirred for 60 min to attain full immobilisation of the metal nanoparticles onto the carbon supports [42]. The catalyst slurries were finally filtered, washed thoroughly with 1 L of distilled water, and dried at 80 °C for 2 h in oven."
4,Catalyst characterisation,"2.3 Catalyst characterisation Quantachrome Autosorb was used to measure surface area and pore size. The samples were degassed at 120 °C for 3 h before starting the measurements. All the surface areas were evaluated using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method in the partial pressure range p/p° of 0.05-0.35. The pores volume was calculated using single point method at p/p° of 0.99. ZEISS LIBRA200FE microscope operating at 200 kV was used to perform transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The samples were prepared by sonicating the catalysts in isopropanol and their further deposition on 300 mesh copper grids coated with carbon film. Particle size distributions (PSD) was obtained counting at least 200 particles. The mean particle diameters (dm) were calculated using the formula dm= Σdini/Σni, where ni is the number of particles of diameter di. Thermo Scientific K-alpha + spectrometer was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The samples were analysed using a monochromatic Al x-ray source operating at 72 W, with the signal averaged over an oval-shape area of 600 × 400 μ. Data were recorded at 150 eV for survey scans and 40 eV for high resolution (HR) scans with a 1 eV and 0.1 eV step size, respectively. CASAXPS (v2.3.17 PR1.1) was used for the analysis of the data, using Scofield sensitivity factors and energy exponent of -0.6."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests Stainless-steel autoclave equipped with a heater and a magnetic stirrer was utilised to perform hydrogenation reactions at 5 bar and 50 °C. For each experiment, the desired amount of catalyst (31.5 mg, metal/vanillin = 1/1000 mol/mol) along with a solution of vanillin (10 mL, 0.3 M in isopropanol) were loaded in the reactor. The autoclave was then purged with N2 3 times and charged with 5 bar H2. The mixture was heated to 50 °C and the reaction started as soon as the stirring speed was set up to 1200 rpm. During the reaction, the samples were taken at regular intervals from the reactor for gas chromatography analysis (Agilent 6890, equipped with a Zebron ZB5 60 m x0.32 mm x1 μm column and a FID detector. Temperature programme: 2 min at 100 °C, 15 °C min-1 up to 170 °C with a hold time of 2 min at 170 °C, 20 °C min-1 up to 300 °C with a final hold time of 3 min). In particular, the stirring was stopped and the reaction quenched putting the autoclave in an ice bath for a couple of minutes. 500 μL of reaction mixture were withdrawn and centrifuged in order to separate the catalyst. 200 μL of the supernatant were then mixed in a GC vial with 800 μL of a solution of dodecanol (external standard). Response factors of the substrate and products were calculated using a known concentration of standard solutions of the pure compounds, using octanal as external standard. The conversion was calculated using the following equation (Equation 1): (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = m o l i - m o l t m o l i ∙ 100 Where moli are the initial moles of vanillin and molt are the moles after a reaction time “t”. The selectivity was calculated according to Equation 2: (2) S e l e c t i v i t y a % = m o l n ∑ m o l n ∙ 100 Where mola are the moles of product “a” and ∑moln is the sum of the moles of all the other reaction products. The initial catalytic activity normalised on the total amount of active metal was calculated using Equation 3: (3) A c t i v i t y h - 1 = m o l i - m o l 5 m o l P d ∙ 60 t Where mol5 are the moles after 5 minutes of reaction, molPd are the moles of Pd introduced in the reactor and t is the reaction time (5 minutes). The catalytic results were also expressed in term of activity normalised on the number of exposed metal surface atoms (ActivityNS). The evaluation of the number of exposed Pd atoms was performed assuming that all the nanoparticles have cuboctahedral morphology with cubic close-packed structure. A full-shell nanoparticles model applied in previous studies was then adopted [43,44]. The total number of Pd atoms in the cluster (NT) for a given cluster size can was calculated using Equation 4: (4) d s p h = 1.105 ∙ d a t ∙ N T 1 3 Where dsph is the mean diameter of Pd nanoparticles obtained from TEM analyses and dat is the atom diameter of Pd (0.274 nm). The number of surface atoms (Ns) and n can be calculated from Equations 5 and 6, based on the values of NT: (5) N T = 10 n 3 - 15 n 2 + 11 n - 3 3 (6) N S = 10 n 2 - 20 n + 12 Therefore, the ActivityNS based on the surface atoms can be calculated using Equation 7: (7) A c t i v i t y N S s - 1 = A c t i v i t y A Where A is the fraction of atoms lying at the surface calculated dividing Ns by NT. The most active catalyst was then chosen for stability test, and the liquid-phase vanillin HDO was carried out for five consecutive cycles at 50 °C in 5 bar of H2 for 10 minutes (ca. 85 % conversion). After each reaction, all the catalyst was recovered simply by filtration and it was reused after drying in an oven at 50 °C for 20 minutes."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Pd nanoparticles were synthesised by sol-immobilisation technique and deposited on four carbonaceous materials with different physical-chemical properties. Norit, KB and G60 are commercial activated carbon powder, while HHT are commercial hollow fishbone pyrolitically stripped carbon nanofibers treated at high temperature in order to increase the graphitisation degree. The final metal loading was assessed with Inductively Coupled Plasma analysis (ICP), and for all the catalysts it was found a value of 1 wt%. BET analysis was performed on the Pd supported catalysts (Table 1 ). Pd/Norit catalyst showed the highest surface area (2000 m2/g) while Pd/HHT the lowest one (40 m2/g). The average pore radius among all the samples was wide: from 2 nm of Pd/KB to 25.4 nm of Pd/HHT. XPS analyses were performed on the synthesised catalysts in order to evaluate Pd oxidation state, graphitisation order and the presence and abundance of oxygen functionalities. Survey spectra were recorded and analysed to evaluate the atomic % of the different elements on the catalyst surface (Figure S1). C 1s, Pd 3d and O 1s were considered for the calculation of Pd/C and O/C atomic ratios (Table 2 ). Pd/Norit, Pd/KB and Pd/G60 showed similar amount of C 1s species (84.4 %, 87.3 %, and 91.1 %, respectively), while Pd/HHT displayed the highest C 1s amount (98.8 %). Pd/Norit, Pd/KB and Pd/G60 presented the same amount of superficial Pd (ca. 1.3 %), while Pd/HHT sample had the lowest exposed Pd amount (0.3 %). The low Pd exposure can be explained considering that the Pd nanoparticles might be distributed prevalently in the inner walls of the carbon nanofibers. Finally, O 1s species were evaluated and, as expected, the Pd/HHT catalyst showed the lowest amount of functionalisation (0.9 %), while Pd/Norit the highest one (14.3 %). The Pd/C ratio was calculated as well, and Pd/KB showed the highest value (0.017), followed by Pd/Norit and Pd/G60 (0.015 and 0.013, respectively). Pd/HHT had the lowest Pd/C ratio (0.002) due to the low amount of particle present on the external catalyst surface. Finally, O/C ratio was evaluated and Pd/HHT exhibited the lowest value (0.009) while Pd/Norit the highest one (0.169). C 1s high resolution spectra was deconvoluted (Table 3 and Figure S2) and 4 main carbon groups were found: C = C double bond (284.20-204.70 eV), C-C single bond (284.98-285.23 eV), carbonylic groups C = O (286.57-286.97 eV), and C-O ether-like group (288.99-291.76 eV). Pd/Norit catalysts is mainly composed of C-C sp3 carbon (42.9 %), while regarding oxygen moieties C = O is the highest (19.2 %). Pd/KB has 63.3 % of C = C and 22.9 % of C-C, while carbonyl/carboxylic groups and ether/hydroxyl-like group were 5.9 % and 4.9 %, respectively. Pd/G60 showed similar results, although the C = O contribution increased to 14.8 %. Pd/HHT catalyst showed the highest amount of C = C (82.1 %), therefore the support can be considered highly graphitised. Graphitisation is also confirmed by the presence of high percentage of π-π* group (7.9 %), which is typical of large conjugated systems. The deconvolution of high-resolution spectra of O 1s (Table 3 and Figure S3) showed the presence of 3 different groups: carbonylic groups C = O (530.98 -532.00 eV), C-OH/C-O-C (532.65-533.36 eV), and carboxylic group COOH (535.47-535.87 eV). The main group was C-OH/C-O-C (58.4-64.2 %) except for Pd/HHT sample (28.52 %), where the most important moiety was C = O (53.3 %). Regarding Pd 3d high-resolution spectra, two oxidation states of Pd were found (Table 3 and Figure S4). The peak at 335.20-335.50 eV was assigned to Pd(0), while the one at 336.84-337.41 eV was ascribed to Pd(II). Pd(0)/Pd(II) ratio was calculated and Pd/G60 and Pd/HHT samples showed similar value (1.11 and 1.17, respectively). Pd/KB exhibited the lowest ratio (0.30), while Pd/Norit the highest one (1.41). TEM analyses were performed to evaluate the mean particle size diameter and size distribution (Fig. 2 ). In all the samples, the nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the supports. Pd/Norit and Pd/KB presented similar mean Pd particle size (2.5 and 2.7 nm, respectively). Pd/G60 and Pd/HHT, on the other hand, showed higher Pd nanoparticle mean diameters (3.5 and 3.9 nm, respectively). The particle size distribution is similar for the Pd/Norit, Pd/KB and Pd/G60 catalysts (in a 0.6 – 0.8 nm range), while slightly larger for the Pd/HHT (±1.2 nm). These differences in particle size cannot be attributed to the synthetic procedure, since the metal nanoparticles were synthesised with the same procedure. Weak interaction between the metal colloid and the support leads to particle agglomeration and coalescence. On the carbon surface, metal nanoparticles are anchored either on structural defects (such as edges and kinks in the graphitic planes or in the amorphous C sp3 structure) or on heteroatomic functional groups (such as oxygen functionalities). Although the quantification of structural defects is not trivial, an indication of the metal-support strength can be inferred by the amount of oxygen species from XPS analysis. As expected, larger nanoparticles were obtained with low functionalised carbons (HHT and G60), while smaller nanoparticles were obtained with the highly functionalised supports (Norit and KB)."
8,Vanillin hydrodeoxygenation,"3.2 Vanillin hydrodeoxygenation The as characterised catalysts were tested and compared in the vanillin hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO). The reaction conditions chosen were 50 °C and 5 bar of H2, using isopropanol as a solvent (vanillin concentration of 0.3 mol L-1; Pd/vanillin molar ratio of 1/1000). In these reaction conditions, using a Pd-based catalyst, vanillin typically undergoes a first hydrogenation step, yielding vanillyl alcohol (Fig. 1). Vanillyl alcohol is then further converted to creosol through a hydrogenolysis step. Despite the use of a secondary alcohol as solvent, hydrogen transfer mechanism was avoided due to the low temperature at which the reactions were carried out. In order to confirm this, a reaction was carried out in absence of H2 (5 bar of N2) and no product formation was observed. Fig. 3 shows the reaction profile of vanillin HDO carried out using Pd/KB as a catalyst. Full conversion was achieved in less than 1 h. The reaction profile shows the features of a typical consecutive reaction, with vanillyl alcohol as the intermediate product. Interesting, an additional product was detected in the reaction mixture, namely vanillyl isopropyl ether. The ether is produced by reaction of vanillyl alcohol with a molecule of solvent (isopropanol) and it is consumed with time since it is in equilibrium with the alcohol (Fig. 1). The four synthesised catalysts showed different initial activity (calculated after 5 minutes of reaction) as shown in Table 4 (full reaction profiles in the Supporting Information). The activity of the Pd/KB and Pd/G60 were very similar (2816 h-1 and 2804 h-1, respectively) and almost three times as high compared to the Pd/Norit catalyst (initial activity of 971 h-1). Pd/HHT, on the other hand, showed the highest activity among the catalysts tested (3196 h-1). These activity values, however, are calculated considering the whole amount of Pd present in the reaction mixture (see Experimental section). Nevertheless, only the exposed Pd atoms actively take part in the catalysis. For this reason, the catalytic activity was compared using the normalised initial activity (ActivityNS), which is the catalytic activity normalised by the number of exposed Pd atoms (see Experimental section). This parameter thus allows the comparison of catalysts having different mean particle size. The newly calculated ActivityNS values showed a similar trend, with Pd/Norit and Pd/HHT being the least and the most active catalysts (2163 h-1 and 10355 h-1, respectively). On the other hand, a clear distinction between the Pd/KB and Pd/G60 catalysts in terms of activity is now visible (6677 h-1 and 8269 h-1, respectively). The rate of conversion of vanillin is therefore dependent not only on the particle size, but also on other features of the catalysts. The ActivityNS values obtained could not be correlated with the Pd exposure calculated by XPS. Despite being the catalyst with lower Pd exposure, in fact, the Pd/HHT catalyst showed the highest activity. This indicates that most of the nanoparticles are easily accessible to the substrate in the reaction conditions studied. Also the Pd oxidation state does not seem to be correlated to the overall catalytic activity. This, however, is not unexpected, since it is known that Pd oxidation state can change in-situ in the reaction conditions used [45]. Plotting the ActivityNS values versus the degree of graphitisation of the support (expressed by the amount of C-C sp2–hybridised carbon obtained by XPS analysis, more information in the Supporting Information), for example, a linear correlation can be noticed (Fig. 4 ). In particular, the rate of conversion of vanillin increases with increasing degree of graphitisation. These results can be explained by the strong interaction between the graphitic plane of the support and the aromatic ring of the substrate that allows a better interaction with the active metal nanoparticles. It has been in fact previously reported that the substrate is weakly adsorbed on the catalyst sites for a similar vanillin-Ru/C system [19]. At the same time, a linear correlation can be found also plotting the ActivityNS versus the concentration of oxygen functionalities of the support (expressed by the O/C molar ratio obtained by XPS analysis, Fig. 5 ). Also in this case, the responsible for the change in activity is the support-substrate interaction; an increase of the oxygen functionalities, in fact, disrupts the graphitic plane structure of the support. The activity in the vanillin hydrogenation reaction therefore decreases with an increase in oxygen content at the carbon surface. Similar results were recently obtained in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [36,46]. The selectivity is affected by the type of carbonaceous material used as well (Table 4 and Figure S5-7). Despite a previous report showing mass loss up to 30 % with a similar Pd/C catalyst [27], the sum of reactant and products masses from GC analysis was always close to 100 %; therefore no mass loss was observed across the range of conversion studied. Comparing the selectivity at 50 % conversion, high amount of vanillyl alcohol was produced with Pd/Norit (80 % of selectivity), despite this catalyst being the least active of the series. High selectivity towards the alcohol was reached also by the Pd/HHT and Pd/KB catalysts (82 % and 73 %, respectively), while only 56 % of vanillin was converted into vanillyl alcohol by the Pd/G60. The latter catalyst was the only one producing significant amount of vanillyl isopropyl ether (23 %). Although a comprehensive correlation between the selectivity towards the various products with the support’s features is not clear from the gathered data, the ether formation can be associated with the amount of carboxylic functionalities on the support (COOH groups, see Supporting Information for the calculation). As expected, in fact, decreasing the acidic functionality of the support, the alcohol-ether equilibrium shifts towards vanillyl alcohol (Fig. 6 ). Once the reaction reaches completion, the only product detected was in all the cases creosol (Fig. 3 and S8-10, selectivity > 99.5 %). This result puts these materials among the most active and selective catalysts reported in literature (Table 5 ), especially considering the mild reaction conditions at which the reactions were conducted (50 °C, 5 bar H2 and metal/substrate of 1/1000 mol/mol). Recycling tests were performed on the most active catalyst: Pd/HHT (Fig. 7 ). As described in the Experimental Section, after every reaction the reaction mixture was filtrated and the catalyst reused as is without any washing step. After 5 consecutive reactions, the conversion did not decrease significantly, confirming the high stability of the catalyst. Similarly, the selectivity to vanillyl alcohol remained nearly constant, varying in a 73 - 76 % range."
9,Conclusion,"Four different carbonaceous materials (three activated carbons – Norit, KB and G60 – and a carbon nanofiber – HHT) were effectively used as support for Pd nanoparticles and employed in the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin. The activity was correlated to the graphitisation order and the concentration of oxygen functionalities of the support. In particular, increasing the graphitisation order the activity increased due to a strong interaction between the graphitic plane of the support and the aromatic ring of the substrate, that allows a better interaction with the active metal nanoparticles. Similarly, the presence of oxygen functionalities on the support surface disrupts the graphitic plane structure of the support and therefore decreases the reaction rate. Full conversion to creosol was obtained with all the catalysts in short reaction times (Pd/G60, creosol yield > 99.5 %) and in mild reaction conditions. The support, however, affected the selectivity at lower conversion. At 50 % of conversion, in fact, vanillyl alcohol was the main product of Pd/Norit, Pd/HHT and Pd/KB (selectivity in the 73 – 82 % range), while Pd/G60 produced high amount of both vanillyl isopropyl ether and creosol (23 and 21 % respectively). The formation of ether was correlated to the amount of carboxylic functionalities on the support (COOH groups), with high quantity of ether produced with supports containing high number of carboxylic groups. Finally, the Pd/HHT catalyst showed good stability upon recycling, maintaining both activity and selectivity for 5 consecutive reactions."
