0,Introduction,"Global climate change and environmental pollution due to the abuse of fossil fuels as well as those shortfall make it important to search for alternative energy sources that are cost-effective, environmentally-friendly and renewable. Hydrogen (H2) satisfies the above requirements because it has a higher energy yield (122kJg−1) by 2.75 times than hydrocarbon fuels and produces only water, not carbon combined end-products, when it is combusted as a fuel or converted to electricity. Among various hydrogen production processes, biological methods are known to be less energy intensive than chemical or electrochemical ones since they are carried out at ambient temperature and pressure (Cheong and Hansen, 2007; Elam et al., 2003). Dark fermentation of organic compounds might be the most feasible one since the rates of hydrogen production and microbial growth were higher than those of photo fermentation and bio-photolysis (Levin et al., 2004). The anaerobes responsible for fermentative hydrogen production can produce hydrogen all day long without light and can use various kinds of substrates such as refuse and food waste products. Until recently, clostridia and enteric bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum and Enterobacter aerogenes have been known to be strong and efficient producers of hydrogen (Nath and Das, 2004; Tanisho et al., 1987). Saccharolytic clostridia represent one of the largest genera of prokaryotes and satisfy the following four criteria: a) able to form endospores; b) must rely on the energy metabolism of obligate anaerobes; c) unable to carry out a dissimilatory sulfate reduction; and d) the cell wall must be gram-positive (Balow et al., 1992). In this work, a hydrogen-producing anaerobe was isolated from a food waste treatment process and designated as Clostridium tyrobutyricum JM1. C. tyrobutyricum, one of the saccharolytic clostridia, is a low G+C gram-positive anaerobe and exhibits special metabolic routes to produce short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen from carbohydrates and amino acids (Balow et al., 1992; Dürre, 2005). To improve the efficiency of substrate utilization and hydrogen productivity, the isolate was immobilized in a packed-bed reactor using polyurethane foam as support media. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the pure C. tyrobutyricum-immobilized bioreactor system for continuous hydrogen production (Table 1 ), unlike the immobilizations of facultative anaerobes such as E. aerogenes and E. cloacae (Kumar and Das, 2001; Palazzi et al., 2002; Yokoi et al., 1997). Hydrogen production rate, hydrogen content in biogas, soluble metabolites compositions, and hydrogen yield were investigated to identify for the proper HRT condition for continuous hydrogen production by the isolate."
1,Methods,
2,Isolation of H2-producing anaerobe from a food waste treating reactor,"2.1 Isolation of H2-producing anaerobe from a food waste treating reactor The bacterium used in this study, C. tyrobutyricum JM1, was isolated from effluent of a food waste treating reactor in our laboratory (Jo et al., 2007). The strain was stored at −80°C in sterile 20% (v/v) glycerol solution."
3,Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and determination of 16S rRNA gene sequence,"2.2 Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and determination of 16S rRNA gene sequence To isolate anaerobes responsible for hydrogen production, serial dilutions of the broth from the food waste treating reactor were plated and cultivated on RCM (Reinforced Clostridial Medium, Merck) plates in the Gas-Pak anaerobic cultivation jar (BBL, UK) at 35°C. The RCM was composed of the following materials (gl−1): meat extract, 10.0; peptone, 5.0; yeast extract, 3.0; d(+) glucose 5.0; starch, 1.0; sodium chloride, 5.0; sodium acetate, 3.0; and l-cysteinium chloride, 0.5. The agar plates were prepared by adding 1.5% (w/v) agar to the RCM broth. Single colonies obtained on RCM agar plates were re-streaked three times to ensure the purity of the strains. After 48h of incubation, the colonies were appeared on the plates and the 16S rRNA genes of the microorganisms were amplified by a following colony PCR method. In a 500μl tube containing 100μl of 5% Chelax 100 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), the cells were inoculated with the tip of a sterile platinum inoculating needle. After thirty-one colonies on RCM agar plates were denatured for 5min above 95°C, the samples were centrifuged for 3min at 12,000rpm. The supernatant was used as a template for PCR. The PCR was performed using universal primers 27F and 1492R as follows: 94°C for 5min; 32 cycles consisting of 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1min followed by 72°C for 10min. For ARDRA, the 7.3μl of resulting amplicons were double-digested with both HaeIII and HhaI by adding 1.2μl Reaction II Buffer and each 0.5μl restriction endonuclease to 12μl PCR reaction and then incubated at 37°C for 5h. ARDRA patterns were analyzed on 2.5% MetaPhore agarose (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) gels with a 100-bp ladder (Promega) as marker. The patterns were determined using BIORAD Diversity Database 1.0 software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Colonies containing ARDRA patterns of interest were selected and amplified by PCR with the primers 27F and 1492R. The amplicons were purified and sequenced. In addition, the isolates were checked for their ability to grow in RCM broth."
4,Phylogenetic analysis,2.3 Phylogenetic analysis The sequence was compared with type strains available in GenBank and Ribosomal Database Project II. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining methods. Multiple sequence alignments and construction of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree were carried out with CLUSTAL W and PHYLIP software packages.
5,Set-up and operation of a fixed-bed bioreactor with polyurethane foam matrix,"2.4 Set-up and operation of a fixed-bed bioreactor with polyurethane foam matrix A cylindrical acryl column reactor (diameter 7.0cm×height 65cm) with a working volume of 2.5l was used for the continuous culture. Fresh medium was supplied from the bottom by a peristaltic pump, and evolved gas and effluent liquid were discharged from the top of the reactor. The effluent of the bioreactor was introduced into a gas-liquid separator. The cells were inoculated from a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR, working volume: 3l) which was operated for 48h at 37°C with shaking at 150rpm for high density of the cells using RCM mentioned above. In a column reactor, C. tyrobutyricum was then cultivated at 37°C using a circulated water bath connected to the jacket of the reactor with no pH control and the gas phase in the column reactor was replaced with N2 gas for 30min to maintain anaerobiosis at the beginning of the culture. After 24h of incubation in batch culture with recycling to increase the cell density in the fixed bed to a stable level, continuous cultivation was initiated by feeding sterilized medium at HRT of 24, 18, 12, 9.5, 4, 3, 2 and 1h sequentially without recycling system. HRT was changed from 24h to 1h after a stable operation (steady-state condition) was reached. During the cultivation, the pH and soluble metabolites (volatile fatty acids and alcohols) in the effluent were monitored as a function of time. The fixed-bed column was packed with synthetic polymer, polyurethane foam (Golden Co. Ltd., Korea) with 96–97% high void fraction. The density of the support was 22.6g matrix l−1 of the reactor, and 1cm3-cubes of polyurethane foam (800ea.) were packed inside the cylindrical reactor following sterilization. The amount of immobilized cells was calculated by measuring the difference in dry weights between the biomass-associated matrix and the matrix alone (Chang et al., 2002). The biomass content on the immobilized support was in range of ca. 0.41–1.23kg VSS (kg matrix)−1. The initial pH of the medium (RCM) was controlled at 6.7, which was found to be favorable for hydrogen production, and modified by adding a phosphate buffer solution containing 2.3gl−1 of potassium phosphate dibasic and 0.7gl−1 of potassium phosphate monobasic (Lay, 2000)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The percentage of hydrogen gas was analyzed by a gas chromatography (model 6890N, Agilent Inc.), as previously described (Jo et al., 2006). Total volume of evolved gases was measured by a water displacement method. The concentration of effluent metabolites such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols and glucose was measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC 1100 series, Agilent Inc.). RID (Refractive Index Detector) and Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used as a detector and an organic acid analysis column, respectively. The column was operated at 40°C with 8mN H2SO4 as the carrier liquid at a flow rate of 0.6mlmin−1."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of hydrogen producing anaerobes,"3.1 Characterization of hydrogen producing anaerobes To identify hydrogen producing anaerobes, dominant ones were isolated from the food waste treating process. The 16S rRNA gene fragments were extracted from 30 isolates and its restriction patterns were compared with each other. As shown in Fig. 1 , sixteen unique types were distinguished by ARDRA analysis. The number of ARDRA patterns and the number of isolates within each ARDRA pattern potentially suggest the abundance and diversity of the microbial community. The nearly full-length sequences of 16S rRNA genes (∼1.5kb) were determined to characterize the 16 isolates. The determined sequences were compared with database sequences by the BLAST search and a phylogenetic tree was constructed to show the relationship between microorganisms deduced from the sequence determined and reference strains (Fig. 2 ). These isolates fell into two divisions. Identified three Clostridium species were related to hydrogen producing bacteria (HPB) such as C. tyrobutyricum, C. leptum, C. acetobutylicum, and C. sporosphaeroides. On the other hand, the identified 13 species were grouped into the Lactobacillus genera containing various kinds of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The microorganisms are known to be responsible for the kimchi fermentation (Lee et al., 2006). The shifts in microbial community structure when the deterioration of hydrogen production occurred were investigated through microbial population dynamic aspects (Jo et al., 2007). The fingerprint analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) elucidated that unstable operation of the anaerobic reactor were well coincident with the change in the microbial community from H2-producing Clostridium spp. to lactic acid producing Lactobacillus spp. (Jo et al., 2007). Therefore, three strains capable of producing hydrogen were isolated from a food waste treatment reactor under anaerobic conditions. Morphological examination by a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i) showed that the isolates were in rod-shape (data not shown). Among them, Clostridium sp. with the highest similarity (100%) to C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 (NCBI accession No. M59113) was selected for further hydrogen fermentation studies and designated as C. tyrobutyricum JM1."
9,Effects of HRT on the rate and yield of hydrogen production,"3.2 Effects of HRT on the rate and yield of hydrogen production Most studies of biological hydrogen production were conducted using continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under complete mixing conditions. However, this bioreactor system is not proper to maintain high concentration of cells due to their washout at low HRTs. To maintain high levels of cells, a packed-bed reactor was applied. The volumetric H2 production rate and H2 yield were used as major performance indexes of H2 production and the effects of HRT on them were investigated. HRT had a significant influence on hydrogen production by C. tyrobutyricum JM1, hydrogen production rate and hydrogen content in biogas (Fig. 3 ). In the range of 24–9.5h HRT, the hydrogen content in biogas was almost at constant value of 42.6%. However, the hydrogen content increased slowly upto 50.0% at 2h HRT, and then decreased to 39.9% at 1h HRT. At all HRTs, the biogas primarily consisted of CO2 and H2, but CH4 was not detected. As HRT was decreased from 24 to 2h, the hydrogen production rate significantly increased. The volumetric H2 production rate at 2h HRT was 6.8–7.0 times higher than that at 24h HRT. The maximum hydrogen production rate at steady state conditions was obtained as 7.2l H2 l−1 d−1 at 2h HRT, where substrate utilization efficiency was 97.4% (Table 1). Glucose degradation efficiency decreased sharply from ca. 100% to 41.0% at 1h HRT (not shown in Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows metabolites compositions in the effluent of the immobilized bioreactor at various HRTs. The major metabolic product was butyrate (∼80%, 4158.0±9.6mg l−1) above 2h HRT. However, the proportion of butyrate suddenly decreased to 1.13% (128.3±11.8mgl−1) at 1h HRT with an abrupt accumulation of lactate. In the presence of acetate, lactate can be fermented to butyrate, CO2, and H2 by C. tyrobutyricum (Balow et al., 1992). The subsequent conversion of lactate to butyrate is energetically favorable as the following equations: ΔG0, kJmol−1 Lactate+0.4Acetate+0.7H+ →0.7Butyrate + 0.6H2 +CO2 +0.4H2O −183.9 Lactate+Acetate+H+ →Butyrate+0.8H2 +1.4CO2 +0.6H2O −59.4 2Lactate+H+ →Butyrate+2H2 +2CO2 −64.1 It is well known that a number of microorganisms such as C. acetobutylicum and Butyribacterium methylotrophicum as well as C. tyrobutyricum are related to above reactions (Hashsham et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 4, butyrate was dominant in the range of 2–24h HRT, but lactate and acetate instead of butyrate were dominant at 1h HRT. At high organic loading rate (1h HRT), the reaction time was not enough for conversion of lactate and acetate to butyrate and H2. It was also supported by a sharp decrease of pH from 5.5 (2h HRT) to 4.6 (1h HRT) due to no reduction of protons to hydrogen gas. It is known that acetate production was inhibited by butyrate at pH 6 and higher (Zhu and Yang, 2004). However, acetate production continued with butyrate formation at pH 5.7 and lower and lactate and acetate became the major fermentation products instead of butyrate when the pH was further dropped to 5.0 (Zhu and Yang, 2004). Therefore, the high concentration of lactate (6887±101.9mgl−1) in the effluent might be considered as an indicator of inefficient bioconversion and the operation at short HRTs (<1h) appeared to be undesirable for hydrogen production by C. tyrobutyricum. In addition, the maximum hydrogen yield was 223ml (g-hexose)−1 on the basis of glucose concentration of 5g l−1 as a composition of RCM. The value was higher than those of other researches using various packed-bed bioreactor systems, in which biomass are either immobilized in granules or entrapped in packed media (Table 2 ). Meanwhile, cell washout was not observed even at 1h HRT in this study. This means that the immobilized bioreactor system was very stable in maintaining high concentration of the cells."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen producing anaerobe, C. tyrobutyricum JM1, was isolated from a food waste treatment process and immobilized in a packed-bed reactor using polyurethane foam as support media. The HRT condition for maximum hydrogen production rate in this system was 2h, where the main metabolite was butyrate with low level of lactate concentration (943.9±43.8mgl−1). Hydrogen yield of 223ml (g-hexose)−1 was also higher than those of other previous results reported. Therefore, the immobilized system was an effective and stable approach for continuous hydrogen production for efficient utilization of carbon substrates with good hydrogen-producing performance."
