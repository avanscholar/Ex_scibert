0,Introduction,"Today, sustainable biomass resource used to replace traditional fossil energy has been extensively studied to reduce environmental pollution and prevent energy exhausted. Xylose-derived furfural (FAL) and FAL derivatives have important applications in many aspects, such as transportation fuels, gasoline additives, lubricants, and intermediates in pharmaceutical, chemical, and biopolymer synthesis (Eseyin and Steele, 2015; Peleteiro et al., 2016). Therefore, FAL has a bright future as a new renewable platform chemical. Another bio-based product, furfuryl alcohol (FOL), also has wide application prospects, such as highly qualitative rocket fuels, refractory composite materials, sealants, furan resins, and ascorbic acid (Iroegbu and Hlangothi, 2019). And it is also known that FOL can be obtained from the reduction of FAL by the whole cell-catalyzed biological reduction, avoiding the high energy consumption of chemical methods (He et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2018). The production of FAL and FOL from lignocellulose has attracted the interest of researchers. In recent years, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted widespread attention because of its similar properties to ionic liquids and the advantages of cost-effective, non-hazardous, environmentally friendly, and recycling (Vigier et al., 2015). DESs are transparent homogeneous solutions formed by combining hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) at a moderate temperature (<100 °C) under agitation (Mbous et al., 2017). The formation of a deep eutectic mixture is caused by the destruction of the crystal structure of the individual components component, and this reduces the lattice energy and results in the formation of a liquid at room temperature (Liu et al., 2015; Müller et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2014). Moreover, DESs have been used in the pretreatment process of lignocellulose, and have been studied in the application of delignification, hydrolysis of hemicellulose, and preparation of FAL (Chen et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2019). And in emerging DESs applications, it has been envisaged as a solvent for biocatalytic reactions, and some studies have successfully used DESs for enzyme catalysis and whole-cell catalysis (Maugeri and Domínguez de María, 2014; Müller et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017). However, the combination of biomass pretreatment and whole-cell catalysis mediated by eutectic solvents has not been reported. As one of the most important agricultural residues, corncobs are considered as raw materials with great potential for the production of high value-added bio-based chemicals and biofuels (Li et al., 2014). What's more, corncob is rich in 30–36% cellulose and 30–40% hemicellulose, and the xylan component in hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed to xylose first, and then to FAL. In addition, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to obtain glucose-rich enzymatic hydrolysis hydrolysate, which could provide NADH for furfural reduction (He et al., 2017). Finally, to high effectively utilize the carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) of corncob, it's of great interest to using the one-pot method to convert the xylan in corncob to FOL and the corncob derived glucose as an auxiliary substrate (He et al., 2016). In our previous researches, the screened Bacillus coagulans NL01 could utilize the glucose to produce the lactic acid and reduce FAL to FOL in the biphasic system (Bu et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2016; Ouyang et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2018). Therefore, the two-phase system of DES and the organic solvent was used as a medium for conversion of corncob to FAL, and the pretreated corncob residue could be saccharified to be used as a co-substrate for B. coagulans NL01 whole-cell catalytic reduction of FAL to FOL. However, the used DESs could continue to be reused for the next round of FAL production, thereby achieving the reuse of the DESs and full utilization of biomass under this system (shown in Fig. 1 ). Therefore, this process realized the full use of biomass and recycled catalysts in the production process from corncob to FOL in the DESs, which had the advantages of low toxicity, low pollution, and high economic benefits."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and materials,"2.1 Strains and materials B. coagulans NL01 (CCTCC No: M 2011468) was used in this study (Ouyang et al., 2013). FAL (99%), FOL (99%), and FA (furoic acid) (99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chemicals used in microbiological culture media were purchased from Sinochem or Fluka Chemical. Corn steep liquor was purchased from Shandong Kangyuan Biotechnology Co. (He ze, China). Corncob used in this study was from a farm in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, China. The corncob was grounded into particles with a size of 40–60 mesh, and then oven-dried at 55 °C to constant weight to use in the next catalysis process."
3,Preparation of cells and the DESs,"2.2 Preparation of cells and the DESs B. coagulans NL01 was pre-cultivated at 50 °C and 150 rpm for 12 h under aerobic conditions. The medium contained the following (in grams per liter): glucose 20; yeast extract 2; corn steep 2.5; NH4Cl 1; MgSO4 0.2; and CaCO3 10. After preculture, 10% seed culture was inoculated to the fresh medium at 50 °C and 150 rpm for 12 h, then, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 3 min) and washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.0). Choline chloride (ChCl) and malonate/succinic acid/lactic acid/malic acid/citric acid/oxalic acid were added to a 100 mL round bottom flask, the molar ratio of ChCl to each organic acid is 1:1, then heated and stirred at 80 °C to a transparent liquid."
4,Production of FAL with xylose as substrate,"2.3 Production of FAL with xylose as substrate 0.05 g AlCl3·6H2O, 1 g ChCl, and the equimolar amount of organic acid were added to the 100 mL round bottom flask, then heated and stirred at 80 °C until it turned to a transparent liquid. 0.25 g xylose and 10 mL dioctyl phthalate (DOP) were added into the flask, the reaction was placed in an oil bath with magnetic stirring that had been preheated, and reacted at 100 °C for 30 min. After the end of the reaction, the reaction was quickly stopped by an ice bath, and then the sample was analyzed."
5,Production of FAL with corncob as substrate,"2.4 Production of FAL with corncob as substrate 4.5 g ChCl-oxalic acid (OA) with the molar ratio of 1:1, was added into the round bottom flask, and it was stirred to form a transparent liquid. Then 0.5 g corncob (10% solid content), 10 mL DOP, AlCl3·6H2O and 1 wt% H2SO4 were added to the round bottom flask. The mass ratio of AlCl3·6H2O to the corncob was 0.1:1. The mixtures reacted at 120 °C for 30 min, and the sample was analyzed by HPLC. Based on this experiment, the effects of different organic acids, corncob solid loading, metal chloride, metal chloride amount, and water content on the yield of FAL were investigated, and only one factor was changed at a time. The amplification experiment was to prepare FAL with different quantity corncobs (0.1 g-3.0 g) under the above optimal conditions."
6,Enzymatic hydrolysis and production of FOL by B. coagulans NL01,"2.5 Enzymatic hydrolysis and production of FOL by B. coagulans NL01 0.2 g solid residue (calculated by the absolute dry cellulose) from corncob pretreated with DESs was added to a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 40 IU/g of cellulase (calculated by the absolute dry cellulose) was added to the enzymatic hydrolysis system and citrate buffer (pH 4.5, 0.1 M) was used to make up the volume to 10 mL, then the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction lasted for 48 h at 50 °C, 150 rpm. After shaking the system for 1 h at 50 °C, 100 rpm, 1.0 g wet cells were added to react for 9 h, samples were taken from the aqueous and organic phases for analysis."
7,Analysis methods,"2.6 Analysis methods The turbidity of cells was measured at 600 nm (OD600) by UV–visible spectrophotometer (Spectrum Lab 752 s, Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co. Ltd Shanghai, China). FAL and FOL concentrations were analyzed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) by using a reversed-phase HPLC (Agilent 1260 system) equipped with a DAD detector set at 220 nm. The column was set at 25 °C and the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (Yan et al., 2018). Sugar and lactic acid concentrations were measured by an Agilent HPLC 1200 series equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm) and a refractive index detector. The analysis was performed with a mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 55 °C (Ouyang et al., 2013). The determination of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin components was based on NREL (Sluiter et al., 2008). The yield of FAL is defined as the follow formula: Yield of FAL xylose as the substrate = FAL produced mM initial xylose mM × 100 % Yield of FAL corncob as the substrate = FAL produced mM xylose mM in xylan × 100 % 0.88 was used for the molar conversion between the xylan and xylose in corncob. The yield of FOL with corncob as substrate is defined as the follow formula: Yield of FOL = FOL produced mM initial xylose mM × 100 % The conversion of FAL, selectivity to FOL was calculated during the whole-cell catalysis according to the following equation: Conversion % of FAL to FOL = consumed FAL mM in simple initial of FAL mM × 100 % Selectivity % of FOL = prodced FOL mM consumed FAL mM × 100 %"
8,Result and discussion,
9,Selection of the DES type to produce FAL with xylose as the substrate,"3.1 Selection of the DES type to produce FAL with xylose as the substrate In biomass pretreatment, the xylan in hemicellulose was the main component of converting FAL after hydrolysis (Takagaki et al., 2010), xylose could be the most suitable substrate for the preliminary experiment of FAL production in the DESs. 6 organic acids (malonic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid) were chosen to form different DESs systems with ChCl to produce FAL, and DOP became the organic phase to extract FAL. Then this biphasic system was used for the FAL production from xylose and the results were as shown in Table 1 , it was reported that the pK a of the carboxylic acid in the DESs was approximately the same as the pK a in water, and the acidity of carboxylic acid would affect the yield of FAL (Abbott et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). Wherein, the FAL yield mediated by oxalic acid was the highest at 33%, it was speculated that this due to the lowest pK a and the shortest carbon skeleton chain of the oxalic acid. As the carbon chain of the carboxylic acid increased, the acidity of the carboxylic acid decreased, resulting in a decrease in the FAL yield, such as the pK a of succinic acid was 4.21, the yield of FAL was 9.5%. However, the increase of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the carbon chain would reduce the pK a of carboxylic acid and increase the FAL yield, such as the pK a of succinic acid and malic acid was 4.21 and 3.46, and the yield of FAL was 9.5% and 13.0%, respectively. Although malonic acid also exhibited relatively strong acidity, the FAL yield was only 2.0%. This might due to the weight loss of ChCl-malonic acid at 120 °C (Skulcova et al., 2017), resulting in a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration and the hydrogen bonding interaction of this DES, causing the decrease in the FAL yield."
10,Production of FAL with acidified DESs using corncob as substrate,"3.2 Production of FAL with acidified DESs using corncob as substrate In the previous research, it was achieved that xylose was converted into FAL by bio-catalysis in the DESs. However, xylose mainly exists in hemicellulose in biomass while the composition of biomass is complex, the xylan in the hemicellulose is first converted to the five-carbon monosaccharide, which could be hydrolyzed to FAL, and the FAL yield is generally low (Oh et al., 2013; Takagaki et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2017). However, corncob was considered to be the most effective raw material for FAL production, 1 g corncob could produce 0.22 g FAL theoretically (Montané et al., 2002). The composition of corncobs was relatively complex, the additional H2SO4 was added in the ChCl-OA system to help to achieve a high conversion of corncob to FAL (Morais et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 2 , when using hydrothermal treatment of the corncob, the FAL yield was only 0.48%, and the concentrations of xylose and glucose were only 1.26 g/L and 0.39 g/L, respectively, indicating that the hydrothermal method couldn’t satisfy the hydrolysis of xylan in corncob to FAL. When 42% oxalic acid or 1 wt% H2SO4 was added as a reaction catalyst, a large amount of xylose would be produced, but oxalic acid as a reaction medium, FAL yield was higher than 1 wt% H2SO4 as a reaction medium. This indicated that the addition of acid was beneficial to the production of xylose, but the production efficiency of converting xylose into FAL was still low. However, the FAL yield reached 39% when ChCl-OA as the reaction catalyst, and after adding 1 wt% H2SO4, the FAL yield could be further increased to 44.5%, which increased the yield of FAL by 14%. This proved that this scheme combining the ChCl-OA system and H2SO4 could produce FAL in the maximum yield. He et al. (2017) reported that corncob was used as the raw material to produce FAL by the “two-step process”, firstly, the corncob was converted to the hydrolysis solution rich in xylose using oxalic acid as a medium at 140 °C for 40 min, then used SO4 2−/SnO2-kaoline as the catalyst to produce FAL at 170 °C in the toluene-water system. Lee et al. (2019) used oil palm leaves as raw materials to produce FAL in one step, using ChCl-OA as the reaction system at 100 °C for 135 min, but the yield of FAL was only 26.3%. This article was the first time that using acid ChCl-OA/DOP as a two-phase reaction system for the production of FAL in a “one-step process” from corncobs, which had the advantages of high FAL yield, mild reaction and short reaction time."
11,Optimization of FAL production conditions in DES/DOP system,"3.3 Optimization of FAL production conditions in DES/DOP system The proper corncob solid loading could improve production efficiency and reduce energy consumption and production costs. The effect of different solid loadings on FAL yield was investigated (shown in Fig. 3 a). The yield of FAL was about 25% when the solid loading was 5%, the yield of FAL rose as the solid loading increased, while the solid loading was 20%, the yield of FAL reached 43.1%, while as the solid loading continued to increase, the increase in FAL yield was not obvious. This might be the lower solid loading helped the conversion of lignocellulose into usable sugars, and the higher solid loading would cause some fermentation inhibitors formed, especially acetic acid, FAL, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (Chen et al., 2009; Vertès et al., 2010). Therefore, the 20% corncob solid loading used in this experiment was suitable for FAL production from corncob. The addition of metal chlorides in DESs would form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with other compounds, which was conducive to the hydrolysis of xylan and xylose to produce FAL (Wang et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014). And the reaction temperature had a great influence on the reaction rate, while the excessively high temperature would also cause side reactions, which would reduce the FAL production (Pińkowska et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015). The effect of the different metal chlorides and temperatures were investigated in Fig. 3b. The yield of FAL was generally low on the whole at 100 °C, however, the FAL yield of the reaction with AlCl3·6H2O reached the highest, at 16.0%. The yield of FAL generally increased when the temperature increased to 120 °C, and the addition of AlCl3·6H2O still showed a certain promotion effect, finally, the FAL yield reached a maximum of 45.2% and AlCl3·6H2O had a better catalytic effect than the FeCl3·6H2O. However, when the temperature exceeded 140 °C, the yield of FAL gradually decreased. It was speculated that FAL would undergo side reactions with other components in lignocellulose at extremely high temperatures (Lee et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017). For example, FAL would interact with the proteins contained in lignocellulose or other lignin phenolic compounds, thereby making FAL yield drop (Peterson et al., 2010; Pińkowska et al., 2011; Ryu et al., 2010). Therefore, AlCl3·6H2O was used to catalyze the production of FAL from corncobs at a low temperature of 120 °C. The amount of AlCl3·6H2O added would also affect the reaction rate and the FAL yield. We fixed the quantity of corncob at 0.5 g, adjusted the mass ratio of AlCl3·6H2O to corncob, and investigated the reaction process. The FAL yield reached a maximum of 38.6% when the reaction was 15 min while the mass ratio of AlCl3·6H2O to corncob was 0.5. When the reaction was 30 min, the mass ratio of AlCl3·6H2O to corncob was 0.1, the FAL yield reached a maximum of 40.0% (shown in Fig. 3c). This showed that the time when the FAL yield reached the maximum value would be shortened with the increase of the amount of AlCl3·6H2O. When the maximum value was reached, continuing to increase the catalyst dosage or prolonging the reaction time would also cause the FAL yield to fall. This might too much AlCl3·6H2O would accelerate the reaction of corncob to FAL, and also accelerated the side reaction, resulting in a decrease in FAL yield (Wang et al., 2017). Finally, the optimal reaction conditions for the mass ratio of AlCl3·6H2O to corncob was 0.1. The presence of some water in the DESs might promote the production of FAL or 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (Galkin et al., 2016). When the water content was less than 30%, the increase of water content had no significant effect on the yield of FAL, but the content of residual xylose would increase. When the water content exceeded 30%, the yield of FAL decreased, indicating the addition of extra water had little effect on the preparation of FAL. A scale-up experiment was conducted under the above optimal conditions and selected corncobs mass was from 0.1 g to 3 g. The results showed that when the corncob was 0.5 g, the FAL yield was the largest at 42.4%. As the reaction system increased, the FAL production continued to increase, but the yield was gradually decreasing. This might be the side reaction caused by the interaction of FAL with other substances in the biomass as the added corncob increased, resulting in a decrease in FAL yield. The reuse of the catalytic system can reduce the economic burden and environmental pollution, and has a high application potential (Chen et al., 2018; Zhang and Yu, 2013). After the first round of reaction, we replaced the organic phase containing FAL, added new corncob, and proceed to the next round of FAL production reaction. After the first round, the FAL yield in the organic phase was 26.1% and while the two rounds of reaction were over, the FAL yield in the organic phase increased to 36.3% (shown in Fig. 3d). This might be the FAL remaining in the DES phase of the first two rounds was extracted into the organic phase. However, after the third round of reaction, the volume of the DESs phase was too small to continue the next round of reaction due to the water absorption of the corncob residue. Therefore, this experiment showed that DES still had a high catalytic activity after repeated recycling three times."
12,Production of FOL process by using DES/DOP system with corncob as raw material,"3.4 Production of FOL process by using DES/DOP system with corncob as raw material There remained a lot of cellulose rich in the corncob treated with the ChCl-OA system. The residual cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the reaction solution were measured before and after the reaction, the content of hemicellulose was reduced from 36.8% to 2.76%, and the content of cellulose was almost unchanged (shown in Table 2 ). Therefore, cellulase can be used to hydrolyze cellulose to produce monosaccharides that could be used by microorganisms. The enzymolysis solution contains glucose 14.73 g/L, xylose 1.18 g/L, and the enzymolysis yield is about 67%, the hydrolyzed glucose and xylose could be used as auxiliary substrates for the reduction of FAL by B. coagulans NL01. 0.5 g corncob was pretreated under the above optimized conditions to produce FAL under the DESs/DOP biphasic system. Afterward, the residue of corncob was enzymatically hydrolyzed and added with B. coagulans NL01 to reduce FAL to FOL. The final FAL conversion reached 100%, but the selectivity was only 78.6%, the final FOL production was 0.26 mmol (26 mM), the FOL yield of 20.7% was obtained and the glucose was completely consumed (shown in Fig. 4 ). This method finally achieved the full utilization of biomass from corncob to FOL production, which might have some inspiration and references for future FAL and FOL production."
13,Conclusion,"In this paper, the screened ChCl-OA/DOP catalytic system achieved a 33% yield of FAL when xylose as the reaction substrate. What’s more, using constructed acidified ChCl-OA/DOP as the biphasic catalytic system and corncob as the reaction substrate, FAL could be obtained in one step at 120 °C with a FAL yield of 46%. Besides, FAL was successfully reduced to FOL by using the saccharified corncob residue by B. coagulans NL01, and the final 20.7% FOL yield was obtained, realizing the high-value utilization of corncob and the recycling use of DESs phase."
