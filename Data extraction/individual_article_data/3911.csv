0,Introduction,"Considering methods relevant in hydrogen production, aqueous phase reforming (APR) and steam reforming (SR) are of primary interest. APR, being a low temperature alternative to SR has attracted a lot of attention over the last years. The technique can be briefly characterized as a method for hydrogen production at moderate temperatures [1]. Hydrogen produced via APR is expected to have low carbon monoxide (CO) content since APR occurs at temperatures and pressures favorable for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction [2]. APR can also be used for hydrocarbons production. Fuel produced in this way will be sulphur free and, thus it is directly applicable for fuel cells (FC) or, alternatively, can be utilized in catalytic on-board steam reforming [3]. In future, traditional cars will likely be gradually substituted by FC vehicles. During a transition period, pure hydrocarbons can still be used in conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) as well. It is interesting to point out the scope of APR implementations since the modernization of the existing infrastructure and vehicle park can, in principle, proceed in line with two alternative strategies: one is that the “cars should adapt to infrastructure” e.g. they should be able to operate on existing fuels by means of on-board fuel converters [4]. So-called mini-refinery under hood cannot be optimal in case of APR. Since the energy density stored in sugar alcohols is approximately 3 times lower compared to that of hydrocarbons [5], the weight of sugar alcohol together with APR reformer will land somewhere around 200 kg, compared to that of 50–60 kg in the case of a traditional tank containing hydrocarbon fuel. Therefore, it is clear that APR is a technology for stationary applications and bares conceptual resemblance to the second approach when the “infrastructure should be adopted” to new types of cars. Transition periods in techno-economical paradigms can require certain flexibility from industrial processes. Considering industrial possibilities, one cannot neglect the fact of already existing plants and production units: the capital-intensity of chemical industry will not allow for rapid and very significant changes of direction in free market economies. Bio-ethanol is produced in huge amounts and its production can be easily increased since the process itself is based on fermentation followed by distillation. To be able to estimate the feasibility of ethanol used as a renewable precursor in hydrogen generation, one should consider the plausible production routes from renewables to hydrogen. First of all, the range of renewables available is huge in its heterogeneity, ranging from oil plants to lignocellulosics: natural oils, straw, algae, wood, bark, forest residues and so forth represent some examples. Nevertheless, lignocellulosic woody biomass is the most relevant in the context of Nordic Countries. Wood consists of primarily lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed to C5 and C6 sugars, respectively. Lignin is a 3D linked polyphenolic polymer which transformations are outside of the scope of the present paper and, thus, we restrict ourselves to carbohydrates derived from cellulose and hemicellulose originating from wood. Potential routes of hydrogen production inspired by examples described in the literature are illustrated in Scheme 1 (Table 1 ). The main difference of APR and SR, considering the starting materials, is that, in the first case, one of the most promising approaches is to use polyols for hydrogen production. The presence of oxygen atoms bonded to each carbon atom renders the C–C bonds weaker; consequently, this allows for easier splitting of molecules to hydrogen and CO. The final product, CO, can be consequently transformed via the water gas shift reaction to CO2, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen will be produced. However, in the case of hydrocarbons, the energy contained in a C–C bond is higher and, hence, it is not possible to facilitate a C–C scission by means of an APR process [1]. Ethyl alcohol, (bio-ethanol) consisting of two carbon atoms with only one of them bonded to oxygen represents a boundary case. In this paper we are trying to resolve the problem of better biomass utilization. Two processes, such as steam reforming (SR) of bio-ethanol and aqueous phase reforming (APR) of sugars and sugar alcohols, are currently considered the most promising ones in terms of their technical and economical feasibility. Substances used as a starting material are different for these processes. However, in both cases the fuel production starts from the same naturally produced carbohydrates. In this sense, these methods can be considered as direct competitors for bio-fuel production in future. A comparison of the two alternative routes of hydrogen production proceeding either via ethanol or via sugar alcohols (Scheme 1) reveals that the ethanol route consists of 4 steps, two out of which, distillation and steam reforming, are energy demanding. Alternatively, the sugar alcohol route contains 3 steps with hydrogen generation taking place at a moderate temperature range of around 230 °C. Hence it is clear that bio-ethanol cannot be the optimum raw material and that APR is the method of choice for further investigations. Taking into account that APR can be used to produce hydrocarbons, it seems that the currently so popular ethanol production will perhaps not be a lucrative alternative in the future or can be produced in highly energy-integrated, stationary solutions. Even if bio-ethanol is not an optimal raw material for APR, it is a product of natural degradation of bio-renewable materials and can always be present in raw material streams – particularly in industrial ones stored in non-optimal conditions: in a biomass storage subject to some humidity and micro-organisms one will inevitably initiate relevant biological processes. Therefore, the influence of bio-ethanol on the catalytic materials and the products obtained via APR, in general, should be studied. Another reason for the present study is that since bio-ethanol is readily available, if needed there is always a possibility to use neat bio-ethanol or mixtures of it with other feeds. In the present study the effect of bio-ethanol on hydrogen production via the APR process was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts,"2.1 Catalysts 5 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was supplied by Sigma–Aldrich. The catalyst particle range of 125–250 μm was applied in all experiments. The catalyst was reduced in situ applying the following temperature program: 25–250 °C, at 5 °C/min, in hydrogen flow (99.9999%, AGA). The metal dispersion was determined by CO pulse-chemisorption method in an apparatus manufactured by Micromeritics Ltd. (Autochem 2900). The catalyst was reduced prior to the measurement with the following programme: 25–50 °C, at 10 °C/min in helium, dwell for 30 min, gas-switch to hydrogen, 5 °C/min to 250 °C and dwell for 2 h followed by flushing for 60 min in helium at 250 °C. Thereafter the catalyst was cooled to ambient temperature and CO-pulses were introduced utilizing 10 vol.% CO in helium. The stoichiometry 1:1 for Pt:CO was assumed. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalyst was performed in an AutoChem instrument (Micromeritics Ltd.) using the following temperature programme: 5 °C/min – 400 °C for Pt/Al2O3."
3,APR experiments,"2.2 APR experiments A stainless steel reactor (d = 4.2 mm) was loaded with 1 g of Pt/Al2O3 (125–250 μm) fraction mixed with 3 g of quartz sand. Catalyst reduction was done in situ with hydrogen. The catalyst bed was heated with heating rate of 5 °C/min to 250 °C facilitating the reduction of the catalyst for 2 h at this temperature. The APR studies were carried out at 225 °C. A water solution of the substrates was fed to the reactor with the feed rate of 0.1 ml/min. The internal pressure in the reactor was maintained at 29.3 bar, corresponding approx. 4 bar above the critical pressure of the water and the nitrogen flow rate was 30 ml/min. The nitrogen flow containing 1% of He was applied to enable quantitative calculations of the gaseous products. Aqueous solutions of sorbitol (99.5%, Fluka), bio-ethanol (99.5 wt.%, Altia Oy) and glycerol (87% water sol-n, p.a., Merck) were used in all experiments. Prior to each and every experiment, the reactor was pressurized, gas and liquid flows were set to the desired values and the heating was turned on (5 °C/min). Preliminary studies demonstrated that after altering the experimental conditions, a steady-state composition for the liquid and gas samples was achieved after approximately 240 min. The on-line GC analysis of the reaction products was performed by an Agilent 3000A Micro-GC setup. The device was equipped with four parallel GC channels, all with individual TCD detectors and four columns. The columns applied in the product mix separation were Plot U, OV-1, alumina and Molsieve. The volatile compounds were analyzed by means of GC–MS as well as by means of headspace solid phase micro extraction [13]. An aliquot of the solution (2 ml) containing the reaction products was transferred into a small (4 ml) flask equipped with a rubber cap and the sample flask was heated to 48 °C. A needle containing a sorption fiber was pushed through the cap into the bottle and the fiber was exposed to the headspace of the sample for 30 min. The fiber used for the extraction was coated with 2 cm–75 μm of carboxen/polymethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) and purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Also the holder used for the manual injection was supplied by Supelco. The components were enriched on the surface and, as the equilibrium was reached between the headspace and the fiber, a syringe containing the saturated fiber was inserted into the GC–MS for analysis. The temperature in the inlet chamber was set to 270 °C, at which temperature the absorbed and adsorbed analytes were thermally desorbed in the hot injector space of the gas chromatograph. The desorption time was 10 min ensuring a complete desorption of the analytes. Moreover, no memory effect was observed when the same fiber was used for the second time (or subsequent experiments). The GC–MS was equipped with a capillary column (DB-Petro 50 m × 0.2 mm × 0.5 μm). The following temperature program was used: dwell for 10 min at 30 °C, a temperature ramp of 0.9 °C/min to 75 °C followed by heating 1.1 °C/min to 125 °C, a temperature ramp of 10°°C/min to 200 °C and dwelling at 200 °C for 20 min. On the other hand, the liquid samples were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography (HPLC) (injection volume 2 μl, an Aminex HPX-87H column, eluent 5 mMol/l H2SO4, flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, 45 °C, run time of 70 min) coupled to a refractive index (RI) detector. The conversion of ethanol, glycerol and sorbitol, respectively, were calculated as follows: (1) C o n v e r s i o n = ( 1 − S u b s t P e a k A r e a I n i t i a l _ S u b s t P e a k A r e a ) × 100 %"
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalyst, 5%Pt/Al2O3, exhibited a metal dispersion of 23%, according to impulse CO-chemisoprtion and corresponded to an average metal particle size of around 5 nm. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was applied to determine the temperature at which the metal was reduced. A TPR profile is shown in Fig. 1 , displaying three maxima at 75 °C, 180 °C and 350 °C, respectively. The first two peaks can be assigned to the gradual reduction of Pt to metallic state, whereas the peak observed at higher temperatures could be attributed to the final, more complete reduction of Pt to metallic form. Also, some phase changes might take place both in the support material and in the Pt-phase [14]."
5,Results and discussion,"A series of experiments were applied to study the influence of bio-ethanol on hydrogen production via APR. The reactor setup was operated in a continuous, steady-state mode and different feed-solutions were introduced by means of an HPLC pump. After switch of the feed solution, a certain period was required to achieve a steady-state in terms of the liquid and gas phase samples. The reaction products were analyzed by means of HPLC, SPME-GC–MS and TOC for the liquid reaction products and GC–MS and Micro-GC for the gas phase products."
6,Total organic carbon,"3.1 Total organic carbon Due to the complex composition of the reaction mixture, TOC analysis was applied to estimate the amount of organics in the liquid phase. TOC analysis was also useful in monitoring the catalyst deactivation. The catalyst activity was evaluated by means of repetitive experiments, at standard conditions (0.1 ml/min 10% sorbitol feed, 225C, 29.3 bar). Due to consecutive nature of the reaction network, first leading to liquid and then to subsequent gaseous products, an increase in the product concentration in the liquid phase can serve as an indication of catalyst deactivation. Build up of organics in the effluent (Fig. 2 ) pinpoints an activity decline. It was found that during one prolonged cycle of experiments (ca. 60 h), the catalyst activity was decreasing linearly. The activity decrease over this period was in the range of 13%. The results of TOC from all experiments are presented in Table 2 . The concentration of carbon in gaseous species was calculated from the overall mass balance and TOC values. Moreover, the catalyst deactivation was accounted for as well. The main reason for the catalyst deactivation in case of large molecules such as sorbitol is coke formation. Time-on-stream behaviour for ethanol and glycerol was not studied in detail in the present work since for small molecules less deactivation is expected."
7,Micro-GC analysis,"3.2 Micro-GC analysis Data for gas phase products are presented in Table 3 . The same amount of CO observed in all experiments seems to be a consequence of conditions not optimal for water gas shift. For commercial applications, an additional catalytic reactor operating at higher temperature should be installed [1]."
8,APR of ethanol,"3.3 APR of ethanol For a 10 wt.% solution of ethanol, almost complete conversion (98.3%) was observed. Ethanol transformation results in methane formation: (2) In experimental data the molar ratio between methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen coincides (Table 2). When looking at the HPLC results, only ethanol and acetic acid were observed in the solution (Fig. 3 ). Based on TOC analysis of the liquid phase the content of carbon was 9% of the initial one or less than 1 wt.%. Acetic acid observed (see the chromatogram) is a non-reactive byproduct which builds up during the course of the reaction."
9,APR of glycerol,"3.4 APR of glycerol Glycerol was almost completely (96.4%) converted to the reaction products. Based on the stoichiometry for glycerol APR, more than twice more hydrogen is produced compared to carbon dioxide: (3) In a selective process, the hydrogen content should correspond to the stoichiometry dictated by the APR of glycerol process, at any conversion. However, the experimentally obtained values (Table 3) demonstrate some lack of hydrogen, in comparison to the stoichiometrical requirements. It was found that the amount of organic carbon in the solution (TOC) after the reaction is 21% of the initial carbon content. When looking at the HPLC chromatograms, this is attributed to glycerol and 4 major reaction products such as acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, acetaldehyde and ethanol (Fig. 4 ). These substances were accumulated in the solution due to low reactivity caused by several undesired side reactions: (4) Illustrated by eq. (4), these side reactions mean the formation of hydroxyacetone, which can be consequently transformed to C2 products. Other 5 minor products were not identified since their contribution was very small."
10,APR of sorbitol,"3.5 APR of sorbitol In the case of APR of sorbitol, the ratio between hydrogen and carbon dioxide, according to stoichiometry, is expected to be 13:6: (5) However, the experimental ratio was found to be close to unity (1) (Table 3) – a fact which is evidently related to the formation of saturated hydrocarbons (Fig. 6). APR of 10% sorbitol solution, at the conditions studied, demonstrated a situation that resembles that of glycerol. The conversion was 100% and TOC analysis of organic species in solution indicated that 19% of the initial carbon amount ended up in the condensed phase (Table 2). Sorbitol, being a large molecule, gives rise to more complicated side reactions. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of at least 5 major and ca. 10 minor products originating from sorbitol transformations (Fig. 5 ). The largest products identified were as follows: acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethanol and 2-butanol: (6) Since the scope of this paper was aimed at studying APR of bio-ethanol and mixed feedstocks, a thorough analysis of sorbitol byproducts will not be presented here. A separate study on sorbitol reaction products was presented in detail elsewhere [15]."
11,APR of mixtures with ethanol,"3.6 APR of mixtures with ethanol Two experiments were performed with sorbitol and glycerol in the presence of ethanol. Hydrogen generation efficiency was calculated on the basis of conversions of initial substances obtained from HPLC, measurements of produced hydrogen and known stoichiometry using the following equation: (7) H 2 generation efficiency = H 2 observed ( mol / min ) H 2 theoretical ( mol / min ) H 2 theoretical ( mol ) = V ′ x n i x c i + v ″ x 2 x c ( ethanol ) where v′ denotes number of moles of glycerol or sorbitol passing through the catalyst bed in 1 min (mol/min) v″ stands for moles of ethanol passing the catalyst bed (mol/min) ci – conversion of sorbitol, glycerol or ethanol ni – stoichiometry coefficients for hydrogen produced from ethanol, glycerol or sorbitol according to reaction schemes shown above – 2, 7 and 13 respectively. The results of calculations, at comparable conversion levels, are presented in Table 4 . First of all, one can observe that APR of ethanol is very selective, thus ethanol was less prone to side reactions than the other two model molecules. Another observation is that the hydrogen yield from glycerol and sorbitol was affected by ethanol in a different manner: the presence of ethanol in the case of glycerol had a negative influence on the hydrogen yield, while in the case of sorbitol substantial improvement was observed. Primary study of volatile products over solution using SPME technique, with consequent GC-MS analysis, demonstrated noticeable differences in the composition of reaction mixtures of APR processes in the presence and absence of ethanol (Fig. 7 ). In particular, in the case of equimolar sorbitol–bio-ethanol mixture, the differences are rather prominent (Fig. 8 ). One more interesting feature is that detected amounts of acetic acid and acetaldehyde were not changed in presence of glycerol or sorbitol and these amounts are quite low compare to ethanol concentration. Based on this observation the most probable explanation is that ethanol acting as a trap for aldehydes converting them to hemiacetals and acetals therefore, preventing aldehydes from condensation to heavier by-products. Less pronounced effect in the case of glycerol can be explained by the smaller molar mass of glycerol (less side reactions) and a smaller excess of ethanol in comparison to glycerol."
12,Conclusions,"APR is an attractive method for hydrogen/hydrocarbons production from renewable feedstocks. Nevertheless, this technology is not practical in mobile implementations due to the low energy density of sugar alcohols, which are produced, similar to bio-ethanol from carbohydrates. The presence of energy demanding distillation and steam reforming steps in the bio-ethanol route renders it less effective. Indeed, the hydrogen yield might be higher when it is produced via APR of sugar alcohols. Moreover, APR of pure ethanol results in elevated methane formation. However, a clear advantage of bio-ethanol utilization is that the only observed side product was acetic acid does not contribute to the catalyst deactivation. The same is not true when sugar alcohols are used as the feedstock. Furthermore, in the case of a sorbitol–ethanol mixture, an improvement in the hydrogen yield was observed. The absence of any negative influence of bio-ethanol on an APR process allows us to recommend it as a possible solvent for processing of renewables. Further improvements in this process could be achieved among other means, such as by optimization of reaction conditions, ethanol concentration as well as the nature of the catalyst."
