0,Introduction,"The conversion of microalgae to energy has included either thermochemical conversion such as the conversion of lipids to biodiesel, or direct pyrolysis and hydrothermal routes or biological conversion, principally anaerobic digestion (AD). For macroalgae, the main focus has been on biological conversion such as AD and fermentation as a result of their high carbohydrate contents, although some thermochemical routes have also been investigated (Chynoweth et al., 2001; Ross et al., 2008; Anastasakis et al., 2011). At the point of harvesting, algal biomass qualifies as a wet biomass. Much of the current processes for converting wet biomass into fuels are based on microbial degradation, e.g. AD, which has been proposed as a mechanism for recycling nutrients back for algal cultivation. However, AD offers only partial mineralization of the algal biomass, leading to a loss of nutrients for recycling (Ross et al., 2008). Thermochemical routes such as hydrothermal processing offer the potential for complete mineralization of algae in their wet state. Hydrothermal processing methods may therefore offer a sustainable platform for the integrated utilization and cultivation of algae for energy production, without intensive drying which consumes energy. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) offers a route for using biomass for the production of different carbon-based materials such as activated carbons and bio-char/coal (Heilmann et al., 2010). Heilmann et al. (2010) have demonstrated that algal biomass can easily be converted into bio-char with qualities similar to those of bituminous coal at temperatures of about 200°C and pressures of <2MPa within less than one hour. The combustion of the char obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii yielded a net positive energy balance of 12.01MJ, while the fresh algae yielded a net negative energy balance of −5.27MJ. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae has been applied to the production of bio-oils known as bio-crude. For instance, Biller and Ross (2011) have reported maximum bio-crude yields of up to 40wt% in the presence of alumina-supported transition metal catalysts in the temperature range of 300–350°C. The liquefaction procedure carried out at 350°C yielded a bio-crude with a calorific value of 39MJ/kg. The yields of biocrude from microalgae increase with increasing lipid contents (Biller and Ross, 2011). For macroalgae, the yields of biocrude are much lower due to higher levels of mineral matter (up to 35wt%) and a higher carbohydrate fraction. Anastasakis and Ross (2011) reported a maximum bio-crude yield of 19.3wt% from the catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of the brown macroalgae, Saccharina latissima, between 250 and 370°C in the presence of potassium hydroxide. The bio-crude obtained at 350°C gave a calorific value of 36.5MJ/kg, indicating the importance of feedstock composition to conversion yields using hydrothermal processing. Hydrothermal gasification (HTG) for hydrogen and synthetic natural gas production, which operates at moderately low temperature, can potentially become a cheaper source of hydrogen compared to electrolysis and conventional gasification (Ni et al., 2006). Added with the possibility of carbon dioxide capture, the process boasts of increased effectiveness and overall efficiency, with the possibility of a net negative carbon balance. HTG of microalgae has a number of advantages over HTL, namely the produced fuel is nitrogen-free, allowing the use of high protein microalgae. The organic carbon in the water phase is also much lower than that for HTL, which could increase the carbon gasification efficiency (Haiduc et al., 2009; Biller et al., 2012). Nickel and ruthenium have been investigated as effective catalysts for the HTG of algae (Minowa and Sawayama, 1999; Chakinala et al., 2009; Stucki et al., 2009; Haiduc et al., 2009; Guan et al., 2011; Schumacher et al., 2011). In general, marine microalgae strains and macroalgae exhibit lower conversion efficiency than freshwater algae during hydrothermal gasification; however, a direct comparison is often difficult due to different reactor designs, catalyst loadings and conditions employed. Essentially, such difference in conversion efficiencies may highlight the importance of differentiating between algal species for hydrothermal processing into different intended fuel types; e.g. liquid fuels, carbon or gaseous fuels e.g. hydrogen and syngas. In the present study, a freshwater microalga (Chlorella vulgaris), a cyanobacterium (Spirulina platensis) and a macro-alga (Saccharina latissima) were processed using supercritical water gasification at 500°C and 36MPa in an Inconel batch reactor. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the reaction products from catalytic hydrothermal gasification of the different algae samples to determine their potential suitability for energy production and nutrient recycling."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The algae have previously been characterized, including their proximate and ultimate compositions (Biller and Ross, 2011; Anastasakis et al., 2011; Anastasakis and Ross, 2011). The algae were obtained as dry powders and used as received. The dry-basis moisture and ash contents of the samples were respectively as follows; Saccharina, 9.2 and 24.2wt%; Chlorella, 5.9 and 7.0wt%; and Spirulina, 7.8 and 7.6wt%. The higher heating values (HHV) of the samples were 12MJ/kg for Saccharina, 23.2MJ/kg for Chlorella and 21.2MJ/kg for Spirulina (Biller and Ross, 2011; Anastasakis and Ross, 2011). Sodium hydroxide pellets were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, UK, while nickel catalyst on hydrothermally stable alumina support in the form of cylindrical pellets, were supplied by Johnson Mattey, UK and used as received. The catalyst has a BET surface area of ⩾70m2/g with 5wt% nickel content."
3,Procedure,"2.2 Procedure In each experiment, 1.0g of algae sample was weighed out into the Inconel batch reactor obtained from Parr Instruments Co. USA (Onwudili and Williams, 2010a, 2011). Reproducibility values of ⩽5% have been obtained using 5wt% biomass feed concentrations in the reactor system (Onwudili and Williams, 2009; Muangrat et al., 2010a). In the present study, 15ml of deionized water was added to the reactor each time and quickly heated at a rate of 30°C/min to 500°C, giving a reaction pressure of 36MPa at the designated temperature. Reactions were carried out without catalysts or in the presence of either sodium hydroxide or nickel catalyst or both. Experiments lasted for 30min since preliminary experiments indicated that maximum hydrogen gas production was achieved within this time period. The reactor was removed from the heater and rapidly cooled with compressed air to quench the reaction, once the designated reaction conditions were reached. The pressure exerted by the produced gas during the reaction was noted after cooling the reactor to room temperature."
4,Analysis of gas products,"2.3 Analysis of gas products Gas inside the reactor was sampled for off-line gas chromatography analysis. Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide were analyzed using gas chromatographs fitted with thermal conductivity detectors (GC/TCD). Methane and C2–C4 gases were analyzed using gas chromatographs fitted with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) (Onwudili and Williams, 2010, 2011; Muangrat et al., 2010a). The GCs gave the mole% of each gas in the product gas mixture. The pressure exerted by the produced gases ranged between 5 and 12bar at room temperature (20°C) and the moles of each gas component were obtained using the general gas equation."
5,Analysis of liquid residuals,"2.4 Analysis of liquid residuals 2.4.1 TOC analysis After gas sampling and analysis, the reactor was opened to sample the liquid residual. The aqueous residual was transferred with deionized water into a glass bottle. The total volume of the liquid transferred was measured and an aliquot (about 2ml) removed for total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. This step was taken prior to rinsing the reactor and subsequent extraction of any tar products with organic solvent (dichloromethane), to ensure that only the TOC of the reaction liquid residual was measured. The theoretical TOC was calculated using the carbon content in each sample, previously determined using an elemental analyzer (Biller and Ross, 2011; Anastasakis and Ross, 2011). Hence, the percentage TOC removal from the algae samples after hydrothermal gasification was calculated using the following formula; % TOC Removal = 100 - ( TOC in aqueous residual × 100 % ) ( Theoretical TOC in sample ) 2.4.2 Extraction and analysis of tar After rinsing the reactor with deionized water, known volumes of dichloromethane were used to dissolve tar/char and the washings were combined with the total aqueous residuals in the glass bottle. The mixture of dichloromethane and aqueous residual was filtered under vacuum to separate solid residues from liquid products. The filter paper was rinsed several times with more DCM under vacuum to ensure quantitative partitioning of tars in the solid residue into the liquid phase. The liquid phase was transferred into a separating funnel to separate the DCM fraction from the aqueous layer. The DCM layer was transferred into a vial, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and transferred into a pre-weighed concentration vial. The DCM was discharged on a rotary evaporator at 30°C using a Genevac Rocket™ Evaporation System to obtain the weight of the tar. The tar products from the experiments were re-dissolved in DCM for gas chromatography analysis. The GC/MS/MS used consisted of a Varian 3800-GC coupled to a Varian Saturn 2200 MS/MS instrument. The column was a 30m×0.25mm inner diameter Varian VF-5ms (DB-5 equivalent). The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 1mlmin−1. The GC injector was held at 290°C. The oven temperature programme was as follows; 40°C held for 2min and ramped to 280°C at a rate of 5°Cmin−1 and held at 280°C for 10min. The transfer line temperature was 280°C, manifold was at 120°C and the trap temperature was held at 200°C. The GC/MS/MS was used to identify the major compounds in tars by comparing mass spectral data with those in the NIST 2008 Library (Varian, 2008). Spectral matches with similarity indexes (SI) of over 85% were judged reliable for the identification of compounds. Semi-quantitative analysis of each tar was carried out among the fifty largest peaks, representing close to 95% of the total peaks areas obtained from the GC/MS/MS. The corresponding compounds were categorized into five groups and semi-quantitation was achieved by using peak area ratios. The ratios of the peak areas of one group of compounds were calculated for each alga subjected to different reaction conditions. The ratios were obtained by comparing the total peak areas of a group of compounds against the peak area of a surrogate standard. For example, the ratio for phenols was obtained by comparing the total peak areas of phenols in a tar sample against the peak area of a standard solution of phenol in dichloromethane. These ratios were used to determine relative compositions of the groups in the tar products. Phenols were quantitatively analyzed by preparing a standard solution composed of a cocktail of the phenols identified by the GC/MS/MS. These standards were used to confirm these phenolic compounds by comparing retention times and thereafter a three-point calibration curve was prepared and used for the quantification of phenols."
6,Nutrients analysis,"2.5 Nutrients analysis Each of the aqueous residuals was diluted to 200ml, filtered through a Type 3 Whatman filter and analyzed by ion chromatography (DX-100, Dionex, USA) to identify and quantify the main anions and cations present. In particular, the concentration of ammonium, phosphate and acetate was measured as these have a major influence on process waters used in nutrient recycling. Levels of phenols in process water were determined by colorimetry (Hach, Germany), using colorimetry cuvettes (LCK302, LCK338, LCK350, Hach-Lange, Germany). The trace metal concentration in the aqueous phase was measured using an Optima 5300 DV inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP) with optical emission spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Cambridge, UK)."
7,Elemental analysis of solid and tar products,"2.6 Elemental analysis of solid and tar products In order to calculate the carbon balance after the hydrothermal reactions of the algae samples, elemental analyses of the solid residue, tar/oil and water soluble products (WSP) were carried. The WSP refers to the solid residue obtained after evaporation of the aqueous phase, which would comprise both inorganic compounds including reaction products of sodium hydroxide such as sodium carbonate as well as any organic residuals. The instrument used for the elemental analysis was a CE Instruments Flash EA 1112 series elemental analyzer. All measurements were done in duplicate and average values are reported. The phosphorus contents of the algae samples were determined by ICP-OES to be 8g/kg, 7.1g/kg and ≈1.0g/kg for Spirulina, Chlorella and Saccharina, respectively."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Composition of reaction products,"3.1 Composition of reaction products Table 1 presents the distribution of reaction products after supercritical water gasification of the three algae samples at 500°C and 36MPa for 30min. The product mass balance for each experiment was >90%. Gas products were the dominant reaction products when no catalysts or only the nickel-catalyst was used. Conversely, water-soluble products were the predominant reaction products whenever sodium hydroxide was used. Table 1 shows an inverse relationship between gas product yields and water-soluble products. For instance, for all three algae samples, the masses of product gas decreased considerably when sodium hydroxide was used due to the removal of carbon dioxide as sodium carbonates. Both sodium carbonate and bicarbonate are soluble in water and were found in residues obtained after evaporation of water from aqueous residuals from alkaline hydrothermal gasification of biomass (Onwudili and Williams, 2010, 2011; Muangrat et al., 2010a). The proportion of filtration residue was consistently much higher for Saccharina compared to that of the other samples, likely as a result of the high ash content (Biller and Ross, 2011). For the Spirulina and Chlorella samples, the proportion of filtration residues only increased considerably when sodium hydroxide and the nickel catalyst were used together. Considering that sodium carbonate is soluble in water, it was not expected to be retained on the filter paper; hence, the insoluble residue would involve a different source. Therefore, the increase in solid residue could represent a reaction product between NaOH and the nickel catalyst. Muangrat et al. (2010b) found powdered nickel–alumina catalyst produced substantial residues after the hydrothermal gasification of biomass model compounds in the presence of NaOH. XRD analysis of the solid residue confirmed the presence of sodium dawsonite, a possible product of the reaction of NaOH with the catalyst supports. More oil/tar was found after supercritical water gasification of each of the three algae in the absence of NaOH, indicating that the alkali played a significant role in the degradation of the samples and in gas forming reactions. Onwudili and Williams (2010, 2011) have shown that NaOH catalyzes the degradation of different biomass samples into gasifiable intermediates such as formate and acetate salts of the alkali metal and reported that the preferential formation of these intermediates suppressed the polymerization pathway towards enhanced tar/char formation during hydrothermal biomass gasification. In the current study, the yields of tar/oil were relatively low compared to those obtained via hydrothermal liquefaction (Shuping et al., 2010; Biller and Ross, 2011; Vardon et al., 2011). Anastasakis et al. (2011) reported a maximum oil yield of 19.3wt% when Saccharina was liquefied in near-critical water conditions, whereas the maximum tar yield for the same sample was only 7wt% in the present study, likely due to the higher temperature employed. Even so, results from these gasification experiments showed that the yields of tar declined further in the presence of NaOH. For instance, the yields of tar were about 15, 7, and 16wt% from Spirulina, Saccharina and Chlorella, respectively in the absence of NaOH. With the alkali, tar yields from these samples were reduced by 67%, 43% and 56%, respectively. Further reductions in tar yields were observed when NaOH and nickel catalyst were used together. With the nickel catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) alone, tar yields were higher than when NaOH was present but lower than when no catalysts were used. The results of the relative compositional analyses of these tars are presented in Section 3.4."
10,Composition of gas products,"3.2 Composition of gas products The major components of the gas products are shown in Table 2 . Carbon dioxide was the major component in the absence of sodium hydroxide, i.e. when nickel catalyst was used and when no catalyst was used. Subsequently, hydrogen and methane were the major component gases when the alkali was used. These results are in line with results previously reported (Onwudili and Williams, 2010, 2011; Muangrat et al., 2010a, 2010b) on the formation of gasifiable intermediates (formates and acetates) during alkaline gasification of biomass samples using NaOH. These authors also showed that the subsequent reactions of these intermediates into hydrogen and methane gases were promoted by the presence of the alkali, which captured the carbon dioxide to produce sodium carbonate. For hydrogen production, the removal of CO2 from the reaction system possibly favored the forward reaction by disturbing the equilibrium of the water–gas shift reaction. Similar conclusions could be drawn for the reaction of sodium acetate to produce methane gas. The mole percent of hydrogen gas increased nearly three times in the presence of NaOH, indicating that the alkali could equally degrade different biomass types with similar results; however, Saccharina produced marginally higher proportions of hydrogen gas than the other two algae samples, both with and without the catalysts, possibly due to differences in the biochemical compositions of the algae. As reported by Anastasakis and Ross (2011), Saccharina, like most macro-algae strains, contains more carbohydrates than the other two microalgae used in the current study. Carbohydrate-type biomass has been shown to be more suitable for hydrogen production under hydrothermal conditions than proteins and lipids (Kruse and Dinjus, 2005; Muangrat et al., 2010b). Kruse and Dinjus (2005) reported that the presence of protein could inhibit gas-forming reactions favorable for hydrogen production. The proportion of methane gas increased slightly in the presence of NaOH. Overall, the methane and C2–C4 gases contents of the gas products increased slightly in the presence of the nickel catalyst and NaOH together. Moreover, this set of reactions also featured slight decreases in the mol% of hydrogen gas in the gas products. It could therefore be the case that the nickel catalyst promoted methanation reactions in addition to the methane produced by the alkali via alkali metal acetate. The composition data of the gas products were used to compute the calorific value (HHV) for the gas products. The calorific values (CV) of the gas products increased in the presence of NaOH, but even more so when NaOH and nickel catalysts were used together, possibly because of the promotion of reactions leading to the formation of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases and the capture of CO2 to form carbonates, leaving mainly combustible gas components in the gas products. A calorific value of up to 36MJ/m3 was obtained from the gas products. Interestingly, the lowest calorific values of the gas products were obtained from Saccharina, even though this alga produced more hydrogen gas than the other two algae. A plausible explanation for this is the overall lower proportions of the C2–C4 gases in the gas products from Saccharina, since these gases have much higher individual calorific values than hydrogen. Remarkably high yields of C2–C4 hydrocarbon gases were obtained from Chlorella and Spirulina, possibly as a result of their high lipid contents. Biller and Ross (2011) reported high yields of up to 40wt% of bio-crude comprised of long-chain fatty acids from these two algae samples. The degradation of long-chain fatty acids under hydrothermal conditions could be responsible for high yields of C2–C4 gases. In addition, analysis of the actual algae showed that the Saccharina sample had the lowest HHV, which could be a result of its high carbohydrate and ash content (Anastasakis and Ross, 2011). Also, in the presence of NaOH, Saccharina gave the most dramatic increase in methane contents of the gas products compared to when no NaOH was used. This is a common feature of carbohydrate-rich biomass samples (Onwudili and Williams, 2011). Onwudili and Williams (2011) suggested that it was not only the carbon contents of carbonaceous materials that influenced the distribution of gas components but also the chemical nature of the carbon atoms within the samples and that the major chemistry of alkaline degradation could involve a nucleophilic attack on the carbon atoms by hydroxide (OH−) ions from the alkaline medium within the subcritical water region. The possibility of enhanced alkaline degradation increases the probability of formation of relevant gas-forming intermediates such as formates and acetates (Kruse et al., 2007; Onwudili and Williams, 2010, 2011). This hypothesis could explain increased hydrogen and methane formation from carbohydrates such as glucose and glycerol in the presence of NaOH (Onwudili and Williams, 2009) and would explain the trend in methane and hydrogen production from Saccharina in the presence of NaOH. However, for Spirulina and Chlorella, where the proportion of methane remained fairly stable, with or without alkali, pyrolysis may be largely responsible for the formation of this gas rather than the acetate route. Under conventional pyrolysis conditions, acetic acid can undergo mainly decarboxylation reactions to form methane and carbon dioxide (Judd et al., 1974); however, under alkaline hydrothermal conditions, decarboxylation and reforming reactions of acetate occur, leading to the production of methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Onwudili and Williams, 2010)."
11,Gas yields,"3.3 Gas yields Gas yields were computed by applying the mole fraction of each gas in the general gas equation. Hence, the yields (mol/kg) of algae presented in Fig. 1 give a better indication of the effect of the catalysts. The maximum hydrogen yield was 15.1mol/kg from the gasification of Saccharina, in the presence of NaOH alone. The yield of hydrogen gas from this sample decreased slightly to 14.2mol/kg when NaOH and Ni/Al2O3 were used. Conversely, both Chlorella and Spirulina produced approximately 11mol/kg of hydrogen gas in the presence of the catalysts. Again, apart from Saccharina, no significant differences were observed in relation to methane production with or without the catalysts. With the macroalgae, methane yields increased nearly two-fold in the presence of the catalysts, indicating that there might be a role for acetate in methane production (Judd et al., 1974)."
12,Compositions of the tars,"3.4 Compositions of the tars Although, tar formation is unwanted during hydrothermal gasification of biomass, their presence and concentrations would highlight the need for further improvement in the catalytic hydrothermal gasification process. The compositional analysis of the tars indicated that they contained mostly stable organic compounds. These compounds included phenols, alkyl benzenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and some aromatic nitrogen compounds (N-heterocycles). Some of these compounds are often difficult to decompose even under conventional gasification conditions (Li and Suzuki, 2009). The relative compositions of the major classes of compounds in the tar products are shown in Fig. 2 . The main components of the category tagged ‘others’, in Fig. 2 included indanes, indenes, long-chain alkanes (e.g. nonadecane), phytol and isophytol. While indanes and indenes have been reported in biomass pyrolysis oils (Boateng et al., 2010; Carlson, 2010), long-chain alkanes as well as phytol and isophytol could possibly have resulted from the lipid and chlorophyll contents of the algae as the lipid-type compounds were only present in the tars from Chlorella and Spirulina that have a higher lipid and chlorophyll contents than Saccharina. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of the catalysts led to a significant decrease in the relative concentrations of the components of the tars. This is corroborated by the results in Table 1, since the combination of NaOH and Ni/Al2O3 gave the highest reduction in tar formation. Hence, the lowest relative concentrations of the different classes of compounds in Fig. 2 corresponded to reactions under the same catalytic conditions. In the absence of catalysts, the tars from Saccharina gave the highest concentrations of phenols, while the tars from Chlorella and Spirulina contained significant concentrations of alkyl benzenes and heterocyclic nitrogen compounds. Fig. 3 (A) demonstrates that the presence of sodium hydroxide caused a reduction in the concentrations of phenols in the tars. In addition, Fig. 3(A) shows that Saccharina produced the lowest yields of phenols in the tar, suggesting that the alkali was effective in either suppressing the formation of phenols or in decomposing phenols into other simpler compounds. However, phenols are known to exhibit appreciable solubility in water and could thus be partitioned between the tar and the aqueous residual. The levels of total phenols in the process waters are presented in Section 3.5.1."
13,Analyses of aqueous residuals,"3.5 Analyses of aqueous residuals 3.5.1 Phenols in aqueous residuals The aqueous residuals from the hydrothermal gasification of algae could potentially also be used for algae cultivation, but a high concentrations of toxic phenols in the process waters would render it unsuitable for algae cultivation (Scragg, 2006; Biller et al., 2012). Fig. 3(B) shows the concentrations of phenols in the process waters from the different experiments. The overall yields of phenols were low, with a maximum yield of 35mg/g from Chlorella in the presence of the nickel–alumina catalyst alone. Comparatively, Saccharina produced the lowest yield of phenols. These concentrations of phenols compare well with those reported by Biller et al. (2012) for hydrothermal liquefaction of algae. These authors found that when process waters with similar concentrations of phenols were diluted (400times), they could be used to grow micro-algae as the diluted process waters compared favorably with the standard media for algae cultivation. Considering the low tar as well as phenol contents from the hydrothermal gasification of Saccharina, there appears to be potential in using process waters from macro-algae for microalgae cultivation. 3.5.2 Total organic carbon (TOC) measurement Fig. 4 shows the percent reduction in TOC of the samples after hydrothermal gasification. Nearly 90% TOC reduction in the aqueous residuals was achieved. These results indicated that nearly all the organic carbon contents of the algae samples were converted mostly to gases and some tar. TOC removal efficiency was highest in Saccharina, as it was consistently above 90% and reached up to 97% in the presence of NaOH. Spirulina and Chlorella, which produced significantly higher amounts of tar, gave lower TOC removals than Saccharina since they contain less carbohydrate than Spirulina and Chlorella, which produced significantly higher tar, gave lower TOC removals than Saccharina. No aliphatic oxygenates were detected, different from what was observed for hydrothermal liquefaction of algae at lower temperatures (Biller and Ross, 2011). The high temperature used in the present study transformed the majority of these water-miscible aliphatic organic oxygenates such as aliphatic alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids into gases via decarboxylation and degradation reactions. In addition, the remaining carbon skeletons could undergo a series of reactions including polymerization, cyclization and aromatization (Williams and Onwudili, 2005) to form stable refractory compounds such as phenols and PAHs in the tar. Essentially, dissolved phenols and hydrothermally stable acetates (Savage, 1999) could be the main contributors to the total organic carbon contents of aqueous residuals. 3.5.3 Nutrient and metal analyses Table 3 presents the concentrations of anions, cations and total nitrogen (total N) in the process waters; the species in this table can generally be regarded as nutrients. The process waters were diluted to 200ml each prior to analysis and results presented in parts per million (ppm). For all samples, high concentrations of sodium ions were obtained in the process waters from experiments involving the use of sodium hydroxide; however, without the alkali, significant levels of sodium ions were also found in the process waters, with the largest concentrations from Saccharina. The highest concentrations of potassium were also found these samples. Indeed, the process waters from the HTG of Saccharina contained approximately eight times the concentrations of potassium as those from Spirulina and Chlorella. These high concentrations of sodium and potassium could well be attributed to the high ash content of Saccharina and other macroalgae (Ross et al., 2008). Potassium is one of the essential nutrients for microalgae cultivation and the levels observed in all the process waters were higher than the typical values of 63ppm found in standard algae growth media (3N-BBM+V). Thus, the process waters, especially from Saccharina, could provide the potassium nutrient needs for microalgae cultivation. In addition, the high concentrations of chloride and sulfate ions from Saccharina process waters may be associated with these high concentrations of sodium and potassium. The concentrations of ammonium ions were also higher when sodium hydroxide was used compared to when the alkali was absent. This observation was in line with the results of tar analyses which showed substantial reduction in the yield of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds in the presence of NaOH. This suggested that the alkali was capable of converting organic-nitrogen into ammonium during hydrothermal processing (Savage, 1999; Kruse and Dinjus, 2005; Onwudili and Williams, 2009). Fewer ammonium ions were found in process waters from HTG of Saccharina due to its low nitrogen content. The concentrations of nitrate ions and total nitrogen were higher in the process waters from Chlorella and Spirulina than in those from Saccharina, possibly for the same reasons of low initial nitrogen content of the macroalgae. Higher concentrations of phosphate ions were found in the process waters from these two microalgae compared to Saccharina due to the higher P content of the original biomass. Acetate ions are one of the most refractory by-products of hydrothermal processing of biomass and appreciable levels of acetate were detected in most aqueous residuals (Savage, 1999). In particular, the presence of alkali can significantly increase the formation of acetate (Yan et al., 2006). Onwudili and Williams (2011) suggested that the preferential formation of sodium formate and/or sodium acetate during alkaline hydrothermal reactions of biomass could depend on the chemical nature of carbon atoms present in the sample. For instance, carbohydrate-rich samples preferentially produce formate and hence hydrogen gas. Thus, the lower concentrations of acetate ions in Saccharina aqueous residuals could be attributed to the preferred formation of sodium formate. Gas analysis results also showed the highest hydrogen gas yields when Saccharina was gasified in the presence of the alkali. Recently, algae growth trials using process waters from hydrothermal liquefaction appeared to show that microalgae could thrive in media with high levels of ammonium and acetate (Biller et al., 2012). In Table 4 , the concentrations of aluminium and some heavy metals are presented. Higher concentrations of aluminium between 130ppm and 225ppm were observed from process waters obtained when sodium hydroxide and the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst were employed together. A plausible explanation is the reaction of sodium hydroxide and alumina, leading to the formation of soluble aluminates. The presence of heavy metals may affect algal growth; in particular, nickel has been reported as a growth inhibitor. Haiduc et al. (2009) reported a maximum nickel concentration of 25ppm for successful algal growth using hydrothermal process waters. Sources of nickel in the process waters obtained in this work would include leaching of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and the walls of the nickel-based hydrothermal reactor. Levels of nickel, reaching up to 56.6ppm for Spirulina, were observed when sodium hydroxide and Ni/Al2O3 were used together for the HTG of the algae."
14,Carbon balance and carbon gasification efficiency,"3.6 Carbon balance and carbon gasification efficiency Table 5 presents the carbon balance as well as the carbon gasification efficiencies (CGE) after hydrothermal gasification of the three algae samples. The CGE column in Table 5 is the respective sums of the amount of carbon in the gas samples and the amount of inorganic carbon in the aqueous residuals. As shown in Table 5, the overall carbon balance closures are over 90%, indicating a high accounting for the reaction products. A high proportion of the carbon atoms in the feed were found as gas and as inorganic carbon (IC) in the aqueous residuals. In particular, the yields of carbon as IC in the aqueous residuals were highest when the gasification of the algae samples was carried out in the presence of NaOH due to the capture of carbon dioxide by reaction with NaOH to form water soluble sodium carbonate (Onwudili and Williams, 2009). The high carbon contents in the actual gas samples when no alkali was used were due to the high yields of carbon dioxide in the gas products. In addition, the results of the CGE calculations show that, high CGE values were obtained in the presence of NaOH. For Saccharina, CGE was higher than 90% when it was reacted with the alkali, indicating that the alkali was very effective in degrading the macro-algae into gasifiable intermediates (Onwudili and Williams, 2009, 2011)."
15,Conclusions,"This work highlights the differences in the application of catalytic hydrothermal gasification on different types of algae. Variations in product distributions from the three algae samples could possibly be ascribed to their different biochemical compositions. Saccharina, a carbohydrate-rich macro-alga, was better suited for hydrothermal gasification than the microalgae, Chlorella and Spirulina, which may be more suitable for bio-oil production. In addition, the process waters from Saccharina processing have potential characteristics for application as growth media for microalgae cultivation. Integrated energy production and nutrient recycling via hydrothermal processing can positively influence the development of a sustainable algae-based bio-refinery for the future."
