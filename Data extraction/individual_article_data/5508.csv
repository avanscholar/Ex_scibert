0,Introduction,"The non-renewability of fossil fuels and their negative environmental impacts are one of the main reasons for finding alternative energy sources. Since the renewable energy sources are cleaner and more environment-friendly than the conventional ones, these are referred as promising options for the sustainable development of societies [1]. In this sence, the biomass has a significant contribution to the world economy and provides a range of biofuels and chemicals. Biodiesel is one of the popular forms of biofuel which is obtained from vegetable oils and animal fats and is considered as an attractive alternative to fossil diesel. It is renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable, sulfur, and benzene-free, can be used in common diesel engines with no modification, and its blending with fossil diesel at any given ratio is possible [2]. Traditionally, biodiesel (known as fatty acid methyl esters) is obtained by the transesterification reaction of triglycerides, mainly found in edible vegetable oils [3]. However, biodiesel could be obtained via esterification reaction of free fatty acids as well [4]. The major component is based to oleic acid (containing one double bond per chain), but it is in admixture with smaller amounts of saturated chains and some doubly unsaturated chains (linoleic acid). For fatty esters, both the acid- and base-catalyzed transesterifications occur readily. Drawbacks of the base-catalyzed transesterification are (i) slightly higher reaction temperatures required and (ii) catalyst deactivation by reaction with the carboxylic acid group to form a carboxylic acid salt (soap). One of the promising processes for a high-value-added product with oleic acid recycled from waste oil is the biodiesel synthesis by esterification of oleic acid with methanol [5]. The latter is usually carried out in the presence of mineral acids (H2SO4 or HCl) catalysts. However, these are highly corrosive and very hazardous to environment and equipment [6]. Recently, findings of alternative catalysts for promotion both the transesterification and esterification reactions for biodiesel production are in progress. In this context, the usage of ionic liquids (especially those functionalized with Brønsted acid sites) as catalysts for the esterification of fatty acids or transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats has increased significantly in recent years [7–13]. For example, Ghiaci et al. [8] applied Brønsted acidic ionic liquids based on 1-benzyl-1H-benzimidazole as acidic catalysts for transesterification of canola oil to its methyl esters. The authors reported an yield of methyl esters of more than 95% in 5 h. In another work, the catalytic behavior of [Im(N(CH2)3SO3H)2]+[HSO4]– and bis[3-(CH2)3SO3H-1-(CH2)2-Im]+[HSO4]2 is investigated in the reaction of methyl oleate synthesis [9]. The methyl oleate yield using bis[3-(CH2)3SO3H-1-(CH2)2-Im]+[HSO4]2 as a catalyst is established to be lower than that in the presence of [Im(N(CH2)3SO3H)2]+[HSO4]– (93%), a result of both different internal hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance effect. Transesterification-esterification of acidic vegetable oils in the presence of polyoxometalate-based sulfonated ionic liquids immobilized on UiO-66-2COOH metal–organic frameworks results in a biodiesel yield in the range from 23 to 96% [10]. Dual acidic ionic liquid on core–shell structured magnetic silica for biodiesel production by one-pot transformation of low-quality oils are applied in a work of Xie and Wan [11]. It was reported that the biodiesel yield in this case varies between 66 and 97%. Although a biodiesel production with ionic liquids as catalysts can be found in a great number of papers [14–18], kinetics evaluation data (especially for a process catalyzed by pyridinium and triazolium based ionic liquids) for biodiesel synthesis via esterification of oleic acid is very limited. For instance, a kinetic study of a biodiesel production through methylation of oleic acid using 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate revealed a maximum conversion (95%) after 8 h at 110 °C, initial reactants molar ratio (M) of 15 and a catalyst dosage of 15 wt% [19]. Similar results are observed in a work of Ullah et al. [20], where the kinetics of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfo-butyl) benzimidazolium ([BSMBIM]+) ionic liquids with different anions ([CH3SO3]–, [CF3SO3]–and [HSO4]–) is studied. The highest biodiesel yield (78.1%) is achieved using [BSMBIM]+[CF3SO3]– after 3 h reaction time, 100 °C and M of 15. Aforementioned anions ([CH3SO3]–, [CF3SO3]–and [HSO4]–) in a combination with 1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1,2,4-triazolium cation ([Taz-prSO3H]+) are also used as effective catalysts for transesterification of palm oil to biodiesel [21]. The authors exposed that the catalyst [Taz-prSO3H]+[CF3SO3]– (3 wt%) leads to the highest product yield (99.7%) after 3 h, 120 °C and methanol-to-oil ratio of 18. Obviously, these parameters differ from those in the case of [BSMBIM]+[CF3SO3]– [20]. In other words, it seems that the biodiesel yield depends strongly on the nature of the cation and anion present in the ionic liquid structure. Kinetic studies on biodiesel production via three-step transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil, catalyzed by a pyridinium-based Brønsted acidic ionic liquid are reported in a paper of Li et al. [22]. As a result, an ester yield value of 60% is obtained.: Multi-objective optimization and a kinetic study on esterification of oleic acid to biodiesel using a magnetic ionic liquid (BMIM]+[FeCl4]–) shows that an ester yield of 83% can be achieved using a molar ratio methanol-to-oleic acid of 22, a catalyst loading of 0.003 mol and reaction time at 3.6 h [23]. Encouraged by these findings, kinetics of oleic acid methylation (biodiesel synthesis) in the presence of the protic ionic liquids pyridinium hydrogen sulfate (PHS), pyridinium nitrate (PN) and 4-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate (ATN) as catalysts is investigated in the current work. The biodiesel (methyl oleate) production rate is directly related to the Hammett acidity and internal hydrogen bonding extent of the used ionic liquids. To optimize the reaction conditions, effect of the reaction temperature, initial alcohol-to-acid molar ratio and catalyst loading is investigated in details. In addition, the catalyst reusability is estimated. Moreover, a thermodynamic analysis on the title reaction is conducted as well. The results obtained are expected to be valuable for further studies on the biodiesel production in the presence of different types of ionic liquids."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis and characterization of catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis and characterization of catalysts For preparation of the ion pair PHS (Scheme 1 ), pyridine (2.13 g, 0.0269 mol) and ultra clean water (1.45 g, 0.0807 mol) are charged into a 0.020 l three-necked flat bottom reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirring, a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The aqueous solution of pyridine is stirred at ambient temperature for 0.5 h, where after the temperature is reduced from ambient temperature to 5 °C. Then, equimolar quantity of H2SO4 (2.64 g, 0.0269 mol) is added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is stirred at reflux for an additional period of 5 h at 80 °C. For solvent removing, the aqueous solution of pyridinium hydrogen sulfate is distillated by means of rotary evaporator at 60 °C under reduced pressure (0.050 MPa) and the product is dried at the same conditions for 8 h until the residue mass remained constant. After cooling, the colorless solid is washed for three times with diethyl ether (0.100 l). Then, the solid is dried under vacuum (0.050 MPa) at 60 °C for 12 h. Synthesis of the ionic liquids PN and ATN follows the procedure described above. Unlike PHS and PN, which crystalize immediately after cooling, ATN ionic liquid does it after several days. To characterize the samples obtained, FT-IR, UV–vis and TGA/DSC methods are used. The respective graphs are added as a supplementary material. The vibrational modes are recorded in the frequency region from 4000 to 400 cm−1 by means of a Nicolet iS 50 Thermo Scientific FT-IR spectrophotometer at scan's numbers of 32. Infrared spectra of PHS and ATN are measured in a KBr pellet, while that of PN using nujol. Electronic absorption (UV–vis) spectra are recorded in the range from 190 to 500 nm at 25 °C in water solution using Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Thermal stability of PHS and PN and ATN ionic liquids is investigated in NETZSCH STA 449 F3 instrument. The samples are heated from 25 to 700 °C at 10 °C/min under stream of nitrogen (0.020 l/min). A detailed thermal analysis on the ATN is presented in a paper of of Keshavarz et al. [24]. Characterization data: (i) PHS: colorless crystals; melting point: 91 °C; thermal decomposition point: 394 °C; FT-IR (ν cm−1): 3397, 3253, 3070, 2951, 2912, 2848, 1639, 1528, 1493, 1290, 1179, 1052, 1004, 885, 845, 750, 673, 575, 456; UV–vis (λ nm): 207, 239, 245, 250, 255 and 263; (ii) PN: colorless crystals; melting point: 120 °C; thermal decomposition point: 245 °C; FT-IR (ν cm−1): 3419, 2952, 2923, 2834, 1762, 1633, 1603, 1529, 1483, 1456, 1376, 1248, 1193, 1055, 1036, 998, 937, 824, 750, 718; UV–vis (λ nm): 227, 232, 237, 255 and 302; (iii) ATN: colorless crystals; melting point: 68 °C; thermal decomposition point: 264 °C; FT-IR (ν cm−1): 3423, 3308, 3130, 2767, 2390, 1994, 1762, 1629, 1528, 1385, 1193, 1074, 1028, 967, 928, 866, 825, 663; UV–vis (λ nm): 206, 222, 230 and 302."
3,UV–vis determination of acidity,"2.2 UV–vis determination of acidity The measurement of the acidic scale of PHS, PN and ATN is conducted using an Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer with a basic indicator (4-nitroaniline) [25] With the increase of the acidic scale of the ionic liquid, the molar absorptivity of 4-nitroaniline decreases. The difference in the absorbance after the addition of a Brønsted acidic ionic liquid is determined. Then the Hammett function ( H 0 , regarded as the relative acidity of the IL) is calculated using Eq. (1). (1) H 0 = p K ( I ) a q + log I s IH + s where p K (I) aq is the pK A value of the indicator referred to an aqueous solution. IH + s and I s are the molar concentrations of the protonated and unprotonated forms of the indicator, respectively. According to Lambert-Beer’s law, the value of I s / IH + s can be determined and calculated from the UV–vis spectrum. The maximal absorbance of unprotonated form of 4-nitroaniline is observed at 378 nm in deionized water solutions. The p K (I) aq value of 4-nitroaniline is 0.99."
4,Batch synthesis of biodiesel,"2.3 Batch synthesis of biodiesel For biodiesel synthesis (Scheme 2 ), oleic acid (1.77 g, 6.3 × 10–3 mol) and ionic liquid (5, 7, 10, 12 and 15 wt% with respect to the mass of oleic acid) are placed in a three-necked round bottom flask of 0.020 l capacity. The latter is equipped with a condenser, a port for sample withdrawal and a thermometer. Mixing of the reaction fluids is performed by a magnetic stirrer. To investigate effect of the initial alcohol-to-acid molar ratio (M) on the biodiesel production, a known quantity of methanol (6.3, 20.1, 33.5, 43.9, 63.0 and 80.4 × 10–3 mol to reach M of 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 12.0 and 15.0, respectively) with respect to the oleic acid, separately heated to the set reaction temperature (55 °C) is added into the reactor. This time is considered as zero reaction time (t = 0). Catalytic performance of the most active sample in the biodiesel production at different reaction temperatures (25, 35 and 45 °C) is studied as well. For reaction progress monitoring, a sample (1.5 ml) is withdrawn at regular intervals of time (10 min) and immediately cooled in an ice bath. It is energetically centrifuged as two phases are formed and the desired product remained as an upper phase. A sample is withdrawn from the upper phase and mixed with methyl heptadecanoate (internal standard) before gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The mixture is analyzed by GC 7890A (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column HP-INNOWAX, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm. High purity helium at a flow rate of 0.0015 l/min is used as a carrier gas. The oven temperature is programmed at 70 °C for 2 min and then it is raised from an initial value of 70–190 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. The injector and detector temperature are maintained at 250 and 300 °C, respectively. The analytical uncertainty of GC is less than 4%, which is in accordance with the acceptable limits. The biodiesel yield is determined by means of the expression X A = C A 0 - C A / C A 0 , where, X A is oleic acid conversion, C A 0 is initial concentration (mol/l) of the oleic acid and C A corresponds to the concentration (mol/l) of oleic acid at given reaction time (t, min). It should be pointed out that the occurrence of side reactions (such as alcohol etherification) is not detected."
5,Reaction kinetics and thermodynamic calculations,"2.4 Reaction kinetics and thermodynamic calculations Since the reaction investigated in the current work is an interaction between a carboxylic acid (oleic acid) and alcohol (methanol), the biodiesel synthesis (Scheme 2) is assumed as a second-order reversible reaction and a pseudohomogeneous kinetic model (Eq. (2)) is used to interpret the experimental kinetic data. (2) - d C A d t = k 1 C A C Y - k 2 C B C Z where, C i ( i ≡ A , Y , B , Z ) corresponds to the concentration (mol/l) of oleic acid (A), methanol (Y), biodiesel (B) and water (Z) at given reaction time (t, min). k 1 and k 2 are the kinetic constants for the forward and backward reactions, respectively. At equilibrium conditions, the oleic acid conversion ( X A e ) could be calculated using Eq. (3). (3) K C = k 1 k 2 = C B e C Z e C A e C Y e = X A e 2 1 - X A e 2 A nonlinear least-squares method is used for estimation the forward rate constant via minimization of the sum of residual squares between the measured and calculated biodiesel yields. (4) SRS = ∑ samples x measured - x calculated 2 where, SRS abbreviates the minimum sum of residual squares and × is the biodiesel yield. When the k 1 values at different reaction temperatures are known, the activation energy ( E A , kJ/mol) and pre-exponential factor (A, l/mol × min) are established by means of Arrhenius's law: (5) ln k 1 = ln A - E A R T where, R is gas constant (8.314 J/mol × K) and T is absolute temperature (K). To determine enthalpy ( Δ H ≠ , kJ/mol) and entropy ( Δ S ≠ , J/mol × K) of activation of a given reaction, the Eyring's equation is applied. (6) ln k 1 T = ln k B h + Δ S ≠ R - Δ H ≠ RT where, k B is Bolzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 J/K) and h is Planck constant (6.63 × 10–34 J × s). If the experimental kinetic data ln k 1 / T are plotted versus 1 / T , the enthalpy of activation can be calculated from the slope - ( Δ H ≠ / R ) . The corresponding entropy of activation is obtained from the intercept ln k B / h + ( Δ S ≠ / R ) . Using the Δ H ≠ and Δ S ≠ values, the activation free energy barrier ( Δ G ≠ = Δ H ≠ - T Δ S ≠ , kJ/mol) for the process of biodiesel synthesis is revealed."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hammett acidity determination,"3.1 Hammett acidity determination The Hammett acidity for PHS, PN and ATN ionic liquids is shown graphically in Fig. 1 . The H0 values are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen, the PHS sample is characterized with the lowest H0 value, namely 1.62. In this regard, values of 1.84 and 2.56 are calculated as H0 in the case of PN and ATN, respectively. Knowing that the lower H 0 value, the higher acidity, among the ionic liquids studied in this paper, PHS possesses the highest acidity, followed by PN and ATN. To explain the different acidity extent, electronic (added as a supporting material, Fig. 4S) and molecular (added as a supporting material, Fig. 5S) structures of PN [26,27], ATN [28,29] and PHS [30,31] are considered. Electronic structures revealed that the most positive site in the ATN and PN samples is the hydrogen atom attached to a nitrogen one in the aromatic ring (pyridine or triazole), i.e. Npyr–H and Ntrzl–H. In contrary, the lowest electron density (most positive potential) in the ionic liquid PHS is located on the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen sulfate fragment, i.e. Ohs–H. Analyzing the molecular structure of the ionic liquid PN, it can be seen that the hydrogen atom in the Npyr–H fragment is involved in an interaction between the cation and anion moieties, namely Npyr–H···O–N. Although the Npyr–H···O–N interaction is referred as electrostatic in nature [27], the high electronegativity of oxygen atom causes the positive charge located on the hydrogen atom to increase in some extent. Unlike PN, electron density amount on the hydrogen atom in Ntrzl–H fragment (ATN structure) is not affected by additional intramolecular interactions with a high electronegative atom. In other words, a more pronounced positive charge on the hydrogen atom in Npyr–H with respect to the hydrogen atom in Ntrzl–H is formed. We believe that the superior positive potential on the hydrogen atom in Npyr–H is responsible for the higher acidity of PN in comparison with that of ATN. Molecular geometry of the ion pair PHS clearly shows that the active hydrogen atom in the anion [HSO4]– moiety is strongly attached to an oxygen atom (Ohs–H). As a consequence, an intensive electron density transfer (H → O) toward the oxygen atom is occurred. Notably higher positive charge located on the active hydrogen atom in PHS in comparison with that located on the active hydrogen atoms in PN and ATN can explain its higher acidity."
8,Catalyst selection,"3.2 Catalyst selection Influence of the catalyst nature (PHS, PN and ATN) on the biodiesel production is investigated at 55 °C, initial methanol-to-oleic acid molar ratio of 7.0 and 10 wt% catalyst loading. The results are presented in Fig. 2 A. For comparison, the blank reaction (without a catalyst) is added as well. It is established that the oleic acid methylation without a catalyst leads to a biodiesel yield of 0.61% after 70 min reaction time. In other words, a biodiesel synthesis is practically not occurred in the absence of a catalyst. However, the addition of ATN and PN caused the biodiesel yield to increase up to 4.26 and 12.31%, respectively. Nevertheless, the effect of catalyst presence on the biodiesel production is visible in the greatest extent when the ion pair PHS is used. For instance, a remarkably higher value of 53.33% (with respect to nitrate anion-based ionic liquids) is observed as a biodiesel yield in that case. Similar data are observed in a work of Gao et al. [9], where [MimN(CH2)4SO3H]+[HSO4]–, [PyN(CH2)4SO3H]+[HSO4]– and [(C2H5)3N(CH2)4SO3H]+[HSO4]– are used as catalysts for oleic acid methylation. As a result, values of 54, 55 and 57% are registered as a biodiesel yield, respectively. Superior catalytic behavior of PHS in comparison with ATN and PN is confirmed by the calculated forward rate constants. Indeed, valued kinetic constant for blank reaction, ATN, PN and PHS at given reaction conditions is 0.041, 0.34, 1.06 and 7.75 × 10–3 l/mol × min, respectively. The linear behavior (Fig. 2B) between measured and calculated yields of biodiesel shows that the kinetics of biodiesel synthesis can be successfully described by Eq. (4). To describe the enhanced biodiesel yield in the presence of ATN, PN and PHS, the mechanism of a carboxylic acid (oleic acid in this paper) activation in the presence of an acidic catalyst is taking into account. Acidic activation of a carboxylic acid proceeds via protonation of the carbonyl‑oxygen due to proton (H+) transfer from the catalyst toward the substrate [30,32]. As a consequence, an active complex due to a carboxylic acid-catalyst interaction is obtained. Hence, the hydrogen bonds (Ntrzl–H, Npyr–H and Ohs–H) formed between the active hydrogen atoms in the catalysts (PHS, PN and ATN) and the carbonyl‑oxygen in the fatty acid are proposed as a possible reason for the promoted biodiesel production. It was presented earlier that both the biodiesel yield (12.31%) and the forward rate constant (1.06 × 10–3 l/mol × min) of biodiesel synthesis in the presence of PN are about three times higher than these (4.06% and 0.36 × 10–3 l/mol × min) registered for ATN. In light of this, notably more pronounced k 1 (7.75 × 10–3 l/mol × min) and biodiesel yield (53.33%) are recorded in the case of PHS-catalyzed reaction. These effects can be directly connected with higher Hammett acidity of PHS (1.62) with respect to that of PN (1.84) and especially ATN (2.56). Since, the catalytic activity of PHS in the reaction of biodiesel production is notably superior than that of ATN and PN, it is preferred as a catalyst for further kinetic and thermodynamic studies. Considering that a value less than 1% characterizes the biodiesel yield for the non-catalyzed reaction, the latter will be no longer taking into account in this work."
9,Reusability of the catalyst,"3.3 Reusability of the catalyst The feasibility and sustainable development of any catalytic process depends on the reusability of the catalyst. This is applied for the PHS sample. The recyclability of PHS catalyst includes following procedure. At the end of the reaction progress, two phases are formed – upper one, which consists the desired product and lower one that contains water and dissolved catalyst. When the aqueous solution of PHS is separated from the reaction mixture by decantation, the catalyst reusability proceeds via the procedure described in section 2.1., where the aqueous solution of pyridinium hydrogen sulfate is distillated by means of rotary evaporator at 60 °C under reduced pressure (0.050 MPa) and the product is dried at the same conditions for 8 h until the residue mass remained constant. After cooling, the solid is washed for three times with diethyl ether (0.100 l). To ensure that there are no other chemical residues in the sample to affect the calculation of catalyst recovery, the regeneration of PHS is conducted by vaporization in vacuum (0.050 MPa) at 60 °C for 1.5 h. The catalyst recycle results are shown in Table 2 . It can be seen that no obvious change is observed on the recovered catalytic activity and quantity after five cycles completed. The slight decrease in the yield of biodiesel should be ascribed to the slight loss of PHS due to the transferring of samples during the regeneration."
10,Equilibrium constant and reaction enthalpy,"3.4 Equilibrium constant and reaction enthalpy Biodiesel synthesis investigated in the current work is a reversible reaction and the conversion of the substrate is highly affected by the chemical equilibrium, even at a large alcohol-to-acid molar ratio [33]. Hence, the equilibrium constant (composition of the system at equilibrium) needs to be known. Based on the equilibrium reactants concentrations, the equilibrium constant (K C) values of the biodiesel synthesis at different reaction temperatures are obtained according to Eq. (3). It is revealed that K C rises with the reaction temperature increasing, which means that the biodiesel synthesis is an endothermic reaction. Hence, values of 3.343, 3.747, 4.218 and 4.773 are exposed as K C at reaction temperature of 25, 35, 45 and 55 °C, respectively (Table 3 ). The K C values registered in this paper correlate well with the generally accepted statement that the equilibrium constant of esterification reactions varies within 0–10 [34]. Vojtko and co-authors [35] and Sarlo et al. [36] analyzed the esterification of secondary alkan-2-ols with acetic acid at 60 °C using H2SO4 as a catalyst and reported for K C values between 0.23 and 3.85. In another work, a kinetic study of the esterification of lactic acid by ethanol at 70, 75 and 80 °C in the presence of Preyssler acid exposed equilibrium constant of 0.044, 0.053 and 0.055, respectively [37]. Hassan and Vinjamur [38] evaluate the kinetics of sulfuric acid-catalyzed oleic acid methylation at 40, 50 and 55 °C. As a result, K C values of 1.53, 1.67 and 1.91, respectively are revealed. Temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant, expressed by means of the classical relation of van't Hoff (Eq. (7)), allows the enthalpy and entropy of a given reaction to be determined. (7) ln K C = - Δ H r ° RT + Δ S r ° R where Δ H r ° (kJ/mol) is the standard enthalpy change of a reaction and Δ S r Â° (J/mol × K) is the change in entropy of the reaction system. Standard enthalpy represents the amount of absorbed/released heat in a reaction, i.e. it indicates whether a reaction is endothermic/exothermic in nature. A plot of the equilibrium constant ( ln K C ) as a function of the reaction temperature ( 1 / T ) is given in Fig. 3 . As a result, a line with a negative slop of ( - Δ H r ° / R ) and an intercept of ( Δ S r ° / R ) is obtained. The negative slop confirms that the reaction of biodiesel synthesis is endothermic in nature, being revealed by K C increasing with the reaction temperature. Based on Eq. (7), Δ S r ° and Δ H r ° are calculated as 42.32 J/mol × K and 9.64 kJ/mol, respectively. The positive Δ S r ° value is another indication that the reaction temperature increasing favors the reaction of biodiesel production. It is well known that the standard enthalpy change ( Δ H r ° ) of any reaction can be calculated from the standard enthalpies of formation ( Δ H f ° ) of reactants and products using Hess's law (Eq. (8)) as well [39]. (8) Δ H r ° = ∑ Δ H f ° products - ∑ Δ H f ° reac tan t s Scheme 2 showed that the reactants for biodiesel production in the present paper are oleic acid (OA) and methanol (MT), while methyl oleate (MO) and water (W) are the respective products. These are characterized with experimental Δ H f ° values of –764.8 (OA), –238.4 (MT), –726.9 (MO) and –285.6 (W) kJ/mol [40,41], which means that the experimental Δ H r ° (in accordance with Eq. (8)) for biodiesel (methyl oleate synthesis) is 9.28 kJ/mol. It is obvious that the Δ H r ° (9.64 kJ/mol) obtained via plot of ln K C versus 1 / T is practically identical to that calculated from the standard enthalpies of formation. Knowing the Δ H r ° and Δ S r ° values, Gibbs free energy ( Δ G r ° ) at different reaction temperature is found by means of the relation Δ G r ° = Δ H r ° - T Δ S r ° . Thus, the reaction of biodiesel synthesis at 25, 35, 45 and 55 °C is characterized with Δ G r ° values of –2.971, –3.394, –3.818 and –4.241 kJ/mol, respectively. If the K C is applied for Δ G r ° calculation (via the expression Δ G r ° = - R T ln K C ), undistinguishable Δ G r ° values are obtained, namely –2.991, –3.383, –3.805 and –4.262 kJ/mol. Analyzing Δ G r ° as a function of the reaction temperature, an inverse trend is observed – Δ G r ° reduces with temperature increasing. Considering that reacting systems are characterized with a minimum of the Gibbs free energy [42], the Δ G r ° diminishing with reaction temperature rising is another conformation that elevated temperatures favors the biodiesel production."
11,Influence of the catalyst loading,"3.5 Influence of the catalyst loading In the previous subsection was noted that the rate determine step in a catalyzed esterification process is a substrate-catalyst interaction, which leads to formation of an active complex (a protonated form of the substrate) [43]. Since a high value described the substrate concentration at the start of the esterification reaction, a great number of active complexes should be expected as well. However, the substrate concentration decreases during reaction progress, which overturns the active complex formation and the catalyst loading ( L cat ) becomes poorer. Thus, to increase the overall reactants conversion, L cat plays a major role. Effect of L cat (5–15 wt%) on the biodiesel yield (Fig. 4A) and the rate constant is investigated at initial reactants molar ratio of 7.0 and reaction temperature of 55 °C. A correlation between measured and calculated biodiesel yields is presented in Fig. 4B. Results revealed that the usage of small amounts (5 wt%) of PHS catalyst improves notably the oleic acid methylation, being observed by remarkably improved biodiesel yield from 0.61 (non-catalyzed reaction) to 48.69%. It is found that increasing of the PHS amount up to 7 wt% promotes the reaction of oleic acid methylation insufficiently, where a value of 50.28% is registered as an ester yield. However, the latter reached a value of 52.97% when the biodiesel synthesis is conducted in the presence of L cat = 10 wt%. It is interesting to point out that further increasing of the catalyst loading up to 12 and 15 wt% practically does not change the main product (biodiesel) yield. Indeed, values of 53.23 and 53.62% are exposed as a biodiesel yield in the case of 12 and 15 wt% PHS, respectively. Based on the latter, we definite 10 wt% of PHS as optimal L cat in the biodiesel production. Improver biodiesel yield when the PHS amount increases is related to formation of a greater number of active carbonyl complexes (more species of protonated substrate). This statement correlates well with a work of Wanchoo and co-authors [44], where a methyl propionate synthesis is investigated at 60 °C in the presence of Amberlyst 15 (catalyst). A notably promoted carboxylic acid conversion is registered when the catalyst loading varies within 32.87–65.80 g/l due to an enhanced number of H+ ions, available for substrate activation. Findings that: (i) the presence of a catalyst favors notably the biodiesel production and (ii) 10 wt% of PHS is optimal L cat are confirmed by the calculated forward reaction rate constant. For example, a k 1 value of 6.69 × 10–3 l/mol × min is obtained of the reaction of biodiesel synthesis in the presence of 5 wt% PHS, which is more than 160 times higher than k 1 (0.040 × 10–3 l/mol × min) of the blank reaction (Table 3). In light of this, the forward rate constant (7.12 × 10–3 l/mol × min) of biodiesel production with L cat of 7 wt% is insignificantly higher than that of the process conducted with L cat = 5 wt%. However, usage of 10 wt% PHS catalyst causes the k 1 to increase with about 10% (up to 7.75 × 10–3 l/mol × min). For reaction conducted in the presence of 12 and 15 wt% PHS, values of 7.82 and 7.92 × 10–3 l/mol × min, respectively are exposed as a forward rate constant. Comparing the k 1 values as a function of the catalyst loading (Fig. 5), it is established that the forward rate constant of biodiesel production with L cat within 10–15 wt% varies to a much lesser extent (0.17 × 10–3 l/mol × min) with respect to k 1 (1.06 × 10–3 l/mol × min) of reaction in the presence of L cat between 5 and 10 wt%. The latter agrees well with the above statement that 10 wt% is the optimal amount of PHS catalyst for biodiesel production. Analyzing the linear regressions in Fig. 5, it can be seen that for a reaction of biodiesel synthesis without a catalyst (x-axis of zero), values of 0.0478 and 0.0103 × 10–3 l/mol × min are obtained as k 1 and k 2, respectively. These agree well with the k 1 (0.0457 × 10–3 l/mol × min) and k 2 (0.0096 × 10–3 l/mol × min) values (Table 3)."
12,Influence of the initial reactants molar ratio,"3.6 Influence of the initial reactants molar ratio High reverse nature of the esterification process suggests the presence of a large amount of the reactants in the equilibrium mixture. To increase the overall reactants conversion (ester yield) during esterification, approaches based on the Le Chatelier's principle are applied [45]. The most popular ones are: (i) usage of alcohol in a large excess with respect to the carboxylic acid and (ii) physically sequestering water. The latter can be achieved by adding desiccants (such as anhydrous MgSO4 or molecular sieves) or by continuous removal of water by distillation, often facilitated by a Dean-Stark apparatus. The simultaneous application of these methods (a large alcohol excess and removal of water) during esterification is usually applied in the industrial productions. To know the effect of reactants quantities on the biodiesel production, an initial methanol-to-oleic acid ratio in a wide interval (1.0–15.0) is investigated in the current work (Fig. 6 A). A correlation between measured and calculated biodiesel yields is presented in Fig. 6B. Results showed that the biodiesel yield increases linearly with the methanol-to-oleic acid ratio variety within 1.0–7.0. In details, values of 28.76, 34.63, 40.73 and 46.69 are registered as a biodiesel yield at M of 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0, respectively. The forward rate constants are calculated to be 1.79 (M = 1.0), 2.91 (M = 3.0), 4.42 (M = 5.0) and 7.75 × 10–3 l/mol × min (M = 7.0) (Table 3). Promoted biodiesel yield and rate constant at M = 7.0 in comparison with those obtained at M = 1.0 are related to the high overall reactants concentration, which shifts the reaction equilibrium toward the products. In other words, the excess of alcohol causes a greater amount of the substrate to react. When M is changed from 7.0 to 10.0, a biodiesel yield of 47.58% is achieved. It is interesting to point out that a plateau characterizes the reaction curve at M within 7.0–10.0, which proposes that an optimal methanol-to-oleic acid ratio is achieved. It is confirmed by the biodiesel yield at M of 12.0 and 15.0, which is found to be lower in comparison with that at M of 7.0 and 10.0. For instance, values of 44.12 and 39.42% are registered as a biodiesel yield, respectively. Decreased biodiesel amount at a methanol-to-oleic acid ratio above 12.0 assumes that a certain (critical) oleic acid concentration is achieved. The substrate concentration at M values within 7.0–10.0 is between 1.782 and 1.428 mol/l, while the methanol concentration varies from 11.676 to 17.819 mol/l. We proposed that above the critical alcohol concentration, a dilution effect on the carboxylic acid is occurred, which reduces both the biodiesel yield and the reaction rate. Similar results are presented in a work of Saidutta et al. [46], where the kinetics of acetic acid esterification with methanol in the presence of ion exchange resin catalysts is studied. The authors reported that the acetic acid concentration in the reactor is significantly reduced at alcohol concentration above 10 mol/l and it (acetic acid) is slightly available for reaction."
13,Influence of the reaction temperature,"3.7 Influence of the reaction temperature Effect of the reaction temperature on the methyl oleate yield and kinetic constant under catalyzed (Fig. 6A and A1) and non-catalyzed (Fig. 7 A) conditions is investigated in the temperature interval from 25 to 55 °C, reactants molar ratio of 7.0 and 10 wt% of PHS catalyst. A correlation between measured and calculated biodiesel yields is presented in Fig. 7B. It is exposed that a biodiesel yield of 17.27% and a forward rate constant of 1.57 × 10–3 l/mol × min characterize the process of oleic acid methylation at 25 °C. The reaction temperature increasing up to 35, 45 and 55 °C is found to promote the oleic acid methylation, since values of 29.26, 41.25and 53.33% are registered as a biodiesel yield, respectively. In addition, the forward rate constants are calculated to be 3.07 (35 °C), 5.06 (45 °C) and 7.75 × 10–3 l/mol × min (55 °C). The respective backward rate constants can be easily obtained by means of Eq. (3). Favored biodiesel production and rate constant with rise in temperature is related to that the elevated temperature helps the reactant molecules to obtain adequate energy to cross the energy barrier [47]. In this sense, the biodiesel synthesis is endothermic in nature, as it was noted earlier. Although the process of biodiesel production is denoted as an endothermic reaction in the present work, quite different point of views about the influence of temperature on reactants conversion (equilibrium constant) in terms of esterification are present in the literature. For example, the kinetics of acetic acid methylation in the presence of Indion 130 catalyst and showed K C values of 5.0097, 6.5209 and 9.2646 at temperature of 60, 70 and 80 °C, respectively [46]. Based on these, the authors classify the acetic acid methylation as an endothermic reaction, as it is stated in our work for biodiesel synthesis. Unlike Saidutta et al. [46], Tao et al. [48] denoted the reaction of butyl acetate synthesis as exothermic in nature since the rise in temperature from 60 to 80 °C diminishes K C from 13.9313 to 12.9467. In other words, the increase in temperature shifts the system in the backward direction to alleviate the stress of additional heat. However, in the same work [48] it is shown that the rise in temperature improves the acetic acid conversion, which obviously contradicts above statement. Accordingly, the authors should term the esterification of acetic acid methylation as endothermic reaction rather than exothermic one. Thus, the statement that K C decreases with the rise in temperature seems very speculative. The lack of consensus about the temperature dependence of K C in terms of esterification reaction is confirmed by the work of Akyalçın and Altıokka [49], where octyl acetate synthesis in the presence of Amberlyst 36 catalyst is conducted. The authors reported for equilibrium constant of 60.7, which is independent of temperature within 60–80 °C. Temperature independence of K C is also noted in the case of heterogeneously catalyzed succinic acid esterification with ethanol [50]. Knowing the forward and backward rate constants at different reaction temperatures, the activation energy (E A) and pre-exponential factor (A) are calculated from Eq. (5) by plotting lnk versus 1/T (Fig. 8 A). Hence, values of 43.09 and 33.31 kJ/mol are calculated as activation energies for forward ( E A f ) and backward ( E A b ) catalyzed reactions, respectively. In light of this, A f and A b are established to be 91.29 and 29.35 × 105 l/mol × min, respectively. It is obvious that the activation energy of the forward reaction in about 25% higher than that of the backward one, which can be explained as follows. During the course of a given reaction, there exists an intermediate stage (transition state), where chemical bonds are partially broken and partially formed. This transition state is at a higher energy level than the starting reactants and it is very unstable. The energy required to reach this transition state is called activation energy. In the case of an endothermic reaction (such as oleic acid methylation), the reactants are at a lower energy level compared to the products. It means that a higher energy (E A) is required to force the reaction in the forward direction in accordance with the relation E A f = E A b + Δ H r ° . Based on the latter, the difference (9.78 kJ/mol) between E A f and E A b is found to be identical to the calculated reaction enthalpy ( Δ H r ° ), namely 9.64 kJ/mol. As the pre-exponential factor takes into account the number of effective impacts between reactants in a chemical process, a remarkably higher A f value (91.29 × 105 l/mol × min) with respect to A b (29.35 × 105 l/mol × min) agrees well with notably more pronounced forward rate constant than backward one. Speaking for activation energy and transition state, enthalpy ( Δ H ≠ ) and entropy ( Δ S ≠ ) of activation for the reaction of biodiesel synthesis are calculated as well (Fig. 8B). For that purpose, Eq. (6) is applied. It is found that values of 40.49 kJ/mol and –162.31 J/mol × K characterize Δ H ≠ and Δ S ≠ , respectively of the forward reaction. As expected lower Δ H ≠ (30.71 kJ/mol) and Δ S ≠ (–224.27 J/mol × K) are calculated in the case of the backward reaction. It is well known that the Δ S ≠ equals the change in entropy when the reactants change from their initial state to the transition state [51]. In other words, Δ S ≠ provides clues about the molecularity of the rate determining step in a reaction. Negative Δ S ≠ value indicates that entropy decreases on forming the transition state, which shows an associative mechanism in which two reaction partners form a single activated complex. It confirms above statement that the biodiesel synthesis includes formation of transition state through oleic acid-catalyst interaction. Knowing the Δ H ≠ and Δ S ≠ values, Gibbs free energy of activation ( Δ G ≠ = Δ H ≠ - T Δ S ≠ ) can be easily found. Thus, Δ G ≠ for the forward reaction at temperature of 25, 35, 45 and 55 °C is calculated to be 88.858, 90.481, 92.104 and 93.727 kJ/mol, respectively (Table 3). Considering that the bonds cleavage during a chemical reaction requires a certain amount of energy, positive Δ G ≠ values are expected. Increased Δ G ≠ value with rise of the reaction temperature indicates that elevated temperature favors the biodiesel production. It was already assumed that the oleic acid activation in the presence of PHS catalyst proceeds via interaction between the carbonyl-oxygen in –COOH group and hydrogen atom in the anion fragment. Based on these findings, a plausible reaction mechanism of biodiesel production using PHS catalyst is offered (Scheme 3 ). According to Scheme 3, the substrate-catalyst interaction generates a protonated form of the oleic acid (step I), where after the activated oleic acid undergoes a nucleophilic attack by a lone electron pair on the oxygen atom in methanol molecule (step II). Then, intramolecular hydrogen transfer occurs, which results in a water removal (step III). In the final stage, a proton is removed by reaction with the deprotonated form of the catalyst (step IV), followed by biodiesel production."
14,Conclusions,"Reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and optimal reaction conditions of biodiesel (methyl oleate) synthesis in the presence of the acidic ionic liquids pyridinium hydrogen sulfate (PHS), pyridinium nitrate (PN) and 4-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate (ATN) as catalysts is carried out. Hydrogen atom attached to aromatic N influence the catalytic activity of ATN and PN, while the H atom in [HSO4]– affects the catalytic performance of PHS. PHS favors the biodiesel production in the greatest extent due to a lower electron density on H atom in [HSO4]–. Superior catalytic activity of PN than ATN is related to an additional cation–anion hydrogen bonding. The catalyst reusability is investigated for five cycles and no obvious changes in the catalytic activity are observed. The catalyst loading ( L cat ) within 5–10 wt% increases the biodiesel yield due to a higher number of active carbonyl complexes. However, L cat between 12 and 15 wt% does not change the biodiesel production. Optimal initial reactants molar ratio (M) is achieved between 7.0 and 10.0, where a plateau is found to characterize the reaction curve. Biodiesel yield and kinetic constant decrease at M within 12.0–15.0 due to a dilution effect. Reaction temperature variety from 25 to 55 °C improves the biodiesel production since the reactant molecules gained adequate energy to cross the energy barrier. Hence, values of 43.09 kJ/mol and 91.29 × 105 l/mol × min are calculated as E A f and A f , respectively. Δ S r ° and Δ H r ° for the process of biodiesel synthesis are found to be 42.32 J/mol × K and 9.64 kJ/mol, respectively. Moreover, Δ H ≠ (40.49 kJ/mol) and Δ S ≠ (–162.31 J/mol × K) are established as well. The respective Δ G r ° (–4.241 kJ/mol) and Δ G ≠ (93.727 kJ/mol) at reaction temperature of 55 °C are obtained. The present results are expected to pave a way for future experimental and theoretical studies on acidic ionic liquids, as well as to further reveal clues to the design and application of novel ionic liquid catalysts for target reactions."
