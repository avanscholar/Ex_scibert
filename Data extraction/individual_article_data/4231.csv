0,Introduction,"The formation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEXs) is important because of their use in many industries, such as the polymer, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and dyeing. BTEXs were produced conventionally by crude oil refinery or catalytic reforming. On the other hand, other approaches are required for BTEXs production, due to the accelerated fossil fuel shortage [1]. Alternative technology for producing BTEXs from waste or biomass is being investigated intensively by many researchers [2]. Among the various kinds of technology for BTEXs production, pyrolysis is considered as a candidate method, because it can produce large amounts of oil with minimal environmental contamination [3]. Although large amounts of bio-oil can be obtained by biomass pyrolysis, the additional use of a catalyst is required to produce BTEXs [4]. The direct use of biomass pyrolysis oil can also be considered from the viewpoint of the process, but its practical use is limited by its high viscosity, acidity, instability, and low calorific value [5]. Various kinds of catalysts, such as zeolites [6] and metal oxides [7], were applied in this regard. However, the BTEXs production from the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is limited together with the short catalyst lifetime [8]. In addition, low hydrogen to effective carbon ratio (H/Ceff) of biomass with a high oxygen content is one of the main reasons for the low BTEXs yield [9]. It can also cause significant coke formation, reducing the catalyst lifetime [10]. Recently, the co-feeding of hydrogen sufficient feedstocks, such as waste plastics i.e. polyethylene [11], low density polyethylene [12], polypropylene [13], polyethylene terephthalate [14], as well as waste cooking oil [15], stearic acid [16] and methane [17]were reported to be a simple and effective method to increase the overall yields of BTEXs on the catalytic pyrolysis process of biomass. Oil sludge (OS) also can consider as a potential feedstock as the co-feeding agent in biomass pyrolysis, due to its high carbon and hydrogen contents [18]. OS is a residual heavy oil mixture that remains in the oil reservoir tank and is discarded as waste regularly during the oil tank maintenance period [19]. During the production, storage, transportation, and refining processes, OS is generated and designated as a hazardous material because of its toxicity, potential carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity [20]. The conversion of OS to value-added products via catalytic pyrolysis is considerable not only because of increasing need for clean fuels but also due to legal prohibition of typical organic waste disposal methods, such as incineration and landfill [21]. Therefore, utilization of OS for the production of bio-fuel as an additional renewable carbon source could be an ecofriendly disposal strategy. Several researchers have investigated the feasibility of the bio-fuel production from OS via catalytic pyrolysis. Bellahcene et al. [22] performed the catalytic pyrolysis of OS over TiO2 and Al2O3 catalysts and compared the elemental components and other physicochemical properties of the pyrolysis oil (such as viscosity, density, high heating value and etc.) with those of commercial diesel fuels. Their results indicated that the obtained oil was rich in oxygen and practically free of sulfur, and therefore the oil can be used as a diesel blend. In another study, Prashanth et al. [23] reported the enhanced selectivity of xylenes, ethylbenzene and other benzene derivatives in the oil from catalytic pyrolysis of OS with HZSM-5, as well as the reduction in O/C ratio and the improvement in the H/C ratio of the oil, thereby improving its fuel quality to be used directly as a diesel fuel. In recent years, several studies performed the co-pyrolysis of OS and various waste materials, for instance, polyolefin [24] and HDPE [25] as well as wheat straw, peanut straw, and coconut shell [26]. These studies concluded that the co-processing of OS and other organic wastes results in the positive synergy in the production of high-quality biofuels. However, the synergetic effect of OS co-feeding to the biomass catalytic pyrolysis has not been investigated yet. In the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose (CE) biomass, repeated dehydration reactions convert CE to olefins, which can be subsequently transformed to BTEXs via oligomerization, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer reactions [27]. However, in CE catalytic co-pyrolysis with OS, extra OS-derived olefins can significantly raise the BTEXs formation through the Diels-Alder reaction with CE-derived furans [28]. Hence, in this study the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE and OS was performed, for the first time, to demonstrate the feasibility of OS as the co-feeding feedstock of biomass for BTEXs production. Fig. 1 presents the experimental procedure of this study. Different catalysts, i.e., HZSM-5, Ni/HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and Al-MCM-41, were applied to investigate the effects of catalyst acidity and porosity on BETX production. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a model-free kinetic analysis were performed to examine the non-isothermal decomposition behaviors of CE and OS. Py-GC/MS was also used to compare the amount of BTEXs production from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE and OS with that produced by individual catalytic pyrolysis."
1,Material and methods,
2,CE and OS,"2.1 CE and OS Microcrystalline CE powder (particle size <20 μm) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and OS was obtained from an oil company in Korea. The OS sample was dried before the experiments under N2 environment at 110 °C for 2 h. Table 1 lists the results of proximate and ultimate analysis of used feedstocks and the calculated H/Ceff values. Although OS has larger moisture and fixed carbon contents than CE, its C and H contents were much larger. This highlights the potential use of OS as the feedstock on the catalytic pyrolysis of CE as its calculated H/Ceff value (1.68) is higher than that of CE (0.02)."
3,Catalysts,"2.2 Catalysts The catalysts used in this study were HZSM-5, HBeta, and HY, which are zeolites with strong acidity and micropores. All zeolites were purchased from Zeolyst. Al-MCM-41 is a mesoporous material with the mild acidity. It was purchased from ACS material. In addition, Ni was added to the HZSM-5 to modify its acid sites [30]. Ni/HZSM-5 was prepared by an impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) as a Ni precursor according to the procedure reported in other literature [31]. All catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in air before the experiment and kept in a desiccator. Table 2 lists the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, pore size, and surface area of the catalysts. In order to determine the acidity of catalysts, the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was performed. For this, all catalysts were heated to 500 °C under helium conditions (30 ml/min) to remove the adsorbed compounds, and then NH3 was absorbed after cooling the catalysts to 100 °C. Afterward, the catalysts were heated from 100 °C to 650 °C (10 °C/min) and emitted NH3 was detected by TCD under helium conditions (30 ml/min) [33]. According to NH3-TPD results (Fig. 2 ), all catalysts have weak-strength acid sites, which exhibited ammonia desorption peaks below 200 °C. Regarding the strong Brønsted acid sites, HBeta and HY have ammonia desorption peaks at approximately 350 °C, while HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 have peaks at 400 and 390 °C, respectively. This suggests that the Brønsted acid strength of HZSM-5 is stronger than HBeta and HY. In particular, at below 300 °C, Ni/HZSM-5 produced more Lewis sites than HZSM-5, and the peak temperature shifted slightly to the higher temperature region of 180–190 °C, indicating the formation of new Lewis sites upon the introduction of Ni. The number of Brønsted sites was decreased by Ni addition. Al-MCM-41 showed very broad and weak peaks for ammonia desorption than the other catalysts, indicating that the strength and number of acid sites are very weak compared to other catalysts."
4,Kinetic analysis,"2.3 Kinetic analysis TGA for the thermal and catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE and OS (CE/OS) was performed by heating 0.8 mg of a CE/OS mixture blended with 1.6 mg of catalyst (catalyst/sample: 2/1) non-isothermally from 40 °C to 700 °C at different heating ratios, 10, 20, and 30 °C/min, under a nitrogen flow rate of 50 ml/min using a TG analyzer (Pyris 1 TGA/PerkinElmer). In this study, the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall (OFW) method [34] was used to calculate the apparent activation energy at each conversion degree (α) during the thermal and catalytic co-TGA of CE/OS. Briefly, the values of α were calculated using equation (1). Eq. (1) α = ( m 0 – m ) / ( m 0 – m f ) where m, m0, and mf are the instantaneous, initial, and ultimate mass, respectively. Accordingly, the conversion rate (dα/dt) is expressed as follows: Eq. (2) dα / dt = k ( T ) f ( α ) where k(T) is the pyrolysis rate constant and f (α) is the reaction model function; k(T) depends on the temperature and can described with the Arrhenius Law as equation (3): Eq. (3) k ( T ) = A 0 exp ( E a /RT ) where A0, Ea, R, T are the pre-exponential factor (min−1), activation energy (kJ/mol), gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and absolute temperature (K), respectively. Considering equation (3), the rate of conversion (Eq. (2)) could be written as follows: Eq. (4) d α / dt = A 0 exp ( − E a / RT ) f ( α ) By introducing the heating rate (β = dT/dt) to equation (4) and after a simple integration, equation (5) will be yielded. Eq. (5) g ( α ) = ∫ 0 α dα / f ( α ) = ( A / β ) ∫ T f T 0 exp ( − E a / RT ) dT = ( AE a / βR ) p ( u ) where g(α) is the conversion function of the thermokinetic decomposition of biomass at a specified heating rate. T0 and Tf are the initial and final temperatures, respectively and p(u) is an approximation for the temperature integral equation with u = Ea/RT. Since p(u) has no analytical solution, it is needed to employ a mathematical approximation to calculate the kinetic parameters. The OFW method is based on Doyle's approximation and can be applied to resolve equation (5), which resulted as following: Eq. (6) ln ( β ) = − 1.052 E a / RT + [ ln AE a / R − 5.331 − lng ( α ) ] The E values for each conversion degree (α) could be determined by calculating the slope of ln (β) versus 1/T plot (equation (6))."
5,Py-GC/MS analysis,"2.4 Py-GC/MS analysis The thermal and catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS and their product analysis were performed using pyrolyzer (Py-2020iD, Frontier Lab., Ltd., Japan)-gas chromatography (7890A, Agilent Tech.)/mass spectrometry (5975 Inert) system (Py-GC/MS) (Fig. 3 ). For thermal pyrolysis, 0.8 mg of CE, OS, and their mixture with different blending ratios (CE/OS; 3/1, 1/1, and 1/3) were flash pyrolyzed at 600 °C using a pyrolysis heater. The product vapor was analyzed after transfer to the GC coupled directly with the pyrolyzer according to the analytical condition shown in Table S1 (Supplementary materials). For the catalytic pyrolysis of CE/OS, 1.6 mg of catalyst was mixed with the sample (Catalyst/sample: 2/1) and was pyrolyzed at 600 °C; the same analysis conditions (Table S1) were applied. The chemical species of the products were identified by the NIST 8th library, and their formation amounts were compared indirectly by comparing the peak area of each chemical. All the experiments were repeated 3 times to obtain more accurate data, and the reported results are the average values."
6,Results and discussion,
7,TGA,"3.1 TGA Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the TGA and derivative TGA curves for the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of CE/OS (1/1) over HZSM-5, Ni/HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and Al-MCM-41. The thermal TG curve of CE/OS revealed three decomposition stages: 1st up to 300 °C, 2nd 300–360 °C, and 3rd 360–700 °C. Based on Kim et al. [9], the main decomposition of CE occurs between 256 and 410 °C, and is not changed significantly using HZSM-5 and HY. This suggests that the 1st and 3rd decomposition regions of the non-catalytic DTG curve of CE/OS were due mainly to the decomposition of OS, while the 2nd decomposition region can be assigned to CE. On the other hand, the summed conversion (X) for the 1st (from 0 to 0.3) and 3rd (from 0.9 to 1.0) was only about 0.3, suggesting that the 2nd decomposition peaks include the contribution from both CE and OS. Using the catalysts, the intensity of the maximum decomposition peak on the DTG curve of OS decreased, while the peak intensity on the DTG curves below 200 °C increased together with the appearance of new DTG peaks between 200 and 300 °C. An increase in peak intensity below 200 °C with the addition of catalysts indicates that the decomposition of OS is accelerated through the cracking reaction over the acid sites of the catalysts. Moreover, the catalytic DTG curve of CE/OS over HY showed the highest peak intensity and lowest maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax, Table 3 ) between 200 and 300 °C, followed by that over HBeta, Ni/HZSM-5, HZSM-5, and Al-MCM-41. This order coincides with the pore size of the microporous catalysts (HY, HBeta, and HZSM-5), suggesting the catalytic cracking of OS can proceed when the applied catalyst can provide an appropriate pore size, allowing the diffusion of OS molecules to the catalyst pore [35]. Interestingly, the catalytic DTG curve of CE/OS over Ni/HZSM-5 had lower Tmax values for the 2nd and 3rd decomposition regions. This suggests that Ni can accelerate the decomposition of both OS and CE [36]. Although Al-MCM-41 has a much larger pore size than other catalysts, the peak height at the lower temperature was not increased at the lower temperature below 300 °C. This indicates that Al-MCM-41 can provide a pore size large enough to diffuse the reactant OS molecules; however, its much lower acidity limits the efficient cracking of OS compared to other catalysts used in this study [37]. The appearance of the maximum decomposition peak over Al-MCM-41 at temperatures higher than 380 °C suggests that the decomposition of OS molecules is difficult when low acidity Al-MCM-41 is used as the catalyst. Fig. 5 shows activation energy (Ea) at each conversion on the model-free kinetic analysis for thermal and catalytic TGA of CE/OS over various catalysts. The high linearity for the plots of ln(β) versus 1/T at each conversion rate for all TGA, shown in Fig. S1, suggests the appropriateness of the OFW method to kinetic analysis in this study, and the detailed Ea values were listed in Table S2. During TGA for the thermal decomposition of CE/OS, the Ea increased from 109 kJ/mol at 0.1 conversion to 171 kJ/mol at 0.4 conversion and was maintained at 172 kJ/mol up to conversion 0.9. This suggests that the Ea for the decomposition of OS was lower than those of CE. Ghalibaf et al. [38] reported that the Ea for the thermal decomposition of CE did not change significantly with conversion, showing a value of 150 ± 10 kJ/mol. The change tendencies of Ea for the catalytic TGA over all catalysts are very different from that for the thermal TGA of CE/OS. Over Ni/HZSM-5, HZSM-5, HBeta, and HY, the activation energies from 0.2 to 0.4 conversion were much lower than those for the thermal decomposition, suggesting their catalytic effects on lowering the Ea for the decomposition of OS. Although the Ea for the catalytic pyrolysis of CE/OS at conversions higher than 0.4 were still lower than those for thermal decomposition, they started to increase progressively with increasing conversion. Regarding the effect of different catalysts, the Ea for the reactions over HBeta and HY exhibited a steep increase at 0.5 conversion over HY and at 0.6 conversion over HBeta. In contrast, such a large increase was not observed over HZSM-5. The catalytic pyrolysis reaction properties can explain this. The HY and HBeta catalysts generate larger amounts of coke than HZSM-5 because of their large pore size and pore structure [39]. Table 4 lists the final residue amount (char + coke) after TGA. More residue was observed over HY and HBeta (2.22 and 2.73) than over HZSM-5 (0.79). Al-MCM-41, which has the largest pore size, exhibited the largest amount of residue. Overall, HZSM-5, which has the smallest pore size, produced the smallest amount of residue, resulting in the highest decomposition efficiency by lowering the Ea to the smallest values during the decomposition of CE/OS. In addition, the catalytic TGA of CE/OS over Ni/HZSM-5 revealed a much lower Ea than that over HZSM-5, particularly at a lower conversion than 0.5, confirming the additional role of Ni on the decomposition of OS during the pyrolysis of CE/OS [40]. The acid sites of HZSM-5 are good for breaking C–C bonds, while the Ni metal is active in cleaving C–H bonds through dehydrogenation. Therefore, the synergy of two active sites accelerates the decomposition kinetics of CE/OS over Ni/HZSM-5. Overall, adding Ni to HZSM-5 can improve the decomposition of CE/OS [41]."
8,Py-GC/MS analysis,"3.2 Py-GC/MS analysis 3.2.1 Catalytic pyrolysis of CE Fig. 6 shows the products distribution obtained from the thermal and catalytic Py-GC/MS analysis of CE over the catalysts at 600 °C. As expected, the thermal decomposition of CE produced a large amount of anhydrosugars, including levoglucosenone, 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-α-D-glucopyranose, levoglucosan, and 1,6 anhydro-β-D-glucofuranose. In particular, the peak area of levoglucosan, known as the typical pyrolyzate of cellulose [42], comprised 90% of the total peak area obtained from non-catalytic Py-GC/MS analysis. During the pyrolysis of cellulose, levoglucosan is generated and can be converted further to furans by increasing the reaction temperature [43]. In the present results, the amount of other oxygenates, such as furans, ketones, acids, aldehydes, and phenols, were increased at the expense of levoglucosan by the low acidity Al-MCM-41 catalyst. Yang et al. [44] reported that the yields of light olefins and aromatics on the catalytic pyrolysis of CE over MCM-41 were very low, and small oxygen-containing compounds were the major products of this reaction, even though a large number of oxygenated intermediate of CE pyrolysis can be diffused into the mesopores of MCM-41. This is probably due to the low acidity of Al-MCM-41, which is not sufficient for catalyzing the additional aromatization of these oxygenates. On the other hand, the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons formed, such as BTEXs, other mono aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), over strong acidity microporous zeolites, i.e., Ni/HZSM-5, HZSM-5, HBeta, and HY, increased with decreasing oxygenate contents. During the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass over acidic zeolites, the oxygenates are diffused into the catalyst pores and are converted to light olefins via various catalytic reactions, such as dehydration of alcohols, decarbonylation of aldehydes and ketones, and decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, with the emission of water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide [45]. The light olefins formed inside the catalyst pore generate a hydrocarbon pool and subsequently produce aromatic hydrocarbons. The overall deoxygenation and aromatics formation efficiency were the functions of the acidity and pore structure of the applied catalysts [46]. HZSM-5, having the highest acid strength and smallest pore size, produced the largest amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, followed in order by HBeta and HY. 3.2.2 Catalytic pyrolysis of OS Fig. 7 shows the carbon number distribution in the products obtained from thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of OS at 600 °C. Although the non-catalytic pyrolysis product of OS consisted of heavy hydrocarbons from C32 to C40, the catalytic pyrolysis of OS over all the catalysts except for Al-MCM-41 produced large amounts of short-chain gasoline-range hydrocarbons (<C11). The summed peak area for BTEXs, which were formed from the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of OS (Table 5 ), was largest over Ni/HZSM-5, followed in order by HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and Al-MCM-41. The BTEXs production efficiency from the catalytic pyrolysis of heavy wax was reported to be related to the catalyst's acidic properties and pore structure. The larger amount of BTEXs formation over HZSM-5 compared to those over HBeta and HY can be explained by the strong acidity, providing higher cracking efficiency and an appropriate pore size allowing optimal shape selectivity of the products [47]. Moreover, because linear hydrocarbons are the main products of OS pyrolysis, and their kinetic diameter is smaller than HZSM-5, the OS pyrolyzates can diffuse easily into the pores of the catalyst for further conversion to BTEXs. Despite the fact that the amount of acid sites in HBeta is highest, catalytic pyrolysis of OS over HBeta produced less amount of BTEXs than HZSM-5. This can be explained by its lower acid strength and less steric hindrance for aromatization than HZSM-5 [48]. In particular, the aromatic formation efficacy was correlated more with the acid strength of catalysts, showing that more acidic catalysts produce more aromatics. Among the microporous catalysts used in this study, HY with the least acidity (acid strength and acid amount) showed the lowest activity for aromatic production. In addition, Al-MCM-41, which has a lower acidity than HY, resulted in an even lower rate of BTEXs formation [35]. In this context, the much higher aromatic formation efficiency for Ni-impregnated HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 also can be explained by the varied acidic properties with Ni addition [49]. As shown in the NH3-TPD result, introducing nickel increased the number of weak acid sites of HZSM-5, but decreased the number of strong Brønsted acid sites. An increase in the number of weak acid sites indicates the formation of new Lewis acid-type sites [50], presumably due to the ion exchange of protons in HZSM-5 with Ni2+, leading to a decrease in Brønsted acidity. Therefore, a change in the relative distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acidity is likely the main reason for the enhanced BTEXs formation. The proper balance between Brønsted and Lewis acidity is the key to improve the aromatic yield from the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass because a cooperative effect between these two types of acidic sites is necessary for aromatic formation [51]. 3.2.3 Catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS Fig. 8 shows the product distribution for the thermal and catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS at 600 °C. The main products obtained from the individual catalytic pyrolysis of CE and OS were also monitored and compared with the catalytic co-pyrolysis results of the CE/OS mixture. Anhydrosugars from CE and alkanes from OS were the main pyrolyzates for the non-catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE and OS. The main products from the catalytic pyrolysis of CE (furans and aromatic hydrocarbons) and OS (alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons) were also compared with the main products from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS over all the catalysts. The relative distribution of main products, i.e., furans, olefins, and BTEXs, obtained from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS showed a different pattern from those obtained from the individual catalytic pyrolysis of CE and OS, meaning there is a mutual interaction between pyrolysis products of two feedstocks. The theoretical peak areas for furans, olefin, and BTEXs were calculated using equations (7) and (8) to quantify the degree of the interaction and know the synergistic conversion of catalytic pyrolysis intermediates to the target BTEXs. Eq. (7) Y T = Y E CE × P CE + Y E OS × P OS Eq. (8) Synergic effect ( % ) = ( Y E − Y T ) / Y T × 100 where YT and YE are the theoretical and experimental yields of the target compounds in catalytic pyrolysis of CE and OS, respectively, and P represents the proportion of CE or OS. As shown in Fig. 9 , the experimental peak areas of the furans and olefins for the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS were lower than their theoretical amounts, while the experimental yields of BTEXs were much larger than the theoretical amounts calculated from the individual catalytic pyrolysis results of CE and OS. This indicates that the additional conversion of catalytic pyrolysis intermediates, furans, and olefin, to the target BTEXs, can be achieved by applying their co-pyrolysis over all the catalysts used in this study. This indicates the more effective conversion of furans and olefins to aromatic hydrocarbons via a Diels-Alder reaction, which is one of the appropriate paths for generating aromatic compounds in catalytic co-pyrolysis via conversion of furan derived from biomass and olefin derived from the H-rich co-fed [52]. Wang et al. [53] also commented that hydrogen-rich feedstocks, such as lipid oils could act as hydrogen donors to hydrogen-deficient feedstock, such as cellulose during their catalytic co-pyrolysis, and the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons can be increased further over the appropriate catalysts. Similar to their results, OS has a much higher H/Ceff (1.68) than that of CE (0.02), which confirms that the use of OS as the co-feeding feedstock of CE during its catalytic pyrolysis can induce a positive effect on the BTEXs formation during their co-pyrolysis due to the increased hydrogen transfer reactions. Among the tested catalysts, the largest amount of BTEXs was obtained when Ni/HZSM-5 was applied as the catalyst on the co-pyrolysis of CE/OS with a synergistic effect, followed by HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and Al-MCM-41 (Table 6 ). The high performance of Ni/HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 can be explained by the fact that HZSM-5 can lead not only to a high cracking efficiency [54] but also to an optimized Diels-Alder reaction for the production of BTEXs because of its strong acid sites and appropriate pore structure for aromatization [55]. The higher performance of Ni/HZSM-5 also suggests that Ni elevates the performance of HZSM-5 [56]. As mentioned before, Ni, as a Lewis acid site, can abstract hydrogen from alkane intermediates to produce olefin intermediates. These olefin intermediates may facilitate the formation of aromatics through a Diels-Alder reaction with furans. Li et al. [50] commented that the introduction of Ni could improve the acidity of catalyst and promote the cracking of pentene, hexene, and other large hydrocarbons to produce ethylene and propylene, which are the main light olefins for co-aromatization with biomass-derived pyrolyzates, such as furans. Although large amounts of olefins were generated via the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS over HBeta, its BTEXs formation efficiency was lower than HZSM-5s. This suggests that HBeta can provide high cracking acidity, but the optimized formation of BTEXs is limited by its lower acidic strength and pore structure. Compared to HZSM-5, HY and HBeta have a larger pore size, leading to higher selectivity toward the polyaromatic hydrocarbons [57] and coke [39]. Moreover, the large pore size of Al-MCM-41 along with the lowest acidity (Table 2 and Fig. 2) caused the least BTEX production from the co-pyrolysis of CE/OS mixture over this catalyst [58]. Based on the above results, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS over Ni/HZSM-5 was concluded to be the optimized process applied in this study. Furthermore, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS with different blending ratios were also performed and theoretical and experimental levels of BTEXs formation were compared to determine the effect of the CE/OS blending ratio. As shown in Fig. 10 , the difference between theoretical and experimental BTEXs formation increased gradually with increasing blending ratio of OS in the CE/OS mixture from 25% to 75%, suggesting the reaction intermediates of OS catalytic pyrolysis are the controlling factors increasing the overall BTEXs production from the catalytic pyrolysis of CE/OS."
9,Research outlook and complementary suggestions,"3.3 Research outlook and complementary suggestions The increasing environmental concerns on one side and the growing demands for fuels on the other hand attract lots of attentions to the “waste to energy” strategy [59], which necessitate the development of innovative and advanced technologies to effectively convert different kinds of wastes to valuable products. The proposed idea in this study could be a solution to achieve this goal. OS contains large amounts of heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and solid particles [60], which are considered as harmful compounds to both environment safety and human health. Also, inappropriate treatment strategies, e.g., landfill and/or incineration, might lead to critical challenges, such as genotoxicity to humans and animals, changes in the chemical and physical properties of the receiving soils, negative effects on plants growth, soil hydraulic conductivity and diversity of soil microorganisms [3], while requiring high expenditures. Hence, its conversion to fuel can be considered as an ecofriendly treatment. For this purpose, pyrolysis is a candidate process since it almost has no peripheral contamination [61], and the produced energy can be also utilized for generating electricity or thermal energy for endothermic process. On the other side, considering the fact that biomass has renewability and abundancy [62], and the results of this study regarding significant synergy between OS and CE (as the main compound in various biomass) in producing BTEXs (as a fuel), it can be concluded that the combination of OS and biomass, can promote the process towards desired aims with no extra cost. These mean that catalytic co-pyrolysis of OS with renewable biomass feedstocks not only tackle OS treatment problems but also produce more value-added products (e.g., BTEXs), demonstrating beneficial environmental and economic aspects. Since co-pyrolysis as a thermal conversion process has a complex input–output relationship and non-linear nature, it needs advanced analytical techniques for prediction and modeling (especially for kinetic parameters) [63] as well as simulating the processing characteristics [64] to maximize overall efficiency. From a computational intelligence outlook, Neuro-evolution [65], which called as artificial neural networks (ANNs) [64], can be used as an appropriate approach to obtain optimum experimental condition. ANNs has been widely utilized to model significant criteria in sophisticated processes because of possessing fully automatic modeling procedure and high validity in addressing complex nonlinear processes [63]. In particular, machine learning (ML) which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), could be employed to effectively optimize the co-pyrolysis process [64]. In addition, the incorporation of interacting intelligent agents is known as a multi-agent system (MAS) that comprises of independent agents, which cooperate with each other to achieve common objectives, while concurrently pursuing individual goals [66]. Indeed, the problem complexity and the associated uncertainties of co-pyrolysis entail the use of these procedures. On this basis, numerical modeling by integrating adequate techniques could demonstrate the downstream of the co-pyrolysis process and optimizing the overall mechanism/efficiency of the process."
10,Conclusion,"The effectiveness of OS as the co-feeding feedstock on the catalytic pyrolysis of CE was proven with the identification of the most proper catalyst on BTEXs formation, Ni/HZSM-5, in this study. The decomposition temperature of OS was lowered by the use of catalyst during the TG analysis of CE/OS mixture, which, in turn, resulted in the decrease of apparent activation energy. Among the catalysts investigated here, Ni/HZSM-5 revealed the lowest Ea value (97.6 kJ/mol) on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS due to the improved cracking efficiency by the synergy between Ni and HZSM-5. In addition, the catalytic co-pyrolysis over Ni/HZSM-5 produced the largest amount of BTEXs (Summed peak area: 189.55 × 106) compared to other catalysts due to the promoting role of Ni on effective shape selectivity of HZSM-5 toward BTEXs formation. The experimental BTEXs production amount on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CE/OS over all catalysts were larger than the theoretical amount. Over Ni/HZSM-5, the highest synergistic production efficiency of BTEXs (11.5%) was achieved when 1/3 of CE/OS mixing ratio was applied, confirming the effective role of OS as the co-feeding feedstock of CE."
