0,Introduction,"In response to quality, economic, and political and health drivers, the wine sector is focused on producing wines with reduced alcohol concentration. Whilst a number of viticultural and engineering strategies have been pursued to achieve this goal (Bindon, Varela, Kennedy, Holt, & Herderich, 2013; Schmidtke, Blackman, & Agboola, 2012; Stoll, Scheidweiler, Lafontaine, & Schultz, 2010), production of quality wines with decreased levels of alcohol continues to be one of the major challenges facing wine producers (Varela et al., 2015). Using wine yeast to produce wine with reduced alcohol content remains one of the most easily applied and inexpensive approaches for winemakers to employ. Since commercially available S. cerevisiae wine strains produce similar alcohol concentrations when fermenting the same must (Palacios, Raginel, & Ortiz-Julien, 2007), several studies have focussed on generating new S. cerevisiae strains that produce less alcohol than traditional wine yeast during fermentation (Ehsani, Fernandez, Biosca, Julien, & Dequin, 2009; Kutyna, Varela, Henschke, Chambers, & Stanley, 2010; Tilloy, Ortiz-Julien, & Dequin, 2014; Varela et al., 2012). Another alternative is to search for strains which exhibit a reduced ethanol yield among non-conventional yeast. Non-conventional yeast, which include non-Saccharomyces and non-cerevisiae yeast, are part of the natural microbiota present on grapes, and harvesting and winemaking equipment, and are present at least during the early stages of fermentation (Fleet & Heard, 1993). Most non-conventional yeast are incapable of completing alcoholic fermentation and require the input of a S. cerevisiae wine strain that can be added as a co-inoculum (Herraiz, Reglero, Herraiz, Martin-Alvarez, & Cabezudo, 1990; Soden, Francis, Oakey, & Henschke, 2000) or sequentially where S. cerevisiae is added later in the fermentation (Herraiz et al., 1990; Zironi, Romano, Suzzi, Battistutta, & Comi, 1993) to ensure completion of fermentation. Nevertheless, the application of non-conventional yeast in wine fermentation is increasingly popular particularly due to their effects on wine composition, flavour, aroma and colour (Benito, Morata, Palomero, Gonzalez, & Suarez-Lepe, 2011; Comitini et al., 2011; Domizio et al., 2011; Hayasaka, Birse, Eglinton, & Herderich, 2007; Jolly, Varela, & Pretorius, 2014; Magyar & Toth, 2011; Soden et al., 2000). Recently, we identified a Metschnikowia pulcherrima strain able to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration when sequentially inoculated with S. cerevisiae (Contreras et al., 2014). In a following study we isolated from Shiraz fermentations an indigenous Saccharomyces uvarum yeast strain, which was also able to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration (Contreras, Curtin, & Varela, 2015). Wine produced with a combination of M. pulcherrima and S. uvarum followed by sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae, showed an additional reduction in ethanol concentration compared to wines produced with either strain alone (Contreras et al., 2015). In the present work, we evaluated the volatile flavour profile of Chardonnay and Shiraz wines produced with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 during sequential fermentation with S. cerevisiae. In addition to showing reduced ethanol concentration, wines fermented with a combination of both non-conventional yeasts showed a distinct flavour composition including relatively high concentrations of desirable flavour metabolites."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and media,"2.1 Microorganisms and media Saccharomyces cerevisiae AWRI1631, Metschnikowia pulcherrima AWRI1149 and Saccharomyces uvarum AWRI2846 were obtained from the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) Wine Microorganism Culture Collection (WMCC). Cryogenically preserved (−80°C) strains were cultured and maintained on YM plates (3g/L malt extract, 3g/L yeast extract, 5g/L peptone, 10g/L glucose, 16g/L agar) and stored at 4°C. Non-cerevisiae yeasts were distinguished from S.cerevisiae by growth on WL agar (Amyl Media Pty Ltd, Australia); S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 produces large white colonies whereas the non-cerevisiae yeasts M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 produce small green colonies on this medium (Pallman et al., 2001). M. pulcherrima and S. uvarum were distinguished from each other based on colony colour and morphology; M. pulcherrima colonies are smaller than S. uvarum colonies and have a red tinge. Differences between colonies of M. pulcherrima and S. uvarum were made based on previous colony identification using ITS RFLP (Contreras et al., 2015)"
3,Fermentations in sterilised grape must,"2.2 Fermentations in sterilised grape must Five treatments were performed to evaluate M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 in sequential fermentations with S. cerevisiae in sterilised Chardonnay and Shiraz musts (for details see Table 1 ). Chardonnay must was prepared from grapes obtained from Blewitt Springs, Clarendon Hills (South Australia), while Shiraz must was prepared from grapes obtained from Adelaide Hills (South Australia). After crushing, red must was macerated at 0°C for 24h. Both musts were filter sterilised (0.2μm Millipore, USA) and stored at 4°C until used. Chardonnay juice contained 240g/L of sugar (equal amounts of glucose and fructose) and 260mgN/L of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN). Shiraz must contained 210g/L of sugar and 200mgN/L of YAN. Must pH was adjusted to 3.5 using potassium hydroxide prior to filtration. Starter cultures of all yeast strains were grown overnight in YM medium under aerobic conditions at 28°C, shaking at 200rpm. These cultures were then used to inoculate 100mL of sterile grape must, diluted 1:1 with water, in 250mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks were incubated overnight at 22°C with shaking (120rpm) under aerobic conditions and then used to inoculate grape must at time 0 (t0). Fermentations were performed in triplicate in 250mL fermentation flasks equipped with fermentation locks and containing 150mL of sterilised grape must. Ferments were incubated at 22°C (120rpm) under initial semi-aerobic conditions; flasks fitted with air-locks ensure anaerobic conditions after all oxygen in the headspace is consumed. After 50% of sugar was consumed S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 (1×106 cells/mL) was inoculated into each flask to ensure completion of fermentation. Samples were taken for analysis of volatile fermentation products after sugar was completely consumed."
4,Analytical techniques,"2.3 Analytical techniques Viable cell counts were determined by plating on WL agar. Plates were incubated at 28°C for 2days. Ethanol, glucose, fructose, glycerol and organic acids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a BioRad HPX87H column as described previously (Varela, Pizarro, & Agosin, 2004). Analysis of higher alcohols, acetate-, and ethyl esters was performed by Metabolomics Australia (Adelaide) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) using a stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) as previously described (Bizaj et al., 2012). Concentrations of acetic acid, propanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, butanoic acid, 2-/3-methylbutanoic acid, hexanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid in wine were determined using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GCMS), with polydeuterated internal standards (Siebert et al., 2005) for stable isotope dilution analysis as follows. Briefly, an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph was equipped with a Gerstel MPS2 multipurpose sampler and coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass selective detector. The instrument was controlled with Agilent GC ChemStation software (rev. E.02.02.1431) and Maestro software (integrated version 1.3.3.51/3.3), and the data were analysed with Agilent MassHunter quantitative analysis software, version B.04.00. The gas chromatograph was fitted with a 30m by 0.250mm J&W DB-wax fused silica capillary column, with a 0.50μm film thickness and a 0.5m by 0.250mm Restek Siltek deactivated retention gap. Helium (BOC ultrahigh purity) with a linear velocity of 44.9cm/s and a flow rate of 1.5mL/min was used as carrier gas in constant flow mode. The oven temperature was started at 60°C, held for 4min, increased to 220°C at 9°C/min, and held for 5min. The inlet was fitted with a borosilicate glass SPME inlet liner (0.75mm inside diameter; Supelco) and was held at 220°C. Samples (1mL) were diluted 1:10 with potassium hydrogen tartrate buffer at pH 3.2 in a 20mL headspace vial containing 4g of salt. Vials were immediately sealed (magnetic, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] septum). Subsequently, 100μl of combined deuterated internal standards solution was injected through the septum and the vial was thoroughly shaken. The concentrations of each deuterated internal standard in the vial were 4670.00μg/L for d3-acetic acid, 1066.50μg/L for d5-propanoic acid, 286.25μg/L for d7-2-methylpropanoic acid, 285.50μg/L for d7-butanoic acid, 247.00μg/L for d7-3-methylbutanoic acid, 236.00μg/L for d11-hexanoic acid, 135.00μg/L for d15-octanoic acid, and 142.75μg/L for d19-decanoic acid. A Supelco polyacrylate (white) 85μm fibre was exposed to the headspace of the sample vials for 10min at 35°C and desorbed in the GC inlet in pulsed splitless mode for 10min. Detailed peak information for this method is provided in Siebert et al. (2005)."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis Differences between measurements were determined using one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s LSD test with the software GraphPad Prism v6.03. Differences were considered significant when p values were lower than 0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) using Unscrambler X 10.3 (CAMO ASA, Oslo, Norway) was carried out for reducing the dimensionality of data and for finding the best differentiation among samples."
6,Results,Five inoculation regimes were carried out to evaluate wine flavour composition in reduced-alcohol wines produced by Metschnikowia pulcherrima AWRI1149 and Saccharomyces uvarum AWRI2846. Treatments included: a control S. cerevisiae inoculation (inoculation with S. cerevisiae at t0); a M. pulcherrima/S. cerevisiae sequentially inoculated ferment; a S. uvarum/S. cerevisiae sequential inoculation; and two sets of M. pulcherrima/S. uvarum ferments where S. uvarum was inoculated at different cell densities followed by sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae (Table 1). Different cell densities for Treatments D and E were trialled to test the effect of S. uvarum on the metabolism of M. pulcherrima.
7,Sugar consumption during sequentially inoculated wine fermentations,"3.1 Sugar consumption during sequentially inoculated wine fermentations In Chardonnay fermentations, the control inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 at t0 (Treatment A) completed alcoholic fermentation in 11days. M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 (Treatment B) exhibited a slow rate of fermentation, taking 24days to consume 50% of initial sugar prior to sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae, and requiring 40days to complete fermentation (Fig.1 A). All ferments inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 (Treatments C, D and E) exhibited similar sugar utilisation kinetics and completed fermentation in approximately 23days. Population dynamics revealed successful implantation of the corresponding strains for each inoculation regime (Supplementary Fig. S1). Briefly, control ferments inoculated with S. cerevisiae reached a maximum population of 1.1×108 CFU/mL. In Treatment B, M. pulcherrima population reached a maximum of 1.2×107 CFU/mL to decline 15days after inoculation disappearing completely following sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae (Fig. S1B). S. uvarum population in Treatment C remained stable after reaching 1.3×108 CFU/mL and it was slightly affected after sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae (Fig. S1C). In Treatments D and E M. pulcherrima populations reached similar numbers, however after S. uvarum populations reached maximum cell numbers, M. pulcherrima numbers dropped quickly and no viable cells were detected 12days after inoculation (Fig. S1D and E). A slight decrease in cell numbers for S. uvarum populations was observed following sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae. In Shiraz, the control (Treatment A) completed fermentation in 15days. Similarly to Chardonnay, ferments inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone (Treatment B) were the slowest to complete fermentation and showed an increased sugar utilisation rate following sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae (Fig.1B). Treatment C completed fermentation in 25days, whereas Treatments D and E consumed all sugar after 29days (Fig.1B). As in Chardonnay we confirmed successful strain implantation for each inoculation regime (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly to Chardonnay, M. pulcherrima populations in treatments D and E remained viable for approximately one third of the fermentation (10 out of 29days), while S. uvarum populations remained stable at least until sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae (Fig. S2)."
8,Wine chemical composition in Chardonnay,"3.2 Wine chemical composition in Chardonnay Chemical composition of all wines was evaluated to determine the effect of the different inoculation regimes on wine flavour profile. Although Treatments C, D and E produced wines with some residual sugar, all were considered dry (<5g/L sugar) (Table 2 ). Compared to wines produced with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 alone, wines obtained in Treatments B and C showed approximately 1% v/v lower ethanol concentration, while wines from Treatments D and E contained approximately 1.8% v/v less ethanol. All treatments inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 (Treatments C, D and E) exhibited the highest concentration of glycerol and malic and succinic acids. The total concentration of esters (excluding ethyl acetate) was only significantly different between the S. cerevisiae control (Treatment A) and Treatments C and E. However, differences in the concentration of several esters were observed among treatments. Compared to the S. cerevisiae control, wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone (Treatment B) showed significantly higher concentrations of ethyl propanoate, 2-methypropyl acetate, ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate; and lower concentrations of 2-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, hexyl acetate and ethyl decanoate. Additionally, these wines contained an 8-fold higher concentration of ethyl acetate compared to the S. cerevisiae control wine. Wines inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 (Treatments C, D and E) were characterised by significantly higher concentrations of ethyl propanoate, ethyl 2-methyl butanoate and 2-phenylethyl acetate; and lower concentrations of 2-methylbutyl acetate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate (Table 2). As observed for esters, the total concentration of higher alcohols was similar between treatments although the concentration of individual compounds was significantly different. Wines from Treatment B showed the highest concentration of 2-methyl propanol and the lowest concentration of 2&3-methyl butanol. Compared to the control, all wines inoculated with S. uvarum (treatments C, D and E) showed higher concentrations of butanol and 2-phenyl ethanol and lower concentrations of 2-methyl propanol and 2&3-methyl butanol (Table 2). Similar to total esters and higher alcohols, significative differences between inoculation regimes were found for individual volatile acids but not for the total concentration of these compounds. All co- and sequentially inoculated regimes yielded wines containing very low concentrations of acetic acid relative to wine made with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 alone. Wines from Treatment B showed increased concentrations of 3-methyl butanoic and hexanoic acids, and reduced concentration of octanoic acid compared to control wines. Whereas wines inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 showed increased concentrations of butanoic and 2-methyl butanoic acids, and reduced concentrations of hexanoic and octanoic acids (Table 2)."
9,Wine chemical composition in Shiraz,"3.3 Wine chemical composition in Shiraz Comparable to what was found in Chardonnay wines, and as we previously reported (Contreras et al., 2015) Shiraz wines from Treatments B and C showed approximately 0.9% v/v lower ethanol concentration, while wines from Treatments D and E contained approximately 1.7% v/v less ethanol than wines produced with S. cerevisiae alone (Table 3 ). The total concentration of esters (excluding ethyl acetate) was lowest for ferments inoculated with S. cerevisiae alone (Table 3). Once more several differences among treatments were found for individual esters. Wines from Treatment B showed nearly five times higher ethyl acetate concentration than the S. cerevisiae control. Additionally, wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone showed increased concentrations of ethyl propanoate, 2-methylpropyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl decanoate and 2-phenylethyl acetate. Only Treatments D and E, which were inoculated with both M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 showed higher ethyl acetate concentration than control wines. Although some differences were observed between wines inoculated with S. uvarum (Treatments C, D and E), they exhibited similar ester profiles. Compared to the S. cerevisiae control, these wines showed increased concentration of 2-phenylethyl acetate and reduced concentrations of 2-methylpropyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, hexyl acetate and ethyl octanoate. Compared to control wines the total concentration of higher alcohols was significantly higher for wines from Treatments C, D and E. Once again these wines exhibited a similar profile, increased concentrations of butanol, 2&3-methyl butanol and 2-phenyl ethanol and reduced concentration of 2-methyl propanol compared to wines inoculated with S. cerevisiae alone. Wines from Treatment B, on the other hand, showed higher concentration of 2-phenyl ethanol and lower concentrations of 2-methyl propanol and 2&3-methyl butanol than control wines (Table 3). Similarly to Chardonnay, wines inoculated only with AWRI1631 at t0 showed the highest acetic acid concentration. Compared to the S. cerevisiae control, wines inoculated with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 (Treatments B, D and E) showed significantly higher concentration of volatile acids (excluding acetic acid). This difference was mainly driven by increased concentrations of butanoic and hexanoic acids (Table 3). In addition, Treatments D and E showed lower concentrations 3-methyl butanoic and octanoic acids than control wines."
10,Principal component analysis of wines,"3.4 Principal component analysis of wines Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the volatile fermentation products that discriminated best among treatments (Fig. 2 ). The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 54% of the total variation, while PC2 explained 21%. Wines were separated according to variety with Chardonnay wines on the upper half of the plot while Shiraz wines were located on the bottom half. Regardless of grape variety, wines inoculated at t0 with S. uvarum AWRI2846 (Treatments C, D and E) were clearly different than S. cerevisiae control wines (Treatment A) and wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone (Treatment B). Wines from Treatments A and B clustered tightly for Shiraz, whereas in Chardonnay both treatments were less related. Chardonnay wines inoculated with both M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 (Treatments D and E) clustered together with wines inoculated at t0 with S. uvarum AWRI2846 alone. For Shiraz however, wines from Treatments D and E grouped independently to wines from Treatment C."
11,Discussion,"The work described in this manuscript extends previous research performed in our laboratory aimed at the use of non-conventional yeast to produce wine with reduced ethanol concentration (Contreras et al., 2014, 2015). We have previously shown that co-inoculation with two non-conventional yeast strains, M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846, followed by sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae, enabled the production of Shiraz wines containing 1.6–1.8% v/v less ethanol than wines produced with the same S. cerevisiae wine strain alone. Here we describe the flavour composition profile of Chardonnay and Shiraz wines produced in this manner. Amongst other things most non-conventional yeast are generally unable to cope with the stresses associated with increasing ethanol concentration and decreasing nutrient availability (Fleet, 1993; Jolly et al., 2014). Consequently, most non-conventional yeast are not able to consume all sugar present in grape must and sequential inoculation strategies utilising S. cerevisiae strains have, therefore, been employed to ensure completion of fermentation (Contreras et al., 2014, 2015). Nevertheless, there are several non-conventional yeasts commercially available for winemaking, particularly relevant is a M. pulcherrima strain able to influence wine flavour profile (Gonzalez-Royo et al., 2015). In both Chardonnay and Shiraz, M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 showed the slowest fermentation kinetics. Furthermore, the growth of either S. cerevisiae or S. uvarum negatively affected M. pulcherrima cell population numbers. This is consistent with the early decrease in M. pulcherrima viable population previously observed in non-sterile wine fermentations (Contreras et al., 2015) and indicates how sensitive M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 is to inhibition by other microorganisms. In contrast, ferments inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 showed faster fermentation kinetics than M. pulcherrima AWRI1149, at the same time S. uvarum populations remained stable and dominated until the later stages of fermentation. S. uvarum has been shown to be the main fermenting microorganism during fermentation of some Riesling musts (Ultee, Wacker, Kunz, Löwenstein, & König, 2013). The slower fermentation kinetics observed for mixed cultures might be relevant for retaining volatile aroma compounds and decreasing cooling energy demand in the winery (Medina et al., 2013). Similarly to what we have reported previously (Contreras et al., 2015), wines fermented with both M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 showed 1.7–1.8% v/v less ethanol than S. cerevisiae wines, whereas wines fermented with either M. pulcherrima or S. uvarum following sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae showed 0.9–1.0% v/v less ethanol than control wines. Although reduced ethanol production can be explained by increased glycerol and succinic acid formation in the case of S. uvarum AWRI2846, the ethanol yield observed for M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 was not explained by the production of any compound measured in this study. Similarly, the lower ethanol yield observed in ferments inoculated with both strains, which showed similar glycerol and succinic acid concentrations than wines inoculated at t0 solely with S. uvarum, was not explained by the formation of any compound measured. Further research is needed to establish the fate of the carbon that is not destined to ethanol formation by M. pulcherrima AWRI1149. Besides fermentation performance and in this particular case ethanol yield, yeast impact on wine flavour and aroma is critical to determine if a wine strain will be used by winemakers (Chambers et al., 2015). It is well documented that non-conventional yeast can impart novel and desirable characters to wine and also produce metabolites that impact negatively on wine flavour profile (Magyar & Toth, 2011; Rojas, Gil, Pinaga, & Manzanares, 2001; Viana, Gil, Genoves, Valles, & Manzanares, 2008). Chardonnay and Shiraz wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 (Treatment B) showed significantly increased concentrations of ethyl acetate. While at low levels (approximately 50mg/L) ethyl acetate may add aroma complexity to wine, at concentrations above 150mg/L it is associated with negative sensory descriptors, such as nail polish remover (Jackson, 2009). Therefore, it is likely that the aroma profile of wines produced using M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 will have some negative sensory attributes as a result of the high concentration of this compound. In contrast, wines produced with a combination of both M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 contained moderate concentrations of ethyl acetate unlikely to be perceived negatively. This suggests that the presence of S. uvarum in Treatments D and E affected the formation of ethyl acetate by M. pulcherrima either inhibiting M. pulcherrima growth before ethyl acetate accumulated or affecting M. pulcherrima metabolism. Co-fermentation allows exchange of metabolites between inoculated strains, resulting in distinct volatile profiles relative to wines fermented with each strain separately (Cheraiti, Guezenec, & Salmon, 2005; Howell, Cozzolino, Bartowsky, Fleet, & Henschke, 2006). This is particularly evident for Shiraz wines fermented with a combination of both non-conventional yeasts. These wines clustered together and showed a different volatile profile than wines fermented with either M. pulcherrima or S. uvarum. Relative to wines fermented with S. cerevisiae, wines produced by non-conventional yeasts showed different concentrations for several esters. Particularly relevant to both Chardonnay and Shiraz wines, the concentration of 2-phenylethyl acetate was increased over its sensory threshold (0.25mg/L) for all wines inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846. This compound is associated with rose and honey sensory descriptors and it has been previously observed at high concentrations in wines fermented with S. uvarum (Stribny, Gamero, Perez-Torrado, & Querol, 2015). Although the total concentration of higher alcohols was increased for wines fermented with S. uvarum AWRI2846 this was the result of higher levels of 2-phenyl ethanol than in control wines (sensory threshold 10mg/L). 2-Phenyl ethanol is associated with rose and lilac sensory descriptors. Therefore, the increased concentrations of 2-phenylethyl acetate and 2-phenyl ethanol found in wines fermented with S. uvarum AWRI2846 would potentially increase the floral aroma in these wines. In fact, wines produced with S. uvarum have shown higher sensory scores in desirable sensory attributes, including ‘floral’, than wines fermented with S. cerevisiae (Muratore et al., 2007). Removal of ethanol post-fermentation (using evaporative perstraction, osmotic distillation or vacuum distillation) has been shown to decrease the concentration of volatile compounds in the resulting reduced alcohol wine (Aguera, Bes, Roy, Camarasa, & Sablayrolles, 2010; Diban et al., 2013; Lisanti, Gambuti, Genovese, Piombino, & Moio, 2013) and consequently reduce aroma intensity particularly for fruity sensory attributes (Lisanti et al., 2013). Given the higher concentration of volatile compounds associated with positive sensory descriptors found in wines fermented with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846, it would be interesting to test if these wines would maintain a balanced aroma profile after ethanol removal post-fermentation. Volatile acids are generally associated with negative aromas in wine (Carrascosa, Muñoz, & Gonzalez, 2011). Although the concentration of some volatile acids was increased in several treatments only Chardonnay wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone showed concentrations exceeding the corresponding sensory thresholds. The concentration of 3-methyl butanoic acid in these wines was just higher than the reported sensory threshold (3mg/L) (Guth, 1997). Chardonnay wines inoculated with S. uvarum AWRI2846 showed concentrations of 2-methyl butanoic acid close to the sensory threshold (3mg/L). Volatile flavour profiles from wines inoculated with both M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 were closer to those of wines inoculated at t0 with S. uvarum AWRI2846 alone than to wines inoculated at t0 with M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 alone. This indicates the great influence of S. uvarum metabolism in these wines which also relates to the dominance of S. uvarum populations during fermentation. In summary, the work described in this paper shows that reduced-alcohol wines made by a combination of M. pulcherrima AWRI1149 and S. uvarum AWRI2846 did not contain elevated concentrations of volatile metabolites considered detrimental for wine flavour and aroma. This work thus demonstrates the successful application of non-conventional yeast for the production of wines with reduced alcohol concentration and beneficial volatile composition. Future work will focus on scaling up experiments to pilot scale using red and white grape musts and evaluating wine sensory profile."
