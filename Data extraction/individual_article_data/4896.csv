0,Introduction,"Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (EC 1.1.1.1) is the family of alcohol: NAD+ oxidoreductases that catalyze reversible conversion of a wide variety of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones [1]. In human and rats ADHs of I and IV classes, localized mainly in liver and stomach epithelium, play the key role in ethanol metabolism [2]. ADH III is found in the majority of tissues, including liver and brain, and reacts with ethanol with a poor affinity due to a very high Km. Thereby only very high blood ethanol concentrations are able to trigger ADH III activity [3,4]. In addition to oxidation of hydroxyl groups, ADHs are able to catalyze the reverse reaction of aldehyde reduction. Different forms of ADH are known to participate in metabolism of some types of endogenous neurotransmitters and their catabolites such as steroid hormones, GABA, serotonin and catecholamines [5,6]. Remarkably, ADHs affinity to some of these substances is higher than to ethanol [7]. ADHs are involved in regulation of catecholamine metabolism both in peripheral neural system — dopamine metabolic products act as substrates for liver and serum forms of ADH [8], and in CNS - ADH III is represented in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, perivascular and subependymal astrocytes, the cortex and hippocampus [9]. Hippocampus appears to be the part of the limbic system, sends glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens and therefore plays an important role in alcohol motivation [10]. Increased ADHs activity in liver and serum is also associated with modulation of dopamine level and utilization of its metabolic products [8]. Besides that, ADHs show high affinity to 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) that appears to be one of the main products of epinephrine and norepinephrine metabolism [11]. Serum form of ADH could use MHPG as substrate during its appearance in blood in process of epinephrine/norepinephrine metabolism and its transport from brain to liver [12]. ADHs of I and II classes are observed to participate in serotonin metabolism by catalyzing the reaction of 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) to 5-hydroxytriptophan conversion [13]. It is known that long term alcohol consumption leads to increased expression and activity of ADH I in rat liver, while in people with chronic alcoholism it does not cause such effect [14]. It should be noted that chronic alcohol intoxication is associated with constitutively increased brain ADH III activity [15]. In the series of studies it has been shown that intraperitoneal administration of non-specific ADHs inhibitor 4-methilpirasol provides a short-term anti-alcoholic effect, but the role of brain ADH isoforms in formation of alcoholic motivation and in metabolism of brain biogenic amines was still unclear [16]. The fact that chronic alcohol administration causes significant constitutively increased ADH I activity in serum plays the key role for this work [17,18]. Serum form of ADH I could extensively participate in previously described metabolic pathways and appears to be an interesting target for anti-alcoholic therapy. In this study we aimed to investigate individual roles of different isoforms of ADH in regulation of alcohol consumption in rats. We used active immunization against alcohol dehydrogenase in chronically alcoholized specific-pathogen-free (SPF) rats to decrease the alcohol-induced ADHs activity. Earlier published studies with the use of conventional animals reported high efficiency of this approach [19–21] but they did not allow to distinguish the effects of non-specific action of immunomodulators caused by pathogenic microflora and targeted suppression of ADHs. In the present study we solved this problem by using SPF rats. Active immunization against endogenous regulators appears to be a promising approach because it combines long-term modulation of target proteins activity with a simple procedure [21]. It was shown that active immunization against cholecystokinin in rats led to long-lasting decrease in anxiety, depressive behavior, modulation of level of biogenic amines and their metabolic products in striatum [19,20]. Another successful example of immunotherapy is blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Immunization against endogenous TNF (by using TNF-a conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as an antigen) in mice with experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis caused production of polyclonal antibodies that significantly decreased TNF activity, suppressed arthritis progression and did not lead to autoimmune pathology [22,23]. The invention successfully passed full spectrum of pre-clinical trials and now shows high efficiency and safety in phase 2 clinical trials [24]. These studies confirm the efficiency and relevance of active immunization approach in correction of pathological conditions and its possible integration into clinical practice."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental rats,"2.1 Experimental rats Studies on immunization against serum ADH I and inhibition of brain ADHs were performed using 60 and 30 male Wistar SPF rats (6–8weeks old) respectively. The animals were received from EMBI SPF vivarium of Russian Laboratory Animal Science Association (EMBI LLC, Novosibirsk, Russia). All experiments were performed in SPF-certified vivarium of Moscow State University (Mitoengineering Institute MSU, Moscow, Russia). The animals were kept in standard conditions before the alcoholization and the immunization: 15rph ventilation rate, temperature 20–24°С (daily temperature difference no >2°С), related humidity 30–70%, 12/12 light cycle (12 “on” stage start at 9AM Moscow Russia time), standard diet. All experimental manipulations with animals (including behavioral tests, blood sampling and euthanasia) were performed between 2PM and 6PM Moscow Russia time."
3,Ethical approval,"2.2 Ethical approval All in vivo experiments were controlled and approved by Official Bioethical commission of Mitoengineering Institute, MSU, Moscow (official approval №23)."
4,Part 1. Study of the influence of brain ADHs inhibition on physiological parameters of alcoholized Wistar rats,"2.3 Part 1. Study of the influence of brain ADHs inhibition on physiological parameters of alcoholized Wistar rats 2.3.1 Alcoholization Wistar SPF rats were chronically alcoholized using two-bottle choice method (water and 15% ethanol) during 6months [25]. We detected 15% ethanol consumption daily within last 15days of the experiment. For subsequent studies we selected 30 rats that consumed >35ml/(kg body weight) of 15% ethanol per day. 2.3.2 Experimental groups All rats were divided into 3 equal groups (10 rats in each group) according to results of weighting and 15% ethanol consumption measurement: alcoholized control (“Alc. control”), three-fold intranasal introduction of 0.25mg/kg 4-methylpyrazole (“4MP 0.25”), single intranasal introduction of 2.5mg/kg 4-methylpyrazole (“4MP 2.5”). 2.3.3 Administration of ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrasole 4-methylpyrazole is a nonselective competitive inhibitor of ADHs [26]. To estimate the contribution of ADHs localized in the brain to catecholamine metabolism and alcohol consumption we used intranasal administration of 4-methylpyrazole in low doses. Due to high permeability of blood-brain barrier for 4-methylpyrazole, it is detected in the brain within 1h after the administration. We administered 4-methylpyrazole on the 0, 3 and 6-th days of the experiment. The efficiency of 4-methylpyrazole action was controlled by evaluation of ADH III activity in the brain. The brains were harvested on the 7-th day of the experiment. 2.3.4 Evaluation of ADH III activity in the brain We estimated ADH III activity in cytosol fraction using modified method described by Mezey and Potter [27]. Brain tissues were unfrozen and homogenized in 2× volume of 10mM Tris buffer (pH8.5) with 0.5mM ditiotriol (DTT) using glass-teflon homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged at 27000g during 1h, supernatant was filtered. For one sample we mixed 100μl of supernatant, 30μl of 1mM n-octanol as a substrate [28] and 240μl of 1.2mM NAD in 0.1M NaOH-glycine buffer (pH9.6) and used the mixture for spectrophotometric ADH activity evaluation (wave length 340nm) in Shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations in samples were estimated by Bradford assay. 2.3.5 Evaluation of serum ADH I activity The serum was filtered before the assay. We used p-nitrosodimethylaniline (NDMA) as a substrate. We mixed 0.1ml of filtered serum, 1.8ml of a 26μM solution of substrate in 0.1M of sodium phosphate buffer (pH8.5) and 0.1ml of a mixture containing 0.25M n-butanol and 5mM NAD and used the mixture for spectrophotometric ADH activity evaluation (wave length 440nm) in Shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotometer [28]. Protein concentrations in samples were estimated by Bradford assay. 2.3.6 Analysis of catecholamine brain levels in experimental rats For evaluation of biogenic amines level in the brain we used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We euthanized the animals by decapitation at the end of the study (on the 7-th day of the experiment), removed striatum and subsequently used it for biogenic amines extraction. We homogenized striatum in 400μl of 50mM EDTA, adjusted pH to 8.2 using 1M sodium carbonate and added homogenate to aluminum oxide cartridge (SEP-PAK VAC Alumina, Waters). Sorbent was washed for 2 times with distilled water and then catecholamines were eluted using 1M acetic acid. Catecholamine level was detected using reversed-phase chromatography (RP-HPLC) with pulsed amperometric detection. Mobile phase included 70mM sodium hydrophosphate, 1.5mM sodium octyl sulfonate and 40mM chloroacetic acid. Elution was performed using acetonitrile. Threshold sensitivity to dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and DOPA was 0.4ng/ml. Using biochemical automatic analyzer A-25 (Biosystems) we determined general biochemical parameters of experimental animals' serum: levels of bilirubin, cholesterol, glucose, protein, triglycerides, calcium, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)."
5,Part 2. Evaluation of serum ADH I influence on physiological parameters of alcoholized Wistar rats using the method of active immunization,"2.4 Part 2. Evaluation of serum ADH I influence on physiological parameters of alcoholized Wistar rats using the method of active immunization 2.4.1 Animal alcoholization We performed alcoholization of Wistar SPF rats (body weight 270–310g) during 4months prior to the start of the immunization using two-bottle choice method (water and 15% ethanol) [25]. For subsequent studies we selected 40 rats that consumed >35ml/(kg body weight) of 15% ethanol per day. 7days prior to the immunization we performed ethanol deprivation. We started re-alcoholization of the rats on the 22day after immunization start. Thereby immunization was performed during alcohol withdrawal. Re-alcoholization was performed using two-bottle choice method (water and 15% ethanol), alcohol consumption was detected daily. 2.4.2 Experimental groups 60 Wistar SPF rats (including 40 previously alcoholized rats and 20 intact rats of the same age) were divided into 6 equal groups (10 rats in each group) according to results of weighting and open field behavioral test [29]: 1) Intact control group (Int. contr); 2) Alcohol control (Alc. contr). Rats were alcoholized and injected with saline; 3) Alcohol+adjuvant control (Alc. PO). Rats were alcoholized and injected with adjuvant polyoxidonium without antigen; 4) Control alcoholized group injected with KLH and the adjuvant (Alc. KLH+PO). This group was used to exclude the effect of irrelevant immunization on alcohol consumption; 5) Experimental group without alcoholization (ADH+PO): injected with ADH and the adjuvant; 6) Experimental group with alcoholization (Alc. ADH+PO): injected with ADH and the adjuvant. 2.4.3 Immunization against ADHs Scheme of the experiment is represented on the Fig. 1 . Active immunization was performed by three fold subcutaneous injection of the vaccine at four abdominal points during 2weeks (1, 7 and 14-th days of the experiment). We used recombinant horse ADH (Sigma-Aldrich) as an antigen in the dose of 150mg per injection and immunomodulator polyoxidonium (azoximer bromide, LLC “NPO PetrovaxPharm”) as an adjuvant [30] - 200mg/injection. Control animals were injected with saline in the equal volume. 2.4.4 Evaluation of behavioral parameters of the rats before and after re-alcoholization On the 17 and 18-th days of the experiment (prior to re-alcoholization) we estimated behavioral parameters of the animals using the open field [28] and the elevated plus maze test [31]; on the 36-th day of the experiment (two weeks after alcoholization start) we performed exploratory closed plus-maze test [32]; on the 49-th day (27days after start of alcoholization) – Porsolt forced swim test [33]. For the open field test we used a circular arena (diameter 90cm) open on top, illuminated with 600lx and limited by the walls (height 42cm). The animal was placed into the center of the arena, the distance passed by the animal (cm) during 5min was registered using video-tracking system Noldus Ethovision XT 8,5. Elevated plus-maze test was performed using previously described standard apparatus [34]. The rat was placed into the center of the maze and allowed to explore. The duration of the test was 5min. We registered: the time spent by the animals in the open arm, the number of entries into the open arms, the number of stretch-attend posture, the distance passed using video-tracking system Noldus Ethovision XT 8,5. For Porsolt forced swim test rats were placed individually for 10min into a vertical plexiglass cylinder (height 50cm) containing 30cm of water maintained at 23°C. We registered immobility time and active swimming time of the rats using visual monitoring by Real Timer program (Openscience Ltrc). Exploratory closed plus-maze test was performed according to previously published protocol [32]. We used a plexiglass crossmaze apparatus consisted of four closed empty arms 20×20cm (numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4) connected to the central compartment (20×20cm) through the passes (10×10cm). The rat was placed into the center of the maze and allowed to explore. The duration of the test was 3min. We registered the total distance passed during the test and the length of the first episode of maze patrolling (number of entries before every arm has been first visited) using video-tracking system Noldus Ethovision XT 8,5. 2.4.5 Evaluation of anti-ADH antibodies levels in serum after immunization Retro-orbital sinus blood collection was performed using isoflurane anesthesia on the 21, 32 and 49-th days of the experiment. Blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 30min and then precipitated at 1800G for 15min. Serum (supernatant) was used for evaluation of antibodies level using immunoferment analysis. Horse ADH (Sigma-Aldrich), which provides high homology to rat serum ADH, was applied to 96-well flat bottom plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc) and then serum was added. For detection of anti-ADH antibodies we used secondary rabbit anti-rat HRP-conjugated antibodies (IMTEK, Russia) in 1:10,000 dilution and ready to use substrate containing 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide (Immunotek, Russia). The signal was measured at 450nm using plate reading spectrofluorimeter (MaxiSorp, Nunc). 2.4.6 Ethanol-induced narcosis Alcohol-induced narcosis test was performed according to standard protocols [35] on the 40th day of the experiment. The animals received intraperitoneal injections of 25% ethanol (4g/kg). The test was performed on alcoholized groups of animals. A group of 10 intact rats of the same age and weight served as control (these animals were used only for ethanol-induced narcosis test and did not participate in other studies). As main quantitative parameters we estimated the duration of ethanol-induced narcosis and the time of the loss of the righting reflex. 2.4.7 Evaluation of general biochemical blood parameters Using biochemical automatic analyzer A-25 (Biosystems) we determined general biochemical parameters of experimental animals: levels of bilirubin, glucose, protein, triglycerides, ALT and AST in the serum."
6,Statistical analyzes,2.5 Statistical analyzes Statistical analyzes was assessed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's LSD test using STATISTICA 10 and Microsoft Excel software.
7,Results,
8,Intranasal administration of 4-methylpyrazole caused dose-dependent reduction in brain ADH III activity and dopamine concentration but did not influence alcohol consumption in SPF Wistar rats,"3.1 Intranasal administration of 4-methylpyrazole caused dose-dependent reduction in brain ADH III activity and dopamine concentration but did not influence alcohol consumption in SPF Wistar rats Prior to the study, SPF Wistar rats were alcoholized using two-bottle choice method during 6months. For target inhibition of ADHs localized in the brain we performed intranasal administration of 4-MP in low doses (three-fold introduction of 0.25mg/kg or single introduction of 2.5mg/kg 4-methylpyrazole). This approach allowed us to minimize inhibition of liver and serum ADH isoforms that was also controlled by estimation of serum ADHs activity after 4-MP treatment. 4-MP administration led to 1,5-fold reduction in specific ADH III activity in brain (Fig. 2A) and did not influence serum ADHs activity (Fig. 2B) that indicates specificity of our model and allows us to speak about differentiated effect of brain ADHs inhibition. 4-MP administration caused dose-dependent decrease in dopamine concentration and respective raise of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC, dopamine metabolic product) level (Fig. 2C, D). Brain epinephrine and serotonin concentrations showed no significant changes after 4-MP treatment (the data are not represented). Also intranasal 4-MP administration did not influence alcohol consumption by alcoholized rats in any manner (Fig. 2E). This data indicate the role of brain ADHs (in particular ADH III) in dopamine metabolism, but it could not provide any evidences of its participation in alcohol consumption regulation."
9,Immunization of SPF Wistar rats led to production of high levels of antibodies against ADHs,"3.2 Immunization of SPF Wistar rats led to production of high levels of antibodies against ADHs To evaluate the role of serum ADH I in regulation of alcohol consumption we performed active immunization of SPF Wistar rats against ADHs (described in Materials and Methods section). Prior to the study, SPF Wistar rats were alcoholized using two-bottle choice method during 4months, ethanol deprivation was performed 7days before the immunization, the immunization was performed during alcohol withdrawal. For the immunization we injected the rats with recombinant equine ADH (Sigma-Aldrich) as an antigen and immunomodulator polyoxidonium (azoximer bromide, LLC “NPO PetrovaxPharm”) as an adjuvant [30]. ADH I, especially its active center, is highly conserved in mammals, that enables production of cross-reactive antibodies which should be specific to rat serum ADH I. Despite the fact that ADHs play an essential role in metabolism of the range of alcohols and its functioning is essential for the health, such kind of immunization appears to be a safe procedure: produced antibodies affect only extracellular ADHs (including serum ADH I) and could not block or eliminate any intracellular ADH isoforms located in tissues (liver, brain, stomach etc.). The levels of anti-ADH antibodies, tested on the 32th and 49th days of the experiment using ELISA assay, were significantly higher in immunized groups of animals (Fig. 3 ). Minor levels of anti-ADH antibodies in control groups could be explained by non-specific binding of secondary antibodies during ELISA assay. Thereby, current method of immunization was successful and led to production of anti-ADH antibodies."
10,Active immunization of Wistar rats did not lead to any behavioral impairments,"3.3 Active immunization of Wistar rats did not lead to any behavioral impairments Active immunization did not lead to any behavioral impairments in experimental rats comparing to control groups. Open field test, which was performed on the 17th day of the experiment (before alcoholization), demonstrated minor increase in motor activity of immunized rats, both in ADH- and KLH-administered groups (Fig. 4 ). This stimulatory effect could be explained by the activation of the immune response which is frequently associated with elevated mobility of experimental animals [36]. Elevated plus maze test performed on the 18th day (Fig. 4) could not detect any changes in behavioral parameters of the animals (the time in the open arms and the number of entries into the open arms) after immunization that indicates no influence of active immunization on spontaneous exploratory activity and anxiety of the rats [31]."
11,Immunization against ADHs led to decrease in 15% ethanol consumption by Wistar rats,"3.4 Immunization against ADHs led to decrease in 15% ethanol consumption by Wistar rats We started re-alcoholization on the 22th day of the experiment. We observed a gradual increase in 15% ethanol consumption in all control groups of animals (Fig. 5 ). Starting from the 47th day of the experiment (25th day after alcoholization start) immunized rats showed no further increase and even demonstrated moderate reduction in alcohol consumption. The difference in ethanol consumption between control groups and immunized animals was 30% on average. Animals injected with polyoxidonium adjuvant without antigen or with combination of KLH and polyoxidonium showed no significant differences in alcohol consumption comparing to alcoholized control group that indicates the absence of effects of irrelevant immunization on alcohol consumption. These data indicate specific effect of immunization against ADHs on alcohol consumption by SPF Wistar rats. Supposedly this effect is associated with inhibition of serum ADH I isoform, highly represented during chronical alcohol consumption [17]. This process could lead to recovery of dopamine, serotonin and other neurotransmitters metabolism, reduction of depression level and alcohol consumption."
12,Alcoholized groups of the rats demonstrated decreased narcosis time and increased time of loss of the righting reflex in ethanol-induced narcosis test comparing to intact control,"3.5 Alcoholized groups of the rats demonstrated decreased narcosis time and increased time of loss of the righting reflex in ethanol-induced narcosis test comparing to intact control Despite the fact that the rats of alcoholized groups demonstrated high levels of 15% ethanol consumption in two-bottle choice conditions, we estimated their physiological alcohol motivation on the 40th day of the experiment using ethanol-induced narcosis test (Fig. 6 ). The duration of ethanol-induced narcosis was identical in all alcoholized groups and significantly lower than in intact and non-alcoholized rats. The time of the loss of the righting reflex was identical in all alcoholized groups and elevated comparing to intact rats. Supposedly these effects could be triggered by elevated activity of enzymes of ethanol metabolism during long-term alcohol consumption. These data indicate physiological changes in the rats of alcoholized groups typical for ethanol metabolism in alcohol-addictive subjects [37]. The absence of the differences between alcoholized groups indicates that immunization did not cause any changes in ethanol metabolism: immunization against ADH targeted serum isoform and did not affect the major liver intracellular isoform that plays the key role in alcohol utilization."
13,Immunization against ADHs was associated with recovery of behavioral parameters in alcoholized Wistar rats,"3.6 Immunization against ADHs was associated with recovery of behavioral parameters in alcoholized Wistar rats We performed exploratory closed plus-maze test on the 34th day of the experiment (two weeks after the start of alcoholization) to evaluate exploratory and motor activities of the rats and their learning and memory abilities. Alcoholized control, alcoholized polyoxidonium injected and alcoholized KLH injected animals demonstrated (Fig. 7 ) significant decrease in horizontal mobility (parameter: distance passed) that could be associated with alcohol intake [38]. Immunization itself without alcoholization did not influence motor activity of rats, while immunization of alcoholized rats against ADHs partially recovered horizontal activity of the rats to intact control level. It is important to mention that alcoholization significantly increased length of the first episode of maze patrolling that is associated with reduction of attention, decreased exploratory activity and serves as an indicator of alcohol intoxication [32]. Alcoholization of immunized animals did not cause any changes in the length of the first episode of maze patrolling in contrast to effects observed for alcoholized control rats that indicates protective role of the immunization. Protective action of the immunization is supposedly associated with neutralization of the changes in neurotransmitters metabolism which are typical for intact animals after long-term alcohol consumption [39]. In Porsolt forced swim test, performed on the 46th day of the experiment (4weeks after alcoholization start), we observed 2-fold increase in immobility time of alcoholized control animals and 1,5-fold decrease in active swimming time comparing to intact control group (Fig. 7). This effect could be interpreted as depressive condition [40] and is typical for chronical alcohol abuse [41]. This condition is also associated with deficiency of biogenic amines (mainly dopamine and serotonin) in the brain and in peripheral blood [42]. Alcoholization of rats immunized against ADHs did not cause any changes in active swimming time comparing to intact control animals. These data demonstrate protective role of immunization against ADHs by decreased alcohol-induced depression level which correlated with low alcohol consumption induced by the immunization. All animal groups administered with polyoxidonium adjuvant showed normal immobility time levels. These data indicate a non-specific effect of polyoxidonium on tolerance of alcoholized animals to depressive conditions that could be associated with activation of immune response. Non-alcoholized control groups demonstrated no behavioral changes in Porsolt forced swim test comparing to intact control."
14,Alcoholization and immunization did not cause any significant changes in biochemical composition of blood,"3.7 Alcoholization and immunization did not cause any significant changes in biochemical composition of blood To estimate probable biochemical background of observed anti-alcoholic effect of immunization, we evaluated blood composition on the 21th, 32th and 49th days of the experiment. Blood analysis revealed significant difference in triglycerides concentrations between injected and control groups of animals on the 21th and 32th days (Fig. 8 ). Decrease in triglycerides levels correlated with administration of polyoxidonium adjuvant and was not specifically connected with immunization or alcoholization. This kind of action was previously described: administration of some types of adjuvants, in particular complete Freund's adjuvant [43], leads to reduction of blood lipids level which is associated with local inflammation [44]. On the 49th day all the differences in triglyceride levels between groups disappeared (Fig. 8) that is probably associated with full termination of immunostimulatory effect of polyoxidonium. Other blood parameters (concentrations of bilirubin, glucose, protein, ALT, AST) did not depend on immunization, alcoholization and adjuvant administration (Fig. 8). These data indicate that our method of active immunization against ADHs provides precisely target effect and does not cause any significant changes in biochemical blood composition and does not detect any toxic effects on the rats."
15,Discussion,"Alcohol dependence is a complex disease that leads to impairments in metabolism of the range of neurotransmitters [45]. Dopamine and serotonin deficiencies are associated with chronic alcohol addiction and cause alcohol abuse both in human and rats [5,46]. Combining the observations that long term alcohol consumption leads to increased activity of ADHs in different tissues [14,15] and that different forms of ADH are able to participate in metabolism of some types of endogenous neurotransmitters [5,6,8] we hypothesized that increased ADHs activity could be responsible for impairments in neurotransmitters metabolism and enhanced alcohol consumption. In the previous studies it was demonstrated that acute intraperitoneal administration of 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), a nonselective competitive inhibitor of ADHs, leads to short-term decrease in alcohol consumption in the rats [16]. According to well-described role of mesolimbic and dopaminergic systems in formation of alcohol addiction [47], we aimed to study participation of brain ADH isoforms in this process. In particular we were interested ADH III located in the neurons of hippocampus [4,9] that appears to play an important role in alcohol motivation sending projections to the mesolimbic system [10]. In the current study we performed inhibition of brain ADH isoforms in alcoholized SPF Wistar rats by intranasal administration of 4-methylpirazole that led to significant reduction of ADH III activity in the brain and did not influence serum ADHs activity (Fig. 2). This effect correlated with dose-dependent decrease in dopamine concentration and respective raise of DOPAC (dopamine metabolic product) level. These data indicate the direct role of brain ADHs (in particular ADH III) in dopamine metabolism. However inhibition of brain ADHs did not cause any changes in alcohol consumption or in the levels of serotonin and epinephrine in the brain. Thus we demonstrated that brain ADHs do not influence alcohol addiction in SPF Wistar rats. We indicated serum ADH isoforms as another possible regulator of alcohol addiction. It was previously described that long-term alcohol consumption leads to compensatory increase in serum ADH I activity [17,18,48], that could be associated with enhanced oxidation of metabolic products of some neurotransmitters (such as dopamine, serotonin and epinephrine) located in the serum [8,11–13]. These processes could supposedly lead to neurotransmitters deficit and become the reason of chronic depressive conditions that induce further alcohol consumption. In this study we performed active immunization against ADHs in Wistar SPF rats that led to production of anti-ADH antibodies (Fig. 3) and did not cause any significant changes in animal behavior (Fig. 4) or blood composition (Fig. 8). Despite the fact that ADHs play an essential role in metabolism of the range of alcohols and its functioning is essential for the health, such kind of immunization appears to be a safe procedure: produced antibodies affect only extracellular ADHs (including serum ADH I) and could not block or eliminate any intracellular ADH isoforms located in such tissues as liver, brain or stomach and appeared to be the main pools of ADH. It is important to mention that in ethanol-induced narcosis test immunization did not influence the narcosis time and the time of the loss of the righting reflex in alcoholized animals (Fig. 6) that indicates the tolerance of alcohol metabolizing systems to immunization against serum ADHs [37]. Immunization against ADHs led to 30% decrease in 15% ethanol consumption in two bottle choice method by previously alcoholized Wistar rats (Fig. 5). Described effect could be conditioned by repression of alcohol-induced serum ADHs activity accompanied with normalization of neurotransmitters levels during immunization. This proposition is confirmed by the fact that immunization of alcoholized rats led to recovery of such behavioral parameters as motor and exploratory activities, anxiety and depression level (Fig. 7). However, it is important to notice that performed experiments do not describe this mechanism completely and that recovery of behavioral parameters of the rats after immunization could be associated with decreased levels of alcohol intake itself but not with normalization of neurotransmitters metabolism. Alcoholized status of experimental rats was confirmed by ethanol-induced narcosis test: alcoholized animals demonstrated lower duration of the narcosis than intact rats (Fig. 6) that is typical for alcohol-addictive subjects [37]. In conclusion we can say that in this study we indicated an important role of serum ADHs in regulation of alcohol consumption and modulation of alcohol-induced depressive condition. Active immunization against serum ADHs demonstrated high efficiency in reduction of ethanol consumption and recovery of general behavioral parameters and showed no significant side effects on animal behavior or blood composition. Active immunization against ADHs is an interesting and effective approach that in future could be used for alcohol addiction treatment."
