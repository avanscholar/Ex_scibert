0,Introduction,"Carbonyl compounds such as benzaldehydes are important intermediates in the production of functional organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs and agrochemicals. Benzaldehydes are traditionally synthesized by hydrolysis of benzyl chlorides or vapor-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohols/toluene [1,2]. The main limitations of these methods are the generation of toxic acids, and the use of harsh reaction conditions and expensive and/or toxic oxidants [3]. The development of sustainable processes for benzaldehyde synthesis is therefore important [4–6]. Sustainable processes for liquid oxidation of benzyl alcohol with air or O2 as the oxidant are preferred because they are environmentally benign and have good atom economy [7–11]. Noble-metal-based catalysts [12] such as Au [13], Pd-grafted hydroxyapatite [14] and Pd@Cu(II)-metal oxide framework [15] were initially used because they promote adsorption and activation of alcohols through formation of alkyl alkoxides [16]. Recently, room-temperature oxidation of benzyl alcohol in good yields (~77%) over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst with air as the oxidant under additive-free aqueous conditions was reported [17]. The use of transition-metal (TM)-based catalysts instead of noble-metal-based catalysts is more in line with the requirements of a sustainable chemical industry. Much progress has recently been made in the development of active and cost-effective TM-based catalysts. Mn-based catalysts (mainly manganese oxides) are efficient catalysts in the oxidation of a range of species, including water [18], amines [19], CO, and volatile organic compounds [20]. Although the use of Mn-based catalysts to promote alcohol oxidation has been explored, these catalysts are generally difficult to synthesize because of tedious preparation processes or stringent reaction conditions such as high temperatures and use of hazardous oxidants. The development of practical approaches for fabricating Mn-based catalysts with improved oxidation activities under mild conditions is therefore needed. Such Mn-based catalysts should contain oxygen vacancy (OV) sites, which can facilitate cleavage of the alcohol O–H bond and consequently improve the alcohol oxidative activity of the Mn-based catalyst [21,22]. Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) such as MnO x and MnCo2O4 have high activities and near-optimal features [23,24]. Many studies have shown that the alcohol oxidative performances of TMOs are significantly promoted by the mobility of oxygen species originating from exchange between lattice and free oxygen at OV sites [25]. Efforts have been made to fabricate OVs in TMO catalysts [26] by (1) decreasing the TMO thickness with organic amines [27] and (2) thermal treatment under reducing gases [28] such as NH3 and H2. However, these methods have the disadvantage of using hazardous gases or expensive organic amines. The OV stability should also be considered, especially under the oxidizing conditions used for alcohol oxidation. Anion doping, e.g., with nitrogen, is a feasible approach to creating OVs in TMOs [29,30]. Recent research on nitrogen-doped MnO2 materials has shown that N heteroatom doping at interstitial sites is the key step in OV formation, with subsequent promotion of O2 adsorption and activation [31]. Recently, we found that urea is a good raw material for the hydrothermal synthesis of nitrogen-doped MnO2 (N–MnO2) with abundant OVs. The N–MnO2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity in the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [29] and the synthesis of benzoxazole at room temperature [32]. In addition to their role in OV formation, other effects of nitrogen dopants on TMO catalysts should be taken into account. For example, nitrogen dopants can induce strong metal–support interactions through formation of Pd–N species in Pd/TiO2 and this favors dissociative adsorption in nitrobenzene hydrogenation [33]. Based on our previous findings of hydrothermal synthesis of heteroatom nitrogen-doped MnO2 [31,32], herein we report a practical method for synthesizing interstitial-nitrogen-doped manganese oxides (N–MnO2−x ), with urea as the nitrogen source. The as-prepared N–MnO2 catalysts gave superior catalytic performances in the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol at 30 ​°C without any additives. The activities of the N–MnO2 catalysts were systematically studied with respect to their surface OV sites to clarify the mechanism involved in alcohol oxidation with interstitial-nitrogen-doped catalysts. These results will pave the way for the use of such catalysts in other oxidative reactions."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Catalyst structure determination,"2.1 Catalyst structure determination Although MnO2 materials have been receiving increasing attention because of their oxidative abilities and low toxicities, there is only a few reports on N–MnO2 catalysts [31]. The use of N2 plasma techniques enables selective doping of MnO2 with interstitial N atoms at a level of ~2.0 ​wt%. Hetero-nitrogen doping at interstitial sites is a key step in OV formation and subsequent promotion of O2 adsorption and activation. We recently developed a series of nitrogen-doped manganese oxides as heterogeneous oxidative catalysts for synthesizing high-value chemicals with minimal waste production [32]. Here, we report a new hydrothermal method for doping of MnO2 with interstitial N atoms. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the N–MnO2 catalyst was synthesized by mixing urea and Mn species, crystallization in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined stainless-steel reactor, and calcining at 300–400 ​°C for 5 ​h. We thoroughly investigated the effects of the amount of urea and the calcination temperature on the physicochemical properties of N x -MnO2-T, where x and T are the molar ratio, which was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the calcination temperature, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1b) of the prepared N1.80-MnO2-T (T ​= ​300–400 ​°C) catalysts are identical to that of β-MnO2 (JCPDS No. 30–0820). When the calcination temperature was increased (T ​= ​500–700 ​°C), the crystal structure of the prepared catalysts changed from MnO2 to Mn2O3 (JCPDS No. 041–1442). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1c) of N1.8-MnO2-300 shows estimated d-spacings of 0.52 and 0.31 ​nm, which correspond to the (200) and (110) facets, respectively, of MnO2 [34–36]. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images of N1.8-MnO2-300 in Fig. 1d show the presence of three major elements, i.e., N, Mn and O. This confirms that hetero-nitrogen was successfully doped into MnO2 via the hydrothermal method. The amounts of N heteroatoms calculated by TEM-EDX mapping and XPS (Table 1 ) are similar, i.e., ~1.8 ​mol%, for N1.8-MnO2-300. Among N heteroatom species, interstitial N is considered to play a key role in improving the catalytic activity of MnO2 by reducing the OV formation energy and introducing new singly ionized OVs [30]. Only one peak, at ~399.5 ​eV, which is assigned to interstitial N, was observed in the XP spectrum of N1.8-MnO2-300 (Fig. 1e). This indicates that N heteroatom species were selectively doped at interstitial sites. The amount of N dopant increased to ~2.4 ​mol% with increasing amount of urea. The new peak that appeared at ~396.7 ​eV in the N 1s XP spectrum of N2.4-MnO2-300 is assigned to substitutional N (Fig. 1e). Substitutional N atoms, which easily occupy OV sites, are considered to be less conducive than interstitial N atoms to enhancing the OV accessibility. These results show that manganese dioxides doped with interstitial N atoms were successfully fabricated by a hydrothermal method. The mechanism of doping with interstitial N in this hydrothermal synthetic method was clarified by recording infrared (IR) spectra of the synthesized catalysts (Fig. 2 a). The IR spectra of the N1.8-MnO2 samples with and without calcination were compared. The spectrum of the N1.8-MnO2-300 sample contains three peaks, at 1412 (C–N), 1385 (N–O) and 1632 (O–H) cm−1 [30], and that of the N1.8-MnO2 sample contains peaks at 861 (C–N), 1385 (N–O), 1075 ​cm−1 (C–O), 1412 (C–N) and 1802 (CO) cm−1 [37]. The N–O peak is assigned to interstitial N directly connected to lattice oxygen (Mn–O–N or Mn–N–O). This is consistent with the XPS results for N1.8-MnO2-300 (Fig. 1e). The N–O bond is formed by adsorption and dissociation of O2 on N1.8-MnO2-300. The peaks at 1412 (C–N) and 1385 (N–O) cm−1 disappeared (Fig. 2b) when the N1.8-MnO2 calcination temperature was higher than 500 ​°C. The disappearance of the N–O bond (1385 ​cm−1) from the IR spectrum, and the weakening of the peak at 399.5 ​eV and appearance of the peak at 396.7 ​eV in the XP spectrum (Fig. 2c) indicate that the interstitial N (Mn–N–O or Mn–O–N) was converted to substitutional N (Mn–N–Mn) when the calcination temperature was increased from 400 ​°C to 600 ​°C. On the basis of this analysis, we suggest that the disappearance of CO/C–O in the N1.8-MnO2 sample after calcining is essential for the formation of interstitial-N-doped MnO2. The interstitial N atoms are a primary factor in obtaining OVs in MnO2. Fig. 3 a shows the O 1s XP spectra of N1.8-MnO2-300 and MnO2. Unlike that of MnO2, the spectrum of N1.8-MnO2-300 has a strong peak at ca. 531.4 ​eV. This suggests formation of abundant OVs [38,39] in N1.8-MnO2-300 doped with interstitial N atoms. It should be noted that the interstitial N doped into the MnO2 lattice seems to strongly affect the interactions between Mn species and nearby oxygens. This clearly changes the effective charge on the oxygens and shifts the binding energy (Fig. 3a). As mentioned above, some of the interstitially doped N species in the N1.8-MnO2 sample were converted to substitutional N species when the calcination temperature was increased from 400 ​°C to 600 ​°C or higher. This significantly decreased the amount of OVs (Fig. 3b and c)."
3,Clean catalytic oxidation of alcohol,"2.2 Clean catalytic oxidation of alcohol The aerobic oxidation of p-methylbenzyl alcohol (p-MBA) was used to assess the effects of interstitial N dopants and OVs on the catalytic performances of MnO2 catalysts. The first set of experiments, in which the catalytic performances of various MnO2 catalysts were evaluated, was used to analyze the active sites of the as-prepared catalysts. The effects of mass-transfer limitations were eliminated by performing all the experiments at a stirring speed of 1200 ​rpm (Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the catalytic activity (<1%) of commercial MnO2 was negligible. In contrast, MnN x O2−x obtained by calcining in an NH3 atmosphere (details are given in Supporting information) showed moderate catalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation of p-MBA and the yield of p-methylbenzaldehyde (p-MBZ) was 27.7%. Note that the amounts of OVs (Fig. 6 ) and Mn valences (3.89 for MnO2 and 3.90 for MnN x O2−x , Table 1) of MnO2 and MnN x O2−x are similar, therefore the higher catalytic performance of MnN x O2−x is attributed to its N heteroatom dopants (~1.5 ​mol% in MnN x O2−x ). This indicates that the N heteroatom dopants in MnN x O2−x provide catalytically active sites for the aerobic oxidation of p-MBA. The catalytic activity of N1.8-MnO2-300 is clearly higher than those of MnO2 and MnN x O2−x , which gave a 94.7% yield of p-MBZ within 6 ​h (Fig. 5a). The amounts of interstitial N in MnN x O2−x (~1.5 ​mol%) and N1.8-MnO2-300 (~1.8 ​mol%) are similar (Table 1), therefore the significantly higher catalytic activity of N1.8-MnO2-300 is attributed to its more abundant OVs. This result shows that the OVs in the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst are the key catalytic sites for efficient aerobic oxidation of p-MBA. In a second set of experiments, the performances of N1.8-MnO x -T (T ​= ​300, 400, 500, 600 and 700) catalysts were used to identify the optimum calcination temperature. As shown in Fig. 5b, the catalytic activities of N1.8-MnO2-T (T ​= ​300 and 400) in the aerobic oxidation of p-MBA to p-MBZ were better than those of N1.8-MnO2-T (T ​= ​500, 600 and 700)."
4,Mechanistic analysis,"2.3 Mechanistic analysis The performances of the N1.8-MnO2 catalysts suggest that the interstitial N dopant species and OVs in the N1.8-MnO2 catalyst are the key active components in the catalytic reaction. According to the Mars–van Kervelen mechanism, OVs and lattice oxygen (O2−) are both involved in the storage and mobility of oxygen species during oxidation reactions [38]. The reducibility of N1.8-MnO2-300, which is important and closely related to its redox ability, was investigated by H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The reduction of manganese oxides involves the following three steps [39]: (1) MnO 2 → step 1 Mn 2 O 3 → step 2 Mn 3 O 4 → step 3 MnO The reduction curve (Fig. 7 a) for the commercial MnO2 sample contains three peaks, at ca. 352, 460,and 521 ​°C, which correspond to the transformations in step 1, step 2 and step 3, respectively, in Eq. (1). The reduction curve (Fig. 7a) for N1.8-MnO2-300 also has three peaks, but is completely different from that of commercial MnO2. The lowest reduction temperature, at ca. 60 ​°C, is directly related to the excellent mobility of oxygen species at OVs. Relative to those in the MnO2 reduction curve, the reduction peaks in the N1.8-MnO2-300 curve that correspond to step 1 and step 2 are clearly shifted to lower temperatures (Fig. 7a). This shows that the reducibility of MnO2 is significantly improved by interstitial N doping. The H2-TPR analysis shows that the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst has oxygen species with excellent mobility because of its abundant OVs. This significantly improves its catalytic activity in alcohol oxidation. The underlying oxidative mechanism of alcohol oxidation on the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst was investigated by using ex situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 7b). In the initial stage (5 ​min, Fig. 7c), two peaks at 1019 and 1158 ​cm−1 are observed in the range 800–2000 ​cm−1. The peak at 1019 ​cm−1 is assigned to the C–N stretching vibration mode [40]; C–N bonds are formed by chemical adsorption of –C–OH groups on N sites of the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst. The peak at 1158 ​cm−1, which is associated with the C–O stretching vibration [41], indicates adsorption of p-MBA on the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst. The peaks from adsorbed C–O species (1158 ​cm−1) vanish, whereas the intensities of the peaks from adsorbed CO species increase (1181 ​cm−1), with increasing reaction time (4 ​h; Fig. 7c). On the basis of the above analysis and previous literature reports [4,23,27], a possible mechanism for oxidation of p-MBA over the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst, which involves C–N intermediates, is shown in Scheme 1 . First, O2 molecules undergo dissociation and one adsorbed O2 fills a vacancy site (Step 1). Then p-MBA molecules can be adsorbed on the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst by formation of -C-O-(Mn) and -C-N- bonds (Step 2). This is supported by the IR spectroscopic analysis, which shows the formation of C–N and C–O bonds (Fig. 7c). The activation and deprotonation (i (1), Scheme 1) of O–H group [21] is occurred at this process, which leading to the formation of unstable metal-alkoxides species [16]. Those unstable species undergo α-C–H cleavage at activated interstitial N sites (i (2), Scheme 1) and/or OVs (i (2)’, Scheme 1). Stepwise desorption of p-MBZ (Step 3) and H2O molecules (Step 4) from the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst complete the catalytic cycle. Our proposed mechanism suggests that interstitial N dopants and OVs may act as synergistic active sites. This shows that the aerobic oxidation of p-MBA molecules involves cooperation between N dopant species and OVs in the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst."
5,Potential practical applications,"2.4 Potential practical applications Potential practical applications of the catalysts were investigated by evaluating the large-scale applicability, recyclability, and general applicability of the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst. First, a gram-scale synthesis over N1.8-MnO2-300 was performed with 1.5 ​g of the catalyst and 5 ​mmol of p-MBA (0.61 ​g). The p-MBA yield was >99% after reaction for 8 ​h ​at 30 ​°C (Fig. 8 ). The stability of the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst was evaluated by performing a gram-scale oxidation of p-MBA over the recycled catalyst (Fig. 8). The yield of p-MBZ was still greater than 82% after ten cycles. The slight decrease in the yield of the desired product is attributed to catalyst loss during recovery (fresh: 1.5 ​g; after ten cycles: ~1.0 ​g). The general applicability of the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst in the oxidation of structurally diverse alcohol derivatives was investigated by performing oxidations of benzyl alcohol and its derivatives such as aliphatic, alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl alcohols. The results show that these of alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl alcohols were oxidized to the corresponding aldehydes in 6 ​h ​at 30 ​°C with toluene as the solvent (Table 2 , entries 1–11). The yields were 81.4%–91.4%. Compared with the reported catalysts (Table 2, entries 14–16) [42–44], the catalytic performance of the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst is also superior. In contrast, almost no desirable product was observed when aliphatic alcohols such as 1-hexanol and 1-octanol were used as reactants (Table 2, entries 12 and 13)."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we constructed an advanced MnO2 catalyst with abundant OVs through interstitial nitrogen doping. When used in the oxidation of p-MBA to p-MBZ, the N1.8-MnO2-300 catalyst gave a 94.7% yield of the desired product at 30 ​°C, with excellent recyclability. The product yields were 27.7% and < 1% over MnN x O2−x and a commercially available MnO2 catalyst, respectively. A detailed analysis of the reaction showed that the superior catalytic performance of N1.8-MnO2-300 is strongly related to OVs and interstitial N doping, which improve the alcohol oxidation efficiency. The results show that N1.8-MnO2-300 has potential as a scalable, recyclable, and generally applicable catalyst for aerobic oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. The same strategy can be used to fabricate a wide range of OV-rich TMOs by interstitial nitrogen doping for use as catalysts for other oxidative reactions."
