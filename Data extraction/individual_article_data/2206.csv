0,Introduction,"There has been a growing interest in manufacturing chemicals and fuels from biomass-resources for environmentally-friendly society design because they possessed reproducibility and low impact to CO2 emission owing to the carbon offset concept. Over these decades, a number of laboratories have studied on the way for upgrading such new green feedstocks to convert into highly-valuable materials instead of petroleum-based processes [1–4]. Because the biomass resources contains a lot of oxygen itself, reductive deoxygenation treatments, i.e. hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, with hydrogen agents are central important to exploit processes for biomass transformations [5,6]. In previous reports, hydrogenation of furaldehydes has been widely examined with H2 gas as a hydrogen source. Synthesis of furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), respectively, from 2-furaldehyde (furfural) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), has attracted many researchers because of their outstanding applications for further transformation routes towards valuable chemicals and polymer intermediates. Nakagawa et al. investigated FOL production via hydrogenation of furfural over Ir and/or Pd-supported SiO2 [7] and Ni/SiO2 [8]. For instance, the Ir/SiO2 served 93% yield of FOL with 99% selectivity at H2 (80bar) at 313K for 24h. It was considered that prohibition for over-hydrogenated product formations such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and pentanediols was one of the key functions for the development of metal-supported catalyst in furfural hydrogenation [9]. High selectivity (>96%) was also reported with Cu/SiO2 [10] and PtSn/SiO2 [11] by a combination of pressurized H2 (10bar) and 2-propanol solvent at 373–383K. While, for hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF, Ohyama et al. examined Au clusters-supported γ-Al2O3 catalyst and produced >96% yield under pressurized H2 (30–40bar) [12,13]. Metal supported alumina catalyst such as Cu/γ-Al2O3 [14], Ru/γ-Al2O3 [15] and Ni/Al2O3 [16] could also accelerate the high pressurized H2 gas-mediated liquid-phase hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF at 20–30bar. In these cases, the high selectivity for BHMF was observed only at the initial stage because further transformation to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF) or 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) was proceeded. In this study, we investigate catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural, 5-methylfulaldehyde (5-MF), HMF using sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) as a hydrogen donor. These three aldehydes were produced from hemicellulose biomass resources via hydration/isomerization/dehydration of saccharides with one-pot manner [17,18]. If this catalytic hydrogen transformation methodology works well, expensive instruments and operation risks due to the utilization of high pressurized condition would be decreased, effectively. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions with NaH2PO2 as a hydrogen source had been examined by few research group, previously. Boyer et al. attempted to use NaH2PO2 for Pd/C-catalyzed mild hydrogen transfer reaction in 1985 [19]. They successfully proceeded the hydrogenations of aromatic ketones and aldehydes, alkenes, N-oxides and azides with significant yields in tetrahydrofuran/water solution. Hydrogenolysis of various chloride compounds (dechlorination) were also examined in the same report. Oba et al. further investigated the Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of various organic substrates including organohalides in water containing a nonionic surfactant using NaH2PO2 as a hydrogen source in 2013 [20]. They found that the addition of a nonionic surfactant, e.g. Tween 20, provided to be effective to obtain satisfactory product yields in most cases. However, application of the catalytic hydrogenation process with NaH2PO2 for facile transformation of biomass-based compounds has never been reported till today. This challenge would bring further interests to the application of conventional hydrogen donor agent, NaH2PO2, for next generation hydrogenation reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2•H2O, ca. 3000 JPY per 500g), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 5wt% metal-supported catalysts (Pd/Al2O3, Pd/C, Pt/C, Rh/C, Ru/C), furfuryl alcohol (FOL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and 1-butanol (1-BuOH) were purchased from Wako Pure Chem. Ind., Ltd. Super-purified water (18.2MΩcm) was generated by a Smart2Pure (Thermo Sci. Inc.). 2-Furaldehyde (furfural) was provided from Acros Organics whereas 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde (5-MF) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) were obtained from Simga-Aldrich Co. LLC. Toront Res. Chem. Inc. served 5-methyl furfuryl alcohol (5-MFOL) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Naphthalene was from Tokyo Chem. Ind. Co., Ltd. supplier."
3,Characterizations,2.2 Characterizations Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by a H-7650 (Hitachi Co.) at 100kV. TEM grids made by Cu (grid pitches: 150µm) were used to stabilize/disperse the powder sample. Particle size distribution was created on the basis of 1300 particles selected randomly with the ImageJ software (ver. 1.50i). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a SmartLabo (Rigaku Co.) using Cu–Kα X-ray source accelerated at 30mA and 40kV with a Bragg–Brentano focusing mode. A Ni filter was used to reduce the intensity of the Cu–Kβ line in the X-ray source. Degree from 5 to 80 was scanned at a rate of 2.0degmin−1 with 0.02deg steps. The obtained XRD patterns were analyzed by a PDXL software ver. 1.8.0.3 (Rigaku Co.) to compare the obtained data with the crystal phases recorded in the database and estimate the half maximum full-width (HMFW) for the calculation of crystalline size by the Scherrer equation.
4,Reactions,"2.3 Reactions According to the previous report [19], we have examined the target transfer hydrogenation in THF/water solvent. All reactions were performed in the packed ACE glass tube (15ml vol.). First of all, substrate (0.5mmol) was resolved with 2ml of THF solvent in the reactor. Secondary, catalyst without any pretreatments (50mg) was put into the mixture, and then 6ml of THF was further added. Finally, 2ml of NaH2PO2 aq. was introduced immediately into the vessel, and then the reaction was started under vigorously stirring (800rpm) at room temperature (25°C). After adequate time, the reaction mixture was filtered off with a Millex syringe filter (0.20µm), and analyzed by a GC-FID (Shimazdu GC-2014). The Agilent J&W advanced capillary GC columns of DB-1 (50m×0.320mm (i.d. 0.25µm)) and DB-FFAP (30m×0.320mm (i.d. 0.25µm) were used, respectively, for furfural derivatives and HMF and 5-MF derivatives analyzes. Naphthalene (for furfural and 5-MF hydrogenation) and 1-BuOH (for HMF hydrogenation) were used as an internal standard to ascertain the conversion and yield with a calibration curve method. To determine the reusability, the used Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was washed with water (15ml) and centrifuged at three times. After drying under vacuum at room temperature overnight, additional reactions were performed with same procedures mentioned above."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural,"3.1 Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural Furfural is the simplest structure among three furaldehydes, thus, the advantage for NaH2PO2 utilization as a hydrogen donor has been demonstrated with furfural at the initial stage for this study. Table 1 shows the effect of catalyst element on the hydrogenation of furfural with Na2HPO2 as a hydrogen source. Among carbon-supported catalysts, Pd/C only shows an activity for the reaction with moderate yield (41%) for FOL production (entry 2). The THFOL, an over-hydrogenation product of FOL, was obtained as a by-product with a low yield (8%). Pt/C, Rh/C and Ru/C gave conversions of furfural with only 7–8% and yields for FOL and/or THFOL were not detected at all (entries 3–5). Because in the case of blank served a similar result, 11% conversion with 0% yields (entry 6), these three elements seemed to be inactive completely for the hydrogenation of furfural with Na2HPO2 under such mild reaction conditions. The Pd/Al2O3 lead the highest values for the reaction with 91% conversion, 64% yield for FOL, and 5% yield for THFOL (entry 1). To investigate the differences in activity between Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/C, Figs. 1 and 2 show TEM images and XRD patterns for two commercial catalysts. TEM images indicated that a variety of Pd nanoparticles seemed to be immobilized well on the support in both cases. The Pd/C catalyst gave a wide size distribution as shown in Fig. 1(e) with the average of 5.7nm. While on the other hand, the size distribution of Pd/Al2O3 was hardly described owing to unshapen borders between particle and support. The evidence of Pd metal nanoparticles presence on Pd/C was nicely supported by XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 2(b). The peak appeared at 2θ =40.16, 46.70 and 68.19 was corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) plane of Pd metal (No. 01-088-2335, PDXL data base), respectively. The crystalline size at Pd(111) was calculated to be 25.8nm. 1 1 It seems that Pd/C was composed with the mixtures of large and small Pd particles in Pd/C, detected by XRD and TEM analyses, respectively. While, on the other hand, these peaks for Pd metal were hardly identified in the case of Pd/Al2O3 because these were overlapped with θ-Al2O3 patterns (No. 00-011-0517, PDXL data base) (Fig. 2(a)). The crystalline size at Pd(111) was tentatively estimated to be 2.8nm in the case of Pd/Al2O3. Accordingly, we conclude that the presence of finer and smaller Pd(0) species on Pd/Al2O3 was related to its higher reactivity for the catalytic hydrogenation reaction with NaH2PO2 agent than Pd/C. Because various types of hydrogen donors have been examined in the previous reports for transfer hydrogenation reactions [21–24], the effect of hydrogen donor was compared in the hydrogenation of furfural at room temperature. Table 2 shows the results of activity for hydrogenation of furfural using various types of hydrogen donor agents. Formic acid, 2-propanol and urea produced no FOL and/or THFOL at room temperature (entries 3–5). It was supposed that these needed higher temperature and/or different active centers to generate hydrogen source via dehydrogenation of the donor agent. A significant value (87% yield) was observed in NaBH4 donor (entry 6), however, it seemed to be almost non-catalytic cycle because the 72% yield was given in the absence of catalyst (entry 7). Accordingly, only NaH2PO2 donor could proceed the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at room temperature with significant activity (entries 1–2). Various amount of NaH2PO2 was applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural with NaH2PO2 (Fig. 3 ). Increase of NaH2PO2 amount led an increase in FOL yield from 0mmol to 0.5mmol drastically, and slight decreases in FOL yield from 68% to 55% were observed till 2.0mmol. The use of large amount of NaH2PO2 (>2.0mmol) gave large diminishments in not only the yield for FOL but also the conversion of furfural: i.e. 55% conversion with 23% FOL yield for 3.0mmol NaH2PO2 whereas 11% conversion with 0% FOL yield in 5.0mmol. Moreover, in the cases of 3.0mmol and 5.0mmol, although a large amount of bubbles were generated during reaction, the production of THFOL, an over-hydrogenation product of FOL, was not detected (0% yields). These results suggested that the excess amount of NaH2PO2 agents might inhibit the hydrogenation reaction of furfural. Time course of the reaction was plotted in Fig. 4 . Both conversion of furfural and yield of FOL were increased as a function of reaction time, gradually within 1h. The maximum yield (68%) for FOL was obtained at 2h reaction with 94% conversion and 6% THFOL yield. Except for THFOL production, there were about 20% differences between conversion and yield value during progress of the reaction, however, other by-products were not determined in GC chart. Recycle test was also examined in the Pd/Al2O3 catalyzed hydrogenation of furfural with NaH2PO2 as shown in Fig. 5 . The moderate yields (>55%) could be kept for 4 runs without significant decrease."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation of 5-MF and HMF,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of 5-MF and HMF Catalytic hydrogenations of 5-MF and HMF with a NaH2PO2 agent were also examined (Schemes 1 and 2 ). Effects of NaH2PO2 amount for the hydrogenation of 5-MF and HMF are discussed in Fig. 6 . The observed results had close resemblances to the result in furfural hydrogenation (see Fig. 3). In other word, the yields have a trend to possess a peak top at around 1mmol of NaH2PO2 usage. The conversion and yield at that time were following values, respectively; 45% yield of 5-MFOL with >99% conversion of 5-MF and 63% yield of BHMF with >99% conversion of HMF. GC-TOFMS analysis (JEOL AccuTOF GCx) suggested that deoxygenated side-products were present in the reaction mixture: e.g. 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran in 5-MF hydrogenation whereas 5-MF, 5-MFOL and 5-methyl-THFOL in HMF hydrogenation were detectable with a few quantity. In previous reports, it was suggested that deoxygenation steps of hydroxymethyl group during hydrogenation of HMF were accelerated with the co-existence of acidic agents [25–28]. Therefore, NaH2PO2 would also act as an acid and promote the dehydrogenation step of furaldehydes during our reaction, slightly. Progress of the reaction and recyclability were also investigated in these substrates. Figs. 7 and 8 exhibited the time course and recycle test for the hydrogenation of 5-MF and HMF with NaH2PO2. It was indicated that both reactions had been almost completed within 1h and the activities were reproducible for continuous 4 runs with slight decreases in yield."
8,Conclusion,"The hydrogenation reaction with NaH2PO2 agent was effective for facile transformation of furaldehydes to the corresponding furfuryl alcohols at room temperature, and the reusable Pd/Al2O3 catalyst put the NaH2PO2 agent to be used as a hydrogen source. Maximum yield of 68%, 45% and 63%, respectively, for FOL, 5-MFOL and BHMF was achieved with a simple reaction procedure. 2 2 Substituent effects of the 5th furaldehyde position (H-, CH3- and HOCH2-) on the reactivity still remains unclear, and would be a futural subject in NaH2PO2 utilizations. According to these results, we have concluded that the NaH2PO2 would be a candidate as cheap and easy-handling hydrogen donor agent on the transfer hydrogenation performed even at room temperature."
