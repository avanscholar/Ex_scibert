0,Introduction,"The occurrence of oil or fuel spills into aquatic environments has raised the concern over effective and environmentally benign environmental remediation. On the other hand, with increasingly stringent discharge standards of oily wastewater, the demand for effective removal of oil and non-polar solvents from water is rising. The current conventional cleanup strategies that have been practiced includes the use of dispersants to speed up natural degradation process (Nyankson et al., 2015), in-situ burning (Lin et al., 2005), bioremediation (Atlas, 1991; Atlas and Atlas, 1991) and mechanical recovery from water surface by booms/skimmers (Song et al., 2015) and adsorbents (Choi and Cloud, 1992; Bayat et al., 2005). Amongst these approaches, physical adsorption is deemed the most promising due to its convenience, relatively low-cost, high efficiency while creating no secondary pollution. In principle, an ideal oil sorbent should fulfill the following requirements: (1) selective wettability i.e. superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity, (2) low cost, (3) reusability and (4) remarkable adsorption capacity. Keeping this in mind, numerous types of sorbent materials including mineral products (e.g. zeolites (Sakthivel et al., 2013)), natural products (e.g. rice husks (Kumagai et al., 2007)) and synthetic polymers (e.g. polyurethane sponge (Khosravi and Azizian, 2015)) have been explored. However, sorbents derived from the mineral and natural products are often suffer from low sorption capacity, low buoyancy and poor recyclability whereas the polymeric sorbents are not environmentally friendly and may impose undesirable impacts to the cleanup area. In this regard, carbonaceous materials, which are intrinsically hydrophobic and oleophilic, heat-resistant, chemically inert and lightweight, are more favorable for development of efficient oil sorbent. A significant progress has been made to fabricate ultralow density three-dimensional (3D) carbon-based porous sorbents in the form of aerogel or sponge (Wu et al., 2013; Tai et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). Particularly for aerogel, based on the synthesis approach, the characteristics of the resulting porous structure may differ. One notable example is conventional freeze-casting and unidirectional freeze-casting. Conventional freeze-casting involves a rapid homogeneous solidification of precursor solution induced by isotropic cooling whereas the cooling process in unidirectional freeze-casting (usually assisted by liquid nitrogen) is controlled by a directional thermal gradient. After removal of the ice crystals in the frozen solution via sublimation in freeze-dryer, the resulting structure contains macropores in a replica of sublimated ice crystals and micropores in the wall. The former approach tends to result in isotropic porous structure whereas the latter one gives anisotropic porous structure. Other advanced synthesis methods including hydrothermal reaction (Ma et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017), self-assembly (Chen et al., 2011; Cong et al., 2012) and drying under ambient pressure (Wu and Fu, 2008) have also been reported. In hydrothermal reaction, the synthesis of aerogel is achieved through the self-crosslinking/gelation mechanism without the presence of cross-linkers under high pressure and temperature. On the other hand, the self-assembly of aerogel formed from nanostructured building blocks into macroscopic materials are driven by various interactions such as electrostatic attractions or repulsions and hydrogen bonding (Xia et al., 2011). In contrast to freeze-drying which are energy intensive, aerogel is formed under ambient pressure drying during which the solvent is removed from precursor wet gel while maintaining the structural integrity and porosity. The macroporous network with appropriate strength together with the surface tension plays a significant role to avoid structural collapse and reduce the shrinkage of the pore structure (Wu and Fu, 2008). Aerogels resulted from these synthesis routes can exhibit varying physical (e.g. porosity, density) and mechanical properties (e.g. compressibility) that affect the performance in oil/water separation, for instance. Aerogels/sponges prepared from the above-mentioned methods have demonstrated remarkable adsorption capacity due to its low mass and highly porous structure. Moreover, with the reversible deformation property, they are reusable after undergoing physical or chemical treatment such as compression, heating or pH desorption (Li et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2017). Many attentions have been given to making 3D sorbents by using 2D carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube (Gui et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2017) and sheet-like graphene (Mi et al., 2018a; Zhao et al., 2019) due to their remarkable mechanical properties. For instance, an ultralight and compressible cellulose/graphene aerogel exhibits an absorption capacity of 80–197 g/g and can be recovered through mechanical squeezing due to the synergy of bidirectionally aligned porous structure, cellulose's flexibility and graphene's stiffness (Mi et al., 2018b). Mi et al. fabricated a hierarchically structured aerogel from a mixture of graphene oxide, cellulose and silica. The graphene oxide presented in the aerogel was able to retain the mechanical strength and free-standing characteristics (Mi et al., 2018a). However, the incorporation of 1D carbon nanoparticles into 3D porous sorbent is still rarely reported. Apart from that, despite all the offered advantages, 3D aerogel/sponge derived from novel 2D carbonaceous nanomaterials is not flawless. Firstly, the fabrication of 2D carbonaceous nanomaterials requires complex fabrication methods e.g. high temperature pyrolysis under inert gas, which inevitably incurs high energy consumption as well as high fabrication cost. This implies that the search for more economically viable carbonaceous materials is still needed. Secondly, the selectivity of carbon-based aerogel/sponge is restricted by its surface wettability. Many of the reported carbon-based aerogels/sponges exhibit water contact angles (WCA) < 150° which are not in the region of superhydrophobicity (Gui et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). This adversely affects the selectivity in the separation of oil and water and hence the corresponding separation efficiency. The difficulty of imparting superhydrophobicity to carbonaceous materials mainly arises from its surface smoothness and absence of functional groups. Even with the active functional groups present, the largest possible WCA that can be obtained on a smooth surface of lowest surface energy is only ca. 115.2° (Nakajima, 2011). Theoretically, to tune the wettability of a solid surface, chemical composition and topographical structure of the surface are two major governing factors (Feng and Jiang, 2006). According to Cassie-Baxter theory (Cassie and Baxter, 1944), the wettability can be enhanced by (1) decreasing the surface energy, (2) introducing re-entrant surface textures and (3) creating hierarchical structure. The first approach helps to increase the intrinsic contact angle of the material while the remaining two are meant to increase the fraction of interfacial area between liquid and gas, usually by forming “air pockets”. On this basis, an efficient way to create superhydrophobic material should involve surface roughening combined with coating with low surface energy groups such as fluoromethyl (-CF3) and methyl group (-CH3). In this work, a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic aerogel using PVA and LCBW nanoparticles as constructing material is reported. The development of PVA/LCBW aerogel is affordable and sustainable considering that PVA is easy to handle and cost-effective while LCBW derived from oil refinery waste is a recycled material. The composite PVA/LCBW aerogel was prepared through conventional freeze-casting technique followed by lyophilization. This resulting aerogel is highly porous with LCBW homogeneously interpenetrated into the PVA matrix, thus creating a hierarchical structure that roughened the surface. After surface treatment with methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to impart low surface free energy, the aerogel becomes superhydrophobic. With its excellent selective wettability, PVA/LCBW aerogel has shown competitive adsorption capacity to a number of oils and organic solvents compared to the other PVA-based composite aerogels prepared by similar routes. Although the incorporation of 1D carbon nanoparticles into aerogel has been reported, it was often used in tandem with 2D or 3D carbon nanomaterials to optimize the performance of resulting aerogel. This has caused the effect of 1D carbon nanoparticles to the aerogel characteristics to be underestimated. This work not only demonstrates the facile synthesis of superhydrophobic composite aerogel by using merely waste-derived 1D carbonaceous nanomaterial and PVA for selective separation of oils and organic solvents from water but also provides an insight into the effect of carbon nanoparticles to the performance of the aerogel. The results will be helpful in designing a superhydrophobic sorbent with hierarchical texture by using 1D nanomaterials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Carbon black wastes (CBW) were derived from gasified wastes collected from oil refineries in Singapore. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (M.W. = 30,000-50,0000 g/mol), methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS, CH3SiCl3, 99%), diiodomethane (CH2I2, reagent, 99%) and Sudan III (M.W. = 352.39 g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received."
3,Leaching of CBW,"2.2 Leaching of CBW Pristine CBW was collected from an oil refinery in Singapore. The leaching process was conducted according to the previously reported procedures (Dong et al., 2017). Briefly, the as-received CBW was first dispersed in 1 M H2SO4 solution at a solid-to-solution ratio of 0.1 g/mL followed by 1 h of shaking. After leaching, the powder was filtered from the solution by using 0.45 μm Nylon membrane under vacuum filtration before washed with deionized water to remove the remaining acid. The powder after drying at 105 °C was collected as LCBW. It is noteworthy that the surface of the resulting LCBW consists of hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups that allow chemical reactions during the aerogel fabrication and post-treatment."
4,Fabrication of PVA-LCBW aerogels,"2.3 Fabrication of PVA-LCBW aerogels PVA solution of various concentrations (0.5–2.0 wt%) was prepared by mixing PVA with deionized water. The mixture was stirred and heated at 90 °C until PVA was completely dissolved. A certain amount of LCBW was thereafter added to the mixture. The PVA/LCBW mixture was then ultrasonicated for 15 min followed by overnight stirring (>12 h) to ensure LCBW was homogeneously dispersed. The resulting aqueous gel was subsequently cooled in a −78 °C freezer before lyophilized in freeze-dryer (Christ Beta 2–8 LD plus) at −85 °C under vacuum for 24 h. The PVA:LCBW weight ratios used in the experiment were 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5. All aerogels were synthesized without undergoing freeze-thawing process."
5,Preparation of hydrophobic PVA-LCBW aerogels,"2.4 Preparation of hydrophobic PVA-LCBW aerogels The surface modification of PVA-LCBW aerogels was conducted via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by using MTCS. Silica gels and a small glass vial containing 0.5 mL MTCS were placed in a desiccator along with the aerogel samples which were immediately transferred from freeze-dryer after lyophilization. The desiccator was then sealed and left for 24 h. To remove the unreacted silane as well as its by-product hydrochloric acid (HCI (g)), the surface-treated aerogels were dried in a fume hood for a few hours before use."
6,Oil/solvent capacity of PVA-LCBW aerogels,"2.5 Oil/solvent capacity of PVA-LCBW aerogels Various oil and organic solvents, including mineral oil, soybean oil, vegetable oil, silicone oil, hexane, acetone, dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol, were used to study the adsorption capacity of the aerogels. The adsorption process was conducted in a glass vial containing the oils or solvents. The aerogels of known weight were cut into small pieces before immersed into the oils/solvents for 10 min to reach saturation. The wet aerogels were then removed from the glass vial and held in air to allow excess oil/solvent dripped off from the surface. The weight of the aerogel before and after immersion was measured and the corresponding mass-based adsorption capacity was calculated according to the following equation: (1) A d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y , Q ( g g ) = W f − W i W i where wi and wf are the initial and final weight of aerogel during the adsorption test, respectively. As mass-based adsorption capacity is sensitive to the density of the sorbents and sorbates, the adsorption performance of the aerogel was also characterized by volumetric adsorption capacity which is defined as (2) V o l % = V o i l V a e o g e l × 100 % = m o i l ρ o i l × ρ a e r o g e l m a e r o g e l × 100 % Triplicate measurements were conducted for all experiments unless otherwise stated and the average values were presented as final data."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations Morphology of the fabricated aerogel were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7610F Plus) operating at 5 kV. Elemental mapping was done by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX, Oxford Instruments X-MAX 80). For better visualization, the distribution of elements on surface of scanned area was colorized and the corresponding intensity was adjusted. The wettability study was performed at ambient temperature by using contact angle goniometer (AST VCA Optima system) Water droplets of 5 μL were dropped onto the surface of aerogel and the measurements were taken after the dropping. For surface energy analysis, diiomethane was used as second dispersive liquid. The surface energy was then calculated by using Wu's Harmonic Mean method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted by using Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. The thermal stability of aerogel samples was examined from 25 to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere on a thermal analyzer (Shimadzu, TA-60WS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on Kratos AXIS UltraDLD using mono Al Kα as X-ray source and C 1s data was calibrated to 284.5eV prior to peak fit analysis. The porosity was calculated by using the following equation (3) P o r o s i t y = ( 1 − ρ ρ s ) x 100 % where ρ and ρs are the densities of the aerogel and the solid materials, respectively. The apparent density of the aerogels can be determined from their volumes and masses whereas the solid density is calculated from the weight fraction and density of each component of the aerogel by using the following equation (4) ρ s = 1 W P V A ρ P V A + W L C B W ρ L C B W + W M T C S ρ M T C S where w and ρ are the weight fractions and solid densities of different components. According to the material suppliers, the solid density of PVA and MTCS is 1.19 and 1.273 g/cm3, respectively. For LCBW, the density is given as 0.241 g/cm3 based on the previous study (Cui et al., 2019)."
8,Results and discussion,"Aerogels of various PVA concentrations and PVA/LCBW ratios before and after hydrophobic treatment were studied to investigate the effect of aerogel compositions to the physical characteristics. As shown in Table S1, highly porous and ultralight aerogels were synthesized. The lightweight aerogel (0.015–0.065 g/cm3) could even sit firmly on a petal of Bougainvillea Glabra (Fig. S1). Among the aerogels, untreated pure PVA aerogel exhibits the highest porosity, i.e. 98.63 ± 0.05%. After LCBW was added to the aerogel, the porosity dropped with increasing LCBW concentration due to the fact that LCBW increased the bulk density by occupying the pore space. Similarly, the decline in porosity after the aerogels were treated by MTCS could be attributed to the introduction of MTCS. The porosity was also greatly affected by the concentration of PVA and LCBW in the aerogel. With increasing PVA and LCBW concentration, the porosity was reduced. Among the composite aerogel, aerogel prepared from 0.50 wt% PVA at PVA/LCBW ratio of 1, both before and after hydrophobic treatment, possessed the highest porosity. On the other hand, due to its hydrophilic nature, PVA-based aerogel tends to absorb water vapor when exposed to air, leading to structural collapse of porous structure that causes volumetric shrinkage. Fig. 1 shows the varying degree of shrinkage after the aerogels were treated with MTCS via CVD. It was observed that when the LCBW mass percentage was 50% or at PVA/LCBW ratio of 1, the resultant aerogel experienced the least shrinkage (25.96 ± 4.51%) (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, by tuning the PVA concentration, the shrinkage could be further reduced. As seen in Fig. 1b, the composite aerogel shrinkage was dropped to 18.81 ± 4.40% after 2 wt% PVA was used while maintaining PVA/LCBW ratio of 1. The microstructure of LCBW has been well characterized and reported in the previous work (Dong et al., 2017). Fig. 2 shows the microstructures of PVA and PVA-LCBW aerogel before being treated with MTCS. PVA aerogel exhibits a porous lamellar structure with a wide range of pore sizes. The pore walls were found to be thick probably due to the lack of freeze-thawing (Xiao et al., 2017). However, these pores are interconnected across the walls and vertically aligned as a result of the squeezing effect of growing ice crystals during the freeze-casting process (Deville et al., 2007). When the PVA solution was frozen, the ice crystals grew and rejected the PVA component from the growing planar ice front, redistributing the PVA component into an aligned lamellar structure. After the ice was sublimed through lyophilization, aerogel having a porous structure was formed. For PVA/LCBW aerogel, the active groups of LCBW particles interacted with the PVA matrix through hydrogen bonding to form a percolation network. During freeze-casting, PVA/LCBW network was separated out from the suspension and redistributed along with the ice crystals growth direction into a lamellar structure. As seen in Fig. 2d, fine LCBW nanoparticles were embedded homogeneously on the PVA network. Only a small fraction of LCBW aggregates (circled in red) were found to be kept out of the network due to their larger size. This indicates that the size of LCBW nanoparticles is critical to fabricate PVA/LCBW aerogel with uniform morphologies. Primary carbon nanoparticles tend to agglomerate due to their nano size and high surface energy. To de-agglomerate and hence improve its dispersion stability, ultrasonication coupled with stirring were applied in this work. It was observed that 15min ultrasonication followed by overnight stirring (>12 h) were sufficient to prepare a homogenous PVA/LCBW dispersion that could remain stable for more than 24 h (see Fig. S2). This prolonged stability is important to ensure fabrication of homogenous PVA/LCBW aerogel. If PVA/LCBW mixture with poor LCBW dispersion was prepared, the structure of the resulting aerogel would be separated into two distinct layers with the top layer dominated by PVA and the bottom by clusters of coarse LCBW agglomerates that were loosely tied to PVA (see Fig. S3). This was caused by the quick precipitation of the large LCBW agglomerates during the freeze-casting. Such aerogel is undesirable as it gives rise to poor structural integrity. It has been reported that the agglomeration of nanoparticles can weaken the potential mechanical augmentation in nanocomposites due to the interfacial area limitation (Ashraf et al., 2018). Hence, it is desirable to obtain well-dispersed nanoparticles whose high surface area can provide sufficient interfacial interaction/adhesion with polymer matrix to attain favorable properties. It is also interesting to note that the incorporation of LCBW into PVA matrix roughened the surface and induced an enhanced surface hydrophobicity. The morphologies of the aerogel were well preserved after silanization (Fig. S4). During CVD, MTCS with hydrolyzable groups, i.e. chloride, reacted with water to form intermediate silanols which reacted with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of PVA matrix to form hydrophobic silicone layer, giving off HCI (g) as by-product (Fig. S5). It is interesting to note that nanofiber-like structures were found to grow on the internal wall surface of the pores. This was likely due to the formation of silicone nanofilaments. Depending on the reaction conditions, the silanization process can lead to different types of coating. Under relatively dry condition, horizontal polymerization will take place during which organosilanes form self-assembled or covalently attached layer whereas vertical polymerization is triggered when the condition is relatively wet, leading to the formation of covalently attached cross-linked polymeric fibers or layers (Artus et al., 2006; Zhang and Seeger, 2011). After the surface modification, the composite aerogel became highly compressible. As shown in Fig. S5a-e, unmodified PVA/LCBW aerogel was unable to recover from compression and deformed permanently whereas the surface-modified PVA/LCBW aerogel in Fig. S5f-j could instantly recover its shape after released from the applied compressive force (also see movie S1). It was speculated that the high compressibility stemmed from the hydrophobicity of aerogel surface. When the aerogel was subjected to compression, the stress propagated throughout the interconnected porous structure and by volumetric deformation of the pores, the strain was absorbed. As the stress was unloaded, the absorbed strain together with the repulsive interaction between the alkyl groups on the coated surface restored the deformed structure to its original shape, preventing the aerogel from structural collapse (Zhang et al., 2019). However, the compressibility diminished when the aerogel was wetted. This is partly because the repulsive interaction was lost in wet state. Another reason was that, unlike 2D or 3D carbonaceous materials such as graphene sheet or carbon nanotube, LCBW nanoparticle as 1D nanofiller does not possesses elastic stiffness sufficient to be transferred to the PVA matrix (Kuang et al., 2015; Lv et al., 2016). Therefore, upon wetting the aerogel's elasticity was lost and the absorbed mechanical energy was dissipated through deformation. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131520 The following is/are the supplementary data related to this article: Movie S1 2 Movie S1 The chemical structure and molecular interaction of the aerogels were characterized by FTIR analysis. Fig. 3 a shows the spectra of PVA, PVA/LCBW and silanized PVA/LCBW aerogels. Pure PVA aerogel exhibits strong peaks at 3282 cm−1 due to the stretching of –OH whereas the peaks at 2914 and 2851 cm−1 represent the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of –CH2, respectively. In addition, the peaks at 1085 and 829 cm−1 result from the stretching vibration of –C-H and C–C group of the PVA skeleton. These are in good agreement with the literatures (Wang et al., 2004, 2007; Cheng et al., 2012). Compared to untreated PVA/LCBW aerogel, two new peaks at 1266 and 765 cm−1 arise in the spectra of silanized PVA/LCBW aerogel due to the asymmetric stretching of C–Si in the C–Si–O unit and the vibration of Si–O–Si, respectively. The presence of these two new peaks manifests the successful silicone coating onto the surface of the aerogel via CVD. Also, the –OH vibration peak at 3282 cm−1 in pure PVA aerogel is shifted slightly to a lower wavenumbers in the PVA/LCBW aerogels. This can be ascribed to the intermolecular interaction between hydroxyl groups of PVA and active groups (-OH, –COOH) on LCBW which results in hydrogen bonding formation. However, the decreased peak intensity at 829 cm−1 in the composite aerogels implies the change of structural deformation in PVA chains. The thermal stabilities of different aerogels were also assessed by TGA and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3b, the aerogels displayed different thermal degradation behavior. However, all aerogels experienced first degradation at around 100 °C due to the vaporization of adsorbed and bound water or moisture. For pure PVA aerogel, the second decomposition occurred from 240 to 320 °C, resulting in 72.3 wt% weight loss. This was largely attributed to the elimination of hydroxyl groups on PVA chains and the removal of other small molecules during the chain breakdown (Tretinnikov et al., 2016). The chain was further broken down by decarboxylation and formation of small molecules such as ketones, aldehyde and other cyclic compounds between 320 and 400 °C. Beyond 400 °C, the PVA chain was fractured and completely decomposed at around 750 °C. There was no weight left by the end of analysis. Compared to pure PVA aerogel, PVA/LCBW aerogel showed a slight improvement in thermal stability. The maximum decomposition temperature was increased from 293 to 327 °C and the weight loss during second decomposition was reduced to 32.6 wt%. This can be attributed to the thermal resistance of LCBW. The third decomposition at 785 °C was mainly due to the carbonization of the composite structure which resulted in a residual weight of 24 wt%. After treated with MTCS, thermal stability of the hydrophobic PVA/LCBW aerogel was further improved due to the silicone coating on the porous surface that retarded thermal decomposition. This resulted in only 12 wt% weight loss after the second decomposition. XPS analysis was also conducted to further examine the chemical compositions of pristine PVA aerogel and silaned PVA/LCBW aerogel. As seen in Fig. 4 a, two new peaks corresponding to Si 2p and Si 2s at 101.3 and 152.3 eV arise in silane PVA/LCBW aerogel. However, no Si peaks were observed in pristine PVA aerogel. This confirms the observation that the surface of PVA/LCBW was successfully silanized. High resolution spectra of Si 2p, C 1s and O 1s are also presented in Fig. 4b–f. For Si 2p, Si–C and Si–O peaks were observed at 102.1 and 102.8 eV. On the other hand, the peaks of C 1s in spectra for both pristine PVA and silane PVA/LCBW aerogels were deconvoluted into three peaks of C–C, C–O/C–N and O–C–O. Compared to the O 1s spectra of pristine PVA aerogel, a new peak was observed at 532.1 eV in silaned PVA/LCBW aerogel. This can be ascribed to the formation of Si–O covalent bond as a result of MTCS treatment (Lin et al., 2015). The effect of silanization can be further verified by EDX analysis. The results in Fig. S6 show that PVA/LCBW aerogel are mainly composed of C, O and Si as characterized by the strong peaks in EDX spectrum in Fig. S6b. Fig. S6e shows that Si was evenly distributed on the aerogel surface. The detection of chlorine was due to the residual chlorine products after silanization. Pristine PVA aerogel is inherently hydrophilic. After the surface treatment, the wettability of the composite aerogel was transformed from hydrophilic into hydrophobic/superhydrophobic and superoleophilic. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the superhydrophobic aerogel is light enough to fully float on the water surface. As the aerogel was pushed underwater, a silver mirror-like layer of water was instantly formed around the surface, showing its strong water repulsion capability (Fig. 5d). To study the surface wettability, water contact angles (WCAs) of pure PVA aerogel and PVA/LCBW aerogels were measured (see Table S2). As seen in Fig. 5a, pure PVA aerogel after MTCS-treated became hydrophobic from hydrophilic, exhibiting a WCA of 138.4 ± 2.9°. This was caused by the introduction of a silicone layer to the surface where the alkyl groups of the silanes reduce the surface energy (<6 mN/m) to augment the non-wetting property of aerogel. After LCBW was added (PVA/LCBW ratio of 1:1), the hydrophobicity was further enhanced with WCA increased to 150.9 ± 0.4° and the surface energy decreased to <4.5 mN/m (Fig. S7). Amongst all prepared aerogels, PVA/LCBW aerogel containing 0.5 wt% PVA and PVA/LCBW ratio of 1 displayed the highest WCA (156.7 ± 2.9°), which rendered the surface superhydrophobic (Fig. 5b). This is comparable to or even outperforms many other PVA-based composite aerogels such as PVA-based nanoparticles/carbon nanotubes aerogel (132.4°) (Zhang and Zhang, 2020), cellulose nanocrystals/PVA aerogel (144.5°) (Gong et al., 2019) and cellulose nanofibrils/PVA aerogel (138-140°) (Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), esterified nanofibrillated cellulose/PVA aerogel (159°) (Chhajed et al., 2019), hydroxyapatite/PVA aerogel (150-160°) (Guo et al., 2018) and PVA-wrapped Ag nanowires sponge (156.5°) (Xi et al., 2019). Apart from the decreased surface energy due to the formation of silicone layer, the improvement in hydrophobicity can be explained by the increased roughness on the aerogel surface induced by the nanoparticles (Hsieh et al., 2005). When LCBW nanoparticles were embedded within the PVA matrix, a textured surface with micro-nanoscale hierarchical structure was formed. According to the Cassie-Baxter model (Cassie and Baxter, 1944), for a rough and porous medium, liquid droplet does not penetrate the grooves on the surface but sits on the tips of protruding surface, leaving air gaps between the liquid and solid surface. This increase in the air pocket volume increases the ratio of the projected area of the liquid droplet to air (fLA). According to Tuteja (Tuteja et al., 2007), the apparent WCA on a hierarchically structured surface (θ) increased with an increase in the number of layers of hierarchical structure (n) can be expressed as cosθn = (1-fLA,n)cosθn-1 – fLA,n. Because of the existence of air, and hence reduced fLA, the apparent WCA was increased. A schematic illustration of superhydrophobicity mechanism is presented in Fig. S8. The decreased contact area between liquid and solid surface also reduced the adhesion to water. As seen in Movie S2&3, as water was dropped onto the aerogel surface inclined at 18°, it rolled off immediately, indicating its superhydrophobicity property. The non-sticky anti-wetting behavior also confirms that the surface is in a Cassie-Baxter state. In contrast, mineral oil spread quickly across the surface and permeated into the aerogel. Aerogel with superhydrophobicity possesses a great potential in effective removal of oil and water.

Fig. 6 a–d shows the adsorptive removal of mineral oil (red-dyed by Sudan III) from water by PVA/LCBW aerogel. The mineral oil was adsorbed immediately after it was contacted with the aerogel. By virtue of its lightweight and hydrophobicity, the aerogel remained floating on the water surface throughout the process (see Movie S4). The aerogel's selective wettability also allows selective adsorption of dichloromethane under the water. As seen in Fig. 6e–h, dichloromethane was adsorbed quickly by aerogel, suggesting that the adsorption rate is fast. As structural porosity is crucial to the adsorption capacity, a preliminary DMF adsorption test was conducted by using composite aerogels of various PVA contents to study the effect of porosity to the adsorption performance. As shown in Fig. 5e, the composite aerogel prepared from 0.5 wt% PVA exhibited the highest adsorption capacity. Beyond 0.5 wt%, the adsorption capacity was adversely affected. This was expected because increasing PVA concentration reduces the porosity (Table S1). With decreased pore volume, the porous structure of aerogel could only hold lesser liquids. The effect of LCBW weight fraction to the adsorption was also assessed. It was found that highest adsorption capacity was achieved when the LCBW weight fraction was 0.33 (Fig. 5f). On this basis, aerogel prepared from 0.5 wt% PVA with PVA/LCBW = 1:0.5 was selected for adsorption test.

Depending on the sorbates, adsorption capacity ranging from 21.3 to 35.7 times its own weight could be achieved. This is comparable to several other PVA-based composite aerogels prepared via different synthesis routes (Table S3) although still lower than some carbon-based aerogels such as graphene oxide aerogel (86.6–347.7 g/g) (Wang et al., 2018) and carbon fiber aerogel (50–190 g/g) (Bi et al., 2013). Nevertheless, compared to the carbonaceous adsorbents whose preparation involves sophisticated synthesis procedures and utilization of costly raw materials, fabrication of superhydrophobic PVA/LCBW aerogel is advantageous as it involves straightforward and easier production procedures. Moreover, with the use of recycled industrial material (i.e. LCBW) into the aerogel for oil/water separation, a conversion of an industrial waste into valuable product is demonstrated. It is also noteworthy that composite aerogels fabricated by unidirectional freeze-casting tend to perform better than those derived from conventional freeze-casting due to its unique anisotropic structure. In other words, the adsorption capacity of the as-prepared aerogel could be optimized not only by changing the chemical compositions but also altering the synthesis route although this could compromise the aforementioned advantages as a more complex fabrication route is involved. The adsorption performance of the composite aerogel was also compared with the pure PVA aerogel. As seen in Fig. 6i, the composite aerogel performed similarly or slightly better than the pure PVA aerogel which showed adsorption capacity between 18.3 and 30.3 g/g. This implies that incorporation of LCBW did not deteriorate the aerogel's adsorption performance despite the porosity being decreased considerably. The synergistic effect of enhanced wettability induced by surface roughness and the sorption capacity boosted by LCBW could be the reason. As the mass-based adsorption capacity is largely determined by the density of the sorbates, the utilization rate of the pore volume inside the aerogel could be easily overlooked. To further characterize the adsorption performance, volume-based adsorption capacity of the aerogel which is independent of sorbate density was calculated as shown in Fig. 6j. The volume-based adsorption capacity of oils and organic solvents for pure PVA aerogel was between 50 and 83% whereas a higher value (73–100%) was achieved for PVA/LCBW aerogel. This indicates that a larger portion of pore volume inside the composite aerogel was available for adsorption although the porosity of pure PVA aerogel was higher. The as-prepared PVA/LCBW aerogel also showed a higher volume-based adsorption capacity compared to the other porous sorbents such as ultralight carbon aerogel (38.1%) (Sun et al., 2013), carbon fibrous aerogel (22.8%) (Liang et al., 2012), graphene oxide foams (58.9%) (Niu et al., 2012) and superhydrophobic polyurethane sponge (11.5%) (Zhu et al., 2011). The higher efficiency use of space could be contributed by the synergetic effect of enhanced surface roughness, capillary action of lamellar pore structure and superoleophilicity nature of the aerogel. Due to the superoloephilicity induced by increased surface roughness, the affinity of aerogel towards oils becomes stronger, thus enabling the capillaries in the aerogel to drive the oils into the pores more efficiently and to store them in the void space. It should be noted that, for oils of high viscosity, the volume-based adsorption capacity could be higher than the adsorbent's porosity. This may be caused by the adhesion of excess oils onto aerogel surface (Yang et al., 2014) or the structural expansion of aerogel itself during the adsorption process (Gui et al., 2013). To investigate the selective separation efficiency of aerogel on the water surface as well as underwater, mineral oil and dichloromethane were selected. The separation efficiency was determined by the weight change of sample as well as the water loss before and after the adsorption and were calculated by the following equations: (5) S e p a r a t i o n e f f i c i e n y ( % ) = [ m o + a − m a m o ] × 100 where ma is the mass of aerogel, mo the mass of oil and mo+a the mass of aerogel after oil adsorption. For calculation of the water loss, (6) W a t e r l o s s ( % ) = [ m i − m f ] m i × 100 where mi and mf are the initial and final mass of water added after oil adsorption, respectively. As seen in Fig. 7 a, the oil adsorption of aerogel was high in both adsorption on water surface (97.90 ± 1.36% for mineral oil) and underwater adsorption (93.61 ± 2.5% for dichloromethane) while water loss closes to 0.04 ± 0.02% and 0.07 ± 0.02%, The high separation efficiency is attributable to the excellent selective wettability of the aerogel. Aside from the selective wettability and adsorption capacity, the recyclability of the adsorbents is an essential criterion in oil/organic solvent remediation. To further explore its potential as a selective oil adsorbent and to make use of its augmented thermal resistance, the recyclability of the composite aerogel was assessed via cyclic adsorption-drying by using ethanol. The aerogel was first saturated with ethanol followed by heating at 120 °C (boiling point of ethanol is est. 78 °C) in oven for 15 min to remove the adsorbed ethanol. This process was repeated 10 times to investigate the change in the adsorbent mass and the resulting adsorption capacity. Fig. 7b shows a pronounced decline (>50%) in adsorbed mass for the first cycle. However, the performance remained rather stable till the end of the test. The decline could be explained by the irreversible pore contraction in the aerogel as a considerable shrinkage was observed after drying. Notwithstanding, the superhydrophobicity property of the aerogel was sustained throughout the test. It is suggested that the addition of 2D nanomaterials such as cellulose nanofibers can improve the aerogel's elasticity to alleviate the pore contraction. These results support that the composite aerogel is reusable and can be easily recovered through a simple adsorption-drying method."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, a lightweight, porous, superhydrophobic and heat-resistant composite aerogel was prepared via conventional freeze-casting method by embedding LCBW into PVA matrix followed by post-treatment with MTCS. By tuning the weight concentration of PVA and LCBW, aerogels with density ranging between 0.015 and 0.065 g/cm3 and porosity >85% were fabricated. With the incorporation of LCBW, the aerogel surface was roughened, hence turning it into superhydrophobic with WCA up to 156.7 ± 2.9° after treatment with MTCS. When utilized as selective oil and organic solvent adsorbent, superhydrophobic PVA/LCBW aerogel was capable of adsorbing various oils and organic solvents up to 35 times its own weight from water. The presence of LCBW also improved the volume-based adsorption capacity although the porosity was compromised slightly. The recyclability test highlighted that the composite aerogel can be used repeatedly for efficient separation of oils and organic solvents from water. It is expected that, apart from oily water remediation, the reported composite aerogel is able to gain a foothold in other applications such as thermal insulation and sound insulation."
