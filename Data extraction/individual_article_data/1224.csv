0,Introduction,"With the globalization of industrial development, the exploring of the clean and efficient energy has been one of the most important researches in future. Hydrogen, with the zero carbon emission and renewable property, is considered as the most potential material. Especially the photocatalytic water splitting of hydrogen production, with the enormous solar energy and surface water, has been a hotspot in current researches [1–3]. However, the high electric potential of the H2O splitting reaction limits the H2 generation via a direct electrolysis route [4,5]. In this case, lots of materials have been explored [6,7], including series of the metal oxides such as pyrochlores(A2B2O7), spinels(AB2O4) or perovskites(ABO3) [8–10]. Especially the typical perovskite CaTiO3, with the appropriate bandgap of the conduction band negative to redox potential of H+/H2 and valence band positive to redox potential of O2/H2O, has been reported in series works, including the doping, surface modification or composition, such as Zhang et al. have prepared the Pt-CaTiO3 catalysts with excellent photocatalytic activity [11], Huang et al. have reported the Zr-doped CaTiO3 with enhanced photocatalytic activity [12], etc. [13]. All the researches focus on increasing the light utilization, promoting the photon-generated electron transferring or reducing the recombination of the photon-generated carriers. Among these ways, the heterojunction modification is considered as an ideal way for enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production, because that this process could provide all of the above advantages, such as Huang and Jiang et al. have reported the NiTiO3/TiO2 heterojunction with efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation [14], Zhang and Zheng groups have prepared the carbon quantum dots/Bi2MoO6 composites with photocatalytic H2 evolution and near infrared activity [15], and so on [16]. However, there is an evident confine in this structure. As known, in traditional heterojunction, the photon-generated electrons would transfer to the lower conduction band and the photon-generated holes would transfer to the higher valence band, i.e. the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production depend on the lower conduction band and higher valence band [17], which means that the two semiconductor should both own the performance of photocatalytic water splitting. In consideration of the electric potential of the H2O, the optional material would be few. It’s interesting that the new Z-scheme structure with unique mechanism would provide researchers efficient ways to design the photocatalyst [18–20]. Compared with the traditional heterojunction, in the Z-scheme heterojunction, the photon-generated electrons in lower conduction band and photon-generated holes in higher valence band could quench directly by the cross-linking bridge [21–23], which could increase the lifetime of the remain photon-generated carriers to improve the photocatalytic performance efficiently, and have been reported by some frontier researches, such as Chen groups have obtained the In2O3-Ag-Ag3PO4 composites with Z-scheme configuration for photocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation [24], Xiong et al. have prepared the 3D Z-scheme (BiO)2CO3/MoS2 with enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance [25], Cheng groups have reported the Z-scheme TiO2/CdS hierarchical photocatalyst for enhancing the H2 production [26], Jiang groups obtained the Z-scheme Ag2CO3/N-doped graphene visible light photocatalysts via tuning the nitrogen species [27], etc. [28,29], especially the Yu groups have reported the heterojunction photocatalysts [30] and all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems [31], those could provide excellent references for the design of the Z-scheme systems [32–34]. In plenty of materials, the AgCl, with the non-poisonous and easy preparation, has been considered as an ideal material for Z-scheme modification [28,33,35], such as Pan groups have reported the SrTiO3-Ag/AgCl composite with plasmonic visible light exciting photocatalysis [36], Li et al. have reported the hierarchically Z-scheme Ag@AgCl/BiVO4 photocatalyst with enhancing photocatalytic performance [37], Yang groups have obtained the Ag/AgCl modified SrTiO3 nanocubes with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity [38], etc. [39,40]. In addition, the part of AgCl would decompose to metal Ag° shell on the surface of the AgCl, which could act as the quenching center and prevent the degradation of the AgCl for improving the photocatalystic stability [41], those are extra advantages for the AgCl modification. On the other hand, the morphology is another important factor for the nano-photocatalyst [42], and lots of researches about the morphological control for photocatalysis have been reported, including the nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, etc., such as Yang et al. have prepared the ultrathin urea-derived g-C3N4 nanosheets with excellent visible-light photocatalytic performance [43], Lai groups have reported the TiO2 nanowires with excellent photocatalytic property via surface roughening [44], etc. [45]. Particularly the nanosheets, with the extra-thin structure, could provide large specific surface area for the deposition of the AgCl nanoparticles and photocatalysis, which could be considered as another advantage for this laminar structure. In this work, we prepared the two dimensional Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction via simple hydrothermal-chemical co-deposition method. Compared with the unmodified samples, the 2D Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction possesses an obvious enhancement photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Further, the stability and mechanism of the Z-scheme structure were studied."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the chemicals are analytical grade and purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (shanghai, China)."
3,Synthesize,"2.2 Synthesize 2.2.1 Synthesis of CaTiO3 nanosheets CaTiO3 nanosheets were synthesized by the one-step hydrothermal method. In a typical process, Ca(NO3)2·4H2O(1.0g) was added into water and put into the teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. The tetrabutyl titanate(1.44g) was added dropwise to the solution with vigorous stirring. Then, NaOH(0.17g) was added into the solution and stirred for 1.0h at room temperature. Subsequently, the hydrothermal treatment was carried out for 24h at 200℃. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation after cooling off. The precipitate was washed three times with water, diluted acetic acid and water-ethanol with centrifuged. The precipitate was dried for 6h at 80℃. 2.2.2 Synthesis of CaTiO3/Ag/AgCl nano-heterojunction The samples were got by a chemical deposition-photoreduction process. The CaTiO3 nanosheets(0.10g) was added in deionized water(15mL) and the solution was ultrasonicated for 5min. According to the capacity, the 0.05M silver nitrate solution was added to the solution with stirring vigorously for 1h. Then, the 0.05M hydrochloric acid was added in the solution and the same as above. After stirring in the dark for 1h, the solution was irradiated under a 500W xenon lamp for 20min. The precipitate was washed twice by water and water-ethanol. The precipitate was dried for 6h at 80℃. Samples with silver nitrate solution of 0μL, 50μL, 100μL and 150μL were labeled as Ca-Ag-0, Ca-Ag-1, Ca-Ag-2, Ca-Ag-3, respectively. The CaTiO3/Ag was labeled as Ca-Ag."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The micromorphology, elemental mapping and EDS of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM JEM-2100). The specific surface area is measured by an F-sorb 3400 micropore analysis system(3H-2000PS1) at 77K. The phase composition of the as-prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover) using Cu Kα(λ=1.5406Å) radiation at 40kV and 40mA. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained by the UV–vis spectrophotometer(Hitachi-U3900). The PL spectra were recorded by a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorimeter at the excitation wavelength of 360nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) spectra was obtained by Kratos Axis Ultra system with monochromatic Al K X-ray source. The Raman spectra of the obtained samples were recorded on a Horiba XploRA Raman microscope using the 535nm laser at room temperature."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity Samples were tested by photocatalytic hydrogen production using a self-made quartz internal radiation reactor connected to a closed glass gas system. A 300W Xe arc lamp was used as light source with 100mW/cm−2 output light. In detail, 50mg AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 were suspended in 100mL solution(90mL water and 10mL methanol, methanol as the sacrifice agented). Prior to irradiation, the solution was dispersed in the ultrasonic bath for 20min, and then in order to remove the dissolved oxygen from the reactor, N2 gas was evacuated for 30min. The amount of H2 evolution was measured by using gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC-7900)."
6,Results and discussions,"Fig. 1 is the XRD pattern of the as-prepared AgCl/Ag/ CaTiO3 with different ratio. As revealed, the obvious diffraction peaks at Ca-Ag-0 could be ascribed to the (101), (121), (113), (132), (043), (202), (045), (221), (223), (242) and (323) planes of the CaTiO3(PDF-42-0423) [46]. With the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles being introduced, the new diffraction peaks appear and increase with the ratio of the modification obviously. As shown, the new peaks of (111), (200), (102) and (220) in Ca-Ag-1, Ca-Ag-2 and Ca-Ag-3 could be ascribed to the AgCl(PDF-31-1238) [35–36,47]. It’s significant that the peak of the (111) plane of the Ag(PDF-04-0783) [47] could be observed in Ca-Ag-1, Ca-Ag-2 and Ca-Ag-3, though it is very weak, especially in Ca-Ag-1, that because of the low crystallinity and less content of the metal Ag°, which indicates that the presence of the metal Ag° in preparation under the illumination. It’s interesting that the (045) peak of CaTiO3 overlaps with the (311) peak of AgCl, so with the deposition of the AgCl/Ag, which exhibits an enhancement at the corresponding position. There are no other obvious peaks present in all curves, which manifests that the samples are composed of AgCl/Ag and CaTiO3. The morphology of the samples with different ratio is displayed in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a is the SEM image of the as-prepared pure CaTiO3 nanosheets. As shown, the leaves-shape CaTiO3 nanosheets are thin and uniform, which could provide sufficient specific surface area for photocatalysis. Fig. 2b–e are the high resolution SEM(HRSEM) of the Ca-Ag-0, Ca-Ag-1, Ca-Ag-2 and Ca-Ag-3. As shown in Fig. 2c, with the introducing of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles, the surfaces of the CaTiO3 nanosheets appear some nanoparticles. Displayed as the Fig. 2d and e, with the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles increasing further, the surfaces of the CaTiO3 nanosheets become more and more rough. Limited by the grain sizes of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles and the distinguishability of the SEM, such dense AgCl/Ag nanoparticles could hardly be distinguished directly. Further, the elemental mapping and EDS are provided. Fig. S1(In ESI) is the elemental mapping for the surface of Ca-Ag-2, which indicates that the elements of Ca, Ti, O, Ag and Cl are distributed on the surface uniformly. Then the EDS are shown in Fig. S2(In ESI), as revealed, the atomic ratio of the Ag to Cl is about 1.33/1.04(AgCl is 1/1), which means that the presence of the metal Ag° in this structure, and corresponds to the results of XRD. All above indicate that the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles may have been deposited. What’s more, as displayed in Fig. S3a(in ESI), the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement indicates that the 2D AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction, with a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller(BET) speciﬁc surface area of 163.52m2/g, is a typical porous material. Further, calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda(BJH) equation, the average size of the pores is about 13.10nm(in ESI Fig. S3b). Combined with the SEM, such characteristics are beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Fig. 3 is the TEM spectra of the as-prepared 2D AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano- heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 3a, the samples are laminar and uniform, which corresponds to the SEM. Further, the HRTEM of the lamellar structure is shown in Fig. 3b. As revealed, the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles with diameter of about 10–15nm have deposited on the surface of the CaTiO3 nanosheets uniformly. Fig. 3c is the interface of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles and CaTiO3 nanosheets. Further, the HRTEM of the CaTiO3 and AgCl are shown in Fig. 3d and e, the lattice spaces of 0.381nm and 0.278nm are ascribed to the (101) plane of the CaTiO3 and (200) plane of the AgCl [46,47]. Restricted by the thickness of the Ag° shell on the surface of the AgCl nanoparticles, the metal Ag° could be hardly viewed and would be characterized by the XPS. Furthermore, the XPS spectra are employed to characterise the components of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction further. Fig. 4 a is the full survey, which indicates the presence of Ca, Ti, O, Ag and Cl in the as-prepared sample. Fig. 4b shows the high-resolution spectrum of the Ca 2p. As shown, two obvious peaks at 346.8 and 350.4eV are assigned to the Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2, respectively [48]. Fig. 4c is the high-resolution spectra of the Ti 2p. As revealed, the peaks at 458.7 and 464.4eV could be ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 [48]. As displayed in the Fig. 4d, the O 1s could be divided to the peaks at 530.0 and 531.2eV, which are ascribed to the O2− and the OH bond [47–49], respectively. Fig. 4e is the spectrum of Ag. As displayed, two distinct peaks at 368.3 and 374.4eV could be ascribed to the Ag 3d. Further, the two peaks could be divided into four peaks at 368.2, 369.2, 374.3 and 375.3eV, respectively. As shown, the peaks of 368.2 and 374.3eV could be assigned to Ag+ of the AgCl [48,49], while the peaks of 369.2 and 375.3eV could be attributed to Ag°, which indicate that the metal Ag° has form in the process under illumination and correspond to the XRD, EDS and previous literatures [48,49], that is the core of the Z-scheme. The high-resolution spectrum of Cl 2p could be fitted into two peaks at 197.2 and 198.7eV, which is ascribed to the Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively [49]. What’s more, this consequence could be further proved by the Raman Shift(in ESI Fig. S4). As shown, compared with the pure CaTiO3, the obvious peak at 1569cm−1 of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 could be ascribed to the surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS) effect that induced by surface plasmon resonance(SPR) of the metal AgCl/Ag nanoparticles [48,50–51]. Therefore, based on the results of SEM, EDS, elemental mapping, TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman shift, the Z-scheme nano-heterojunctions of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nanosheets have prepared successfully. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the diﬀ ;erent AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction is displayed in Fig. 5 . As revealed, the pure as-prepared CaTiO3 nanosheets exhibit weaker H2 production of ∼13.05μmol/gh, which could be ascribed to the intrinsic H2 production property of the CaTiO3 nanosheets. It’s obvious that the hydrogen production increases with introducing of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles, and get an optimal value at the Ca-Ag-2(∼226.53μmol/gh), then decreases. By calculating, the hydrogen production of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction is about 17 times than the pure CaTiO3 nanosheets. As a control group, the as-prepared CaTiO3/Ag nanoparticles(Ca-Ag) and AgCl/Ag nanoparticles are carried out at the same condition. As displayed, there are about ∼20.85μmol/gh H2 production from the CaTiO3/Ag nanoparticles and no obvious H2 production from the AgCl nanoparticles, which would be valid evidences for the Z-scheme structure of the nano-heterojunction. It’s obvious that the suitable modification of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles could increase the photocatalytic H2 production efficiently. As the remarkable photocatalytic performance, the cycling stability of the as-prepared Ca-Ag-2 is carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 , after 24h(six consecutive cycles) hydrogen production, the photocatalysis runs reposefully. By calculating, the average of the hydrogen production is about 220μmol/gh, that closes to the initial value and could be regarded as an excellent result. Further, the XRD of the Ca-Ag-2 after reaction is characterized, as shown in Fig. S5(In ESI), the structure of the sample after reaction is similar to the before one, which indicates that the structure is stable in the photocatalytic process. All above prove that the Z-Scheme structure could prevent the decomposing of the photocatalyst for increasing cycling stability. Thus, exploring the photocatalystic mechanism of the 2D AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction would be an interesting issue. Fig. 7 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction with different amount of AgCl/Ag nanoparticles. As shown, the absorption of the as-prepared CaTiO3 nanosheets locate at approximately 350nm, which is ascribed to the intrinsic bandgap of the perowskite CaTiO3 [48]. With the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles being introduced, the absorption of the samples display an obviously increase with the increasing AgCl/Ag in visible light, which is attributed to the absorption of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles and corresponds to the previous literatures [32–33,48–49]. The absorption enhancement would be benefitted for the photocatalytic hydrogen production. It’s interesting that the Ca-Ag-3 exhibit better absorption than the Ca-Ag-2 in visible light, though the optimal H2 production activity is obtained by the Ca-Ag-2, which indicates that the excess AgCl/Ag nanoparticles would lead a competition in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Based on the above results, including the XRD, TEM, EDS, elemental mapping, XPS, UV–vis and Raman shift, the mechanism of the photocatalystic hydrogen production enhancement of the nano-heterojunction is proposed as the Fig. 8 , which could be mainly ascribed to the unique Z-scheme structure and remarkable laminar 2D nano-heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 5, compared with other samples, the control group of AgCl/Ag exhibits hardly photocatalytic hydrogen production performance under illumination, which could be ascribed to the intrinsic bandgap structure of the AgCl [32–33,48]. In that case, the traditional heterojunction for the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 could hardly explain the excellent enhancement of the hydrogen production, and that the formation of the Z-scheme structure by the metal Ag° should be a reasonable explanation. Under illumination, the metal Ag° could act as a cross-linking bridge to contact the two semiconductors and promote the recombination of electrons(CB of AgCl) and holes (VB of CaTiO3), which could increase the lifetime of the remaining holes(VB of AgCl) and electrons(CB of CaTiO3) [11–12,35–38,46,48], and is deemed as the main reason for the excellent enhancement of the hydrogen production. This consequence is supported by the fluorescence(PL) of the samples further. As shown in Fig. S6(in ESI), the PL of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 is obvious weaker than pure CaTiO3 nanosheets, which means that the recombination has decreased and the photon-generated carriers have been separated efficiently, and corresponds to previous researches [48]. It’s interesting that the Ca-Ag-3 exhibit a decreasing, though it exhibit better visible light absorption, which could be ascribed to that the extra AgCl/Ag would result in a competition for light absorption [38], in spite of itself having no photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Based on the above, the process of the photocatalytic hydrogen production could be described as follows [52,53]: Conduction band of CaTiO3: (1) H + + e - → 1 2 H 2 Valence band of AgCl: (2) OH - + h + → °OH (3) CH 3 OH+ °OH → HCHO + H + + e - + H 2 O (4) HCHO+ H 2 O → CO 2 +2 H 2 Net: (5) CH 3 OH+ OH - + h + → 5 2 H 2 + CO 2 Overall: (6) CH 3 OH+ H 2 O+ e - + h + → 3 H 2 + CO 2 This process could be proved by the silver mirror reaction subsequently and correspond previous works [52,53]. As shown in Fig. S7(In ESI), after the silver mirror reaction, the cuvette with formaldehyde exhibit obvious metal Ag° sediment on the wall, nevertheless the cuvette with solution after the photocatalytic hydrogen production is still transparent, which manifest that the formaldehyde has been catalyzed thoroughly in the process of hydrogen production [35,36]. That is another main reason for the high efficiency of the hydrogen production. Additionally, the laminar structure of the CaTiO3 also plays a prominent role, because which could provide large surface area for the growth of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles and the photocatalytic hydrogen production(in ESI Fig. S3a, the specific surface area of Ca-Ag-2 is 163.52m2/g) [54]. What’s more, the metal Ag° shells cover the surface of the AgCl could trap the photo-generated electrons, which could inhibit the further decomposition of AgCl nanoparticles to enhance the stability of photocatalystic hydrogen production and is another advantage for this 2D Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction [48–51,40]. Thus, the 2D Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunctions exhibit remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance than the unmodified samples."
7,Conclusions,"We have successfully prepared the 2D Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano- heterojunction by simple hydrothermal-chemical co-deposition method. Then the as-prepared 2D nanostructures exhibit excellent enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The main reason could be ascribed to the unique Z-scheme structure of the AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 and the laminar structure of the CaTiO3, that the metal Ag° decompose from AgCl could act as quenching centers to quench the photo-generated electrons(CB of AgCl) and holes(VB of CaTiO3) for increasing the lifetime of the remain photo-generated carriers, and the laminar structure of the CaTiO3 could provide plenty of specific surface areas for the deposition of the AgCl/Ag nanoparticles and photocatalysis. Further, the photocatalytic process has been proved simply by the silver mirror reaction, which could decompose the methyl alcohol to carbon dioxide thoroughly. What’s more, the as-prepared photocatalyst exhibit excellent photocatalytic stability, which could be ascribed to that the metal Ag° shells could trap the photo-generated electrons to inhibit the decomposition of AgCl for increasing the stability. Thus, the novel 2D Z-scheme AgCl/Ag/CaTiO3 nano-heterojunction with remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance would be considered as one of the most potential materials in future energy and environmental fields."
