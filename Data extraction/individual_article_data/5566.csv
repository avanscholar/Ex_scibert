0,Introduction,"The large quantity of polluted wastewater generated by petroleum refineries requires treatment technologies to remove hazardous contaminants [1]. In general, the refinery industry generates a wastewater volume that is about 0.4–1.6 times greater than that of the volume of refined oil [2]. Petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) usually contains a high concentration of contaminants, such as dissolved oil, organics, hydrocarbon derivatives, heavy metals, phenolic compounds, ammonia, and a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) [3,4]. As reported in many studies, PRW generally contains dissolved oil and grease at 500–3000 mg.L−1, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 750–1600 mg.L−1 and 300 −1000 mg.L−1, respectively [5]. Toxic organics, such as phenolic compounds, are found in PRW at approximately 950 mg.L−1, and ammonia and sulfide are typically at 20–80 mg.L−1 and 13–17 mg.L−1, respectively [6]. In some cases, heavy metals and radioactive materials are observed in refinery wastewaters [7]. Existing PRW treatments usually only reduce the total solids and major organic pollutants; however, this treated wastewater still contains phenolic compounds and ammonia at high concentrations. Phenolic compounds are identified as priority contaminants as they are highly toxic and corrosive even at a low concentration [8]. The sources of phenolic compounds in PRW are usually from the tank water drain, multiphase separator, desalter water effluent, and neutralized spent caustic waste. In Pertamina Ltd. Indonesia, the primary source of the phenols, is the residual fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) waste stream with an average phenol concentration of 960 mg.L−1 [6]. In recent years, phenol and its derivatives have warranted more attention in the field of industrial wastewater because of their toxicity and contamination in wastewater production. Phenolic compounds discharged into the environment remain for long periods and harm the ecosystem, especially humans [9,10]. Phenolic compounds that are commonly found in PRW are phenol, m-p-cresol, o-cresol, tri and tetra chlorophenols, and 4-chloro-3-cresol [11], as shown in Fig. 1 . The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has labeled phenolic derivatives as a priority contaminant in water. The limited concentration of phenol in wastewater discharge was set strictly to avoid environmental damage. The toxicity level of phenol derivatives is usually in the range of 9–25 mg.L−1 for both humans and aquatic life [12]. Long-term exposure to phenol can lead to a serious health problem such as diarrhea, vertigo, salivation, tremors, coma, and respiratory failure for humans exposed to lethal doses. Therefore, industries that produce phenol-contaminated wastewater, such as petroleum refineries, must pay attention to the treatment of wastewater to meet quality standards of wastewater discharge. Another pollutant in petroleum refinery wastewater and petrochemicals that becomes a serious issue is ammonia. Ammonia in wastewater is usually generated from the degradation of nitrogen components. Excessive ammonia in wastewater is highly toxic and harmful to the environment and human health; moreover, ammonia is associated with the malodor problem of wastewater [13]. Generally, the ammonia–nitrogen content in refinery wastewater is in the range of 20–80 mg.L−1 [14]. Treatment using chemical and biological methods are unable to nitrify the ammonia content to the desired level. Ammonia in wastewater is generated from the degradation process of nitrogen-containing compounds. Ammonia is toxic to aquatic life and human health at very low concentrations. The common maximum permitted level of ammonia in discharged wastewater is 0.7 mg.L−1 [15]. Ammonia in water can be in an equilibrium state of dissolved ammonia and ammonium ions or bound as organic amine (R-NH2), as shown in Eq. 1. (1) NH3 + H2O → NH4 + + OH− Wastewater from food processing plants is nutritious enough to enrich the nitrification bacteria by converting ammonium ions to nitrate ions. However, in petroleum wastewater treatment, nitrifying bacteria are seldom observed because of poor nutritional content. Therefore, it is highly important to develop an effective method for phenolic compounds and ammonia removal or neutralization, given their serious environmental threat. In recent decades, many attempts have been made to eliminate contaminants in PRW, such as the advanced oxidation process (AOP), coagulation, absorption, adsorption, chemical, and biological treatments [16–18]. Such methods effectively remove a variety of organic compounds. However, membrane separation is considered a faster and more efficient process than other physically-driven and equilibrium-driven processes. Conventional size exclusion based separations such as Ultrafiltration is unable to remove phenolic compounds or ammonia with high separation efficiency [19]. Hence, a dense membrane, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membrane, is required, resulting in high energy consumption [20] and faster fouling formation. A hybrid process, such as the adsorption prior to membrane separation, has been previously reported [21] using activated carbon followed by an ultrafiltration membrane. This process effectively reduced energy consumption. However, the process is complex as it requires more than one stage. In the past few years, the membrane research is dominated by the development of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that combine the molecular sieving mechanism and adsorption of inorganic filler; furthermore, the introduction of inorganic material significantly increases the surface properties, mechanical strength, and perm-selectivity of the fabricated membrane [22]. Polymeric membranes with an embedded microsized inorganic filler have shown excellent performance in removing various organic compounds during water treatment, and the membrane’s hydrophilic property can be significantly improved. However, the incorporation of inorganic filler at normal size (micron scale) into polymeric membranes has the risk of producing defective membranes. A defect membrane might be caused by the formation unselective void as the result of the de-attachment between the polymer and the particle surface [23]. Recent developments include the incorporation of nanosized inorganic particles because of their higher surface area, high shape uniformity, and excellent affinity with a polymer matrix [24]. Many researchers have reported that the incorporation of nanosized inorganic materials and functionalized metal oxides into a polymeric membrane significantly enhance the permeability, structural properties, surface hydrophilicity, antifouling behavior, and separation properties [25,26]. However, in some cases of wastewater with a high organic level, such as PRW, the utilization of the nanohybrid membrane has a short lifetime because of surface fouling [27]. Moreover, the membrane with a smaller pore size that is used to remove molecular pollutants leads to low permeability. In this study, a nanohybrid PSf membrane was used as a support membrane, and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer was added to improve the membrane surface properties. PVA is a low-cost polymer that possesses good chemical and mechanical stability, excellent hydrophilicity, and film-forming ability, which is widely used as the coating material. PVA can be used to produce a stable membrane with good mechanical properties and selective permeability to water by crosslinking, grafting, or other modification reactions. The objectives of introducing PVA on the PSf membrane were to enhance the removal efficiency of phenol and ammonia in petroleum wastewater and to improve the membrane mechanical properties as well as to minimize the membrane fouling during operation. Furthermore, the removal efficiency and permeability were studied using untreated petroleum refinery wastewater effluent to explore the industrial applicability of this technique."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polysulfone (Udel® PSU P1700NT) polymer granules were purchased from Solvay, USA, and used as the main polymer of the membrane preparation. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and sulfuric acid were supplied from Merck, USA. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 86 %–88 % hydrolyzed, Mw 130,000 Da), polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 Da as a pore-forming agent and glutaraldehyde (GA) as a crosslinking agent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Nanosized ZnO powder (±350 nm) was obtained from Nano Center Indonesia, Indonesia. PRW (sedimentation-coagulation effluent) was obtained from Pertamina, Ltd., and the characteristics of the wastewater are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Preparation of the nanohybrid PSf-ZnO membrane,"2.2 Preparation of the nanohybrid PSf-ZnO membrane Nanohybrid PSf-ZnO membranes were fabricated via a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method adapted from a previous study [28]. ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in NMP at various total solid concentrations, as shown in Table 2 , and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. PSf and PEG were dissolved in NMP at the polymer concentrations listed in Table 2 and stirred for 8 h. The ZnO suspensions and polymer solutions were blended and homogenized. The polymer solution was then cast using a manual casting machine with an outlet gap thickness of 150 μm. The polymer film was evaporated for 60 s to form a selective layer and was subsequently immersed in pure water for 24 h at room temperature for complete phase separation. The wet membranes were placed between filter papers and dried at 50 °C for 24 h."
4,PVA coating of the PSf-ZnO membrane surface,"2.3 PVA coating of the PSf-ZnO membrane surface According to the previous work [29], the addition of ZnO in polymer matrix significantly improved the permeate flux and mechanical strength of the membrane but risks on creating unselective gap. Coating procedure using PVA polymer on the fabricated nanohybrid membrane one of which aims to help overcoming the aforementioned issue. The PVA coating was prepared by dip-coating the top surface of the membrane to provide a selectivity property [30]. PVA solutions were prepared with the concentrations in Table 2. An appropriate amount of PVA granules was dissolved in deionized water at 85 °C under constant stirring for 8 h. The top side of the membrane was dipped into the PVA solution, and the excess solution on the membrane surface was wiped off using filter paper. The coated membranes were crosslinked using a crosslink-agent containing 5 wt% glutaraldehyde and 0.5 wt% sulfuric acid as the catalyst. The coated membranes were rinsed to remove the residual chemicals. A schematic illustration of the membrane coating using PVA is shown in Fig. 2 ."
5,Membrane characterization by SEM and FT-IR,"2.4 Membrane characterization by SEM and FT-IR The morphology of both the surface and internal structure of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Series JSM-6510-LA, Japan). The morphological structure of the membrane was observed at low and high magnification (1000x and 20,000x). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Perkin Elmer Frontier, USA) was used for the investigation of the change in the chemical groups as a result of the modification treatment. The FT-IR spectra of the fabricated membranes were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1."
6,Water contact angle and mechanical strength test,"2.5 Water contact angle and mechanical strength test Water contact angle (WCA) measurements were performed via a sessile-drop method with 25 °C pure water used as the probe liquid. The static angle of the water droplet on the membrane surface was measured using an angle-meter (RASE Angle-meter, Japan) at six different points. The membrane mechanical strength was studied by measuring the tensile strength and elongation percentage at break using a testing machine (UTS H001, China). The membrane sample (5cm × 1cm) was clamped and stretched at a rate of 20 mm.min−1 until the break poin. The mechanical strength test was repeated three times for each membrane type."
7,Permeation and rejection performance of the membranes,"2.6 Permeation and rejection performance of the membranes The membrane performance in terms of the pure water permeability (PWP), water flux using untreated PRW, and contaminant removal (total phenols, ammonia, TDS, COD, and turbidity) were performed using a cross-flow filtration setup as shown in Fig. 3 . The tested membrane (with an effective area of 15.90 cm2) was compacted using pure water at 5 bar for 30 min before PWP measurement. The PWP was recorded every 0.5 h at a constant pressure of 5 bar. For untreated refinery wastewater filtration, the pure water was replaced with untreated wastewater. The PWP (Jw ) and wastewater permeate flux (Ji ) were calculated using Eq. 2[31]. (2) J = V A . t Where J is the permeate flux, L. m−2 h−1; V is the permeate volume, L; A is the effective membrane area, m2; and t is the permeation time (h). Pollutant rejections were calculated using Eq. 3 as follows [32]: (3) R = 1 − C p C f × 100 % Where Cp and Cf are the pollutant concentration in the permeate and feed solution, respectively. The ammonia and total phenol concentration were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurements. Other pollutant rejections such as TDS, COD, and turbidity were determined using a conductivity meter, spectrophotometer, and nephelometer, respectively."
8,Fouling evaluation for refinery wastewater treatment,"2.7 Fouling evaluation for refinery wastewater treatment Fouling properties of the membrane in the refinery wastewater filtration were evaluated using a series model of cake resistance measurements [33,34]. The membrane resistance during filtration is contributed to by the intrinsic membrane itself, absorbed foulant compound (irreversible fouling), and cake of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface (reversible fouling). The clean membrane was used in the pure water permeation test and using Eq. 4 to evaluate the intrinsic membrane resistance. To obtain the value of the irreversible fouling resistance, the fouled membrane was rinsed using deionized (DI) water to remove the foulant deposition on the membrane surface. The fouled membrane was used for the DI water permeation test, and the irreversible fouling resistance was evaluated using Eq. 5. The cake resistance was assessed using the total fouled membrane for a DI water permeation test. The cake resistance was determined using Eq. 6. (4) R m = Δ P μ × J 0 (5) R a = Δ P μ × J a − R m (6) R c = Δ P μ × J t − R m − R a (7) R t = R m + R a + R c Where Rm , Ra , and Rc are the resistance of the clean membrane, absorbed foulant, and cake of the deposited foulant, respectively (m−1). J0 , Ja , and Jt are the constant permeate flux of pure water using clean membrane, internal fouled membrane, and total fouled membrane, respectively (m3.s−1); μ is the viscosity of water at 25 °C (8.9 × 10−4 Pa.s); ΔP is the transmembrane pressure (Pa)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Membrane morphology characterization,"3.1 Membrane morphology characterization An investigation of the structure is necessary to evaluate the perm-selectivity performance of the membrane. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the PSf-ZnO and PVA-coated PSf-ZnO membranes are shown in Fig. 4 . A clear surface morphological difference is observed in Figs. 4A and 4B. The membrane surface of the uncoated membrane is rough, with many visible pores. This morphology was affected by the addition of PEG, which is a known pore-forming agent in the membrane fabrication process [35]. The porous structure of the support membrane is beneficial as it provides better permeation in the filtration process. The enhanced surface porosity might occur with the addition of a hydrophilic polymer (PEG), which dissolves in a non-solvent. When the casting film was soaked in DI water, the exchange of the solvent/non-solvent was followed by the migration of PEG into the water, thus inducing the formation of more pores. In Fig. 4B, the surface is smooth, and no pores were observed even at a magnification of 20,000x, indicating that the surface layer is dense and suitable for molecular separation. The smooth and dense layer might have resulted from the coating of the crosslinked PVA. A membrane with a smoother surface tends to have better antifouling properties. Finger-like micropore structures were observed the cross-sections of all membranes. The shape and micropore size of the finger-like structures were similar for all membranes because the membrane support materials have the same composition. The structural properties of the membrane sublayer were attributed to the polymer solution composition. The viscosity and hydrophilicity of the polymer solution play an important role in determining the micropore structural properties. The high concentration of the incorporated nanoparticles leads to larger finger-like micropores. Closer observation of the membrane top-layer revealed that the thickness of the dense layer of the membrane is different. The PVA-coated membrane has a thicker layer than the uncoated membrane. The average dense layer thickness of the uncoated and PVA-coated membranes based on SEM analysis are 1.62 ± 0.30 μm and 3.47 ± 0.41 μm, respectively. A thicker dense layer resulted from the PVA coating on the selective layer of the membrane. With focused observation at the selective layer, it can be noticed the different characteristic layer can be ascertained as PVA layer. The denser selective layer may improve the molecular separation; however, it also decreases the water flux [36]."
11,FT-IR spectra of the fabricated membrane,"3.2 FT-IR spectra of the fabricated membrane The functional groups of the fabricated membrane were inspected using FT-IR spectra analysis. The FT-IR spectra of the uncoated nanohybrid PSf-ZnO and PVA-coated membranes are shown in Fig. 5 . The FT-IR spectra of the uncoated membrane (PSf-ZnO) show characteristic peaks at around 1582 cm−1 representing the aromatic ring of the PSf backbone. Methyl and sulfone groups were observed by the appearance of a single sharp peak at 1487 cm−1 and double peaks at around 1297 cm−1, respectively. The peak at 2969 cm−1 also indicates the stretching of C–H from the methyl in PSf. The presence of ZnO in the membrane was observed by the weak stretching of the absorbed hydroxyl at 450 cm−1. The weak broad peak from 3700–3000 cm−1 represented the vibration of−OH absorbed by ZnO nanoparticles, which indicates that the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles improved the hydrophilicity of the polysulfone membrane. The PVA-coated PSf-ZnO membrane shows a stronger, broad peak around 3312 cm−1, which is typical for the hydroxyl vibration of the PVA molecule. The stronger peak also appears at 2937 cm−1, which is analogous to the peak at 2969 cm−1 of the uncoated PSf-ZnO membrane. The peak shift from 2969 to 2937 cm−1 shows the presence of C–H stretching from the vinyl group in PVA. The absorption band at 1146 cm−1 was observed in the PVA-coated membrane spectra, which is related to the stretching of acetal ester groups as a result of the crosslinking reaction between PVA and GA. Besides, the CO stretching at 1151 cm−1 in the uncoated membrane is replaced by a stronger absorption band at 1098 cm−1 that can be attributed to the ether (CO) group formed by the crosslinking reaction. A strong peak at 1733 cm−1 was observed at the PVA-coated membrane, but it does not appear in the spectra of the uncoated membrane. This peak belongs to the CO stretching of the aldehyde from GA. The result explains that the aldehyde group of GA did not completely react with the hydroxyl group in PVA [37]. Given the presence of the strong−OH stretching in the PVA-coated PSf-ZnO membrane, the PVA coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The improved hydrophilic property of the membrane surface improves the water flux and antifouling behavior."
12,Contact angle value and pure water permeability of the membrane surface,"3.3 Contact angle value and pure water permeability of the membrane surface The WCA of the membrane surface is influenced by several factors, including surface tension, hydrophilic property, and surface roughness. Membrane hydrophilicity is attributed to the water permeation rate through the membrane barrier in the filtration process. As shown in Fig. 6 , the static WCA of the neat PSf membrane shows the highest value, i.e., 61.75°. This result shows that polysulfone has a slight hydrophobic nature. With the addition of 0.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles, the WCA decreases from 61.75° to 46.00°; the ZnO nanoparticles enhance the hydrophilic property of the PSf membrane surface. This result is supported by the FT-IR spectra analysis, where the addition of ZnO resulted in the presence of absorbed−OH, thus the membrane becomes more hydrophilic. The PVA layer on the membrane surface significantly decreases the WCA from 46.00° to 31.17° at a PVA concentration of 1 wt%. The improvement of the surface hydrophilicity might come from the presence of hydroxyl groups in the PVA. This explanation is supported by the FT-IR analysis, where the hydroxyl vibration band increases significantly. Moreover, the presence of PVA as a selective skin layer decreases the surface roughness of the membrane, as shown in Fig. 3. The previous study conducted by Woo and co-workers also revealed that a rougher membrane surface had a higher WCA value [38]. The higher concentration of the PVA slightly decreasing the contact angle might be due to the increase in PVA in the coating solution resulting in a denser skin top-layer. The denser skin layer slightly increased the surface tension; therefore, increasing the PVA concentration in the coating solution is not linearly proportional to the decrease in the WCA. A PWP experiment was conducted to evaluate the water transport properties of the prepared membranes. The PWP results at different operating pressures are shown in Fig. 7 . It is shown that the permeate flux of pure water for all types of the membrane (M1-M4) increased proportionally with the operating pressure (5–9 bar) from the feed side. This result indicates that the permeation of the membranes is a pressure-driven filtration. The pristine PSf membrane seems to have a relatively low PWP value due to its slightly hydrophobic nature. The PWP of the nanohybrid membrane increased by about 1.33 times with the incorporation of 0.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles. The PWP enhancement might be from the improved structural properties with the incorporation of the nanoparticles. As reported in a previous study, the membrane blended with inorganic nanoparticles had improved membrane porosity, average pore radius, and surface hydrophilicity, which leads to a permeate flux enhancement [39]. This result is also supported by the SEM image analysis, where the nanohybrid membrane was shown to have a porous surface. However, the PVA layer addition on the membrane surface significantly decreases the PWP by as much as 0.71 times at 1 wt% PVA. The thicker dense top layer of the membrane due to PVA deposition may increase the membrane resistance. According to Darcy’s law of fluid transport through porous media, the higher resistance of the membrane would decrease the permeate flux. The PWP value continuously decreases with an increase in PVA concentration from 1 wt% to 3 wt%. Although the PVA coating enhances the surface hydrophilicity, the increased density of the coating layer with increasing PVA decreases the mass transfer rate of the water."
13,Mechanical strength evaluation of the fabricated membranes,"3.4 Mechanical strength evaluation of the fabricated membranes The individual structural components contribute to the mechanical properties of the overall membrane. According to the SEM images, the overall membrane thickness increases when ZnO nanoparticles are incorporated, and the membrane is coated with PVA. The nanoparticles change the rheological properties of the polymer solution that influences the formation of the membrane structure during the phase separation process. Table 3 presents the thickness, tensile strength, and elongation at break of the prepared membranes. The thickness of the membrane increased with the modifications in this study. The nanohybrid PSf-ZnO membrane has a thicker membrane compared with the neat PSf membrane due to the impregnation of nanoparticles into the polymer structure. The coating of PVA also affected the membrane thickness, as shown by the increase in the membrane skin layer thickness in the SEM analysis. However, the increase in PVA concentration did not significantly increase the thickness of the membrane. The tensile strength values of the modified membranes were higher than the neat PSf membrane. The incorporated nanoparticles in the membrane help absorb the energy applied to the membrane during the mechanical test. Hence, the membrane is not easily broken, despite higher applied energy. However, the elongation at breakpoint decreases from 12.03%–11.50 % as ZnO is added as the ZnO nanoparticles restrict the chain mobility of the PSf matrix to a certain extent. The PVA deposition on the PSf-ZnO membrane improves both the tensile strength and elongation at break. This phenomenon is attributed to the PVA coating on the membrane surface. PVA naturally has excellent tensile strength, flexibility, and adhesive properties. The presence of PVA provides enhancement of the support membrane mechanical strength. The adhesive and flexibility properties of PVA contributed to the tensile strength and elongation at break of the whole membrane. The PVA coating significantly enhanced the membrane mechanical strength, extending the membrane life span."
14,Performance evaluation using refinery wastewater treatment,"3.5 Performance evaluation using refinery wastewater treatment Untreated petroleum wastewater filtration experiments in a cross-flow system were performed to evaluate the separation performance of the prepared membranes. The wastewater was obtained from the physical-chemical waste treatment output of Pertamina, Ltd., Indonesia. The characteristics of the wastewater were 1800 mg.L−1 total dissolved solid, 671.68 mg.L−1 COD, 143 mg.L−1 NH3, 75 mg.L−1 total phenol, and 32 NTU turbidity. As shown in Fig. 8 , the initial flux of PSf was slightly enhanced from 1.68 to 1.82 L.m−2. h−1 by the membrane with 0.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles. However, the PVA coating caused a decline in the initial flux to 1.23 L.m−2 h−1, 0.84 L.m−2 h−1, and 0.69 L.m−2 h−1 for PVA concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 wt%, respectively. The enhancement of the permeate flux may be related to the improvements in the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity by the addition of nano-ZnO nanoparticles in the PSf membrane. The decline of the initial permeate flux might be due to the increase in skin layer thickness as a result of the PVA coating that also increased the resistance. Over the operating time for each membrane, decreases in the permeation fluxes were observed. The significant decline in the first 60 min might be due to external fouling caused by particulate attachment on the membrane surface. After 90 min of filtration time, the flux profiles showed a pseudo-steady-state due to foulant adsorption and concentration polarization. Although the initial flux of the PVA-coated membranes was less than the pristine PSf membrane, the permeate flux decline of the pristine PSf membrane yields a serious decline during the PRW treatment. Higher-level pseudo-steady-states was achieved by the membrane with a PVA coating. This phenomenon indicates that the foulant deposition on the PVA-coated membranes was less than that on the neat uncoated membrane. The PVA coating was proven to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane during the filtration process. However, with a higher concentration of PVA in the coating solution, the pseudo-steady-state of the permeate flux declines by 0.5–0.6 times, which might be due to a higher density of the membrane skin layer with the higher PVA concentration as the coating agent. The sharp flux decline of the neat PSf membrane was consistent with a previous study [40]. It might be ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the PSf polymer that attracts oil droplets from the wastewater to form a waterproof layer on the membrane surface and internal body of the membrane. Another parameter in the membrane performance evaluation was pollutant rejection. In this study, phenol and ammonia are the pollutants focused on removal from wastewater. Phenol and ammonia levels become an issue in PRW treatment using conventional techniques. As shown in Fig. 9 , all fabricated membranes exhibited a phenol removal efficiency greater than 51 %, and the ammonia removal efficiency greater than 82 %. The removal efficiency obtained from this study was greater than a previous study [41] that reached 25 %– 50 % removal efficiency. This lower efficiency may be due to the effect of other contaminants in the untreated wastewater. Ammonia (NH3) in wastewater is in the equilibrium state with ammonium ions (NH4 +), which can be absorbed by other contaminants, such as colloids and suspended solids, that are easier to remove using a membrane. Hence, the pH plays an essential role in the separation efficiency, where the pH of the feed determines the equilibrium state between NH3 and NH4 + ions. The presence of the PVA layer improves the selectivity performance of the membrane by enhancing the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51.52%–82.68% and 82.89%–92.42%, respectively. The enhanced removal efficiency may be due to charge exclusion. As reported by Li and co-workers, the PVA polymer is a negatively-charged polymer over the whole pH region that repels negatively-charged molecules [42]. In the alkaline environment of PRW (pH = 8.6), the form of the dissolved NH3 in water is the dominating NH4 + form. Since NH3 is a Lewis base, the NH3 molecules were rejected via Donnan’s exclusion mechanism by the PVA surface. Phenolic compounds have hydroxyls linked to the benzene ring with a delocalized electron cloud. The electron-withdrawing groups (electrophilic functional group) can interfere with the electron cloud and create a partial positive charge in the aromatic ring [43]. Electronegative oxygen in phenolic compounds creates a negative charge on the benzene ring in the pH range of 8–12, where the hydrogen is attracted to form a phenolate anion that is negatively charged. Ammonia experiences a stronger electrostatic repelling force than phenolic compounds, given its stronger negative charge. However, phenol and N-NH3 concentrations in the permeate are still relatively high at 148.09 mg.L−1 (82.68 % removal) and 25.40 mg.L−1 (92.42 % removal), respectively. According to the low removal efficiency of N-NH3, another process, such as advanced oxidation processes (Electrochemical oxidation, Fenton oxidation, etc.) [44,45], should be integrated with the membrane separation to achieve the higher quality of treated water. Other pollutants, such as TDS, COD, and turbidity, were also evaluated to investigate the membrane performance for contaminant removal efficiency. The TDS level represents the concentration of dissolved solids, such as minerals. The COD level indicates the concentration of organic compounds in the PRW, while turbidity is a measure of the micro-particulates present in the PRW. As presented in Fig. 10 , the TDS removal increases with the addition of ZnO nanoparticles and PVA coating. However, the higher concentration of PVA in the coating solution does not have a significant effect on TDS rejection. The TDS removal efficiency of all membranes was in the range of 18.33 %–38.25 %. In general, the rejection of TDS was relatively low, which might be because the membrane was unable to reject monovalent ions such as Na+, K+, and Cl−. Thus, the monovalent ions experienced weak size exclusion and Donnan’s exclusion effects. The enhancement of TDS rejection by the PVA-coated membrane might be attributed to by the electrostatic repulsion. The positively-charged membrane surface provided a stronger repulsion force against cations. The PVA coating exhibits an obvious enhancement in the COD removal efficiency. Organics compounds were excluded due to both the size exclusion effect and charge exclusion effect due to their larger molecular size and functional groups. Many organic contaminants in PRW are hydrocarbon and benzene derivatives that have strong repulsion forces with hydrophilic surfaces such as that produced by the PVA coating. Turbidity removal efficiencies were excellent for all membrane types, where the removal efficiencies are in the range of 97 %–99 %. The turbidity in PRW was caused by particulates with a micro-scale size. Since the membrane pores are nanoscale, the particulates in PRW were rejected via size exclusion mechanism."
15,Membrane fouling analysis,"3.6 Membrane fouling analysis The main issue in membrane separation applications for wastewater treatment is fouling during operation. Fouling in the membrane gradually decreases the permeation flux and also reduces the lifespan of the membrane; therefore, the membrane application is not economically feasible. In this work, the PVA coating was used to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane. The examination of the fouling can be performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative analysis can be performed through a fouling autopsy to indicate the foulant deposition on the membrane [46]. In this study, a quantitative approach was conducted to evaluate how much the membrane modification can mitigate the fouling formation during PRW treatment. A series model of the resistance equation derived from Darcy’s law was used to examine the resistance created by the foulant. The resistance in the membrane separation was contributed to by the membrane structure itself, absorbed foulant, and cake formation of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface. The resistance of the fabricated membranes during a 150-min PRW filtration experiment are shown in Table 4 . The value of Rm decreases slightly with the addition of ZnO nanoparticles, possible because the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles improves the porosity and hydrophilicity. However, the Rm of the membrane increases as the PVA coating is applied. This increase in Rm might be because the PVA coating decreased the size of the surface pores on the membrane, forming a denser membrane. Alternatively, the PVA addition increases the selective layer thickness, thus increasing the resistance. The lowest resistance from the absorbed foulant was shown by the membrane with a 2 wt% PVA coating. The highest cake resistance was shown by a neat PSf membrane that has a slightly hydrophobic surface and unrepaired properties. As shown in Table 4, the PVA in the selective layer can reduce pollutant deposition on the membrane wall despite the significant increase in the intrinsic membrane resistance. The PVA coating improves the antifouling behavior of the membrane."
16,Conclusion,"Nanohybrid membranes of PSf-ZnO with crosslinked PVA were successfully fabricated with a dense and smooth surface using a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The PVA coating can significantly repair the porous surface of the nanohybrid membrane, as shown in SEM images. The FT-IR spectra analysis also revealed that the addition of ZnO nanoparticles and a PVA coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity by introducing−OH functional groups. These results were supported by WCA measurement. The membrane also exhibited a distinct improvement in the surface charge, mechanical strength, pollutant removal efficiency, and antifouling behavior. The modification made in this study significantly enhanced the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51.52%–82.68% and 82.89%–92.42%, respectively. The fouling evaluation also showed that the PVA coating provides lower cake and absorbed foulant resistance during PRW treatment."
