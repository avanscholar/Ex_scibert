0,Introduction,"Anthraquinones (AQs) are a class of natural and synthetic compounds that have important applications in dyes and pharmaceuticals [1]. However, as recalcitrant dyes [2] and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) [3], AQs easily cause pollution during production and utilization [4,5]. The removal of these organics during traditional wastewater treatment generally involves methods like adsorption and biodegradation [6–9]. Adsorption is the process of enriching pollutants from waterbodies or sewage to solid adsorbents such as activated carbon, zeolite, silica gel, alumina, and other materials [10–12]. Adsorption can directly remove pollutants from water, but this does not degrade them. An enzyme can degrade specific pollutants, but the practical application is restrained by the enzyme’s fragile nature and difficulty in controlling the processes [13–15]. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2), a typical dioxygen oxidoreductase primarily obtained from prokaryotes and fungi, has great potential for biotechnology, notably for the oxidation of various organic matter such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, diclofenac, tetracycline, and dyes [13,16–18]. For AQ degradation, laccase has been shown to be able to remove 72% of the AQ dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R (20 mg/L) within 60 min [19]. However, free laccase has good water solubility, and is thus unable to recycle. In addition, its stability is limited to low temperature and a given pH [20–22]. Given the above, laccase immobilization can promote the removal of specific pollutants. Moreover, laccase immobilization on porous supports combines the synergism of biodegradation and adsorption. Recently, micro/nanomaterials were used to immobilize laccase in some studies, and among these, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were the most popular [23–25]. MOFs are crystalline materials assembled from metal ions and organic bridging ligands with high specific surface areas, adjustable pore sizes, and good modifiability. Laccase immobilization by MOFs is obtained on physical adsorption [26], covalent binding [16], self-assembly [24], co-precipitation [25], and other methods [23]. These studies showed that MOFs can not only provide strong support for the laccase but also act as efficient adsorbents for pollutants, thereby improving the applicability and stability of the immobilized laccase. Although MOFs are effective supports for laccase immobilization, they still have defects, such as being difficult to recycle and sustain enzyme activity. When MOFs are combined with other organic or inorganic materials, composite supports are formed, and the properties of these composite materials are optimized. For example, in our previous research, Fe3O4-NH2@MIL-101(Cr) was prepared to immobilize laccase, and the composite material showed a high laccase loading amount and good recyclability [16]. As for maintaining the enzyme activity, the hydrogel exhibited nontoxicity and moldability, and therefore was regarded as a potential material for use as an immobilizing enzyme [27]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel was widely studied due to its high stability and biocompatibility. MOF/PVA composite materials were newly studied to construct adsorbents [28], supercapacitors [29], and osmosis membranes [30], but there has been no report on enzyme immobilization using an MOF/PVA cryogel. In this study, a simple, cheap, and environmentally friendly strategy for laccase immobilization is constructed that has not been reported before. Different MOF/PVA cryogels are prepared to immobilize laccase (Lac), and MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac (MIL-68(Al) is one of MOFs) that showed high enzymatic properties. Alizarin green, a typical AQ, is used to test the adsorption-biodegradation ability of the immobilized laccase, and an in-depth analysis of the degradation process and mechanism is then conducted. Molecular docking, mass spectrometry (MS), and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) were then employed to prove the targeted removal of the immobilized laccase on the alizarin green. Finally, the potential of the MOF/PVA/Lac for the targeted removal of dyes and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater is discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) purified from aspergillus was provided by the Shanghai Goybio Industries Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Alizarin green (analytical grade) and 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were provided by the Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (the degree of polymerization was 1700, 98–99% hydrolyzed), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from the Damao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China). Terephthalic acid (H2BDC), aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O), hydrofluoric acid (HF), and other chemicals were supplied by the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Mass spectrometric purity acetonitrile was provided by Merck. All of the other materials were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac,"2.2 Preparation of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac MIL-68(Al) was synthesized using the hydrothermal method [31]. In detail, terephthalic acid (5.0 g) and AlCl3·6H2O (4.88 g) were added to N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (248.0 g) and stirred for 18 h at 130 °C. The product was isolated using centrifugation, washed with DMF and ethanol, and dried overnight at 100 °C. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was prepared using the embedding-adsorption method. PVA was added to pure water and completely dissolved by heating and stirring at 90 °C to obtain a 120 mg/mL PVA solution. The laccase solutions (4 mg/mL, 2 mL) were mixed with 240 mg of MIL-68(Al) powder for 10 min and then evenly dispersed in 2 mL of the PVA solution. A 1 cm × 2 cm glass sheet was used as the support, and 200 μL of the mixture was evenly dropped on the support and frozen at − 20 °C for 12 h. Then, the frozen mixture was repeatedly thawed and frozen (each for 1 h) four times. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac (1 cm × 2 cm × 0.09 cm) was finally obtained after washing with deionized water several times. The other MOF-based cryogel-immobilized laccases were prepared using the same experimental procedure (Text S1). These included ZIF-67(Co)/PVA/Lac, HKUST-1(Cu)/PVA/Lac, MIL-53(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-100(Fe)/PVA/Lac, MIL-101(Cr)/PVA/Lac, and MIL-101(Fe)/PVA/Lac."
4,Enzymatic properties assessment,"2.3 Enzymatic properties assessment 2.3.1 Activity assays of the laccase Two pieces of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac were placed in 2 mL of a citrate–phosphate buffer (pH 4.0, 2.0 M) and mixed with 1 mL of the ABTS solution (1 mmol/L). The reaction was maintained in a water bath at 30 °C for 5 min. The oxidation product, ABTS+, could be detected at a wavelength of 520 nm. The amount of laccase required to oxidize 1 μmol of ABTS in 1 min was defined as one unit (U) of laccase activity. The measuring of the free laccase activity was the same as that for the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, wherein the amount of free laccase was equivalent to the laccase contained in the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac. The equation for the recovery rate of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac is as follows: (1) R ( % ) = A i A f × 100 % where Ai and Af refer to the activity of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and free laccase, respectively. The above reactions were conducted in citrate–phosphate buffers with different pHs (pH 2.2–8.0) and temperatures (25–80 °C). The maximum laccase activity in the pH or temperature studies was defined to be 100%. 2.3.2 Stabilities of the laccase The free laccase and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac were maintained in citrate–phosphate buffers at different pHs (ranging from 2.2 to 8.0) for 24 h to explore the pH stability. The activity of the laccase was determined using the methods described in Section 2.3.1, and the relative activity was calculated, where the maximum activity was defined to be 100%. To explore the thermal stability, the free laccase and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac were dispersed in 50 °C citrate–phosphate buffers at the optimal pH values. The laccase activity was detected every hour, and the initial activity was defined to be 100%. To explore the operational stability, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was repeatedly used for the ABTS oxidation. After each reaction, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was washed using the citrate–phosphate buffers (pH 4.0). The initial laccase activity was defined to be 100%. 2.3.3 Kinetic studies The Lineweaver-Burk plot was introduced to determine the parameters of the laccase kinetics. The laccase activity was evaluated in the ABTS solutions that had different concentrations (ranging from 0.05 mmol/L to 2.00 mmol/L), and the average reaction rate during the initial three minutes was regarded as the initial rate of laccase catalysis. The Lineweaver-Burk plot was fitted using the following equation, and the Km and Vmax values were calculated according to the following equation: (2) 1 v = K m V max · 1 [ S ] + 1 V max , where V and Vmax refer to the initial rate and the maximum rate of the reaction, respectively; Km refers to the Michaelis-Menten constant; and [S] refers to the initial concentration of the ABTS."
5,Decolorization of the alizarin green,"2.4 Decolorization of the alizarin green 2.4.1 Removal of the alizarin green The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-68(Al)/PVA, and laccase powder (0.8 mg) were added to the 10 mL of alizarin green solutions (10–70 mg/L, pH 4.0) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. The mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 12 h at 25 °C, and the solution absorbance, At, was measured at a wavelength of 640 nm. The removal rate of the alizarin green was calculated as follows: (3) R ( % ) = A 0 - A t A 0 × 100 % , where A0 is the absorbance of the initial alizarin green solution. To study the effect of pH on alizarin green removal by the immobilized laccase, the solutions (20 mg/L) were prepared at different acidities (pH 3.0–8.0). The other experimental conditions were maintained, as discussed above. The absorbance of the alizarin green solution was tested at intervals at a concentration of 20 mg/ L and a pH of 4.0. Accordingly, the kinetic curve was plotted by calculating the removal rate of the alizarin green. 2.4.2 Reusability of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac The decolorization was performed in 10 mL of alizarin green (20 mg/ L, pH 4.0). After reacting for 12 h, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was directly moved to a new system without any treatment. All of the steps above were repeated several times. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Statistically significant differences were determined using a one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s test. Statistical significance was established at p less than 0.05."
6,Characterization and analysis,"2.5 Characterization and analysis 2.5.1 Characterization of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac The regular and freeze-fracture method (treated using liquid nitrogen) of the scanning electron microscope (SEM), SU8020, was applied to detect the external and internal morphologies of the MIL-68(Al), MIL-68(Al)/PVA, and MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac. The surface area and pore size distributions of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac were characterized using nitrogen adsorption–desorption (ASAP 2460) at 77 K. The thermal properties of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and laccase powder were measured using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, METTLER TOLEDO) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 protection. The MIL-68(Al) was subjected to an X-ray diffraction (XRD) wide-angle diffraction analysis (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using a Cu target (λ = 1.54056 Å). 2.5.2 Analysis of the degradation intermediates The solutions at different reaction times were tested using a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) (Agilent and Bruker) for the analysis of the degradation products. (1) The HPLC parameters. Column: Kromasil C18 (5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm); mobile phase: 0.1% formic acid: acetonitrile (70: 30); flow rate: 0.8 mL/min; column temperature: 25 °C; and injection volume: 10 μL. (2) The Q-TOF-MS parameters. Ion source: ESI source; scanning mode: ESI negative ion mode; capillary voltage: 4.5 kV; collision gas: N2; ion source temperature: 180 °C; atomizing gas: N2; dry gas flow: 4.0 L/min; collision energy: 6–40 V; scan time: 0.2 s; and mass scan range m/z: 100–1500. The NMR experiments and spectrum analysis. The degradation product was rotary evaporated under a vacuum and then dried using P2O5 in a dryer for 24 h. After dissolving in 600 µL of DMSO‑d6 , the product was removed to 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis. The CPMG-1D pulse sequence was applied for the NMR. Similarly, the above processes were performed on 5.0 mg of the alizarin green. The degradation products and alizarin green were tested for 1D-NMR and 2D-NMR, where HSQC and HMBC experiments were performed. The NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz on Bruker AV-600 instruments (Bruker, Germany) using 64 scans. The NMR samples (20 mg) were prepared by dissolving in 0.5 mL of DMSO‑d6 solvent, which contained 0.05% tetramethylsilane (TMS). The 1H NMR, HSQC, and HMBC spectra of each sample were loaded on the Mestrenova-12.0 for Fourier transformation. All of the spectra were subjected to baseline and phase corrections before the chemical shifts were assigned. 2.5.3 Molecular docking Auto dock software was used to study the combination of laccase and alizarin green, and the semi-flexible docking method was applied. The crystalline structure of the laccase was downloaded from the RCSB PDB database (http://www.rcsb.org/, PDB No. 2HZH). The reaction active domain and the possible reaction mechanism of the laccase and alizarin green were then investigated."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac,"3.1 Characterization of MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac The SEM image shows the surface appearance of the MIL-68(Al) (Fig. S1), indicating that the MIL-68(Al) was prepared as reported [32]. The surface images of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac are shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. 1 a and b. The surfaces were uneven, and cracks appeared where the MIL-68(Al) was contained. These cracks may be beneficial for molecular diffusion when the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac is in a water solution. Channels, which used to be occupied by water, were emptied due to the freeze-drying process. Cross-sections of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA and MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac are shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. 1c and d, where a large number of pores were revealed with diameters ranging from 5 to 20 μm. TGA was used to analyze the thermal properties of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-68(Al)/PVA, and laccase powder (Fig. S2). The decomposition process of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and MIL-68(Al)/PVA could be divided into three stages. At the early stage (260–360 °C), the weight loss was caused by the depolymerization of the PVA chain and the decomposition of the gel network [33]. At the second stage (500–550 °C), the frozen gel was pyrolyzed until it was carbonized. At the third stage (550–600 °C), the organic ligands of the MIL-68(Al) were decomposed, and the loss curves of the weight were the same for both the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA during this stage. When the temperature reached 800 °C, the residuals were 22% and 20% for the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA, respectively. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac are shown in Fig. S3 and Text S2. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the MIL-68(Al) (Fig. S4) was consistent with the results of Li et al. [34]."
9,Enzymatic properties of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac,"3.2 Enzymatic properties of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac 3.2.1 The effect of pH The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac exhibited its activity over a wider pH range than the free laccase. The activities of the free laccase and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac both decreased when the pH was greater than 3.0, but the stability of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was higher than the free laccase, especially in weakly acidic environments (Fig. 2 a). It retained over 80% of its activity at a pH of 4.0, while the free laccase remained only 34%. The free laccase and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac exhibited different pH stabilities when stored in the buffers for 24 h at different pHs (Fig. 2b). A strong acidic condition (pH < 4.0) was negative to maintain the activity of the free laccase, and the relative stability was 68% at pH 5.0 and dropped to 12% at pH 3.0 (Fig. 2b). The pH adaptability of the laccase was greatly enhanced after immobilization. The relative activity of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was maintained at 79% at a pH ranging from 2.2 to 5.0, and the initial stability was maintained 100% within 24 h at a pH of 3.0 or 4.0. The pH adaptability of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was attributed to the protection of the cryogel. Similarly, the residual activity of a chitosan grafted polyacrylamide hydrogel-immobilized laccase (75.5%) was much higher than that of the free laccase (4.3%) after 48 h of incubation, as reported [27]. The strong interactions between the PVA cryogel and laccase protect the conformation of the laccase from drastic environmental transformations. 3.2.2 The effect of temperature The optimum temperature for exhibiting enzymatic activity shifted from 50 °C (free laccase) to 60 °C (MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac) after laccase immobilization (Fig. 2c). The thermal stabilities were investigated at 50 °C (Fig. 2d), and the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac showed a higher thermal stability than the free laccase. The relative activity of the free laccase rapidly decreased to less than 20% after 2 h, and the corresponding activity was greater than 80% for the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac. The relative activity of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was still greater than 30% after 5 h, while the free laccase was nearly inactivated. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was superior to the free laccase in temperature adaptability and thermal stability. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac is a composite, and the heat transfer towards laccase was hindered by the MIL-68(Al) and PVA. This was also the reason why the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac displayed a higher optimum temperature. The laccase was confined in a 3D microenvironment, which reduced the impact of severe environments on the laccase and helped to maintain its thermal stability [35]. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac exhibited tolerance to changes in temperature, and thus showed more potential for wastewater treatment than the free laccase. 3.2.3 Operational stability Operational stability is a key factor to reduce cost in an application, which is one of the major purposes of immobilization. The activity of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was investigated during ten cycles (Fig. 2e). As shown, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac retained 100% of its activity during the initial three cycles. Even after ten cycles, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac retained greater than 67% of its activity. The decrease in the laccase activity might have been due to laccase leaching during the operations. Similar results were obtained in other studies [36,37]. Additionally, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac can be easily collected and recycled due to its good mechanical strength and bulk structure. Due to its low activity loss and convenient recovery, MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac can be repeatedly used and is promising for reducing the cost of wastewater treatment. 3.2.4 Kinetic studies The correlation between the ABTS oxidation rate and the ABTS concentration can be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetic values of Km and Vmax were 0.022 mmol·L−1 and 2.191 μmmol·L−1·min−1, respectively, for the free laccase, and were 0.063 mmol·L−1 and 0.536 μmmol·L−1·min−1, respectively, for the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac (Fig. 2f). The increase in Km could be explained by a lower ABTS-laccase affinity, which suggested the presence of steric obstacles after immobilization. The diffusion resistance of the cryogel diminished Vmax of the laccase, which was reduced by 75% after immobilization (Table S1). Similar results were obtained in other studies [38–40]. As reported, lower values of Vmax were obtained for the TiO2-ZrO2-laccase (0.036 U/mg) and the TiO2-ZrO2-SiO2-laccase (0.029 U/mg) than that for the free laccase (0.046 U/mg), indicating that the immobilization process may slightly decrease the affinity between laccase and the substrate [40]."
10,Alizarin green removal by the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac,"3.3 Alizarin green removal by the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac 3.3.1 The removal of alizarin green The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac displayed a higher removal efficiency compared with the free laccase and MIL-68(Al)/PVA (Fig. 3 a). With a concentration increase from 10 to 30 mg/L, the removal efficiency of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac remained greater than 93%, yet it decreased from 94.67% to 82.31% when using the free laccase. The coordination of adsorption by the MIL-68(Al) and degradation by the laccase contributed to the high removal efficiency of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac. The excess alizarin green interfered with the active center of the laccase; therefore, the higher alizarin green concentration resulted in a lower removal efficiency. The impact of pH on alizarin green removal was studied considering the pH-sensitivity of the laccase. The removal efficiency by the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was greater than 93% at pH 3.0 and 4.0 (Fig. 3b). With an increase in the pH, the removal efficiencies of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac and free laccase both decreased, which corresponded with the results in Section 3.2.1. In a neutral environment, the free laccase showed no apparent removal, while the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac removed 60% of the alizarin green. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA weakened the pH-sensitivity of the laccase and ensured the removal effects for targeted pollutants. The dynamic equilibrium process was investigated to show the effects of the reaction time on alizarin green removal (Fig. 3c). The adsorption efficiency was higher than the degradation efficiency during the first 2 h. After 2 h, the adsorption reached saturation, yet the degradation continued, and the removal equilibrium was reached after 12 h. The removal efficiencies of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-68(Al)/PVA, and free enzyme were 95.86%, 65.32%, and 83.11%, respectively. In this work, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was inactivated using heat and renamed MIL-68(Al)/PVA/de-Lac to compare the effectiveness of the two materials. The results showed that the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/de-Lac removed 9% less of the alizarin green than the MIL-68(Al)/PVA (pH 4, alizarin green 20 mg/L, 10 mL). The embedded laccase occupied some of the adsorption sites on the surface of the MIL-68(Al), and the adsorption ability of the MIL-68(Al) was affected. When the laccase was inactivated, a loss in the adsorption capacity for the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/de-Lac was obvious. 3.3.2 The reusability of MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac A recycling reaction was investigated to show the reusability of MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac (Fig. 3d). By increasing the cycles, the adsorption effect inevitably weakened, while the degradation effect prevailed. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac remained at a removal efficiency of 68% after six cycles. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac exhibited high stability and good reusability, which is promising for wastewater treatment. Adsorption or degradation was available, but not powerful enough to remove the pollutants efficiently, sustainably, and stably [41,42]. In addition, the combination of them promoted the removal efficiency. Additionally, compared with other strategies for laccase immobilization [43,44], laccase embedding by MIL-68(Al)/PVA is practical and economical, therefore is worth further exploration."
11,The mechanism of pollutant removal,"3.4 The mechanism of pollutant removal The reaction processes and products were analyzed using the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S5). The 1H NMR analysis is faster, more sensitive, and accurate than an ultraviolet (UV) analysis, especially for pollutants with weak UV adsorptions (such as steroidal components in PPCPs) or with trace amounts. A characteristic singlet of hydrogen (–N–H) of alizarin green was found at δH 12.04 in the 1H NMR, which nearly disappeared after enzymatic degradation. This result agreed with that of the spectrophotometer analysis, indicating that the degradation of alizarin green was radical. According to the 1H NMR spectra, the degradation products of alizarin green displayed a typical AA’BB’ coupling system that was indicated by δH 6.83 (d, J = 8.1 Hz) and δH 6.53 (d, J = 8.1 Hz) (Fig. S5). The HSQC spectrum (Fig. S6) exhibited correlations between δH 6.53 and δC 116.71, δH 6.83 and δC 130.76, and δH 2.11 and δC 20.60. In addition, significant long correlations in the HMBC were shown between δH 2.11 and δC 124.04, 130.76; δH 6.83 and δC 20.60, 142.37 (Fig. S7). According to the above results, p-toluidine was inferred to be the primary degradation product. The laccase-AQs reaction system was difficult to determine due to its complexity; therefore, assignment of the structure of the final products has rarely been reported [45,46]. In this study, the major product was determined using NMR techniques, which was a trace amount. The detailed NMR data are as follows: 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO‑d6 ), δH 6.83 (2H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, H-3, H-5), 6.52 (2H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, H-2, H-6), 2.11 (3H, s, –CH3); 13C NMR (150 MHz, DMSO‑d6 ), δC 142.37 (C-1), 116.71 (C-2, C-6), 130.76 (C-3, C-5), 124.04 (C-4), and 20.6 (–CH3). The key active sites and the affinity between the laccase and alizarin green were also investigated to explore the degradation mechanism (Fig. 4 ). The results indicated that alizarin green preferred to combine with GLU460, PHE55, LEU58, VAL345, ALA461, PRO346, ALA80, PHE81, SER113, TYR491, and GNL499 residues in the laccase through interaction forces like hydrogen bonding (Fig. 4a). Therefore, the above residues were the active sites of the laccase towards the alizarin green. Additionally, HPLC-MS was also applied to analyze the final degradation products (Fig. S8). Three key fragments were detected (Fig. 4c), which were sodium 2-amino-5-methylbenzenesulfonate (the precursor of p-toluidine, m/z 186), 2-(2,3,6-trihydroxybenzyl Acyl) benzoic acid (final product 1, m/z 273), and phthalic acid (final product 3, m/z 165). According to the affinity between the alizarin green and the laccase, as well as the final products, it was deduced that the C-α oxidation was likely the primary mechanism of degradation (Fig. 4d), which was consistent with previous studies [46–49]."
12,The construction of various MOF-based cryogels for laccase immobilization,"3.5 The construction of various MOF-based cryogels for laccase immobilization A variety of MOF-based cryogels were prepared and applied for laccase immobilization (Fig. 5 ), which included PVA/Lac, ZIF-67(Co)/PVA/Lac, HKUST-1(Cu)/PVA/Lac, MIL-53(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-100(Fe)/PVA/Lac, MIL-101(Cr)/PVA/Lac, and MIL-101(Fe)/PVA/Lac. The relative laccase activity (100% for the free laccase activity) of the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac was 39.22%, which was the highest among the above MOF/PVA/Lac types. As a comparison, the laccase immobilization found using the embedding method was typically less than 30% [27]. In addition, the acid tolerability of the MOF/PVA/Lac was tested in a phosphoric acid-citric acid buffer (pH 3.0). The ZIF-67(Co)/PVA/Lac, HKUST-1(Cu)/PVA/Lac, and MIL-101(Fe)/PVA/Lac decomposed within 12 h, indicating that they would be intolerable in an acid environment (Fig. S9). Finally, alizarin green removal by the MOF/PVA/Lac was studied to compare their potential for wastewater treatment. The PVA/Lac, MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac, MIL-100(Fe)/PVA/Lac, and MIL-101(Cr)/PVA/Lac removed greater than 90% of the alizarin green within 24 h, in which MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac showed the highest removal efficiency (95.86%). Additionally, to highlight the improvement in the laccase properties after immobilization, the results were compared with other recently published studies (Table S2). Based on the above results, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac displayed promising results for practical applications."
13,Conclusions,"In this study, MOF/PVA-immobilized laccases, i.e., MOF/PVA/Lac, were prepared using freeze–thaw cycles, and these were used for removing alizarin green (which is an anthraquinone dye). The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac exhibited the highest relative laccase activity and acid tolerability. Compared to free laccase, the MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac showed better pH, thermal, and operational stabilities. The MIL-68(Al)/PVA/Lac achieved high efficiency (95.86%) within 12 h for alizarin green removal and remained at greater than 60% activity after six reaction cycles. Additionally, both adsorption and degradation were available to repeatedly remove the targeted pollutant. The affinity between the laccase and alizarin green was strong, and the affinity sites and reaction center were residues like GLU460, PHE55, LEU58, and others. The final degradation product was confirmed to be p-toluidine, and the primary mechanism was shown to be C-α oxidation."
