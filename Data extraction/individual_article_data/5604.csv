0,Introduction,"Triglyceride based biomass is an appealing alternative to produce transportation fuels as they are readily available, renewable [1] and its long chain usually contains carbons between 16 and 18 [2], which is within diesel range [3] and it results in high heating value [2]. However, vegetable oils cannot be directly used as fuels due to the high amount of oxygen and consequently engine incompatibility [3,4] and therefore, in order to be used as fuels, an upgrading process is needed [3,4]. The transformation of vegetable oils into transportation fuels can be achieved by cracking, transesterification and deoxygenation [4–7]. A main drawback of biodiesel produced by transesterification is its inferior quality due the high amount of oxygen, resulting in high viscosity, poor chemical stability, high pour point and high cloud point, which results in poor cold flow properties [1,4,5,7]. Even tough cracking of triglycerides yields a fuel similar to oil derived diesel [6], it is not a selective process due to the formation of a wide range of hydrocarbons [4] and there is reduction of energy content due to loss of carbon [8]. An appealing alternative is the deoxygenation, producing a fuel similar to conventional diesel [5,7–9] and with an outstanding cetane number when compared to fossil-based diesel [1,4,10]. Moreover, this approach has superior removal of oxygen when compared to thermal cracking and it is less susceptible to coke formation, due to operation at high pressures [11]. Other advantages are absence of sulfur [12], the use of established structure for storage and distribution, and green diesel can be used in diesel engines pure or blended with petrol-diesel at any ratio [13]. The removal of oxygen in deoxygenation can be achieved by three main pathways: (i) hydrodeoxygenation, (ii) decarbonylation and (iii) decarboxylation [1,2,4,7,8,10,13–16]. In addition, one should note that there are not many studies of deoxygenation using solvent-free operating conditions [16]. Therefore, this factor is worth investigating and unlike previous work, the solvent-free approach results in a better understanding on how to design practical reactors for the production of sustainable hydrocarbons. Currently, many studies have investigated transition-metal phosphides as hydrotreating catalysts due to some advantages such as its high performance ascribed to ensemble and ligand P effects [7], affordable price, long lifetime [14,17], globular particles, enhancing site exposure [9] and resemblance with noble metals due to P incorporation into the MeOx framework [18]. Another advantage is its low activity for side reactions such as cracking and methanation [1]. Furthermore, it exhibits metallic and acidic properties [1], ascribed to Niδ+ (small positive charge functioning as Lewis acid site) and P-OH group (Brönsted acid sites, resulting from partial phosphate reduction) [10]. Several studies have explored the use of nickel phosphides for the deoxygenation of biomass. From the reported supports, it is important to highlight the use of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and CeO2 [9,19], from which it was concluded that SiO2 showed the higher activity and CeO2 the lower [9]. This has been attributed to the surface density of Ni sites, which result from interactions with the support, and differences in acidity and reducibility also impact the catalyst activity [9]. Even though the use of Al2O3 presents some advantages such as high mechanical strength, a drawback is the formation of AlPO4 and as consequence occurs the formation of the Ni12P5 phase [20,21]. Other relevant supports employed are zeolites such as H-Y [22], H-ZSM-5 [23] and H-β [24] and mesoporous materials such as MCM-41 [25] and SBA-15 [26]. The advantage of zeolites is their strong acidity, enhancing isomerization reactions, and as consequence the quality of the fuel produced [27]. On another hand, the use of mesostructured materials can enhance the hydrotreating activity [26]. Albeit there are many studies exploring the use of metallic phosphides, not many studies have reported the effect of the support on the deoxygenation of model molecules over nickel phosphide catalyst [7], therefore, this is worth investigating. Therefore, the aim of this work was the investigation of nickel phosphide catalysts supported on different structures (USY, H-ZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15) on solvent-free deoxygenation of oleic acid to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons. The performance of the catalysts was conducted on a batch reactor operated at 260–300 °C and 50 bar. The effects of the structure, reducibility, acidity and dispersion of the catalysts on the deoxygenation of oleic acid and the temperature were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The commercial zeolites used were H-ZSM-5 (HCZP 90, Clariant, Si/Al = 50) and USY (HDT 9807, Cenpes/Petrobrás, Si/Al = 5.95). On the other hand, the Al-SBA-15 was synthetized as follows. The materials used were nickel nitrate hexahydrate (97%, Vetec), dibasic ammonium phosphate (99%, Acros Organics), oleic acid (90 wt%, Synth), nitric acid (65%, Synth), hydrochloric acid (37%, Anidrol), hydrofluoric acid (48%, Dinâmica), sulfuric acid (98%, Fmaia), isopropyl alcohol (99.5%, Synth), methanol (99.8%, Synth), hexane (98.5%, Anidrol), sodium hydroxide (97%, Anidrol), ammonium chloride (99%, Êxodo Científica), sodium chloride (99%, Nuclear), ammonium hydroxide (30%, Neon), aluminum isopropoxide (98%, Acros organics), tetraethyl orthosilicate TEOS (98%, Aldrich), triblock copolymer P123 (30 wt%, Aldrich), potassium bromide (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and pyridine (>99%, Synth)."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis The synthesis of the support Al-SBA-15 (Si/Al = 10 at the gel) was performed as the literature [28,29]. Firstly, a solution was prepared with 0.85 g of aluminum isopropoxide, 8.5 g of TEOS, 10 mL of HCl 2 mol L−1 and it was stirred for 5 h. Another solution was prepared adding 4 g of P123 to 100 mL of HCl 2 mol L−1 and it was stirred for 5 h. Secondly, the first solution was added dropwise to the second one and the resulting gel was mixed for 20 h at 40 °C. Then, the pH was increased to 7.5 adding NH4OH dropwise. The mixture was placed into teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves and heated at 100 °C for 48 h. Afterwards, the product was filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the material was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. The catalysts were prepared with 10 wt% Ni2P (the active phase was calculated to be 10% of the weight of the support) and with a Ni/P mole ratio of 1.25 by incipient wetness impregnation. Initially, an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate hexahydrate was prepared. To this solution, dibasic ammonium phosphate was added, followed by dropwise addition of nitric acid until no solids remained undissolved. After drying, the calcination was performed under nitrogen (50 mL min−1) with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 until 500 °C and held for 3 h. Then, the ex situ reduction was conducted under hydrogen (50 mL min−1) with a rate of 5 °C min−1 until 350 °C followed by a rate of 2 °C min−1 until 650 °C and held for 3 h. Finally, the catalysts were passivated in 0.5% O2/N2 (50 mL min−1) for 1 h at room temperature."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) to determine the amount of Si, Al and Ni was conducted on a Spectra AA 50B (Varian) spectrometer. Previously, the samples were digested using nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of hydrogen was obtained on a ChemBet-3000 (Quantachrome) instrument using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 900 °C with a flow of 20 mL min−1 of 5% H2/N2. Before the reduction, the samples were treated with N2 at 300 °C under a flowrate of 20 mL min−1 for 30 min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a XRD 600 (Shimadzu) diffractometer, using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, V = 40 kV, i = 30 mA), a rate of 2° min−1 and a range of 2θ from 5° to 80°. The XRD analysis using small angle was conducted on a small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) N8 Horizon (Bruker) diffractometer between the 2θ range from 0.1° to 5.5°. Nitrogen physisorption to evaluate the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size was obtained on a ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics) instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, while the average pore size was obtained from the Barrette-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was carried on an Autochem II 2920 (Micromeritics) equipment. First, the samples were treated at 300 °C for 2 h under He flowrate of 20 mL min−1. Then, they were saturated with 10% NH3/He at 100 °C under a flow of 20 mL min−1 for 1 h, followed by a 50 mL min−1 He flow for 1 h. The desorption increased the temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 700 °C. The acid sites were classified into weak ( ≤ 200 °C), medium (200° – 350 °C) and strong ( ≥ 350 °C) [30]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examinations were conducted on a JEM-1400 (JEOL) instrument. Previously, the samples were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and then supported on a carbon grid and dried at room temperature overnight. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Vertex 70 V (Bruker) spectrometer using 4 cm−1 resolution and wavelength range from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1. To prepare the samples, 1 mL of pyridine was dropped on 1 g of sample followed by heating at 150 °C overnight. Then, pellets were made blending 200 mg of KBr and 1 mg of sample."
5,Catalytic runs,"2.4 Catalytic runs The deoxygenation tests were conducted in an autoclave batch reactor of 160 mL from Parr Instruments equipped with a sampling cylinder to allow the addition of the reactant free of oxygen. First, 1.5 g of passivated catalyst was reduced in situ at 5–10 bar and 250 °C for 12 h under hydrogen flow (50 mL min−1). After adding 50 g of oleic acid and reaching the desired temperature (260 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C), 50 bar of hydrogen was added in order to initiate the reaction and the catalytic tests were conducted for 6 h. A test with no catalyst was also performed in order to evaluate thermal effects. Afterwards, the liquid products were treated according to the literature [31]. Firstly, it was added to a test tube 100 μL of sample and 2 mL of 0.5 mol L−1 of NaOH in methanol and this was heated at 90 °C for 5 min. After cooling, it was added 3 mL of another solution (50 g of H2SO4 and 33.3 g of NH4Cl in 1 L of methanol) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Then, after cooling, it was added 3 mL of hexane and 2 mL of a saturated solution of NaCl. Finally, the material was centrifuged to separate the phases. The analyses to quantify the samples were conduct on a GC-10 Plus gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) with flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a VA-5 (Varian) capillary column with dimensions 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, while the product determination was conducted using the NIST library. The conversion of oleic acid and degree of deoxygenation were determined by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively: (1) X = C O A i - C O A C O A i . 100 (2) D O = C F A i - C F A C F A i . 100 where X is the oleic acid conversion (%), C O A i and C O A are the initial and final concentration of oleic acid (wt %), respectively, D O is the degree of deoxygenation (%), C F A i and C F A are the initial and final concentration of free fatty acids (wt %), respectively. The turnover frequency was determined by Eq. (3): (3) T O F = r H C L where T O F is the turnover frequency (h−1), r H C is the global reaction rate (mol gcat −1h−1) and L is the theoretical metal site concentration (mol gcat −1). An alternative to CO uptake is the determination of the theoretical metal site concentration, given by Eq. (4) [32]: (4) L = 6 n C ρ d n A where n is the average surface metal atom density of Ni2P (1.01.1015 cm−2), C is the fractional weight loading (gNi2P gcat −1), ρ is the density of Ni2P (7.09 g cm−3), d is the crystallite size calculated from Scherrer equation (cm) and n A is the Avogadro’s constant (mol−1). Assuming the behavior of an ideal batch reactor with constant volume, the reaction rate may be calculated as shown in Eq. (5) [33]: (5) r H C = m O A W d C H C d t 1 M M where m O A is the mass of oleic acid (50 g), W is the weight of catalyst (1.5 gcat), C H C is the total amount of hydrocarbons C10-C18 (wt %), t is time (h) and M M is the average molar weight of the products (g mol−1)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 TPR The TPR profiles of the calcined catalysts, denoted NixPyOz/support, are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The nickel phosphide formation occurs by reduction of Ni+2 to metallic Ni followed by phosphate species reduction [34]. The NixPyOz/H-ZSM-5 catalyst started to reduce at 600 °C and was complete at 950 °C. On the other hand, the catalysts supported on USY and Al-SBA-15 reduced at lower temperatures, both starting at 400 °C and ending at 800 °C and 870 °C, respectively. The first reduction peak at 723 °C (NixPyOz/H-ZSM-5), 509 °C (NixPyOz/USY), 640 °C (NixPyOz/Al-SBA-15) can be attributed to reduction of NiO species, while the second peak at 835 °C (NixPyOz/H-ZSM-5), 594 °C (NixPyOz/USY), 783 °C (NixPyOz/Al-SBA-15) can be ascribed to reduction of P on the P-OH bond [7,9,35]. As the reduction of the nickel phosphide supported on H-ZSM-5 occurs at higher temperature, there is a stronger interaction between the support and the metals [36], which can be assigned to the strong interaction between Ni and the acid OH of the zeolite [36]. The strong interaction between the USY zeolite and PO4 −3 can reduce the interaction between nickel and phosphate species, what explains its reduction at lower temperatures [9]. In addition, the results from the TPR and TPD analyses suggest that catalysts with stronger weak acid sites (desorption peaks of temperature < 200 °C) are more difficult to reduce, thus requiring higher temperatures at the reduction. A previous study has concluded that a stronger Brönsted acidity (e.g. weaker O–H bonds) hinders the reduction of the catalysts, as it facilitates the mobility of H+ species [37]. Indeed, the TPD result (Section 3.1.4) shows that the order of strength of weak acid sites is: USY < Al-SBA-15 < H-ZSM-5, which is consistent with the reducibility order given by the TPR. 3.1.2 XRD and SAXS The wide angle XRD patterns of the supports and nickel phosphide reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Comparing the patterns of the zeolitic supports with patterns found in the literature, it is possible to confirm the MFI structure of the H-ZSM-5 [23,24,25] and the FAU framework of the Y zeolite [12,25,26,27]. On the other hand, the peak at around 22.5° at the Al-SBA-15 and its reduced catalyst can be assigned to amorphous silica found on the pore wall of this ordered mesoporous material [7,26]. The pattern of Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 shows peaks at 40.8°, 44.7°, 47.4°, 54.2° and 74.8° ascribed to the Ni2P nickel phosphide phase [35]. On the other hand, the pattern of Ni2P/USY exhibits only a minor peak 44.7° attributed to Ni2P [35]. This difference can be explained by the high specific surface area of the USY zeolite, which enhances the crystallites dispersion [40]. The nickel phosphide supported on Al-SBA-15 exhibits peaks at 40.7°, 44.5° and 54.2° attributed Ni2P, while the peaks at 32.6°, 38.4°, 41.8°, 46.9°, 48.9°, 56.1° and 60.1° are ascribed to Ni12P5 phase [35]. It is also important to highlight that the Ni2P phase is more active in hydrotreating reactions than the Ni12P5 phase [39]. Moreover, an excess of P is necessary to form the Ni2P phase [41,42]. However, even though the synthesis used excess P, this amount was not enough to form only Ni2P on the Al-SBA-15. The low angle SAXS patterns of the support Al-SBA-15 and its reduced catalyst Ni2P/Al–SBA–15 are illustrated in Fig. 3 . These patterns are typical of ordered mesoporous materials, exhibiting a main peak at the (100) lattice plane and two peaks of lower intensity at (110) and (200) planes, or peaks at 0.85°, 1.45° and 1.68°, respectively [43]. Furthermore, the pattern of the reduced catalyst confirms that the structure of Al-SBA-15 is kept even at a high reduction temperature (650 °C). The TEM of this sample (Section 3.1.5), also corroborates this, showing the typical structure of the Al-SBA-15 molecular sieve. 3.1.3 Nitrogen physisorption and AAS Physicochemical properties of the supports and the reduced catalysts are detailed on Table 1 . The nominal Si/Al ratios are close to the experimental Si/Al for all catalysts. Furthermore, the Ni loading of the reduced catalysts is also close to the nominal value of 7.91 wt% Ni (that is equal to 10 wt% Ni2P). After nickel phosphide impregnation, the specific surface area and pore volume decreased. The reduction is more intense for Ni2P/Al-SBA-15, suggesting accumulation of the active phase on its channels [26,44]. The catalyst with the higher surface area is Ni2P/USY, followed by Ni2P/H–ZSM-5 and Ni2P/Al-SBA-15. Although USY zeolite has a significant mesoporous contribution, the zeolite in this study did not suffer an intense dealumination process, due to the small mesoporous area compared to the total area and the low Si/Al ratio, close to 6, the value found to be a limitation of the synthesis process of the zeolite Y [39]. The Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 exhibits the higher pore volume, followed by Ni2P/USY and Ni2P/H-ZSM-5. 3.1.4 TPD The TPD results of the supports and reduced catalysts are given on Table 2 and the acid profiles are shown in Fig. 4 . The acid strength of the supports, evaluated by the temperature [45] follows the order: H-ZSM-5 > USY > Al-SBA-15. The ordered mesoporous material Al-SBA-15 showed the lower acid strength when compared with the zeolites, due to the fact that the walls of its pore are amorphous [46]. Moreover, the H-ZSM-5 acidity is stronger than the USY zeolite, because the latter has a lower Si/Al, therefore, there are more Al atoms on its structure and more acid sites and its framework suffers less unbalanced during the creation of acid sites [47]. Furthermore, the amount of acid sites is related with the Si/Al ratio. The Si/Al ratio increases with the order: USY < Al-SBA-15 < H-ZSM-5, while the total amount of acid sites decreases with the following order: USY > Al-SBA-15 > H-ZSM-5. This occurs because a lower Si/Al means a higher amount of Al atoms and as a consequence a higher amount of acid sites [47]. Regarding the acid strength of the nickel phosphide catalysts, they follow the same trend as the bare supports. Comparing the nickel phosphide catalysts and their respective supports, they show a reduction of the total amount of acid sites and this is in accordance with previous studies [22,36,48]. Comparing the USY zeolite and its catalyst, there is an increase of the amount of weak and medium sites, while there is a decrease of the quantity of strong sites, probably because the nickel phosphide creates weak acid sites and at the same time it covers strong acid sites [9,22]. In addition, the surplus acidity can be ascribed to the P-OH group on Ni2P [38], since nickel phosphide has both Brönsted and Lewis acidity, attributed to P-OH and to electron deficiency of Ni, respectively [9,22]. Regarding the nickel phosphide supported on Al-SBA-15 and its support, a decrease of weak and strong sites takes place and we suggest that even tough occurs creation of acid sites, the destruction of them is more intense. Moreover, the Ni2P supported on H-ZSM-5 presents a reduction of the amount of weak and strong sites, which can be ascribed to the strong interaction between Ni and the acid OH on the zeolite [36]. 3.1.5 TEM The TEM images of the supports and the reduced catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5 and the nickel phosphide particle size distribution of the catalysts are given in Fig. 6 . These figures show that the average diameter of the phosphide particles are 18.84 nm, 10.25 nm and 13.10 nm for Ni2P/USY, Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 and Ni2P/Al-SBA-15, respectively. It seems that the particles have a better dispersion on USY, due to its high surface area and its mesopores, that can enhance the metallic dispersion. On another hand, the particles supported on H-ZSM-5 are not well dispersed, due to the presence of micropores contained on large crystals [48]. Moreover, the image of nickel phosphide supported on Al-SBA-15 also shows a good dispersion and it confirms that the channels and the ordered structure are maintained, even the at a high reduction temperature (650 °C) [7]. In addition, the catalysts supported on USY and Al–SBA–15 can have nickel phosphide inside their pores because their mesopores present an average diameter of 14.29 nm and 7.23 nm, respectively, obtained by the BJH method (Section 3.1.3). On the other hand, due to its small micropores (0.53 nm × 0.56 nm), the metallic phosphide is formed on the external surface of H-ZSM-5 [38]. 3.1.6 FTIR The FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the supports and nickel phosphide catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The bands at 1540 cm−1 and at 1450 cm−1 are ascribed to pyridine protonated by Brönsted sites and pyridine coordinated with Lewis acid sites, respectively [49], while the band at 1490 cm−1 is attributed to combination of both acid sites [49,50]. Albeit some bands are not very defined on some samples, all supports and all catalysts exhibit bands assigned to Lewis sites, to Brönsted sites and combination of both of them. Regarding zeolites, Brönsted sites can be ascribed to OH acid, such as terminal silanol groups (Si-OH) [51] and bridged hydroxyl group (Si-OH-Al) [47], while Lewis acid sites are due to extraframework aluminum [51]. In addition, nickel phosphides catalysts present Brönsted sites due to P-OH group, resulting of non-reduced P [9,22] and Lewis acid sites are ascribed to non-reduced and partially reduced Ni species [27]. Moreover, it is important to highlight that Brönsted sites are required in reaction involving transformation of hydrocarbons, while Lewis sites do not present catalytic activity by themselves, however, they enhance the strength and activity of sites when associated with them [52]."
8,Catalytic runs,"3.2 Catalytic runs 3.2.1 Support effect The product distribution correspond to diesel fuel range (C10-C25) (Fig. 8 ) [13]. The main products are C17 and C18 hydrocarbons. C17 hydrocarbons derived from decarbonylation/decarboxylation of oleic acid, while C18 hydrocarbons derived from hydrodeoxygenation of this fatty acid [3]. The gas chromatography analysis of the oleic acid showed that this reactant contained 90% of oleic acid, 1% of stearic acid and 5% of palmitic acid and the latter explains the presence of C15 and C16 hydrocarbons, derived from decarbonylation/decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation, respectively. Furthermore, C15 and C16 can result from scission β and α of oleic acid, respectively, however, this approach is hardly considered on previous studies [53]. The yield of the total amount of hydrocarbons (C10-C18) at 300 °C and at 6 h follows the order: Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 (42%) > Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 (29%) > Ni2P/USY (24%) (Fig. 8). Without catalyst, the production was c.a. 0.5% of C17 and 0.6% of C18 hydrocarbons, an insignificant production when compared to the catalytic tests, therefore proving the activity of the prepared catalysts. The highest yield over the catalyst supported on the Al–SBA-15 can be ascribed to its mesoporous nature, which implies less diffusional resistance. Between the zeolites, the catalyst supported on H-ZSM-5 achieved more hydrocarbons, probably due to its strong acidity and although the USY has a mesoporous contribution, it has a small amount of them. Furthermore, albeit the major phase on the Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 was the Ni12P5, which is least active than the Ni2P phase on hydrotreating reactions [39], it yielded more hydrocarbons, confirming its impressive activity (i.e. production of hydrocarbons). Comparing with previous studies, Jeon et al. (2019) obtained 54% of selectivity of C9-C17 hydrocarbons with a Ni catalyst promoted with Pt and supported on Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 on the deoxygenation of oleic acid [5]. In addition, the work of Silva et al. (2016) resulted in 43% of hydrocarbons on the deoxygenation of macauba pulp oil using Pd/C [13]. As on the present work it was obtained an amount of hydrocarbons close to the previous results, this shows that the Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 has a remarkable activity on hydrocarbons production, comparable to noble metals. As can be seen in Table 3 , the reaction conditions of previous studies, considering the temperature, the pressure and hydrocarbon yield is similar to the ones used for this study, which permits an adequate comparison between the results. Although nickel phosphide has been tested as an active phase, no previous studies were found that compare the effects of the supports presented in this paper. Concerning the surface specific area of the catalysts, it follows the order: Ni2P/USY > Ni2P/H–ZSM-5 > Ni2P/Al-SBA-15, suggesting that the catalyst area is not related with the reaction pathway [54]. In addition, as the oleic acid kinetic diameter is 0.55 nm [55], which is bigger than the micropores of the zeolites USY and H-ZSM-5, thus the reaction occurs on the external crystal surface [54]. The difference between the zeolites can be attributed to the strong acidity of H-ZSM-5, resulting in lighter products (C10-C16) (Section 3.2.2), due to cracking reactions [56]. Another factor that can impact the production of hydrocarbons is the crystallite size [5,36]. On the present work, the nickel phosphide crystallites sizes follows the order: Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 (10.25 nm) < Ni2P/Al–SBA-15 (13.10 nm) < Ni2P/USY (18.84 nm). Indeed, as this is related with production of hydrocarbons, the catalysts with smaller crystallites produce more hydrocarbons, as shown by fact that Ni2P/Al–SBA–15 and Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 presented a higher degree of deoxygenation (Section 3.2.2). This is in agreement with the work of Zhang et al. (2017), in which the authors investigated the effect of citric acid addition on the size of nickel phosphide nanoparticles supported on mesoporous H–ZSM-5 and they concluded that the hydrodesulfurization activity of 4,6– dimethyldibenzothiophene increased with smaller Ni2P particles [36]. Moreover, it is known that Ni2P has two types of Ni structures: tetrahedral (Ni (1)) and pyramidal (Ni (2)). The fraction of the latter increases with a decrease on the particle size. As this site is responsible for the hydrodeoxygenation pathway while Ni (1) is responsible for decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions [57]. As the main product is C17 hydrocarbons for all catalysts, we can state that the size of the Ni2P crystallites are such that the majority of sites is in the form Ni (1), thus decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions prevail, which is an advantage due to the lower consumption of H2 when compared to hydrodeoxygenation [1]. The results of the turnover frequency are summarized in Table 4 and they are in agreement with results reported previously [7,58]. The TOF follows the order: Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 > Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 > Ni2P/USY, which is the same order of the production of hydrocarbons. Albeit Ni2P/USY achieved the highest metal site concentration, it had the lowest TOF, due to the lowest production of hydrocarbons. 3.2.2 Temperature effect The catalytic tests were performed at 260 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C as this range of temperature is appropriate for the deoxygenation of fatty acids [59]. Fig. 9 shows that the total amount of hydrocarbons (C10-C18) increased from 260 °C to 280 °C however, there is a decrease from 280 °C to 300 °C. Fig. 10 exhibits the degree of deoxygenation according to the temperature. At 300 °C the highest degree of deoxygenation is ascribed to Ni2P/H-ZSM-5, followed by Ni2P/Al–SBA-15 and Ni2P/USY. At 280 °C Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 achieves the highest oxygen removal and at 260 °C this catalyst has the lowest degree of deoxygenation. Fig. 11 (c) shows that the yield of lighter hydrocarbons (C10-C16) increases with temperature, because cracking reactions are favored are higher temperatures [1]. Regarding C17 hydrocarbons (Fig. 11 (a)), there is a peak of production at 280 °C. The oleic acid conversion (Fig. 11 (d)) also exhibits a maximum hydrocarbon production at 280 °C except for the H-ZSM-5 supported catalyst. We suggest that the decrease of production at 300 °C can be ascribed to catalyst deactivation [2] and probably H–ZSM-5 does not deactivate due to small pores, preventing coke deposition [47]. Regarding C18 hydrocarbons (Fig. 11 (b)), more hydrocarbons are achieved at a higher temperature, except with the catalyst supported on USY. Another interesting outcome is that Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 achieves more hydrocarbons (C10-C18) at 300 °C and 280 °C but it achieves less than the other catalysts at 260 °C. This shows that this catalysts leads to a reaction mechanism with higher activation energy, and consequently, changes in temperature have a larger impact on reaction rate. The literature shows that long reaction runs decreases the diesel yield, as higher temperatures and long reaction times lead to cracking of fatty acids and hydrocarbons into smaller molecules [1], supporting the activity decrease from 280 °C to 300 °C. For instance, Horáčcek et al. (2019) tested Mo carbide, nitride and phosphide catalysts on the deoxygenation on rapeseed oil and it was reported a decrease on the catalytic activity as temperature increased due to an increase on cracking reactions [60]. In addition to that, Yang et al. (2013) noticed a decrease on the yield of C15-C18 hydrocarbons as temperature increased from 300 °C to 325 °C and to 350 °C on the hydrotreating of oleic acid [61]. 3.2.3 Proposed reaction pathway According to the product distribution obtained and based on previous works, a possible reaction pathway was proposed for the deoxygenation of oleic acid over nickel phosphide catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 12 . Firstly, oleic acid is hydrogenated to stearic acid (1) [2,5] or it can be decarboxylated [12] and hydrogenated to heptadecane (2). Stearic acid can then form heptadecane from decarboxylation (3) [2,12,17] or it can be reduced to form an aldehyde (4) [17,33]. The aldehyde can form heptadecane from decarbonylation (5) [17] or it can reduce and result in an alcohol (6) [17,33]. Finally, hydrodeoxygenation of alcohol result in octadecane (7) [33]."
9,Conclusions,"The catalysts present different behaviors regarding reducibility, acidity and dispersion, which influences that deoxygenation activity and the diesel yield. The total amount of hydrocarbons (C10-C18) reached at 300 °C followed the order: Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 (42%) > Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 (29%) > Ni2P/USY (24%). The catalyst Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 achieved more hydrocarbons than the other catalysts due to its mesoporous nature and its small nickel phosphide particles size. Between the zeolites, the Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 produced more hydrocarbons, on account of its strong acidity and small particle sizes. All catalysts exhibited more C17 than C18 hydrocarbons resulting from decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions. Regarding the temperature effect, the amount of hydrocarbons increased from 260 °C to 280 °C but it decreased from 280 °C to 300 °C, probably due to catalyst deactivation."
