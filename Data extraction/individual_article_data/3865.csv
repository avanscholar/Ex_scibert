0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a promising energy carrier due to its clean, renewable, and non-polluting nature [1,2]. Steam reforming [3–6], partial oxidation [7–9], auto-thermal reforming [10–13], and CO2 reforming [14–16] have been widely investigated for hydrogen production from hydrocarbons and alcohols. Among these reforming reactions, steam reforming has been recognized as the most feasible process for production of hydrogen from methane. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is abundant and mainly composed of methane, can serve as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure in modern cities may become more widespread in the future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential and on-board reformers in fuel cell applications. Nickel-based catalysts have been recognized as promising catalysts for steam reforming reactions due to their low cost and high catalytic activity [17–20]. Nickel-based catalysts, however, require high reaction temperature and excess amounts of steam to prevent nickel sintering and carbon deposition on the catalyst surface during the steam reforming reactions [20,21]. Undoubtedly, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for residential and on-board hydrogen production. Many efforts have been made to increase the stability of nickel-based catalysts in the steam reforming reactions [22–27]. It has been reported that addition of small amount of barrier or thermal stabilizer suppresses carbon deposition and nickel sintering in the nickel-based catalysts [22,23,27]. However, decrease of catalytic reforming activity is inevitable when these second metals are added into nickel-based catalysts. Therefore, developing an efficient nickel-based catalyst with high activity and long durability is urgently required for hydrogen production by steam reforming reactions. Textural modification of nickel-based catalysts has been widely attempted to achieve high catalytic performance in the reforming reactions [24–27,28–30]. In particular, it has been reported that nickel catalysts finely dispersed on the surface of mesoporous supports exhibited strong resistance toward carbon deposition and nickel sintering during the steam reforming reactions [24,25,28]. In this respect, mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts have attracted much attention for improving both activity and stability in the steam reforming reactions. In general, mesoporous catalysts can be classified into xerogel-based catalysts and aerogel-based catalysts depending on the drying method for solvent removal. It has been reported that aerogel-based catalysts can greatly enhance the dispersion of active metal and facilitate the internal heat/mass transfer due to their superior surface area, well-developed porosity, and large pore size compared to xerogel-based catalysts [28,31–33]. Therefore, many aerogel-based catalysts for various catalytic reactions have been proposed so far [28,31–33]. However, only a few studies on the application of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts to low temperature steam reforming reactions have been reported [34]. Therefore, a systematic investigation of Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst as a feasible catalyst for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG would be worthwhile. In this work, a series of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts with different Ni/Al atomic ratio were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of Ni/Al atomic ratio of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts A series of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalysts with different Ni/Al atomic ratio were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method, according to the similar method reported in literatures [28,34]. A known amount of aluminum precursor (aluminum sec-butoxide, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol at 80°C with vigorous stirring. Small amounts of distilled water and nitric acid, which had been diluted with ethanol, were slowly added into the solution of aluminum precursor for partial hydrolysis of aluminum precursor. After maintaining the resulting solution at 80°C for a few minutes, a clear sol was obtained. The sol was cooled to 60°C, and a known amount of nickel precursor (nickel acetate tetrahydrate, Sigma-Aldrich) was then slowly added into the sol to obtain a nickel–alumina composite sol. After cooling the nickel–alumina composite sol to room temperature, a monolithic gel was obtained by adding an appropriate amount of water diluted with ethanol into the sol. The gel was aged for 7 days, and then it was dried at 50°C and 170 atm for 24h in a stream of supercritical CO2. The resulting powder was finally calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield the mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst. The prepared nickel–alumina aerogel catalysts were denoted as XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.45), where X represents Ni/Al atomic ratio."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Crystalline phases of catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.541Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to examine the interaction between nickel species and alumina, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of hydrogen (2ml/min) and nitrogen (20ml/min) was used for 100mg of catalyst sample. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion, nickel surface area, and average nickel diameter of the catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5ml/min) and argon (47.5ml/min) at 700°C for 3h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50 ml/min) for 15min at 700°C. The sample was then cooled to 50°C under a flow of argon (50ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was measured by periodically injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel dispersion, nickel surface area, and average nickel diameter were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom and that cross-sectional area of atomic nickel is 6.49×10−20 m2/Ni-atom. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (JEM-2000EXII, Jeol) were conducted to examine the nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts and to see the carbon deposition and nickel sintering on the used catalysts. The amount of carbon deposition in the used catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 =4.6:0.4:10:30. Total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000ml/hg. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion and hydrogen yield were calculated according to the following equations on the basis of carbon balance. (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (2) Hydrogen yield ( % ) = F H 2 , out 2 × F CH 4 , in + 3 × F C 2 H 6 , in × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural properties of Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.1 Textural properties of Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Textural properties of XNiAE catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . For comparison, textural properties of bare alumina aerogel are also listed in Table 1. It was found that measured Ni/Al atomic ratios of XNiAE catalysts were in good agreement with designed values. All the XNiAE catalysts exhibited high surface area (>268m2/g), large pore volume (>1.52cm3/g), and large average pore size (>17.5nm). These results indicate that XNiAE catalysts were successfully prepared in this work. Although the addition of nickel slightly decreased pore volume and average pore size of XNiAE catalysts, overall textural properties of XNiAE catalysts were comparable to those of bare alumina aerogel. This can be understood by the fact that acetate groups in the nickel precursor effectively controlled the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of aluminum precursor as a chelating ligand during the preparation of XNiAE catalysts, resulting in the formation of Ni–O–Al composite structure [28,35]. It was also found that textural properties (surface area, pore volume, and average pore size) of XNiAE catalysts showed volcano-shaped trends with respect to Ni/Al atomic ratio. Among the prepared catalysts, 0.35NiAE catalyst exhibited the highest surface area, the largest pore volume, and the largest average pore size."
7,Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of XNiAE catalysts calcined at 700°C. For comparison, XRD pattern of bare alumina aerogel is also presented in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that no characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to bulk nickel oxide were observed in all the XNiAE catalysts. Instead, all the XNiAE catalysts exhibited three distinct diffraction peaks, indicative of nickel aluminate phase (solid lines in Fig. 1). A close examination of diffraction peaks revealed that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 1) shifted to a lower diffraction angle with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio, representing lattice expansion of γ-Al2O3 caused by the incorporation of Ni2+ ions [36,37]. In order to verify the lattice expansion in the XNiAE catalysts, lattice parameters of bare alumina aerogel and XNiAE catalysts were calculated as listed in Table 2 . The lattice parameter of XNiAE catalysts was larger than that of bare alumina aerogel (0.795). Furthermore, the lattice parameter of XNiAE catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. This is because Ni2+ ions might intimately exist in the cationic deficient sites of γ-Al2O3, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate phase in all the XNiAE catalysts, in good agreement with the previous results [38,39]. The above result indicates that nickel species were finely dispersed in the XNiAE catalysts through the formation of surface nickel aluminate phase derived from Ni–O–Al composite structure."
8,Metal-support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.3 Metal-support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the interaction between nickel species and alumina in the XNiAE catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of XNiAE catalysts calcined at 700°C. All the XNiAE catalysts exhibited single reduction band corresponding to the reduction of surface nickel aluminate phase [40,41], in good agreement with XRD data (Fig. 1). It has been reported that surface nickel aluminate phase has an intermediate metal-support interaction between bulk nickel aluminate-support and bulk nickel oxide-support interactions, and has relatively excellent stability due to its aluminate nature [42,43]. The amount of hydrogen consumption of XNiAE catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio, because of the increase of absolute amount of nickel species. When considering the fact that reduction peak temperature generally increases with increasing nickel content in the nickel-based catalysts, it is noteworthy that the reduction peak temperature shifted to a lower temperature with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio in the XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.35) catalysts. During the formation of surface nickel aluminate phase, Ni2+ ions are incorporated into tetrahedral sites or octahedral sites of alumina [44]. Interestingly, it has been reported that Ni2+ ions located in the octahedral sites of alumina (Nioct) are less reducible than those in the tetrahedral sites (Nitet). Therefore, it is believed that Nitet/Nioct ratio in the XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.35) catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio through the formation of more reducible nickel–alumina composite structure. In other words, the interaction between Ni2+ ions and alumina decreased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio up to 0.35 in the XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.35) catalysts. In the 0.4NiAE and 0.45NiAE catalysts, however, the interaction between Ni2+ ions and alumina increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. This might be because Nitet/Nioct ratio decreased when the excess amount of nickel was added into XNiAE catalyst. Fig. 2 clearly showed that reduction peak temperature of XNiAE catalysts exhibited a volcano-shaped trend with respect to Ni/Al atomic ratio. This means that an optimal Ni/Al atomic ratio was required for effective formation of highly reducible surface nickel aluminate phase in the XNiAE catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, 0.35NiAE catalyst exhibited the highest reducibility (the lowest reduction peak temperature)."
9,Crystalline structure of reduced Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.4 Crystalline structure of reduced Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of XNiAE catalysts reduced at 700°C. It is noticeable that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 3) moved back to the original diffraction angle in all the reduced XNiAE catalysts when compared to the diffraction peak in the calcined catalysts (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all the reduced catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 3). This result indicates that surface nickel aluminate phase in all the XNiAE catalysts was completely reduced into metallic nickel during the reduction process employed in this work."
10,"Nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts","3.5 Nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel surface area, nickel dispersion, and average nickel diameter in the reduced XNiAE catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced XNiAE catalysts are listed in Table 3 . The amount of hydrogen uptake on the surface of reduced XNiAE catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. As a consequence, nickel surface area of reduced XNiAE catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. On the other hand, both reduced 0.4NiAE and 0.45NiAE catalysts retained poor nickel dispersion compared to 0.35NiAE catalyst, although nickel dispersion of reduced XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.35) catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. Similarly, average nickel diameter in the reduced XNiAE (X =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.35) catalysts decreased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio, whereas average nickel diameter in the reduced 0.4NiAE and 0.45NiAE catalysts increased with increasing Ni/Al atomic ratio. This means that excess amount of nickel species in both 0.4NiAE and 0.45NiAE catalysts were aggregated during the reduction process, resulting in the formation of large metallic nickel particles with poor dispersion. This was further confirmed by TEM images. No large agglomerates of metallic nickel were found in the reduced 0.35NiAE catalyst (Fig. 4(b)). However, both 0.05NiAE (Fig. 4(a)) and 0.45NiAE catalysts (Fig. 4(c)) retained relatively large aggregates of metallic nickel, representing relatively poor dispersion of metallic nickel in these two catalysts. TEM results were well consistent with hydrogen chemisorption results (Table 3)."
11,Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts,"3.6 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalysts Fig. 5 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen yields with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over 0.05NiAE, 0.35NiAE, and 0.45NiAE catalysts at 600°C. Both 0.35NiAE and 0.45NiAE catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the reaction. XNiAE (X =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) catalysts also exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the reaction, although they are not shown here. It is believed that high surface area, large pore volume, and large average pore size of XNiAE (X =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.45) catalysts played an important role in facilitating internal mass transfer of reactants and products during the reaction. Highly dispersed metallic nickel species reduced from surface nickel aluminate phase in the XNiAE (X =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.45) catalysts was also responsible for stable catalytic performance of the catalysts. However, 0.05NiAE catalyst was gradually deactivated during the reaction. The reason why 0.05NiAE catalyst solely experienced a catalyst deactivation can be understood by the fact that metallic nickel species reduced from nickel aluminate phase in this catalyst with low Ni/Al atomic ratio are vulnerable to re-oxidation into inactive nickel aluminate phase and to carbon deposition during the steam reforming reaction, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity [39]. Fig. 6 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen yields over XNiAE catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG, plotted as a function of Ni/Al atomic ratio. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield showed volcano-shaped curves with respect to Ni/Al atomic ratio, and they were decreased in the order of 0.35NiAE>0.3NiAE>0.2NiAE>0.1NiAE>0.4NiAE>0.45NiAE>0.05NiAE. Among the catalysts tested, 0.35NiAE catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen yield. The highest surface area, the largest pore volume, the largest average pore size, and the highest reducibility of 0.35NiAE catalyst might be partly responsible for its superior catalytic performance. Fig. 7 shows the correlations between average nickel diameter and catalytic performance of XNiAE catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG. It is interesting to note that both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield increased with decreasing average nickel diameter. These correlations clearly showed that average nickel diameter served as an important factor determining the catalytic performance of XNiAE catalysts. Among the catalyst tested, 0.35NiAE catalyst with smallest average nickel diameter showed the best catalytic performance. According to kinetic studies, steam reforming of methane over nickel-based catalysts is related to the various adsorption mechanisms [45,46]. Among various reaction steps, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon species on the surface of active nickel site (Eq. (3)) is known as a rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [45,46]. (3) CH4 + xNi∗ ↔CH x –Ni∗ +(2−0.5x)H2 Therefore, high catalytic performance can be achieved by enhancing the number of active nickel sites on the surface of reduced catalysts. However, carbon deposition reactions (Eqs. (4) and (5)) also competitively occurred on the surface of nickel catalysts during the steam reforming reaction. (4) CH4 ↔C+2H2 (5) 2CO↔C+CO2 Furthermore, carbon deposition reactions require relatively large number of adjacent active nickel sites compared to steam reforming reaction [45]. Consequently, the amount of carbon deposition in the used XNiAE catalysts increased with increasing average nickel diameter, as can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 . Thus, both active nickel surface area and average nickel diameter of nickel-based catalysts affect the catalytic performance in the steam reforming reaction. Fig. 8 shows the TEM images of used 0.05NiAE, 0.35NiAE, and 0.45NiAE catalysts. Compared to reduced 0.05NiAE catalyst (Fig. 4(a)), large agglomerates of nickel particles and widespread carbon tubes were observed in the used 0.05NiAE catalyst (Fig. 8(a)). Relatively large metallic nickel particles in the reduced 0.45NiAE catalysts (Fig. 4(c)) were vulnerable to sintering or aggregation, resulting in the significant nickel sintering during the steam reforming reaction (Fig. 8(c)). On the other hand, no significant morphological change was observed in the 0.35NiAE catalyst before (Fig. 4(b)) and after (Fig. 8(b)) the reaction. This might be because the highest surface area, the largest pore volume, the largest average pore size, and the smallest average nickel size of 0.35NiAE catalyst effectively suppressed the nickel sintering and carbon deposition. In conclusion, an optimal Ni/Al atomic ratio was required for maximum production of hydrogen by steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 aerogel catalyst."
12,Conclusions,"A series of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 (XNiAE) aerogel catalysts with different Ni/Al atomic ratio (X) were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of Ni/Al atomic ratio of mesoporous XNiAE catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity for steam reforming of LNG was investigated.
