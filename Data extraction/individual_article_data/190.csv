0,Introduction,"The increasing interest to the biomass as a source of chemicals and energy has recently arisen due to the limited fossil fuel resources and the demand for new clean chemical processes [1]. The research on the development of alternative liquid transport fuels has considerably increased in recent years influenced by the implementation of legislation and directives on alternative energy. To achieve these aims in an ethical, environmental and economical manner the use of lignocellulosic biomass or agri-waste for the production of second generation biofuels is proposed [2]. Chemicals derived from biomass have recently attracted a considerable interest [3]. The production of biofuels from hemicellulose requires acid hydrolysis to open the biomass structure giving large quantities of xylose [4]. The synthesis of furfural (FF) as a by-product of this biofuel production process has developed an additional important research area [5]. Furfural is one of the key derivatives which can be obtained from renewable biomass for the production of different important fine chemicals [6]. Selective hydrogenation of furfural has attracted much attention to the production of furfuryl alcohol (FA), methyl furan, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and others (Fig. 1 ). Furfuryl alcohol is widely used in chemical industry, mainly for the production of special resins, polymers and coatings on their basis, which are resistant to acids, alkalies and various solvents. In addition, furfuryl alcohol is employed as a diluent for epoxy resins and as a solvent for phenol formaldehyde resins and poorly soluble pigments. In the organic synthesis, furfuryl alcohol is a feedstock for the production of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and 2,3-dihydropyran and an intermediate in the synthesis of lysine, vitamin C, various lubricants and plasticizers [7,8]. There are two ways of producing furfuryl alcohol: through hydrogenation of furfural, gas phase hydrogenation and liquid phase hydrogenation [9]. In industry, furfuryl alcohol is obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of furfural in a liquid or vapor phase [10]. The liquid-phase process is carried out with copper chromite systems as the catalysts. The main disadvantage of copper-chromite catalysts is their toxicity caused by the presence of chromium oxides, which allows considering such catalysts as environmental pollutants [2]. In the case of liquid-phase hydrogenation, the reaction conditions are milder and it is possible to use both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts based on mono- (Pd [11,12], Pt [13], Ru [14], Ni [15], Cu [16]) and bimetals (Pd-Ni [17,18], Pd-Ir, Pd-Ru [19], Pt- Sn [20]). Depending on the process conditions, namely the type of the catalyst and the nature of the solvent, furfural hydrogenation proceeds in various directions and with the formation of a large number of products. Thus, for example, Yu et al. in the case of hydrogenation of furfural in the aqueous phase in the presence of Co/TiO2 noted the formation of such by-products as pentadioles, pentanols, hydroxycyclopentanone, etc [21]. When using alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol), etherification and acetalization products may be formed such as isopropyl-furfuryl ether, 2-furaldehyde diisopropyl acetal [2], 2-furaldehyde dimethyl acetal [22], 2-furaldehyde diethyl acetal [23–27]. By varying the conditions of furfural hydrogenation (pressure, temperature, etc.), it is possible to regulate the selectivity to one or another product. In our previous work we reported the results of hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol with novel Pt-and Pd-containing magnetite nanoparticles stabilized by polyphenylquinoxaline and hyperbranched pyridylphenylene polymer [28]. In this paper, we want to demonstrate the use of hypercrosslinked polystyrene (HPS) as a stabilizer. HPS is the class of cross-linked polymers is characterized by the unique topology and unusual properties. HPS consists of nanosized rigid micro- and meso-cavities. This material can act as a nanostructured matrix, which governs the particles growth [29]. The nanoparticles of catalytically active metals such as Ru, Pt, Pd were successfully stabilized in the pores of the HPS matrix and showed high catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation reactions [30,31]. In addition, HPS is commercially available and produced on an industrial scale (PUROLATE International Ltd). This research is devoted to the development of the catalytic system (namely, the choice of precursor) and to the determination of furfural hydrogenetion conditions for achieving maximum selectivity to furfuryl alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials As the support of the palladium catalyst, the hypercrosslinked polystyrene (HPS) of Macronet MN 270/3860 type 2/100 (designation HPS) was purchased from Purolite Int., (U.K.) and purified by rinsing with water and drying in vacuum. Bis(acetonitrile)palladium(II)chloride (PdCl2(CH3CN)2, >99%), Pd acetate (Pd(CH3COO)2 >98%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Furfural (99%), furfuryl alcohol (98%), and i-propanol (≥99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts Series of Pd-containing HPS-based catalysts was synthesized via wet-impregnation method according to the procedure described elsewhere [31]. In a typical experiment, 1 g of pretreated, dried and crushed (<60 μm) granules of HPS were impregnated with 2.8 mL of the THF solution of precursor (PdCl2(CH3CN)2 or Pd(CH3COO)2) of a certain concentration. The Pd-containing polymer was dried at 70 °C, treated with 2.7 mL of Na2CO3 solution (concentration 0.07 mol/L) and dried until the constant weight was achieved. After that the catalyst was washed with distilled water till neutral pH and dried at 70 °C. Besides, for all the synthesized catalysts preliminarily reduction in hydrogen flow at 275 °C for 2 h was carried out (the catalysts were designated as 1%, 3%, 5%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) and 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2)). For the successful synthesis of Pd catalysts on the basis of the HPS, its thermal stability was studied by the TG analysis. As it is shown in Fig. 2 . The intensive, multi-stage (probably, resulting from the break of the methylene cross links) destruction of HPS (MN 270) starts at a temperature of about 450 °C (TG line). At this temperature the polymer weight loss rate is maximum –10%/min (DTG line). The resulting weight loss was approximately 55%. These facts prove the possibility of the reduction of the catalyst on the basis of HPS (MN 270) with the gaseous hydrogen at a temperature 300 °C. Thus the following catalysts were synthesized (see Table 1 , palladium content was confirmed by the elemental analysis):"
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing Hydrogenation of furfural was carried out in a steel batch reactor of the Series 5000 Multiple Reactor System (Parr Instruments). The catalyst, furfural and propanol-2 were introduced into the reactor. The reactor was purged with nitrogen. After the reactor was heated to operating temperature, hydrogen was supplied. The hydrogenation process was carried out with continuous stirring (mixing rate 1000 rpm). During the reaction, samples of the reaction medium were taken for the analysis. The time of one experiment was 240 min. In a typical experiment, 0.1 g of the Pd catalyst was dispersed in 24 mL of the i-propanol and activated by the reduction in a hydrogen flow for 30 min at the reaction temperature (120 °C) and pressure (6.0 MPa) under stirring (1000 rpm). After that the reactor was charged with 2 mL of FF and another 24 mL of solvent. The probes of the reaction mixture were periodically taken and analyzed with GC–MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S) equipped with a capillary column HP-1MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a pressure of 74.8 kPa and linear velocity of 36.3 cm/s. The oven temperature was programmed: 120 °C (0 min) → 10 °C/min (160 °C) → 25 °C/min (300 °C) → 300 °C (2.4 min). The temperature of the injector, interface and ion source was 260 °C, in the range from 10 up to 500 m/z. The concentrations of the reaction mixture components were calculated using the internal standard calibration method. Furfural (starting substrate) and the products of the main and intermediate reactions - furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol were identified. Furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol selectivity were calculated using the formulas: Conversion , % = n F F 0 − n F F S n F F 0 × 100 % , Selectivity , % = n F A n F F 0 − n F F s × 100 % , where n° FF - initial moles of furfural, ns FF - moles of furfural in sample, nFA - moles of furfuryl alcohol"
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption was carried out with the surface analyzer Beckman Coulter SA 3100 to determine specific surface areas and porosity of the catalysts and the initial HPS samples. Before the analysis the samples were degassed at 120 °C in vacuum for 1 h using the device for the preliminary preparation of the samples (Coulter Corporation, USA). X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) was performed to determine the palladium content of the catalysts under study. VRA-30 spectrometer from “Zeiss Jena” with a molybdenum anode was used, the crystal analyzer was a LiF and SZ detector. The samples (for the analysis and comparison) were prepared by mixing 1 g of polystyrene with 10–20 mg of the substance. The measurement time (analysis) is 10 s. Electron-transparent specimens for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by placing a drop of a sample suspension onto a carbon-coated Cu grid. The images were acquired at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV on a JEOL JEM1010 the transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) radiation with ES-2403 spectrometer (Institute for Analytic Instrumentation of RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia) equipped with energy analyzer PHOIBOS 100-MCD5 (SPECS, Germany) and X-Ray source XR-50 (SPECS, Germany). All the data were acquired at X-ray power of 250 W. Survey spectra were recorded at an energy step of 0.5 eV with an analyzer pass energy 40 eV, and high resolution spectra were recorded at an energy step of 0.05 eV with an analyzer pass energy 7 eV. The samples were allowed to outgas for 180 min before the analysis and were stable during the examination. The data analysis was performed by XPSPeak. The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was conducted with the S3 MICRO (HECUS) small angle diffractometer (Cu Kα, 50 W) with a point collimation of primary beam. It was used for measuring scattering patterns of all the samples. The scattering vector magnitude q = 4π*sin(θ)/λ (where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.541 Å is the radiation wavelength) was used as the scattering coordinate. The scattering intensity was measured in the range of the scattering vector magnitudes 0.01 < q < 0.6 Å−1. For selective extraction of the scattering signal for dispersed Pd nanoparticles from the total scattering sample we used an original technique based on masking liquid impregnation. A detailed description of the technique was reported in articles [32]. A sample in the capillary was filled with a special liquid having the same density as polystyrene support. The residual scattering signal from such a sample corresponds to supported palladium nanoparticles, because it has higher density and cannot be contrasted by this liquid. A mixture of perfluorobenzene with heptane in a proportion providing the desired density served as a masking liquid. The processing of the experimental data and calculation of the particle size distributions were based on the GNOM program from the ATSAS package [33]. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sample of HPS (MN 270) was done using thermogravimetric analyzer TG 209 IRIS, equipped with differential scanning calorimeter DSC 204 PHOENIX (NETZSCH, Germany). The sample analysis was performed under inert argon atmosphere. Atomic adsorption spectrometry (AAS) to determine Pd content in the liquid phase after the catalytic reaction was carried out with MGA-915 (Lumex, Russia), equipped with hollow cathode lamp for Pd (244.8 nm)."
6,Results and discussion,"In order to understand the influence of the Pd precursor nature on nanoparticles formation in HPS, we used two commercially available Pd compounds, PdCl2(CH3CN)2 and Pd(CH3COO)2. These Pd(II) compounds have different polarity which can be quantified using dielectric constants of ligands. The dielectric constants of acetonitrile and acetate are 36.64 and 6.2, respectively [34]. In our earlier article [35] it was shown that HPS is extremely hydrophobic but, due to unusual porosity and high cross-linking density, it can accommodate even quite polar compounds. We believe the behavior of any compound incorporated into a porous matrix depends on its ability either to spread along the pore walls, when both the matrix and the metal compound have similar properties, or to be repelled by the pore walls (when both are especially dissimilar). This leads to the formation of particles of different sizes and with different locations depending on the metal compound properties. Therefore, metal compounds behavior in HPS depends on the hydrophobicity–hydrophilicity balance between the metal compound and HPS [35]. The results of low-temperature nitrogen physisorption of the initial HPS samples and the catalysts are shown in Table 2 . The specific surface of HPS after the impregnation with Pd precursors decreased indicating that the blockage of pores took place after the incorporation of Pd compound. It should be noted that the volume of mesopores decreased, while the volume of micropores practically did not change. These data show the formation of palladium nanoparticles in mesopores. The obtained BET results are in agreement with the data on the particles size, and actually Pd nanoparticles are formed in mesopores, not in micropores. Fig. 3 shows TEM images the 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) (Fig. 3(a)) and 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) (Fig. 3(b)). The data show that for 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) catalyst Pd nanoparticles form monomodal distribution with mean diameter 5.4 ± 1.2 nm. With the use of more hydrophobic precursor (Pd(CH3COO)2), the formation of larger aggregates is also observed. From the data presented in Fig. 3(b) it can be also seen that the sample 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) has multimodal particle size distribution with the mean particle sizes up to 13.8 ± 5.4 nm. This observation is consistent with the data presented earlier that showed that the nature of the precursor affects the formation of Pd nanoparticles [35]. The Pd-catalysts prepared have also been studied by SAXS. Fig. 4 shows SAXS curves for 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) and 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) after the impregnation of masking liquids. The application spherical form-factor for modeling SAXS curves gets a good fit quality. In the case of 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) Pd particles form monomodal distribution with the average size 7.5 nm. In the case of 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) SAXS data indicate the presence of two particle fractions: the major small particles (≈7 nm) fraction and a minor amount of larger particles (˜10–35 nm). In general these results agree with TEM data. The particle size which is determined by SAXS corresponds to volume weighted size, whereas particle size by TEM is number weighted size respectively. For any polydispersed distribution the value of volume weighted size is more than the value of number weighted size. The XPS spectrum of 3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2) is deconvoluted into two components: with Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.2 eV and 337.2 eV which we assign to Pd° (32%) and Pd2+ (68%) respectively (Fig. 5 ). In the case of 3%-Pd/HPS(Pd(CH3COO)2) Pd 3d spectrum is also deconvoluted into two components: with Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.2 eV (40%) and 336.7 eV (60%) which we also assign to Pd° and Pd2+ respectively (Fig. 5). The typical values of Pd 3d5/2 binding energy for Pd° state is about 335.0–335.4 eV and the range of 336–337 eV corresponds to PdO [36,37]. As the samples were kept on air before XPS study some part of metal Pd is present in oxide form. The ratio of oxide form/metal form is higher in more disperse sample because small particles is easy oxidized comparing to large particles. This value could be used to rough estimate of the ratio between small and large particles in series of such samples. Also it could be concluded that the nature of Pd precursor in HPS matrix practically does not influence the Pd oxidation state. The catalytic properties of the samples of 3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2) and 3%-Pd/HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) were studied in the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Optimal conditions of furfural hydrogenation have been determined in our early works [28]: a temperature of 120 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 6.0 MPa. Propanol-2 was used as a solvent. The results of catalytic testing of both Pd catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . The dependence of the conversion of furfural on time for the prepared palladium catalysts is shown in Fig. 6(a). The high conversion of furfural (55.6%) over the observed reaction period was achieved in the presence of an 3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2) catalyst, a lower value (36.3%) was obtained on a 3%-Pd/HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) catalyst. It should be noted that the selectivity to furfural alcohol for the catalyst with Pd(CH3COO)2 precursor was less (83.8%) in comparison with the catalyst with PdCl2(CH3CN)2 precursor (87.4%) (Fig. 6(b)). The comparison of the catalytic activities of the Pd-containing catalysts showed that more disperse sample of palladium (3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2)) showed higher values of FF conversion and selectivity to FA because of small particles. Such change of the catalytic activity is probably by size effect of Pd particles. Table 3 presents the results of comparison of different Pd catalysts in selective hydrogenation of FF to FA. The variation of palladium content from 1 to 5% (#1-3), when using the precursor PdCl2(CH3CN)2, showed that catalyst 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) is optimal. With a decrease in the Pd content (#2), the conversion of FF decreases from 55.6% to 25.4% and the selectivity slightly changes. When the content of Pd was increased up to 5%, (#3) the conversion of FF increases to 70.5%, while the selectivity of FA falls by 20% and THFA appears in products in significant quantities. After 200 min of the reaction, FA selectivity for both catalysts reached its maximum (87.4% for 3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2) catalyst 83.8% for 3%-Pd/HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) catalyst in FF conversion 55.6% and 36.3% accordingly) (# 1 and #4). By increasing the reaction time up to 450 min, FA selectivity decreased to 65.4% and THFA selectivity increased up to 20.8%. FF conversion was almost complete (# 1 and #5). In our previous work we reported the results of hydrogenation of FF to FA with 0.3% Pd/PPP/Fe3O4 (#6) where Pd nanoparticles were stabilized by hyperbranched pyridylphenylene polymer [28]. This catalyst is characterized by a monomodal distribution of Pd nanoparticles with an mean diameter of 3 nm and shows high activity and selectivity in FF hydrogenation (98.8 and 98.1% respectively). But this catalyst (0.3% Pd/PPP/Fe3O4) concedes to the 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) catalyst the value of TOF (14.5 and 128 h−1 accordingly). Bhogeswararao and co-authors investigated Pd catalysts on alumina in FF hydrogenation [12]. The highest conversion of FF (only 79.5%) was achieved for 5% Pd/Al2O3, but FA was not obtained in this case (#8). FA selectivity of 44.3% was obtained for 2% Pd/Al2O3 at FF conversion of 22.1%. The TOF values for alumina based Pd catalysts were insignificant in comparison with catalyst 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) (# 7–9 and #1). Pd catalysts (5% Pd/C and 5% Pd/TiO2-ZrO2) in FF hydrogenation were investigated in the work of Chen and co-authors [18]. These catalysts showed high value of FF conversion (98.5%), and selectivity for THFA (79.8%), while FA is formed in small amounts (#10–11). For the more complete understanding, we have compared the catalyst obtained with the common hydrogenation catalyst 5% Pd/C (Sigma-Aldrich production) (#12). This Pd catalyst showed a high conversion of FF (82.4%), but low selectivity to FA (28.2%), although THFA is formed in a significant quantity (63.5%). It should be noted that the values of TOF for 5% Pd/C are approximately the same as for 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) (# 12 and #1). This comparison shows that the selectivity in the process of FF hydrogenation may be different, depending on both the process conditions and the nature of the catalyst. In our work, we used hypercrosslinked matrix of HPS for the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Palladium precursors of different polarity were used and the formation of Pd nanoparticles in the hydrophobic HPS matrix was different (#1 and 4). The most effective selective hydrogenation of furfural to alcohol was observed in the presence of more disperse sample because of small particles of palladium (3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2)). In order to evaluate the catalyst (3%-Pd/HPS(PdCl2(CH3CN)2)) stability in the repeated use, seven successive experiments of the FF hydrogenation were carried out in the optimal conditions discussed above. Fig. 7 shows that 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2) is stable, FF conversion and selectivity on FA practically does not change after seven catalytic cycles. The analysis of the liquid phase after FF hydrogenetion by AAS showed no Pd leaching."
7,Conclusions,Pd-containing nanoparticles stabilized by HPS have been synthesized with different precursor and studied as catalysts in the FF hydrogenation to FA. The formation of palladium nanoparticles depends on the nature of the precursor. TEM and SAXS showed a monomodal distribution of particles size with mean diameter 5.4 ± 1.2 nm for 3%-Pd/HPS (PdCl2(CH3CN)2). In the case of 3%-Pd/ HPS (Pd(CH3COO)2) the data indicate the presence of two particle fractions: the major small particles (≈7 nm) fraction and the minor amount of larger particles (˜10-35 nm). The data of XPS confirm zero-valent character and the oxide form of Pd nanoparticles when using both precursors. The comparison of the catalytic activities of the Pd-containing catalysts showed that the more disperse sample showed higher values of FF conversion and selectivity to FA because of small particles of palladium.
