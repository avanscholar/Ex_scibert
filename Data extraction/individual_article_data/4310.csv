0,Introduction,"These days, some of the most promising alternative processes for biodiesel production are still unprofitable or economically improvable because of their limitations such as long reaction time, difficulties in the separation steps, unaffordable amounts of solvents and many more. One of these cases is the Jojoba oil methanolysis and ulterior jojobyl alcohols synthesis through a two-step crystallization separation, where biodiesel is the co-product as it can be seen in Fig. 1 . This entire process was designated as Jojoba oil biorefinery and it was designed and studied by Sánchez et al. [1–4] where high-added value monounsaturated alcohols were obtained as main product and biodiesel as co-product after transesterification reaction and crystallization separation. Jojoba oil is usually obtained by cool pressing and consecutive solvent extraction of Jojoba seed [5], which can be found in a perennial shrub under extreme weather conditions [6]. The countries which have the highest production of this oil are the United States, Israel, Mexico and South Africa because of the suitable soil for the Jojoba cultivation. The whole seed is not completely extractable and only 55% of the jojoba seed can be obtained in oil form [6,7] when cool pressing and solvent extraction are combined. Regarding the oil, it is important to clarify that its composition is completely different from the rest of vegetable oils because is formed by long chains of esters instead of glycerides [6]. The peculiar molecular composition of this oil confers special properties that are valuable for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries [8]. That is the reason why Jojoba oil production will probably increase in order to satisfy the current market demand. Jojobyl alcohols and monounsaturated alcohols represent a group of chemicals with an associated high-added value because of its numerous applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics or surfactants [9]. In addition, it has been proved that alcohols with a carbon-chain between 14 and 20 and a number of unsaturations between 1 and 4 are antiproliferatives and can fight against enveloped viruses [10]. Therefore, the cost of this alcohols is one of the limitations of its use because 1g of this pure alcohols can reach 55$ in the market nowadays (Nucheck Prep). The co-product in the Jojoba oil methanolysis is the fatty acid methyl esters, or biodiesel, which can be used to increase the profitability of the process [2,3]. Biodiesel is defined by the ASTM as “long-chain monoalkyl esters derived from vegetable oils or animal fats” and among its many advantages are the reduction of CO2 global emissions, it is renewable, and it reduces the dependency from fossil fuels [11]. This biofuel has experienced a huge controversy related to the possibility that many crops are being used for energy intentions instead of food purposes [12] and that caused the controversy named “fuel vs food” [13]. Because of this scenario, non-edible oils, such as Jojoba and Jatropha oils, and biofuels derived from algae have been investigated by many researchers in order to clear up the biodiesel situation [14,15]. Biodiesel is usually obtained through transesterification reaction using homogeneous, heterogeneous or enzymatic catalysts. In the case of Jojoba oil, the most interesting type of catalysts are heterogeneous. In the case of homogeneous catalyst, several difficulties arrived due to the washing and purifying steps required [1,2]. Among all the heterogeneous catalysts used for conducting the transesterification reaction, CaO has received many attention because its activity, it can be recycled and its low-cost [1,16–20]. Moreover, CaO can be obtained from natural sources such as mussel or egg shells through calcination process resulting in a green, renewable catalyst. The most important drawback in the use of CaO for the transesterification is its rapid poisoning by CO2 and H2O from the air and it must be used immediately after calcination step for avoiding the loss of catalytic activity [1]. In this paper, the main objective was to reduce the reaction time of the methanolysis of Jojoba oil using a pressurized atmosphere with a Parr reactor. In a previous study [1], the reaction time for this process was set in 10h at atmospheric pressure with an associated oil conversion of 93.9%, which does not permit to have a biofuel which fulfill the minimum requirements marked by the European Legislation after the crystallization separation. However, the use of a pressurized atmosphere under slightly more severe reaction conditions allows to increase the Jojoba oil conversion (96.3%) and to reduce up to half the reaction time of the methanolysis. Also, the study includes the optimization of the process using a full central composite design were the maximum oil conversion is reached at 140°C, methanol:Jojoba oil ratio of 6 and 6% of catalyst percent where the study determines that the oil conversion reaches 98% after 5h of reaction time. Finally, the kinetic model has been determined for this process and it fits the 15 experiments adequately. It is very important to clarify that, all the equations are only valid within the range of the variables."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Jojoba oil was purchased from Jojoba Israel (Kibbutz Hatzerim, Israel). The oil has been already characterized according to AOCS official method and UCM method as reported elsewhere [1]. Certified methanol of 99.8% purity and GC standards were supplied by Sigma Aldrich. The catalyst was obtained by the calcination of mussel shells (Mytilus galloprovincialis species) from local market as detailed elsewhere [1,18]. The catalyst preparation has been already detailed and published elsewhere [1]."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Experiments were performed in a 600cm3 pressurized Parr reactor, where 110cm3 of Jojoba oil were poured into the reacting vessel. The diameter of the blade used was 4.5cm and the reactor was equipped with a two-blade system. The reaction temperature was achieved using an electric mantle and the reaction temperature was controlled by Haake GH Fisons (Germany) bath whereas the heat created by the agitation system was stabilized by Thermomix 1420 (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) bath. Experiments have been conducted following these steps: Jojoba oil, the methanol and the catalyst were added to the reactor and then the vessel was hermetic sealed. When the set temperature was reached a sample was taken out, and just at that moment the reaction time was considered zero. During the experiments the pressurized environment and impeller speed were maintained constant. When the reaction was finished the product went through a filtration process and the catalyst was recovered. Finally, the samples were purified using a Buchi Rota vapor R3 (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Switzerland) for eliminating the surplus of methanol and were analyzed by gas chromatography."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME), Jojoba oil and jojobyl alcohols were monitored using a Bruker scion 436 chromatograph equipped with an autosampler CP-8400, a flame ionization detector (FID) using a 5-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane capillary column. The column used was supplied by Agilent technologies and more specifically is DB-5HT column with 15m of length, 0.32m of diameter, 0.10μm of thickness of the film. The injection system was split-splitless and the carrier gas was hydrogen at a flow of 1ml/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 320 and 350°C, respectively. The initial temperature in the oven was set at 80°C with a temperature program of 10°C/min until a final temperature of 360°C. The analysis of the standards and the reaction products were prepared dissolving the samples in pyridine and 1μl was injected into the GC equipment. The procedure used to characterize the samples was the internal standard. Tetradecane was used as internal standard. The transesterified jojoba is composed by approximately 28% of methanol and 35% of jojobyl alcohols and 35% of biodiesel. The jojobyl alcohols contained in the jojoba transesterified are 11-eicosenol (C20H40O), 13-docosenol (C22H44O) and 15-tetracosenol (C24H48O) and the esters found in this product are mainly methyl oleate (C19H36O2), methyl eicosanoate (C21H40O2), methyl docosanoate (C23H46O2), and methyl tetracosanoate (C25H50O2)."
5,Statistical treatment,"2.4 Statistical treatment 2.4.1 Central Composite Design (CCD) This methodology, originally created by Box and Wilson [21], allows to determine the influences of the different variables and its interactions in order to perform the optimization of a specific process. The proper way to conduct this technique implies the appropriate selection of responses, factors and levels [22]. In this case, the design of experiments involved three factors and two levels (full 23) and the selected response is the Jojoba oil conversion whereas the factors are the reaction temperature (XT), the methanol:oil ratio (XR) and the catalyst percent (XC). The factors have been selected according previous studies where the temperature, methanol:oil ratio and catalyst percent were the most significant variables in the transesterification reaction. Regarding the values chosen for the levels, these have been selected based on the stability of the catalyst and a previous study [1]. The maximum temperature and pressure that the catalyst is able to handle without crumbling in the middle of the reaction is 160°C and 15 bars as it was tested in the laboratory. These tests were conducted at the same way as the rest of experiments. The methanol:oil ratio and the catalyst percent values were slightly reduced regarding other studies [1,22,23] trying to make a more economically competitive process. 2.4.2 Kinetic modeling The kinetic parameters have been determined using the Marquardt algorithm for solving a multiparametric non-linear regression. This task was conducted using the software Aspen Custom Modeler® (Version 8.8, Aspen Technology INC, USA)."
6,Results,"As mentioned before, the study of the enhancement of the Jojoba oil methanolysis using a Parr reactor is divided in two different stages. First of all, a central composite design was applied in order to establish the influences of the temperature, the methanol:oil ratio and the catalyst content in the transesterification and to optimize the process. Once the process was optimized, the second stage corresponded to the determination of the kinetic parameters and the differences between the methanolysis of Jojoba oil using CaO at atmospheric pressure and when the transesterification reactor is pressurized."
7,Design of experiments (DOE),"3.1 Design of experiments (DOE) The design of experiments for the methanolysis of Jojoba oil using a Parr reactor was conducted keeping fixed the reaction time at 5h and the stirring speed at 400rpm. The design of experiments studied for this process is a full 23 factorial design, which is divided in three different stages: linear stage consisted of 8 experiments using linear levels (−1,1), six center points to measure the accuracy of the study and the non-linear stage which involved 6 star points. The selected factors and its associated levels are charted in Table 1 , where ± α is the codification for the star points and α represents the distance between the origin and the star point and in this case has the fixed value of 1.68179 ( α = 2 n 4 where n=3). 3.1.1 Linear stage The first step in the design of experiments is to evaluate the influences of the factors over the process and; for this purpose, it is necessary to use the eight linear stage experiments and the six central points. Coded factors and natural factors together with the oil conversion results related to each experiment are charted in Table 2 , where experiments were performed randomly. The main effects and its interactions are calculated using the coded factor levels and their associated responses, and using the tstudent (fixed at 95% confidence level and with these amount of central points) and the standard deviation, the confidence interval was determined (Table 3 ). On one hand, the factors which have high positive impact in the process are the temperature and the methanol:oil ratio because their influences are substantially higher than the confidence interval. On the other hand, the catalyst percent has a significant negative impact but much less pronounced than the other two factors. Since the curvature is much higher than the confidence curvature interval the equations used for the final optimization process and the response surface are the ones associated to the non-linear stage. Finally, using the coded and natural levels for the factors, the statistical and industrial linear models for the methanolysis of Jojoba oil can be seen in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) Oil Conversion ( % ) = 81.15 + 9.87 X T + 10.10 X R - 1.45 X C - 5.27 XTR - 3.12 X TC + 4.85 X RC ( r = 0.99 ) (2) Oil Conversion ( % ) = - 125.2 + 1.88 T + 13.60 R + 0.16 C - 0.13 TR - 0.08 TC + 1.21 RC ( r = 0.99 ) 3.1.2 Non-linear stage As aforementioned, the curvature has a higher value than the confidence curvature interval and the star points ( ± α ), which are charted in Table 2, must be also considered into the factorial design in order to find a quadratic model that fits the experimental data adequately. The statistical and industrial quadratic models have been obtained thanks to the Statgraphics XV Centurion (Statpoint technologies, Inc., USA) and they are found as Eqs. (3) and (4) respectively. In addition, since the design has three significant factors, there are three different response surfaces depending on what variable is kept constant throughout the statistical analysis. The three response surfaces associated to Eq. (3) keeping fixed the catalyst percent, methanol:oil ratio and temperature are represented in Figs. 2–4 , respectively. These three response surfaces represent the optimization of the methanolysis of Jojoba oil within the experimental range proposed for this study. It can be concluded, according to the information derived from the response surfaces, that the maximum oil conversion is obtained at high temperatures and methanol:oil ratios and moderate catalyst percentages where Jojoba oil conversion can reach values higher than 98% after 5h of reaction time. Therefore, there are mass transfer limitations at low temperatures and methanol:oil ratios and high catalyst percent probably because the contact of the phases is not well enough as in the more favorable reactions, like in the case studied at atmospheric pressure. The reduction of the reaction time supposes a great advance in terms of biodiesel purity regarding the methanolysis conducted at atmospheric pressure. The quadratic model fits accurately the methanolysis of Jojoba oil with the experimental range studied and the quadratic fitting presents no tendency as seen in the distribution of the residuals in Fig. 5 . (3) Conversion ( % ) = 89.91 + 6.65 X T + 7.48 X R + 0.56 X C - 1.72 X T 2 - 5.23 X TR - 3.05 X TC - 2.69 X R 2 + 4 , 825 X RC - 2.22 X C 2 ( r = 0.91 ) (4) Conversion ( % ) = - 211.96 + 2 , 0.9 T + 21.86 R + 7.91 C - 0.0045 T 2 - 0.13 TR - 0.078 TC - 0.68 R 2 + 1.22 RC - 0.56 C 2 ( r = 0.91 ) From the different response surfaces and the Eq. (3), it can be concluded that the jojoba oil conversion could be higher than 98% at 140°C, methanol:jojoba oil ration of 6 and catalyst percent of 6%. However, the design of experiments is a statistical tool and it does not give enough information about the kinetic mechanism and that is why, the kinetic study has been also performed."
8,Discussion about the influences of the factors and its interactions on the Jojoba oil methanolysis,"3.2 Discussion about the influences of the factors and its interactions on the Jojoba oil methanolysis In this section, the influences of the proposed factors (temperature, methanol:oil ratio and catalyst percent) and its interactions are analyzed. The statistical data from the linear and quadratic fitting will be used for this purpose. 3.2.1 Influence of the temperature In the case of the reaction temperature the experimental range studied goes from 86 to 154°C and it has a high positive effect on the methanolysis of the Jojoba oil using a Parr reactor. This variable is significant according to the design of the experiments aforementioned. The temperature is a variable that has been thoroughly studied in the transesterification using many different raw materials [24–27] and it usually has a positive effect on the methanolysis, although this depends on the type of catalyst and the experimental range studied. Therefore, without taking into account the influence of the interactions on the reaction, the higher the reaction temperature is the better for the performance of the process. 3.2.2 Influence of the methanol:oil ratio For the methanol:oil ratio the experimental range proposed is from 3.6 to 10.4 and it is a significant variable with the highest positive impact on the process according to the design of experiments. Likewise the temperature, this variable has been reported by many researchers [18,22,28–30] because of its high influence on the transesterification of vegetable oils. The inclusion of more methanol in the reaction displaces the methanolysis towards the production of more jojobyl alcohols and biodiesel, therefore the highest oil conversions are reached at high levels of methanol:oil ratios. However, the economy of the process limits the amount of the methanol for improving the profitability of the biorefinery. 3.2.3 Influence of the catalyst percent In the case of the catalyst percentage the experimental range proposed goes from 2.6 to 9.4% and although it has significance on the methanolysis it has the lowest impact on the process. This variable has a slight negative influence on the transesterification because of mass transfer limitations [1,22] and the possibility of soaps formation by secondary reactions [24] contribute negatively to the process at certain points. The optimal catalyst percentage is at 6% where these two contributions are minimized and do not have considerable influence on the process within the experimental range studied. 3.2.4 Influence of the interactions Firstly, all the binary interactions (TR, TC, RC) have significance and high impact over the process whereas the ternary interaction is not significant within the experimental range according to the design of experiments previously described. Secondly, the TR and TC interactions have a negative impact on the methanolysis of Jojoba oil and the RC interaction has a positive effect on the process. The interaction which has the highest influence on the reaction is the interaction TR, although all the interactions are highly significant because of the contributions of secondary reactions and the mass transfer limitations at the limits of the factors fixed on the transesterification reaction."
9,Kinetics modeling,"3.3 Kinetics modeling The previous described full design of experiments is a way to optimize the methanolysis of Jojoba oil using a Parr reactor but it does not describe well enough the mass transfer limitations and the contributions of secondary reactions, especially at high levels of methanol:oil ratio and catalyst percent. Therefore, an additional study related to the kinetic modeling of the reaction was also conducted. Different samples from all the experiments performed in the design of experiments (Table 2) were taken out each 60min until the final time established at 300min. As well as in the previous study published elsewhere [1], the reaction suffers mass transfer limitations contribution at the beginning and at the end of the process but much less severe than when the transesterification is conducted at atmospheric pressure. The explanation of this phenomenon could be that the pressurized environment increases the contact among the jojoba oil, the methanol and the solid phase throughout the transesterification, reducing the mass transfer limitations. Therefore, the reaction mechanism studied here is the same as the one proposed in the study performed without incrementing the reaction pressure, and this mechanism is derived from Lukic et al. 2013 [31] where all the assumptions considered are reported elsewhere [1]. Logically, all the kinetic constants differed from the previous study at atmospheric pressure because the reaction reaches the equilibrium much sooner as consequence of high temperatures and pressures in the middle of the reaction. The kinetic equation proposed, that is in agreement with the previous commented study [1], with its constants detailed in Eqs. (5)–(7) is: (5) dx A dt = k · ( K mt , A ) 0 · 1 + α x A β k + ( K mt , A ) 0 · 1 + α x A β · ( 1 - x A ) (6) k = k ∞ · e ( - E a / RT ) (7) ( K mt , A ) 0 = A · g cat a · C M , 0 b · T c where xA : Jojoba oil conversion, k: Kinetic constant (min−1), k ∞ : Preexponential factor (min−1), Ea : Activation Energy (cal/mol), T: Temperature (K), gcat: grams of catalyst poured into the reactor (g), CM,0 : Initial concentration of methanol (mol/l), ( K mt , A ) 0 : Volumetric mass transfer coefficient (min−1), α , β , a , b , c : Fitting parameters. For the previous kinetics model, the experiments that were used for the fitting were the linear stage experiments, the average of the center points and the star stage experiments (Table 2), which makes 15 experiments in total is detailed in Eq. (8): (8) dx A dt = 28.96 · e ( - 3063 / RT ) · 3.5 · 10 - 16 · g cat 0.06 · C M , 0 2.13 · T 4.14 1 - 0.92 · x A 6.26 28.96 · e ( - 3063 / RT ) + 3.5 · 10 - 16 · g cat 0.06 · C M , 0 2.13 · T 4.14 1 - 0.92 · x A 6.26 · ( 1 - x A ) In this case, the parameters a, b and c seen in Eq. (7) are higher than in the atmospheric pressure scenario, but however, the global volumetric mass transfer coefficient is lower because of the improved contact among the reagents. Therefore, the methanolysis of jojoba oil using CaO as catalyst occurs in the same way using an atmospheric or pressurized environment, what affects the speed of the reaction is the reduction of mass transfer limitations in the second case. This kinetic modeling fits adequately all 15 experiments according to the sum of weighted errors and the model selection criteria, which are 0.83 and 5.26, respectively. The first-order sigmoidal reaction mechanism seems to adjust accurately the proposed experiments as seems in Figs. 6 and 7 . The experiments chosen (1, 4, 19, 22) are selected to show the good correlation of the kinetic model are presented in Figs. 6 and 7, were selected in order to avoid overlapping between experimental points and predict curves."
10,Conclusions,"The methanolysis of Jojoba oil using CaO as heterogeneous catalyst has been significantly improved through the use of a pressurized reactor. The use of a pressurized atmosphere reduces the reaction time from 10 to 5h with an appreciable increase of the Jojoba oil conversion. This could permit the fulfillment of the UNE EN 14214 requirements of the methyl esters obtained after its separation from the jojobyl alcohols. The variables used in this study have been the reaction temperature, the methanol:oil ratio and the catalyst percent. According to the full design of experiments conducted, the variables which have the highest impact over the process are the temperature and the methanol:oil ratio, and they have a positive impact on the methanolysis of Jojoba oil. Nevertheless, the catalyst content has a negative influence on the process but its impact is considerably reduced with respect to the other two factors studied. This negative effect can be explained by mass transfer limitations and secondary reactions at high amounts of catalyst. The maximum conversion obtained is 98% after 5h of reaction time at optimum reaction conditions, which are reached at 140°C, methanol:Jojoba oil ratio of 6 and 6% of catalyst percent. The catalyst crumbles at temperatures higher than 160°C and it facilitates the formation of emulsions. Due to the fact that secondary reactions and mass transfer limitations become more likely to appear at high levels of the factors, kinetic study has been also carried out. The proposed mechanism fits the experimental data accurately and it was obtained thanks to a multiparametric non-linear regression."
