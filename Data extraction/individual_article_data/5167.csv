0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production can occur during photosynthetic or dark-fermentative processes. Dark fermentation is a low-cost technology because acidogenic bacteria neither require light nor pure cultures and therefore have low technological requirements. During dark-fermentative processes volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols are produced together with hydrogen and so they can represent a substrate for other biological reactions. Although VFAs can be used by photoheterotrophic microorganisms for biohydrogen production, photo-fermentative processes require proper devices and their application still involves the overcoming of some significant obstacles (e.g. oxygen inhibition) (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Hawkes et al., 2007). Recently, a two-step process has been proposed whereby the produced VFAs are used as substrate for biological methane production (Antonopoulou et al., 2008a,b; Chu et al., 2008; Cooney et al., 2007; Hawkes et al., 2008; Kraemer and Bagley, 2005; Kyazze et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2009; Venkata Mohan et al., 2008; Ueno et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2008a,b; Zhu et al., 2008). Combining the hydrogen and methane anaerobic processes using a two-stage dark-fermentative system, the already available treatment systems for anaerobic digestion of wastes and wastewaters could be easily converted for H2 and CH4 production. In fact, two-stage anaerobic digestion processes are already in use at full-scale, in which an acidogenic (and thus potentially H2-producing) first stage is used to improve the hydrolysis of complex substrates before the methanogenic stage (Hawkes et al., 2007). Moreover, a technical and economic evaluation has recently revealed the benefits of the two-stage process (H2 and CH4 production) compared to just biological CH4 production (Elias et al., 2007), although the real economic benefits mainly seem to depend on the improvement of the hydrogen stage (Ljunggren and Zacchi, 2010). Several different operational conditions (such as pH, hydraulic retention time, temperature), reactor types (continuous, batch, etc.) and substrates have been applied for biohydrogen production by fermentative processes, making it very difficult to make comparisons in terms of yields, substrates conversions and process efficiencies (Kraemer and Bagley, 2005). The use of standardised methods for the determination of biochemical methane potential (BMP) and biodegradability of organic compounds have been applied for a long time (Angelidaki et al., 2009). Recently, similar batch methods have been widely applied for evaluating the biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) of several substrates and the activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria (e.g. Chen et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2003; Okamoto et al., 2000; Van Ginkel et al., 2005). However, to the authors’ best knowledge, there are currently no applications of a rapid and easily applicable method for the determination of the hydrogen and methane potential for the two-stage fermentative processes. The aim of the present study is to propose a simple bench-scale batch procedure for evaluating the BHP and BMP of organic wastes (or energy crops) as a simulated two-stage process (biohydrogen production followed by biomethane production). The results achieved with the wastes are compared with those obtained using glucose as standard substrate. The biogas potentials (both for H2 and CH4) were estimated on the basis of the electron equivalents (chemical oxygen demand unit) in order to evaluate the energy yields by the two gases (H2 and CH4) from complex organic matter and to improve the comparison between substrates of different origins."
1,Methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge Granular mesophilic sludge originating from a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) plant for the processing of potato wastes was used as inoculum. Prior to use, the sludge was acclimated for approximately one month at 35±0.5°C (the temperature of the tests) aimed at reaching endogenous conditions. Thereafter, to reduce inert and particulate substances, the granular sludge was rinsed with tap water and sieved (approx. 5mm openings). The granular sludge had the following main characteristics (mean±standard deviation, m±s.d. of n =6 measures): pH=7.1±0.4; total solids (TS, g/kg)=251±22; volatile solids (VS, g/kg)=199±16. The biomass to be used in biohydrogen potential (BHP) batch tests was subjected to thermal treatment at 105°C for 4h in an oven (Giordano et al., 2007) in order to inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The same biomass without thermal treatment was used for BMP tests."
3,Feedstock,"2.2 Feedstock Four typical wastes from two different types of food industry (i.e. flour mill and potato-processing) were used as feedstock: (i) wheat bran of Triticum durum for the production of the durum wheat of the typical Italian pasta (produced in a flour mill in the province of Pavia, northern Italy); (ii) wheat bran of Triticum aestivum for the production of the common wheat or bread wheat (produced in a flour mill in the province of Alessandria, northern Italy); (iii) wastes from steam-peeling potato-processing and (iv) wastes of the industrial production of mashed potatoes (produced in a food industry located in the province of Bologna, northern Italy). Before the experiments, the wastes were stored at −20°C. TS and VS of the wheat bran (both common and durum) measured were 88% and 84%, respectively. TS content of 14% and 24% and VS of 13% and 23% were measured for the wastes from the steam-peeling and for the mashed potatoes, respectively. Moreover, glucose (Carlo Erba reagents, Italy) was also used as substrate in order to compare the BHP and BMP of the pure compound with those of the wastes."
4,Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP),"2.3 Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) The experiments were carried out in batch conditions, using 1-L Pyrex glass bottles. One hundred twenty gram wet weight (w.w.) of granular sludge (thermal treated), nutrients and micronutrients, substrates and water to 600mL were added to every reactor. The approximate amount (the precise amounts were measured for every bottle) of the substrates tested were as follows (w.w.): 16g of durum bran, 15g of bread bran, 45g of steam-peeling potato-processing and 26g mashed potatoes wastes. Eleven gram of pure compound were used for the glucose tests. The amounts of the substrates were chosen in order to maintain approximately constant the feed/seed ratios (VS unit). Nutrients and trace elements were added according to Owen et al. (1979). pH was corrected to 7.0±0.1 using diluted (0.1M) HCl or NaOH. The reactors were airtight-sealed with screw caps (“Omnifit C series”) which are provided with three valves for sampling. At the beginning of the experiments, anaerobic conditions were obtained adding nitrogen gas for approximately 15min. The reactors were manually mixed every day and maintained at static conditions and constant temperature at mesophilic conditions (35±1°C) in a thermostatic cabinet. All the experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Two “seed-blank” reactors were prepared as described above but without the addition of the substrates. All the results are expressed as net values subtracting the blank."
5,Biochemical methane potential (BMP),"2.4 Biochemical methane potential (BMP) BMP was estimated according to the method proposed by Owen et al. (1979) with minor modifications. When the biological hydrogen production ceased, the reactors were opened and another 120g (w.w.) of granular sludge, without thermal treatment, were introduced into the reactors in order to evaluate the CH4 production from the products of the biohydrogen processes. We chose to directly add the new sludge into the reactors (and not to separate the supernatants containing the VFAs) in order to simulate the operating conditions of the two-phase systems usually applied for waste treatment (e.g. continuous-stirred stank reactor). Without the separation of the supernatants, particulate substrates that are not rapidly hydrolyzed (during the time of the biohydrogen production experiments) could be hydrolyzed/degraded under methanogenic conditions (due to the usually much higher experimental duration) and therefore increase the BMP, although not contributing to the BHP. Nevertheless, a similar method could be applied to the soluble organics of the first stage treatment (BHP) after separation of the supernatant (e.g. after sedimentation) in order to simulate processes with biomass retention (e.g. UASB reactor). Owing to the pH decrease measured during the H2 production, 0.5–1.6g of Na2CO3∗H2O were added into the reactors in order to increase the pH to 7.0±0.1, the optimal values for biomethane production. Then the bottles were airtight-sealed again with the screw caps, immediately made anaerobic by flushing with N2 (15min) and maintained at mesophilic conditions (35±1°C). The reactors were manually mixed every day during the first 5–7days and every 2–3days for the rest of the experimental duration and then maintained at static conditions. As for the BHP tests, the experiments were carried out in triplicate and with two blank reactors. The total duration of the experiments varied between 50 and 90days in order to approximate complete (ultimate) degradation."
6,Analyses,"2.5 Analyses Gas production was measured at room temperature using the water displacement method in sodium hydroxide solution (1M) to allow carbon dioxide removal. The gas volumes were converted to standard conditions (STP). The gas volume produced was corrected by subtracting the production of the blank. Gas was sampled using an airtight 2-mL syringe. Liquid and gas samples were collected through the valves of the screw caps. The liquid samples were centrifuged for 15min at 5000g and filtered using nylon filters (Millipore) with 0.45μm porosity. The mixed liquor samples were used for the measurement of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), glucose and pH. Gas composition and VFAs (acetic, propionic, i- and n-butyric and valeric acids) were measured using gas-chromatographic techniques as described in Spagni et al. (2010). pH was measured using Crison probes and pH-meter. TS and VS were measured according to the standard methods (APHA-AWWA-WEF, 2005) and to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Technical Reports (NREL, 2008) using Whatman GF/C filters. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the feedstock was estimated by the oxidation of approximately 1g of substrate with acidified dichromate according to the open reflux method of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater (APHA-AWWA-WEF, 2005) and the methods of soil analysis (SSSA-ASA, 1996) for organic matter determination."
7,Yield estimation and mass balance estimation,"2.6 Yield estimation and mass balance estimation As several units have been used to estimate the hydrogen production yield, at times making comparison among substrates difficult, in this study the amount of electrons (as COD) were used for mass balance and yield estimation; moreover, the estimations were carried out on the basis of the substrates applied instead of the ones converted because the amount of converted substrates cannot always be determined for complex substrates (Kraemer and Bagley, 2005). The equivalence of gCOD/g of acid for VFAs and glucose is assumed from Batstone et al. (2002). The gas yields (as %) were also estimated, on COD basis, relative to the initial amount of the substrates in order to evaluate the fraction of the organic matter (as electron equivalence) that can be converted to energetic gases, using the following equation: (1) Ri = Pi ∗ fi CODs where Ri is the recovery for gas i (H2 or CH4; % COD/COD), Pi is the maximum cumulative (ultimate) H2 or CH4 (mol) produced, CODs is the amount of substrates added (gCOD) at the beginning of the experiment (i.e. at the beginning of the BHP test), and fi is the equivalence for COD (gCOD/mol) i.e. 16 and 64 for H2 and CH4 (Batstone et al., 2002)."
8,Results and discussion,"In all BHP and BMP tests gas production started almost immediately revealing a short lag phase of the inoculum used for the treatment of the experimental substrates. The H2 concentration in the biogas of the BHP tests ranged between 45% and 72% with CO2 as the remaining fraction; no CH4 was detected during the BHP tests confirming heat pre-treatment as an effective method for enriching for hydrogen-producing bacteria. During the BMP test, the methane concentration in the biogas ranged between 45% and 64% with CO2 as the remaining fraction. Moreover, contrary to the BHP test where a negligible amount of biogas was produced under endogenous conditions, during the BMP test a significant amount of methane was also produced in the blank reactors."
9,Glucose as substrate,"3.1 Glucose as substrate The experiments started with the biological production of hydrogen using thermal pretreated inoculum. Gas production reached an H2 yield (YH) of 185±13 (m±s.d., n =6)L H2/kg COD added after 7days of incubation at mesophilic conditions, that corresponds to 186±13mL H2/g or 1.60mol H2/mol of glucose which is within the range obtained in other studies (Li and Fang, 2007). It is noteworthy that more than 50% of the H2 was produced in approximately 1.5days (Fig. 1 a). After 6days of operation, the glucose in the bottles was completely depleted (data not shown). A large amount of VFAs were produced during the biological hydrogen production processes. At the end of the BHP tests, acetic (HAc) and n-butyric (nHBu) acids represented the main fermentative products reaching the concentration of 3880±342 and 3190±390mg/L for HAc and nHBu acid, respectively (Table 1 ). Although analyses for alcohols and lactic acid (other possible important metabolites during the fermentative hydrogen processes) were not carried out during this experiments, mass balance revealed that HAc and nHBu represented 51% of the added COD, while all the measured VFAs (see Section 2.4) represented 65%, and the entire measured fermentation products (VFAs and H2) 79%, confirming that HAc and nHBu were the two main fermentative products. The VFAs production caused a significant pH decrease from neutrality to 4.9±0.3 (n =3) after 7days of incubation. After seven days’ incubation for hydrogen production, 120g of biomass without thermal pre-treatment was added to the reactor in order to evaluate the BMP using the products of the BHP processes. Methane production reached a yield of 267±13 (n =6)L CH4/kg COD added at the beginning of the experiments (i.e. for BHP tests), which corresponds to 2.29mol CH4/mol glucose added (Fig. 1a). Methane production caused the complete depletion (concentration below the detection limit of the instrument: 10–30mg/L depending on the acid) of the acids produced during the hydrogen-producing fermentative processes (data not shown). Although methane production lasted approximately 50days, about 50% of the total CH4 was produced during the first 7days."
10,Food industry wastes,"3.2 Food industry wastes H2 production started almost immediately with the addition of each of the four different substrates. Therefore, the use of complex substrates does not seem to significantly increase the lag phase in the production of both hydrogen and methane (Fig. 1b–e). However, Fig. 1 shows that the hydrogen and methane yields of the four substrates were very different. In fact, wastes from the flour industry yielded a much lower amount of H2 than CH4 whereas wastes from the potato-processing industry yielded a more balanced amount of the two gases. The higher hydrogen yield from potato wastes can be related to a larger amount of easily biodegradable polysaccharides (i.e. starch) than the wheat processing wastes; in fact, sugars are the preferred substrates by the hydrogen-producing biomass (Li and Fang, 2007). Moreover, the thermal treatment applied by the potato-processing industry might have improved the hydrolysis of the complex substrates making the substrates more accessible by the biohydrogen production microorganisms. Nevertheless, results from the literature (Table 2 ) confirm that potato wastes seem to be much better substrates for biohydrogen production than wheatfeed. The higher H2 yield obtained in this study with the durum wheat than the value obtained from the common wheat (Table 2) could be due to different industrial processes (e.g. different separation of the flour from the bran) between the two mills (this was not investigated as it was beyond the scope of the study), or to heterogeneity of the solid samples. It is noteworthy that the wastes produced in the food industry treating potatoes yielded a higher amount of H2 and a lower amount of CH4 than the wastes from the milling plants (Table 2) and, therefore, as expected from mass balance, the optimisation of H2 production may affect the CH4 potential. In this study we also attempted to apply the modified Gompertz equation for the determination of the kinetic parameters (Chen et al., 2006). Although good fits of the experimental data were usually obtained, since the experiments were not designed for a kinetic study, we found values of the kinetic parameters with very large standard errors (often as higher as the 100% of the parameter value). Nevertheless, Fig. 1 shows that more than 50–60% of H2 is produced during the first 2–3days whereas for the same amount of CH4 approximately 8–10days are required, confirming the much higher kinetics of the fermentative H2 production processes as compared with those for CH4 production. The data obtained in this study for the waste produced in the wheat mills are in a strict agreement with the results of Hawkes et al. (2008) who reported an H2 yield of 56–64L H2/kg wheatfeed from a wheat flour industry (we obtained yields between 54 and 91L H2/kg VS using the same unit). Moreover, the same authors (Hawkes et al. 2008) estimate the amount of CH4 that can be produced from the products of the H2 fermentative process (VFAs, ethanol, etc.) as 262–264L/kg wheatfeed that is within the range we measured in the present study (230–290L CH4/kg VS). The H2 yields obtained in this study using the wastes of the potato-processing industry (153–186L H2/kg VS) are slightly lower than the results reported by Xie et al. (2008b) of 200–271L H2/kg VS. However, Xie and co-authors used fresh potatoes to simulate food wastes whereas real wastes were used in this study and therefore the latter may contain a lower amount of easily biodegradable organic matter due to the industrial treatment. On the contrary, we obtained a methane yield of 209–218L CH4/kg VS which is much higher than the value of 158L CH4/kg VS obtained by Xie et al. (2008b). The standard deviations of the hydrogen and methane yields estimated during this study (Table 2) fall well inside the typical range for the biochemical methane estimations of complex substrates such as biomass and wastes (Chynoweth et al., 1993), thus confirming the reliability of the proposed method. Moreover, the standard deviations were rather stable irrespective of the sample tested (glucose or waste) and therefore the reliability of the method does not seem to be significantly affected by the type of the substrates. However, it is of note that the standard deviations of the cumulative gas production (CGP) trends were also rather stable or even higher at the start of the tests (during the lag or exponential phases) than at the end of the experiments when gas yields are estimated (see Fig. 1e where, for example, the standard deviation of the CH4 CGP decreases from 25 to 16L CH4/kg COD). Thus, this indicates that the gas yields can be estimated more accurately than the kinetics parameters; this could explain the high standard errors we obtained applying the modified Gompertz equation."
11,H2 and CH4 recovery,"3.3 H2 and CH4 recovery Table 2 reports a summary of the main results with the biogas recovery (as defined in Eq. (1)) obtained in this study and of a few examples obtained from the literature (an in-depth literature analysis is beyond the scope of this paper). As also stated by other authors (e.g. Kraemer and Bagley, 2005), we would like to stress that the commonly utilized units for the determination of the biohydrogen potential and yield (e.g. mol gas/mol glucose or hexose) make the comparison among different materials such as wastes or energetic crops difficult; therefore the gas (H2 and CH4) recovery concept (Kraemer and Bagley, 2005) was used in this study. We also emphasise that, due to the different units used to express the results, the values reported in Table 2 of the cited references could be rough estimations; moreover, in several studies it is not clear whether the reported methane yields referred to the loading rate to the methane reactor or to the system conceived as a two-stage process. Here the yield and the gas recovery refer to the initial amount of the biomass in order to calculate the potential total energy gain from different substrates applying a two-step process for sequential hydrogen and methane production. Table 2 shows that using glucose we approximate the maximum theoretical gas yield. In fact, the total gas recovery (as the sum of H2 and CH4) for glucose approximate the closing of the mass balance if a biomass growth yield for anaerobic process of 0.10 (Batstone et al., 2002) is assumed (i.e. 10% of the feed is used for bacterial growth). As a consequence, the increase in the biohydrogen yield close to the maximum values reported in the literature of about 2.5mol H2/mol of glucose (Li and Fang, 2007) will lead to a decrease in methane potential. The total gas recovery also demonstrates that much more energy could be gained from the wastes utilized in this study. In fact, our results and a few of the other results obtained from the literature (Table 2) show that the gas recovery is usually included in the range from 50 and 70% of the theoretical value. It is noteworthy that some substrates show a quite low hydrogen recovery such as wheat wastes, whereas other substrates seem to be much more promising for a two-step process for sequential H2 and CH4 production, such as wastes from the potato-processing industries."
12,Conclusions,"The results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for an easy estimation of the biochemical hydrogen and methane potential of a two-step process for sequential biological hydrogen and methane production. The results demonstrate that the substrate significantly influences H2 or CH4 recovery. Moreover, the use of gas recovery using electron equivalence as COD unit can be used for a clear comparison between different organic matters of various origins such as wastes or energy crops."
