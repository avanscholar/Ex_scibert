0,Introduction,"Sesame is one of the oldest crops in the world, being the 9th most cultivated oilseed with a production of more than 4 million tons annually, of which approximately 70% is destined for oil production [1,2]. According to Hwang [1], in general, the seeds grown for oil extraction contain approximately 50% oil, with approximately 2% of unsaponifiable material (composed of lignans, tocopherols, sterols, and triterpenic alcohols), which are the main components responsible for the high oxidative stability and beneficial physiological effects of sesame oil [1–6]. Hexane is the solvent traditionally employed in the industrial vegetable oil extraction process. Although this solvent has great extraction capability and stability, this compound has caused large amounts of safety, health, and environmental concerns because it is obtained from nonrenewable sources, in addition to its high toxicity, flammability, and pollution risk [7–11]. For these reasons, efforts are being made to search for alternative solvents [12], among which short-chain alcohols, mainly ethanol and isopropanol, stand out for being obtained from renewable sources and for their higher operational safety concerning hexane, considering the specific case of production of vegetable oils for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes [11,12]. According to Potrich et al. [13], for the consolidation of the low carbon economy, it is essential, in industrial processes, the replacement of compounds of fossil origin by compounds derived from biomass. Sugarcane bagasse, a by-product of ethanol production, can be burned in boilers to produce high-pressure steam, generating thermal and electrical energy. Therefore, the replacement of hexane by a renewable solvent, ethanol, combined with bioelectricity cogeneration, presents itself as an attractive alternative [13]. Still from an environmental point of view, Potrich et al. [13] reported that the substitution of hexane by ethanol in an industry that processes 125 tons per hour of soybean resulted in lower Global Warming Potential, reducing the emission of CO2 eq. per year by approximately 10,600 tons. About process safety, while for ethanol and isopropanol the flashpoints ranges are 13–17 °C and 14–18 °C, respectively, depending on the water content, the flashpoint of hexane is −22 °C [14]. Therefore, from a fire/explosion risk point of view, this significant difference indicates that both alcohols, ethanol and isopropanol, are safer than hexane. The U.S. Government Printing Office reports that ethanol is labeled as a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) substance, while isopropanol presents a maximum allowable limit of 6 mg·kg−1 in the residue from essential oil extraction [15]. Besides, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, hexane is classified as a Class 2 solvent, while ethanol and isopropanol are classified as Class 3. Limited quantities of solvents belonging to Class 2 can be present in pharmaceuticals due to their inherent toxicity (in case of hexane this limit is 290 mg·kg−1), for example, whereas Class 3 does not include solvents that are hazardous to human health at the levels normally accepted in pharmaceuticals, meaning that they may be recognized as less toxic [16]. However, the lower solubilization capacity of the lipid fraction by alcohol requires the use of ethanol flow about 280% higher than the hexane flow [13]. This fact can compromise the economic viability of the oil extraction process with the alternative renewable solvent due to the greater energy expenditure in the desolventization step [13,17]. Still, in the context of desolventization, the values of latent heat of vaporization of absolute ethanol (204 kcal⋅kg−1) and absolute isopropanol (159.3 kcal⋅kg−1) are higher than the latent heat of vaporization of hexane (79.6 kcal⋅kg−1), which have been also marked as a disadvantage for alcoholic solvents because they could require more energy in oil from solvent separation in the extract phase and desolventizing of the defatted meal [7]. Despite the greater values of latent heat of vaporization for alcohols, according to Rao et al. [18] and Rao and Arnold [19], vegetable oils at ambient temperature show partial miscibility with ethanol and isopropanol, while with hexane, the miscibility is complete. Therefore, after oil extraction from a solid vegetable matrix at high temperatures, the use of short-chain alcohols as solvents allows the formation of two phases, alcohol- and oil-rich ones, by the cooling of the solvent-oil solution from the extractor device [12]. This property can be used to mitigate costs related to the oil and solvent separation stage, since, in this way, the industrial processes of distillation and desorption [10,11,20] can be carried out using milder operational conditions. An additional point that must be taken into account is the mixture (vegetable oil + hexane) has a negative deviation from ideal behavior, i.e., for diluted solutions of hexane in oil it is very hard to strip the volatile component, requiring higher temperatures, very low pressures, and a higher mass transfer area, with the corresponding impact on investment and energy costs. Conversely, the mixtures (ethanol + oil and/or fatty compounds) have positive deviations from the ideal behavior and are easier to be separated, an aspect that, besides mixture concentration, should also be considered in cost evaluation [21,22]. In this context, Johnson and Lusas [7] suggest that this characteristic of partial miscibility with oils at lower temperatures allows partial recovery of the alcoholic solvent, leading to a reduction of approximately 25% in the energy demand required in the desolventization step when compared with extraction using hexane. However, a deeper investigation is still needed, which will assist in delineating the circumstances under which phase separation is possible, i.e., whether the separation is dependent on the alcohol type, hydration, and temperature. For that, the liquid–liquid equilibrium evaluation may thus provide these responses. Experimental phase equilibria data for several model lipid systems and ethanol as solvent are reported in the scientific literature [12,23,24–37] Among them, only Rodrigues et al. [32] reported experimental data on systems composed of refined sesame seed oil, at (298.2 ± 0.1) K. Besides, related to the use of different short-chain alcohols, Batista et al. [23] and Pereira et al. [29] studied lipid systems containing canola and Amazonian Pracaxi (Pentaclethra macroloba) and Patawa (Oenocarpus bataua) oils, respectively, and short-chain alcohols, including isopropanol. Therefore, studies concerning the use of sesame oil as raw material and isopropanol as a solvent are still scarce. On this basis, experimental data of lipid systems composed of sesame seed oil and alcoholic solvents under different temperature conditions is necessary to properly design the desolventization step that follows the oil extraction one from a solid matrix. The conditions under which the solvent recovery is possible were thus studied from the acquisition of liquid–liquid equilibrium data of systems containing crude sesame seed oil (CSSO), ethanol or isopropanol, and water at (283.2 ± 0.1), (288.2 ± 0.1), (298.2 ± 0.1), and (333.2 ± 0.1) K. Also, the temperature-dependent binary interaction parameters of the NRTL thermodynamic model [38] were adjusted to the experimental data, allowing the prediction of the alcohol- and oil-rich phase compositions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Solvents used were ethanol (Et0, CAS 64–17-5, purity ≥ 0.998, 0.0016 ± 0.0004, in mass, of water), and isopropanol (IPA0, CAS 67–63-0, purity ≥ 0.995, 0.0023 ± 0.0003, in mass, of water), both in absolute degree, purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Also, were used hydroalcoholic solutions at the azeotropic point, prepared by mixing the alcohol with deionized water (Millipore, Mili-Q, Bedford, MA, USA) with the following mass fractions: (0.063 ± 0.002) and (0.126 ± 0.003) of water for ethanol (Et6) and isopropanol (IPA12), respectively. The water content was verified by Karl Fischer titration [39] (Metrohm, model 787 KF Titrino, Herisan, Switzerland). CSSO, obtained by industrial mechanical pressing of seeds, was kindly supplied by Sésamo Real Indústria e Comércio de Produtos Alimentícios Ltda. (Valinhos, São Paulo, Brazil). This oil was not subjected to refining processes such as deacidification, in this way, it presents naturally acidity which was assessed as described in Section 2.2.1. Information about the CAS numbers and purities of each compound used in this study are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure 2.2.1 CSSO characterization CSSO fatty acid composition analysis was carried out by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) according to the AOCS official methods Ce 1-62 and Ce 2-66 [39], following the procedure described in Sawada et al. [40]. FAMEs were identified with external standards purchased from Nu-Chek (USA). The quantification was performed using methyl tridecanoate (Sigma-Aldrich) as an internal standard based on the response correction factors of the FID and FAME to fatty acid conversion. The CSSO was characterized in terms of the free fatty acids (FFAs) content by titration (official method 2.201) [41] with NaOH solution (CAS 1310-73-2, purity ≥ 0.97, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, prepared by solubilizing the pellets with Et0 at approximately 0.01 M) using an automatic burette (Metrohm, model Dosimat 775, Herisau, Switzerland). 2.2.2 Liquid-liquid equilibrium Liquid-liquid equilibrium data were experimentally determined for systems containing CSSO + ethanol + water and CSSO + isopropanol + water, with 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, and 0.66 mass fraction of oil in the overall composition at T = (283.2 ± 0.1), (288.2 ± 0.1), (298.2 ± 0.1), and (333.2 ± 0.1) K, prepared according to the methodology previously used in several works [12,23–33,35–37,42–45]. Following the different mass proportions, both oil and solvent were weighed on an analytical balance (0.0001 g, Adam, model PW 254, Milton Keynes, UK) and placed into a jacketed equilibrium cell. Oil and solvent solutions were stirred for 30 min by a magnetic stirrer (Heildolph, model MR Hei-Tec, Schwabach, Germany) in the sealed equilibrium cell to prevent the solvent loss, and subsequently maintained for approximately 24 h at T = (283.2, 288.2, 298.2, or 333.2 ± 0.1) K controlled by a thermostatic bath (Marconi, model MA184, Brazil). After that period, two optically clear liquid phases with a well-defined interface were obtained: an alcohol-rich phase (AP) and an oil-rich phase (OP). The phases were collected separately through a septum using disposable syringes. Each phase was solubilized in 1-hexanol (CAS 111-27-3, purity ≥ 0.98, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to prevent phase separation during sampling and analysis due to the solution cooling. The phases and 1-hexanol were properly weighted, ensuring a mass ratio of 1:1, to allow calculation of the composition due to dilution. The composition of both phases was assessed as follows: the total solvent content (ethanol + water or isopropanol + water) was determined by evaporation in a forced convection oven (Nova Orgânica, model N035/3, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) at T = (333.2 ± 0.1) K for 24 h, the water content was determined by Karl Fischer titration [39], whereas the FFA content was assessed by titration (official method 2.201) [41]. From the two first analyses, evaporation and Karl Fischer titration, was possible to determine the contents of alcohol, ethanol or isopropanol, and water in each phase. It is worth mentioning that the dilution factor, resulting from the known masses of phases and 1-hexanol, was used in all calculations. Considering the systems composed of CSSO, ethanol or isopropanol, and water, the CSSO content was determined by difference. All experimental measurements were performed at least in triplicate, and the standard uncertainties of the mass fractions were estimated by Type A [46]. 2.2.3 Quality of experimental data To evaluate the accuracy of the experimental liquid–liquid equilibrium data, the mass relative deviations (δ) were calculated according to the procedure developed by Marcilla et al. [47] and used by several authors [12,24–29,32,33,35–37,42,43]. In this procedure, the mass of each phase, M AP and M OP , was calculated based on the experimental values of w i AP and w i OP , by applying a least-squares fitting. The δ values between M OC (initial mixture mass) and the sum of M AP and M OP were calculated according to Eq. (1). (1) δ = M AP + M OP - M OC M OC ∙ 100 Also, Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) was used to evaluate the experimental results for significance (p ≤ 0.05) [48] with SAS® software (v. 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)."
4,Adjustment of the binary interaction parameters of the NRTL model,"2.3 Adjustment of the binary interaction parameters of the NRTL model The temperature-dependent binary interaction parameters of the NRTL model [38] were adjusted to the experimental liquid–liquid equilibrium data. The adjustment was done considering two types of systems with the following compositions: CSSO (1) + ethanol (2) + water (4) and CSSO (1) + isopropanol (3) + water (4). In this way, three components are available for each system, CSSO, alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol), and water, yielding the following pairs of components: CSSO/ethanol (12), CSSO/isopropanol (13), CSSO/water (14), ethanol/water (24), and isopropanol/water (34). It is worth mentioning that CSSO, ethanol, isopropanol, and water were considered as independent components, as experimentally as in terms of the NRTL parameters adjustment procedure. According to Chiyoda et al. [36], molar fractions are traditionally used to adjust the parameters of the NRTL model. However, due to the large differences in the molar masses of the lipid system components, mass fractions are more convenient for the calculations. In this way, the iso-activity criterion in terms of the mass fraction can be written as follows (Eqs. (2) through (4)), where γ i w is the mass-fraction scale activity coefficient [12]. (2) ( γ i · x i ) OP = ( γ i · x i ) AP (3) γ i w · w i OP = γ i w · w i AP Where: (4) γ i w = γ i / M i ∑ j = 1 K w j / M j Therefore, converting the compositions to mass fractions, the NRTL model for multicomponent mixtures can be expressed as Eqs. (5) through (9). (5) ln γ i w = ∑ j = 1 K τ ji G ji w j / M j ∑ j = 1 K G ji w j / M j + ∑ j = 1 K w j G ij M j ∑ l = 1 K G lj w l / M l τ ij - ∑ l = 1 K τ ji G lj w l / M l ∑ l = 1 K G lj w l / M l Where: (6) G ij = e x p - α ij τ ij (7) τ ij = Δ g ij RT (8) Δ g ij R = A 0 , i j + A 1 , i j T (9) α ij = α ji where γ i w is the activity coefficient of the component i expressed as a mass fraction; M and w are the molar masses and the component mass fractions, respectively; Δ g ij and τ ij are related to the interactions in terms of molecular energy between the components i and j; T is the absolute temperature; α ij is the mixture non-randomness parameter; and A0,ij , A0,ji , A1,ij , and A1,ji are the characteristic energy parameters of the interactions between components i and j. In this way, five adjustable parameters were used for each pair of components. The parameters were estimated based on the minimization of the objective function (OF), Eq. (10), according to the algorithm developed in FORTRAN® by Stragevitch and d’Ávila [49], using the modified Simplex method. (10) OF ( w ) = ∑ m = 1 D ∑ n = 1 N ∑ i = 1 K - 1 w i , n , m AP , exp - w i , n , m AP , c a l c σ w i , n , m AP 2 + w i , n , m OP , exp - w i , n , m OP , c a l c σ w i , n , m OP 2 where D, N, and K are the total numbers of data points, tie lines, and components, respectively, in the database m; w is the mass fraction; the subscripts i, n, and m represent the component, tie line, and database numbers, respectively; the superscripts AP and OP are related to the alcohol- and oil-rich phases, respectively; exp and calc refer to the experimental and calculated compositions, respectively; σ w i , n , m AP and σ w i , n , m OP are the standard deviations of the composition values of the alcohol- and oil-rich phases, respectively. The average deviations between the experimental (exp) and calculated (calc) compositions (Δw) of both liquid phases were estimated according to Eq. (11). (11) Δ w = 100 ∑ n = 1 N ∑ i = 1 K w i , n AP , exp - w i , n AP , c a l c 2 + w i , n OP , exp - w i , n OP , c a l c 2 2 N K"
5,Solvent recovery,"2.4 Solvent recovery The obtained NRTL parameters were used to describe the behavior of systems containing 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.33, in mass, of oil in the overall composition. These compositions in terms of oil were used to simulate the oil–solvent solution from solid-liquid extractors, being these oil contents commonly found in traditional processes where hexane is used as a solvent [7,10,11,20]. This procedure was accomplished to calculate the recovering degree of alcoholic solvent (Eq. (12)), by cooling the alcoholic extracts to 283.2, 288.2, and 298.2 K. (12) Solvent recovery ( % ) = 100 w ( 2 + 4 ) o r ( 3 + 4 ) AP ∙ M AP w ( 2 + 4 ) o r ( 3 + 4 ) OC ∙ M OC where w is the mass fraction; subscripts 2, 3, and 4 represent ethanol, isopropanol, and water, respectively; M is the mass of the AP (alcohol-rich phase, obtained by mass balances) and OC (overall composition)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Oil characterization,"3.1 Oil characterization The CSSO was naturally composed of (0.0174 ± 0.0001), in mass, of FFAs expressed as linoleic acid. Table 2 shows the CSSO fatty acid composition. According to data available in the literature, oleic and linoleic acids are the main unsaturated fatty acids found in sesame oil in amounts ranging from 33.5 to 50.9 mass% [50]. From the fatty acid profile, the probable triacylglycerol composition was estimated (Table 3 ) using the statistical procedure suggested by Antoniosi Filho et al. [51], in which the main triacylglycerol (TAG) is represented by the isomer with the most abundant content among all possible isomers of the set (with x carbons and y double bonds)."
8,Liquid-liquid equilibrium,"3.2 Liquid-liquid equilibrium Tables 4 and 5 bring the alcohol- (AP) and oil-rich (OP) phase compositions, in mass fractions, for the pseudo ternary systems with ethanol and isopropanol, respectively, at T = 283.2 to 333.2 K. To evaluate the accuracy of the experimental data, the mass relative deviations were calculated according to the Eq. (1) [47] and also presented in Tables 4 and 5. These values were less than or equal to 0.82% for systems containing ethanol and less than or equal to 0.87% for systems with isopropanol. The low deviations in the mass balances for both system types (close to 0.5%), as well as the low experimental uncertainties (presented in Tables 4 and 5), indicate the good quality and reproducibility of the experimental data [12,24–29,32,33,35–37,42,43]. To adjust the thermodynamic model parameters, the lipid systems were considered to be composed of a single TAG, ethanol or isopropanol, and water. Again, TAG was chosen as the main one present in the oil. The average TAG molar mass was calculated from the probable TAG composition of the CSSO (Table 3). Therefore, from the results presented in Table 3, the calculated average molar mass of CSSO used for the NRTL parameters adjustment was equal to 874.95 g·mol−1. As previously mentioned, CSSO, ethanol, isopropanol, and water were considered as independent components, as experimentally as in terms of the NRTL parameters adjustment procedure. Based on this, Table 6 shows the binary interaction parameters of the NRTL model adjusted to systems containing ethanol and isopropanol, whereas Table 7 brings the deviations between experimental and calculated compositions for both phases. Note in Table 7 that low deviations were calculated (0.24 to 0.63%), indicating that the adjusted NRTL parameters were able to adequately describe the behavior of the lipid systems, in terms of mass composition. Figure 1 shows the experimental data points for the lipid components (CSSO, 1) solubilized in the AP and for the alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol, 2 or 3) and water (4) solubilized in the OP, as a function of temperature, for the different mass fractions of oil in the overall composition (0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.33). Data of systems containing solvents in the absolute degree are not shown in Fig. 1a because in that case the total miscible was observed. Comparisons among the four alcoholic solvents (absolute and azeotropic ethanol and isopropanol) revealed that increased solvent hydration resulted in a decreased mutual solubility of CSSO in the AP and the alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) in the OP. As expected, there is a greater amount of water solubilized in the OP for systems composed of more hydrated solvents. It is observed that in OP, amounts less than 1% of water are solubilized. On the other hand, for alcohol, quantities varying from 6 to 36%. Furthermore, the systems' behavior remained similar for all oil mass fractions contained in the overall composition. Still from Fig. 1, it can be observed that the cooling enabled OP to be obtained with approximately 8% ethanol when using Et6 as a solvent and approximately 12 to 14% when using Et0 and IPA12. Since it is these amounts of alcoholic solvent that must be separated from the oil, although the energy to vaporize the alcohol is greater compared to hexane [7], the masses to be evaporated will be lower. Additionally, increased temperature improved the oil solubility in the AP and the alcohol solubility in the OP. However, it can be noted in Fig. 1 that the temperature, in general, does not affect water solubilized in OP. These results are in agreement with the ones reported by Sanaiotti et al. [43], Cuevas et al. [35], and Chiyoda et al. [36] for systems containing oils from grape seeds, sunflower seeds, and soybean, respectively. Cuevas et al. [35] suggested that molecular agglomerates originating from the hydrogen bonds between the alcohol and water can be generated, resulting in a moderate influence of temperature on the phases' behavior. Additionally, according to Chiyoda et al. [36], non-polar solute molecules can become solvated upon contact with a water-rich solvent through the hydrophobic hydration phenomenon, since the interaction between water and non-polar molecules may increase with a higher water content added to alcohol. Recovered alcoholic solvent contents (%), defined as the ratio between the solvent in the alcoholic phase and the total solvent fed to the system, are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the cooling temperatures and for different oil–solvent solution compositions. In general, regardless of the alcoholic solvent, it was noted that increased oil content in systems leads to reduced solvent recovery. On the other hand, decreased cooling temperature enhanced the amount of recovered solvent, reaching a minimum of approximately 86% recovery for systems with IPA0 at T = 288.2 K. Comparing the alcohols evaluated, absolute ones can be highlighted regarding oil extraction from solid matrices [40,52,53]. Despite this, the absolute solvents also exhibited a great ability to maintain the oil solubilized in the AP even in the cooling solution, when compared to hydrated solvents (Fig. 1). On this basis, only Et6 allows recoveries close to 100%. Besides, these high recoveries are only possible between temperatures of 283.2 and 288.2 K and for extracts with oil contents of up to 0.20, in mass. Therefore, in general, it can be said that azeotropic solvents prove to be more advantageous in the desolventization step, with lower proportions of alcohol to be evaporated from the OP and allowing for greater recoveries. Furthermore, in the step following solid–liquid extraction, the azeotropic behavior facilitates the recovery of alcoholic solvents by simple distillation and its subsequent reuse in the process, once the composition of the mixture remains fixed."
9,Distribution of oil and free fatty acids between liquid phases,"3.3 Distribution of oil and free fatty acids between liquid phases The partial miscibility of short-chain alcohols with vegetable oils also leads to the overlap of the extraction and desolventization steps with the deacidification one due to the free fatty acids (FFAs) partitioning between the two liquid phases. The FFAs can be removed from the oil by liquid–liquid extraction, constituting an advantageous alternative to the traditional processes of chemical or physical refining since the employment of a milder treatment avoids the formation of residual products (soaps) and, consequently, losses of neutral oil and nutraceutical compounds can be minimized [12,54]. In this way, Table 8 and Fig. 2 show the experimental partition coefficient ( k i ) values of FFAs and CSSO, respectively, as a function of temperature for the different oil mass fractions. k i was calculated by Eq. (13), in which i corresponds to FFAs or CSSO, and w i AP and w i OP are the mass fractions of component i in the AP and OP, respectively. (13) k i = w i AP w i OP In the processes using hexane as the solvent, extracts with approximately 0.25, in mass, of oil are obtained [7]. Therefore, in Table 8 and Fig. 2 it can be seen that the oil contents normally obtained in extracts from industrial processes were extrapolated. Regardless of the solvent employed or oil mass fraction in the overall composition, the increase in temperature does not affect the distribution of the FFAs between the liquid phases. This same result is reported in the literature for different types of vegetable oils [12,17,23–26,35–37,43–45,55]. On the other hand, there is an increase in k 1 (oil distribution), indicating a greater oil migration to the AP. It can be noted in Table 8 and Fig. 2 that increased water content in the alcoholic solvent led to a reduction in the partition coefficients of both FFAs and CSSO. Considering the results obtained for systems containing 0.33, in mass, of oil, at 283.2 K, the increase in water content in ethanol, from Et0 to Et6 leads to a reduction of 35.7 and 71.5% in the partition coefficient of FFAs and oil, respectively. Likewise, using azeotropic isopropanol as a solvent, the FFA partition coefficient is reduced by 22.0% and oil by 82.1% when compared with IPA0. These results reveal a lower migration of FFAs and oil to the AP, indicating that a lower amount of these components was solubilized in the AP, which is consistent with results displayed in Fig. 1. However, when comparing solvents in azeotropic degree (Et6 and IPA12), for IPA12, a slight increase in the solubility of oil in the AP and a greater increase in the amount of isopropanol and water solubilized in the OP were noted, although this solvent has higher water content. This may be attributed to the alcohol's molecular structures since isopropanol has an additional carbon atom when compared to ethanol. This additional carbon may contribute to a considerable increase in the interactions among the solvent and oil. Batista et al. [23] found that in systems containing rapeseed oil and short-chain alcohols at T = 283.2 to 303.2 K, the addition of water in the alcoholic solvent had a great impact on the system behavior, mainly by reducing the mutual solubility between the oil and solvent. Still, at a specific temperature, the solubility tended to increase with longer alcohol carbon chain length. Furthermore, in Table 8, it is possible to observe that the partition coefficients for FFAs are close to or higher than 1, which indicates that more FFAs migrate to the AP than remain in the OP, which is advantageous for the good performance of oil deacidification processes. Conversely, from Fig. 2, it can be noted that CSSO partition coefficients were much lower than the unity, indicating lower migration of oil to the AP and, consequently, preferential remaining in the OP. Therefore, it can be inferred that the liquid–liquid extraction technique can be used for CSSO deacidification since high migration of FFAs and low transfer of neutral oil to the AP were noted, as reported in previous studies [12,23,32,35,36,43]. From calculated results expressed as dashed lines in Figs. 1 and 2 it can be noted that the adjusted parameters underestimating the water content in OP for absolute solvents and overestimating this same amount for IPA12 in systems containing 0.15 to 0.25 of oil in the OC. Despite these results, in general, the performance of the NRTL thermodynamic model was adequate for describing the system's behavior in terms of the mutual solubility and CSSO partition coefficients, demonstrated by the low global average deviations presented in Table 7. Rodrigues et al. [32] reported mean deviations between 0.59 and 0.72% for systems containing refined sesame oil and ethanol with 0, 6.22 and 12.27 mass% water at T = 298.2 K. In addition, a wide range of mean deviations (0.12–1.27%) was calculated when NRTL parameters were adjusted to liquid–liquid equilibrium data of systems containing short-chain alcohols as solvents and several vegetable oils, as canola, palm, Brazil nut, babassu, patawa, pracaxi, corn, garlic, grape seed, soybean, peanut, and avocado seed [23,24,27–34,37,42]. In all systems, the authors observed good correlations between the experimental data and the parameters adjusted to the NRTL model, indicating that the NRTL model is indeed appropriate to describe the thermodynamic behavior of this kind of systems."
10,Conclusions,"The use of short-chain alcohols (ethanol and isopropanol) as solvents in systems containing CSSO allowed the formation of two liquid phases because of the partial miscibility of the components contained in the lipid system. Therefore, it was verified that partial desolventization of the liquid output stream from solid-liquid extractors, consisting of solutions composed of oil and solvent, is possible and can be performed only by the solution cooling. The binary interaction parameters of the NRTL thermodynamic model exhibited good performance in the description of the compositions of the phases, with low global deviation values. Adjusted parameters were also used to estimate the levels of solvent that could be recovered by temperature reducing and the azeotropic ethanol was indicated as the most advantageous one, with lower proportions of alcohol to be evaporated from the OP and allowing for greater recoveries. Besides that, the azeotropic behavior facilitates the recovery of alcoholic solvents by simple distillation, once the composition of the mixture remains fixed. These results show that these parameters can be useful in computational modeling and simulation of CSSO desolventization processes. Besides, once the FFAs partition coefficient values were close to unity, this component transfers to a satisfactory extent to the alcoholic phase, enabling the development of alternative processes for CSSO deacidification employing liquid-liquid extraction using alcoholic solvents."
