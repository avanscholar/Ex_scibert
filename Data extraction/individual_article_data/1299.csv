0,Introduction,"In the present day, the world encounters problems due to rising energy demands, which arise mostly because of rapid industrialization and urbanization due to population growth. Fossil fuels are predominantly used to quench the increasing energy demand. However, their consumption is constrained by the rising fuel prices, exhausting finite resources, greenhouse gas emissions, global warming and pollution issues associated with their extraction, processing and utilization [1]. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative energy sources that are reasonable, sustainable, reliable and environmentally benign such as biofuels (e.g. bio-oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, biomethane and biohydrogen) [2–6]. Additionally, these energy resources should have the potential to complement fossil fuels and mitigate the environmental challenges associated with fossil fuel consumption [7]. Hydrogen (H2) is widely seen as a promising energy carrier and alternative fuel in the energy sector. In the last decade there has been a progressive increase in the demand for H2 production for use as transportation fuels, hydrotreating (hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation), heavy oil upgrading and fuel cells [5,8,9]. Recently, lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. energy crops, agriculture residues and forestry biomass) has received immense attention for biofuel production due to its abundant availability, low cost and the ability to reduce atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis [10]. Furthermore, they do not pose any “food versus fuel” issues unlike the starch-based feedstocks (e.g. oilseeds, grains, corn, potato, cassava, etc.), which are associated with the risk of diverting large farmlands and food crops for fuel production [11,12]. Hydrogen produced from lignocellulosic biomass is widely considered as a green fuel for combined heat and power generation due to its high-energy content. Compared to other conventional fuels, H2 has a very high-energy content of 120–142 MJ/kg. Moreover, the combustion product of H2 is pure water, which makes it a much cleaner fuel. Presently, catalytic steam reforming of methane is the most preferred industrial method of producing H2 with an estimated efficiency of about 85% [13–15]. Nonetheless, steam reforming is a process that uses large quantities of hydrocarbons, thereby generating enormous amounts of greenhouse gas emissions [8,16]. Renewable H2 production through different biological (e.g. photo-fermentation and dark fermentation) and thermochemical conversion (e.g. gasification and pyrolysis) of waste biomass offer the possibility of reducing or eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions while improving the process economics [9]. Among the biomass conversion methods, hydrothermal gasification is emerging as a promising method for H2 production from a wide variety of waste resources such as lignocellulosic biomass, sewage sludge and municipal solid wastes [17,19]. Moreover, hydrothermal gasification can effectively convert biomass containing high moisture content, which otherwise requires expensive pretreatment and drying steps before thermochemical conversion, thus imparting additional processing costs. The thermochemical conversion of wet biomass becomes inefficient because the heat of liquid evaporation usually exceeds the heat of combustion of the biomass [20]. Water at a temperature and pressure above its critical point (Tc > 374 °C and Pc > 22.1 MPa) is known as supercritical water (SCW) [21,22]. In contrast, subcritical water (SbCW) exists at temperatures and pressures below the water’s critical points (Tc < 374 °C and Pc < 22.1 MPa). SCW exhibits a gas-like viscosity and liquid-like density that makes it an excellent candidate for biomass conversion through gasification, liquefaction and oxidation [23,24]. SCW gasification results in a hydrogen-rich syngas product that also contains certain levels of CO, CO2, CH4 and C2+ gases. Furthermore, the use of high pressures in SCWG eliminates the requirement for gas compression and downstream shift reactor [25]. Soybean (Glycine max) has gained popularity as an agricultural product after corn and wheat with about 42% of the 324 million tons/year production from North America alone [26]. The common residues left behind after soybean harvesting and processing include straw, hulls and fibers [27]. Similarly, massive amounts of flax straw are obtained after harvesting flaxseeds from flax plants (Linum usitatissimum). Although with high potentials, the straw residues generated from agricultural practices have fewer practical applications. A portion of accumulated straw is used for fodder or bedding material for cattle, while the remaining ones are used for briquetting, biocomposite manufacturing and fuel pellet production [28]. In some developing countries where the arable lands are scarce, the straw residues are burnt in the farmlands, which emit huge amounts of smoke, particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the straws could be harnessed to produce renewable energy, thereby mitigating the problems of disposal. On the contrary, the agricultural straw residues contain a substantial amount of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, which can be converted to biofuels and biochemicals. Soybean straw is reported to contain 34.1 wt% cellulose, 16.1 wt% hemicellulose and 21.6 wt% lignin [29]. On the other hand, flax straw typically contains 53.8 wt% cellulose, 17.1 wt% hemicellulose and 23.3 wt% lignin [30]. Soybean straw and flax straw are of particular interest in this study because of the limited literature available on their hydrothermal gasification to produce H2-rich syngas. Qing et al. [31] performed different acid and alkaline pretreatment for enzyme hydrolysis of soybean straw and the hulls to produce fermentable sugars. Xu et al. [32] performed enzymatic hydrolysis of soybean straw for bioconversion. Harry et al. [33] conducted liquefaction of flax straw in SbCW to produce furfural as an industrial chemical precursor. Soybean straw and flax straw have both been used as precursors for producing activated carbon for a wide variety of applications such as removal of heavy metals from contaminated water [34–36]. A clear understanding of the thermal degradation of soybean straw and flax straw could help in improving their effective management and valorization. Furthermore, the identification of important process parameters and thermodynamic modeling could aid in the design and optimization of the hydrothermal conversion process, energy recovery potential, lifecycle assessment and techno-economic analysis. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the decomposition of soybean straw and flax straw in SbCW and SCW. The effects of different process parameters, temperature (300–500 °C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10), biomass particle size (0.13 mm and 0.8 mm) and residence time (30–60 min) on H2 production at a pressure range of 22–25 MPa were studied. The experimental results were also compared with the theoretical values obtained from thermodynamic models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the experimental and thermodynamic modeling of hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw and flax straw."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass and catalysts,"2.1 Biomass and catalysts Soybean straw and flax straw were the two agricultural residues used as the feedstocks in this study. Both the straw varieties were procured from a local farm in Saskatoon, Canada. The straws were chopped, air-dried and brushed to remove any soil particles before pulverizing. The chopped straws were crushed using an IKA MF 10 Basic S1 grinder (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Mississauga, Canada) to obtain two different average particle sizes of 0.13 mm and 0.8 mm. The pulverized straw particles were stored in a clean and dry airtight container at room temperature before characterization and hydrothermal gasification. Potassium hydroxide, KOH (purity: 99.995%), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co. (Oakville, Canada) was used as the catalyst in hydrothermal gasification."
3,Hydrothermal gasification experimental set-up,"2.2 Hydrothermal gasification experimental set-up All the experiments in this study were conducted in a stainless steel (SS316) fixed bed tubular batch reactor. The schematics of the reactor and its operating procedures have been described by Okolie et al. [37]. The fixed bed tubular reactor has an outer and inner diameter of 1.3 cm and 0.9 cm, respectively with a length of 40 cm. In addition to the tubular batch reactor, the hydrothermal gasification assembly also consisted of a split furnace, thermocouples, pressure relief valves, pressure gauges, check valves, 2-µm filters, gas-liquid separating cylinder and moisture trap column. The tubings and fittings were made of SS316 and purchased from Swagelok Central Ontario, Mississauga, Canada. For the non-catalytic hydrothermal gasification, biomass samples and deionized water were loaded into the batch reactor based on the required BTW ratio. However, for the catalytic gasification, the homogeneous (KOH) catalyst solution at 3 wt% concentration was prepared with deionized water and introduced into the batch reactor along with the biomass. Nitrogen gas was used to create an inert atmosphere inside the gasification set-up and pressurize the reactor to an initial 5–10 MPa depending on the reaction temperature. The fixed bed reactor was heated using the ATS Series 3210 split furnace connected to an ATS temperature control system (Applied Test Systems, Butler, USA) while the Omega Type-K thermocouples (Spectris Canada Inc., Laval, Canada) constantly recorded the temperature of the reactor. Based on our previous studies on improved gas yields, the heating rate of our hydrothermal gasification reactor was maintained at 30 °C/min [18]. After attaining the desired temperature, the reactor was maintained for the duration of the anticipated residence time. After completion of the gasification reaction, the hot vapors including condensable volatiles and permanent gases left the reactor into the gas-liquid separating cylinder for condensation and gravimetric separation of gases and liquid products. The gas products were made to pass through a moisture trap column (Praxair Canada Inc., Mississauga, Canada) to remove moisture and residual volatiles before collection in Tedlar bags (Environmental Sampling Supply, San Leandro, USA) and analyzed in a gas chromatography system. The reactor was cooled down by spraying cold water and disassembled from the set-up before recovering the solid product (hydrochar)."
4,"Effects of temperature, biomass-to-water ratio, residence time and biomass particle size","2.3 Effects of temperature, biomass-to-water ratio, residence time and biomass particle size Hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw was performed at a pressure range of 23–25 MPa to investigate the influence of temperature (300–500 °C), biomass-to-water ratio, BTW (1:5 and 1:10), residence time (30–60 min) and biomass particle size (0.13 mm and 0.8 mm). SbCW gasification was performed at subcritical temperature and pressure (i.e. 300 °C and 22 MPa) while SCW gasification was carried out at supercritical temperature and pressure (400 °C and 500 °C; 25 MPa). Deionized water was used as a reaction medium for all the hydrothermal experiments. After obtaining the maximum temperature and BTW, two different biomass particle size were examined for gas yields. Particle size A referred to the biomass with the particle size of 0.8 mm, whereas Particle size B indicated biomass particle size of 0.13 mm. After optimizing the temperature, BTW and particle size, the effects of residence time on gas yields from soybean straw and flax straw were studied. Using all the values that produces maximum hydrogen yield, a comparative evaluation of product distribution during hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw and flax straw was conducted to investigate how the change in physicochemical properties influence the product yield. The gas yields were expressed as the number of moles of an individual gas per gram of biomass [38,39]. The total gas yield was evaluated as the sum of each type of gas per gram of biomass. The H2 selectivity, carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) and lower heating values (LHV) was calculated using Eq. (1), (2) and (3), respectively [19,37,40]. The values of H2, CO, CH4 and C n H m in Eq. (1–3) depict the molar concentration of the gaseous products. Hydrogen selectivity (HS): (1) H S % = M o l e s o f H 2 S u m o f m o l e s o f C O , C O 2 , C H 4 a n d C 1 - C 4 Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE): (2) C G E % = S u m o f t h e n u m b e r o f m o l e s o f c a r b o n i n C O , C O 2 a n d C H 4 N u m b e r o f m o l e s o f c a r b o n i n t h e f e e d s t o c k Lower heating value (LHV): (3) L H V ( k J / N m 3 ) = 4.2 × 30.3 × C O + 25.8 × H 2 + 85.4 × C H 4 + 151.3 × C n H m"
5,Biomass and product characterization,"2.4 Biomass and product characterization The amount of moisture, ash, volatile and fixed carbon (proximate analysis) of soybean straw and flax straw were determined using the standard ASTM procedures [41–43]. For moisture determination, about 1 g of biomass sample was weighed in a crucible and heated for 2 h inside a muffle furnace at 105 ± 3 °C. The weight difference of the samples placed in the crucible after drying indicates the amount of moisture present. Following the same procedure, the ash and volatile matter contents were determined as the difference in the weight when 1 g of the sample was heated at 575 ± 10 °C for 4 h and 950 ± 10 °C for 7 min, respectively. The fixed carbon content was calculated as the difference of moisture, ash and volatile matter. An Elementar Vario EL III CHNS analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany) was used for ultimate analysis to measure the elemental composition (i.e. carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen contents) in soybean straw, flax straw and their derived hydrochars. Oxygen content was calculated as the difference between the amounts of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and ash. The experimental higher heating value (HHV) of soybean straw, flax straw and hydrochars were measured using a 6400 Automatic Isoperibol Calorimeter (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, USA). The theoretical HHV was evaluated using the Friedl’s formula in Eq. (4) [44]. Vaezi et al. [45] compared the theoretical HHV values obtained using three different empirical correlations (Friedl’s, Demirbas’ and Sheng’s formula) (Eq. 4–6) based on C, H and Ocompositions in wt% with experimental measurements for a wide variety of biomass materials. Friedl’s formula showed the least deviation from experimental values among the three correlations. Therefore, it was used to estimate the HHV values in this study. Friedl’s formula: (4) H H V ( M J / k g ) = ( 3.55 × C 2 ) - ( 232 × C ) - ( 2230 × H ) + ( 51.2 × C × H ) + ( 131 × N ) + 20600 Demirbas’ formula: (5) H H V ( M J / k g ) = 33.5 × C + 142.3 × H - 15.40 × O - 14.5 × N 100 Sheng’s formula: (6) H H V ( M J / k g ) = 0.3137 × C + 0.7009 × H + 0.0318 × O - 1.3675 The gaseous products (i.e. H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and C1-C4 hydrocarbons) obtained from hydrothermal gasification were analyzed using an Agilent GC 7820A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The gas chromatography system was equipped with a capillary column, three packed columns and a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon with the detector and column temperature kept at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The concentrations of CO, CH4 and H2 were measured with the Ultimetal HayesepQ T 80/100 mesh column, while the concentrations of other gases such as CO2 and C2-C4 were evaluated with the Ultimetal Hayesep T 80/100 mesh column. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTA) for soybean straw and flax straw were conducted using a TGA Q500 instrument (TA Instruments – Waters LLC, New Castle, DE, USA). The TGA-DTA analysis was studied under a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 mL/min to determine the devolatilization behavior of the agricultural residues. About 10–15 mg of the biomass samples were heated up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The pattern of weight loss with elevating temperature was observed to determine the thermal stability of the feedstock and the fraction of the volatile components. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the liquid effluents produced from the hydrothermal gasification reaction was performed with a Trace 1310 Gas Chromatograph and a TSQ Duo Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to determine the group of organic compounds. The temperature of the source was at 250 °C with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. To prepare the test samples for GC–MS analysis, each liquid effluent sample was dissolved in acetone with 1:10 vol/vol. Nearly, 1 μL of the prepared sample was precisely injected into the system at an initial oven temperature of 40 °C for a minute holding time using a split ratio and split flow of 50:1and 60 mL/min, respectively. The temperature was then programmed for an increase up to 150 °C at a flow rate of 5 °C/min, followed by a final rise to 320 °C at 10 °C/min for 5 min holding time. The mass spectra of the liquid effluents were obtained from 50 to 650 m/z with the peaks identified using the standard NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) library. Chromeleon™ 7.2 Chromatography Data System (CDS) software was used for all the analysis and comparison."
6,Thermodynamics model analysis,"2.5 Thermodynamics model analysis 2.5.1 Thermodynamic modeling In this study, the experimental product composition was compared with theoretical equilibrium values from thermodynamic modeling. This is important to ascertain how far the experimental product composition, especially in terms of H2 yield deviates from the theoretical values. Consequently, it is easier to define a research gap related to catalyst design, process optimization and simulation for scale-up [46]. Additionally, thermodynamic equilibrium is important in energy evaluations and to determine whether a particular chemical process is energetically sustainable [47,48]. In this field, there are two approaches to thermodynamic modeling, namely stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric. While the stoichiometric approach requires that the different reactions taking place should be identified, the non-stoichiometric approach is in contrast [47]. The latter is based on the Gibbs free energy minimization method (GFMM). Since hydrothermal gasification involves a series of complex reactions with the formation of several intermediates, the GFMM method was selected because it does not require the identification of intermediate reactions. This method requires that each product species should be identified following, which the calculations are made to determine the distribution of products for ensuring that the chemical reaction approaches a minimum Gibbs free energy value [37]. The GFMM method was used for thermodynamic modeling in this study for the following reasons. Firstly, SbCW and SCW gasification are complex processes comprising several intermediate steps, which often makes it difficult to identify all the involved chemical reactions and intermediate reactions. Furthermore, several researchers used this approach and reported good agreement with experimental values [47,49–52]. The Aspen Plus software v7.3 (AspenTech, Bedford, USA) was used for thermodynamic modeling. Aspen Plus is a commercial chemical process simulator widely used in most process simulation. The program operates on a steady-state with a built-in array of physical properties database that is very useful during thermodynamic calculations. Flowsheet can be designed in Aspen Plus by using the unit operation blocks while specifying each component present in the reaction [53]. 2.5.2 Aspen Plus process description In the Aspen Plus program, there is no readymade model relating to hydrothermal gasification; therefore, it is important to simulate the entire process into different unit operations. The schematics of the hydrothermal gasification process design flowsheet developed using Aspen Plus is shown in Fig. 1 . The flowsheet is designed in a simple format to make provision for adjustments and scale up in the future. The flowsheet represents a typical description of a model experimental set-up that has been utilized in a few previous studies in this field with slight modification [51,54–56]. The description of the blocks included in the flowsheet and their block ID is provided in Table 1 . Two blocks used to simulate the hydrothermal gasification reactor are the RYield and RGibbs blocks. Aspen Plus defines lignocellulosic biomass as a non-conventional stream containing heterogeneous solid with no identified molecular weight. To include such stream in the model, the RYield reactor block was used to decompose the biomass (CHµOαClβNsS∞ (ASH)z (H2O)k) into its conventional components (C, H2, O2, N2, Cl2, H2O, ash and S) based on the proximate and ultimate analyses (Eq. (7)). (7) C H μ O α C l β N s S ∞ ASH z H 2 O k = ϑ C + μ / 2 H 2 + α / 2 O 2 + β / 2 C l 2 + s / 2 N 2 + ∞ S + z ASH + 1 - ϑ C + k H 2 O + Q where ϑ and Q are the carbon conversion (%) and heat of decomposition, respectively. A calculator block is included in the RYield block and the function was carried out through a programmed FORTRAN subroutine statement (Table S1, Supplementary materials). It should be mentioned that the enthalpy from the outlet stream (S-DECOM) is not the same as that of the entering stream (BIOMASS) because of the splitting of chemical bonds (Fig. 1). Therefore, the heat stream ‘QT’ was added between the RYield and RGibbs to balance the enthalpy. The stream ‘S-DECOM’ was then mixed with incoming preheated water (S2) in the MIXER before being sent to the RGibbs block (S11 stream) where the calculations of Gibbs free minimization is carried out at a specified temperature and pressure. ‘S’ represents the material stream while ‘Q’ signifies the heat stream. The product species leaving the RGibbs reactor (HSYNGAS) consisted of gases such as CO, CO2, CH4, H2, H2O and C2-C4 hydrocarbons [57]. The product stream (HSYNGAS) is cooled (COOLER) to ambient temperature, after which the pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure in an expansion valve. The gas-liquid separator (GL-SEP) helps to separate the liquid and gaseous products. Table 2 summarizes the assumptions made in the model, operating conditions and property packages used in the model. A water feed flow rate of 100 kg/h was assumed. However, to specify the required BTW ratio another calculator block (C2) was defined. The details of the calculator block and the FORTRAN subroutine code can be found in Table S2 (Supplementary material). The Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of states was used in this study for the thermodynamic modeling. Usually, high-pressure systems (>21 MPa) used during hydrothermal processes restrict the use of activity co-efficient methods, thus preferring the PR equation of states. Hydrothermal gasification occurs in two regions based on the reaction temperature and pressure, i.e. subcritical region (<375 °C) and supercritical region (>375 °C). In each of these regions, the dielectric constant and the properties of water vary from being non-polar to polar. Therefore, the PR equation of states is suitable in capturing the varying polar behavior of water under hydrothermal conditions. Moreover, the PR equation of states has been used by several authors for simulating hydrothermal gasification of biomass feedstocks [47,50,51,58]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Product distribution from hydrothermal gasification,"3.1 Product distribution from hydrothermal gasification Soybean straw was hydrothermally gasified at temperatures of 300–500 °C with BTW of 1:5 and 1:10, residence times of 15–60 min under a pressure range of 22–25 MPa. Table 3 shows the mass balance for the gaseous, liquid and solid products obtained from SbCW and SCW gasification of soybean straw. It can be seen from Table 3 that the gas yield increases with temperature while a decline in the yield of solid (hydrochars) and liquid products was observed. This shows a progression of gasification reaction with temperature. It should be mentioned that the relatively higher yield of liquid products is because of water, which acts as the reaction medium and a solvent. The total mass balance observed during the gasification experiments ranged from 68.8 to 86.7 wt%. The mass balance was susceptible to some inevitable experimental errors because of the technical challenges encountered during product collection, which could lead to some unaccounted product losses. For example, some fine char particles remained trapped in the gas-liquid separator during product collection before being entrained in the liquid effluents, thus creating some inaccuracies in measuring the mass of hydrochars. Furthermore, the weight percent of the gaseous product was estimated from the total gas yield, which may contain C2-C4 hydrocarbons. Adding these compounds to gas yield measurements could elevate the product yield. Similar challenges in mass balance calculations have been reported in the literature. For instance, mass balance ranges of 52.4–59.8 wt%, 84.9–95.6 wt%, 74–83 wt% and 85.9–93.5 wt% have been reported during the hydrothermal gasification of glucose [59], cellulose [37], pinecone [60] and lignin [61], respectively."
9,Physicochemical characterization of biomass and hydrochar,"3.2 Physicochemical characterization of biomass and hydrochar The proximate composition of soybean straw and flax straw is presented in Table 4 . Flax straw demonstrated higher contents of volatile matter (83.3 wt%) and moisture (9.3 wt%) compared to soybean straw. In contrast, soybean straw had higher ash content (4.6 wt%) and fixed carbon (8.9 wt%) than that of flax straw. Soybean straw and flax straw both had a relatively high volatile matter and low ash content, which makes them good candidates for energy production through different thermochemical conversion processes. The thermogravimetric analysis of soybean straw and flax straw is given in Fig. 2 a. The thermal decomposition of the agricultural residues occurs in three different stages related to their weight losses [62]. The thermal decomposition of agricultural residues begins at 80–210 °C, which corresponds to the removal of moisture and light volatile matter due to the hygroscopic behavior of the agricultural residues [63]. The second stage, which is the main decomposition step, involves the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose at 210–400 °C. The final step is observed as lignin decomposes at 400–800 °C [64]. The devolatilization pattern of soybean straw and flax straw appeared quite similar as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The differential weight loss patterns for soybean straw and flax straw is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The relative intensities of the peaks in the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves could be attributed to the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents. Three main peaks were identified from the DTG curves of flax straw and soybean straw. The major peaks in the temperature ranges of 200–300 °C, 250–350 °C and 200–500 °C corresponded to the thermal degradation of hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin, respectively [65]. According to the DTG profile of flax straw, there is the main peak at 360 °C, which is preceded by a very small hump at 270 °C, these correspond to two different degradation sub-regions of hemicellulose and cellulose. Similar peaks were found for soybean straw at 340 °C and 240 °C, respectively. Additionally, the presence of a shoulder peak at 410–520 °C could be attributed to the presence of lignin. Huang et al. [62] studied the pyrolysis kinetics of soybean straw using the thermogravimetric analysis under an argon atmosphere at different heating rates of 5–30 K/min. The maximum weight loss of the straw due to pyrolysis decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose was observed at 453–673 K. The ultimate analysis of soybean straw and flax straw along with the hydrochars derived from SbCW (300 °C) and SCW (400–500 °C) gasification of soybean straw are presented in Table 5 . Between the two agricultural residues, flax straw had higher C, H and N contents of 47.78, 5.37 and 0.84 wt%, respectively. Soybean straw contained 41.98 wt% C, 5.05 wt% H, 0.46 wt% N and 0.45 wt% O. The C content of soybean hydrochars increased from 53.75 wt% at 300 °C to 80.56 wt% at 500 °C. Maximum C content in biochar at higher temperatures is due to the enhanced dehydration and decomposition reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, which lead to aromatization of biochar [66,67]. Thus, the hydrochars obtained at increased temperature SCW conditions are perceived to be more carbonaceous and stable. Moreover, the experimental HHV also increased with temperature in the following order soybean straw (16.4 MJ/kg) < flax straw (17.33 MJ/kg) < soybean straw hydrochar-300 °C (19.56 MJ/kg) < soybean straw hydrochar-400 °C (24.01 MJ/kg) < soybean straw hydrochar-500 °C (29.98 MJ/kg) (Table 5). The higher HHVs of hydrochars were also reflected in the van Krevelen diagram (Fig. 3 ). This diagram reveals that the agricultural residues and their hydrochars at low temperatures had higher atomic ratios O/C and H/C compared to the hydrochars produced at high temperatures (SCW conditions). Through hydrothermal gasification at high temperatures, the composition of the hydrochars resembles that of coal by becoming more carbonaceous with respect to lower oxygen and hydrogen contents. Therefore, the hydrochars obtained at high-temperature SCW conditions could undergo further processing to produce activated carbon, which has many industrial applications [67]."
10,Parametric studies during hydrothermal gasification of biomass,"3.3 Parametric studies during hydrothermal gasification of biomass To investigate the influence of temperature (300–500 °C) on the SbCW and SCW gasification of soybean straw, a fixed particle size A (0.8 mm), BTW ratio of 1:5 BTW ratio, residence time of 45 min and pressure range of 22–25 MPa were selected. As can be seen in Fig. 4 a that elevated temperature favored the hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw. As the temperature rose from 300 °C (SbCW) to 500 °C (SCW), the yield of CH4, H2, CO2 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons increased. H2 yield elevated from 0.99 mmol/g at 300 °C to 3.39 mmol/g at 500 °C. Similarly, the yield of CH4, CO2 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons also increased at 500 °C to 1.73 mmol/g, 4.61 mmol/g and 0.38 mmol/g, respectively. In contrast, the yield of CO decreased slightly at higher temperatures. Based on the higher gas yields, the desired gasification temperature selected in this study is 500 °C (i.e. SCW condition). At supercritical conditions, two main reactions are inherent such as water-gas shift reaction and steam reforming reactions [68]. In water-gas shift reaction, CO and water vapor react to produce H2 and CO2 [22]. Therefore, the consumption of CO during water-gas shift reaction and the production of H2 and CO2 could be responsible for the elevated CO2 and H2 yields at higher temperatures. Nanda et al. [69] have reported similar findings during hydrothermal gasification of wheat straw as they observed an increase in H2 (0.26 to 2.98 mmol/g), CH4 (0.27 to 1.42 mmol/g) and CO2 (1.10 to 5.30 mmol/g) yield with a rise in temperature from 300 to 550 °C. Table 6 shows the total gas yield, CGE, LHV and H2 selectivity. An increment in the individual gas yield with temperature led to an upsurge in the total gas yield by a factor of almost two (5.1 mmol/g at 300 °C to 10.1 mmol/g at 500 °C) in the case of soybean straw. Likewise, the H2 selectivity also increased with temperature from 300 °C (24.2%) to 500 °C (50.4%). Greater values of LHV (1229 kJ/Nm3) and CGE (17.1%) were observed at 500 °C in comparison to 300 °C (LHV: 239 kJ/Nm3 and CGE: 9.87%). The increase in total gas yields with rising temperatures further highlights its influence during hydrothermal gasification and shows the superiority of SCW over SbCW in terms of gas yield and gasification efficiency. At SbCW, ionic mechanisms are dominant while free radical ions are favorable at SCW gasification conditions [20]. The free radical mechanism helps to improve the dissolution of organic compounds and reactants in SCW, thereby escalating the gas yields [70]. The rise in LHV values with temperature could be because of the elevated concentrations of C2-C4 hydrocarbons and CH4 at high temperatures. After finding the desired temperature that produced the maximum gaseous yield, the effect of two BTW ratios were examined at a constant temperature (500 °C), Particle size A (0.8 mm), residence time (45 min) and pressure range of 22–25 MPa (Fig. 4b). The total gas yield (12.6 mmol/g), CGE (21.9%) and LHV (1764 kJ/Nm3) were relatively higher during 1:10 BTW ratio of soybean straw gasification (Table 6). However, the H2 selectivity was lower (43.8%) for the BTW 1:10 ratio compared to the 1:5 BTW ratio (50.4%). Furthermore, the yields of H2 (3.86 mmol/g), CH4 (3.2 mmol/g) and CO2 (5.28 mmol/g) were higher for 1:10 BTW ratio (Fig. 4b). On the contrary, the CO yield declined at a 1:10 BTW ratio. The superior gas yield at 1:10 BTW ratio could be attributed to the function of water in hydrothermal gasification. Since water is known to act as a reactant, catalyst and solvent during hydrothermal gasification, an increment in the amount of water could favor the formation of desired products and gasification efficiency [21,25]. The effect of biomass particle size during hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw at a fixed temperature of 500 °C, 1:10 BTW ratio, residence time of 45 min and pressure range of 22–25 MPa is shown in Fig. 4c. Reducing the biomass particle size influenced the gas yields and product composition. H2 yield increased from 3.86 mmol/g (with Particle size A: 0.8 mm) to 6.61 mmol/g (with Particle size B: 0.13 mm). Similarly, the CO2 and CO yields also elevated with a decrease in the biomass particle size. On the contrary, the CH4 yield declined from 3.2 to 2.26 mmol/g with a decrease in particle size. The influence of biomass particle size can be explained by considering the surface area of smaller and larger particles. Smaller particles contain a large surface area per unit mass, which exposes them to the reaction vicinity efficiently [20]. Therefore, the heat and mass transfer are greatly enhanced to facilitate the solubility and degradation of biomass particles during hydrothermal gasification. Lu et al. [71] have reported comparable results on the influence of biomass particle size on hydrothermal gasification. The authors gasified 2 wt% rice straw and sodium carboxymethylcellulose with biomass particle sizes passing through 40–80 mesh and <80 mesh at 650 °C and 25 MPa for 30 s. Biomass with smaller particle size resulted in higher H2 yield (17 mol/kg) compared to biomass with larger particle size (13.7 mol/kg). Regardless, the additional cost of energy consumption during biomass grinding should also be accounted for during feedstock processing. The influence of residence time (15–60 min) for soybean straw with biomass Particle size B (0.13 mm) at temperature of 500 °C and BTW ratio of 1:10 was investigated (Fig. 4d). It is clear that H2 yield elevated from 3.42 mmol/g (at 15 min) to 6.62 mmol/g (at 45 min) followed by a decline to 4.85 mmol/g (at 60 min). Similarly, CO2 yield also increased from 4.51 mmol/g (at 15 min) to 5.46 mmol/g (at 45 min) with a slight decrease to 5.41 mmol/g (at 60 min). Moreover, CO yield enhanced from 0.02 mmol/g (at 15 min) to 0.31 mmol/g (at 45 min) after which it declined to 0.04 mmol/g (at 60 min). In contrast, CH4 yield increased steadily with residence time from 1.26 mmol/g (at 15 min) to 2.76 mmol/g (at 60 min) indicating methanation reaction. The CGE and LHV are also favored at longer residence times. The CGE amplified from 15.5% (at 15 min) to 21.6% (at 60 min) while the LHV augmented by 39% with an increase in residence time (Table 6). In contrast, H2 selectivity increased up to a maximum value of 63% at 45 min after which it decreased to 56.8% at 60 min. Similarly, the total gas yield amplified to 14.9 mmol/g (at 45 min) followed by a decline to 13.42 mmol/g (at 60 min). Longer residence time could favor hydrogenation and methanation reactions by consumes CO and H2 to produce CH4 (Eq. (8) and (9)), thereby reducing the yields of H2 and CO as well as H2 selectivity [72,73]. Hydrogenation reaction: (8) C O + 2 H 2 → C H 4 + 0.5 O 2 Methanation reaction: (9) C O + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O Based on the observation from the parametric studies, the desired reaction conditions for hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw were: Temperature, 500 °C; BTW, 1:10; Biomass particle size B (0.13 mm) and residence time, 45 min. Flax straw was also hydrothermally gasified using the above-mentioned maximum conditions to make a comparison of its performance with those of soybean straw. As can be seen from Fig. 5 , soybean straw had the highest H2 (6.62 mmol/g), CO (0.31 mmol/g) and CO2 (5.42 mmol/g) yields compared to that of flax straw. On the other hand, flax straw had H2, CO and CO2 yields of 3.82, 0.1 and 5.52 mmol/g, respectively. On the other hand, CH4 (2.43 mmol/g) and C1-C4 hydrocarbon (0.34 mmol/g) yields were higher for flax straw. The total gas yield (14.9 mmol/g), H2 selectivity (63%) and LHV (1592 kJ/Nm3) were higher for soybean straw (Table 6). The superior H2, CO and CO2 for soybean straw could be attributed to its low lignin content compared to flax straw. The better performance of soybean straw could be because of the higher ash content (4.6 wt%), which is almost 1.7 times higher than that of flax straw (Table 4). Ash from herbaceous biomass is known to contain some alkali minerals such as Ca, Mg, Na, P and K, which have catalytic effects during pyrolysis, liquefaction or gasification [74,75]."
11,Thermodynamic equilibrium predictions,"3.4 Thermodynamic equilibrium predictions Thermodynamic equilibrium predictions of the hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw at 300–500 °C and 1:10 BTW ratio were compared with the experimental results under similar conditions (Fig. 6 ). In the present study, higher molecular weight C2-C4 hydrocarbons were assumed negligible in our thermodynamic predictions owing to their insignificant theoretical values from the thermodynamic models (Fig. 4). Therefore, the experimental yield was analyzed and compared with thermodynamic predictions for the H2, CH4, CO and CO2. As can be seen in Fig. 6 that the non-catalytic hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw exhibited a large deviation from theoretical yields for CH4, CO2 and H2 yields at the temperature range of study with CO2 exhibiting the largest deviation. On the other hand, the CO yield correlates with the theoretical yield. However, it should be noted that the experimental observations did not exceed the theoretical values obtained from thermodynamic models. To estimate the extent to which our experimental yield deviates from the theoretical yield obtained from thermodynamic predictions, a new term RDev was introduced. It is defined as the ratio of the experimental yield to the equilibrium yield (expressed in percentage). The RDev values approaching 100% signifies that the experiments attain equilibrium and the yield obtained is the maximum theoretical yield. The RDev values of CH4, CO2 and H2 yields for the non-catalytic gasification of soybean straw at 500 °C were estimated as 17.9%, 27% and 57.6%, respectively. Similarly, for the non-catalytic gasification of flax straw under the same experimental conditions, RDev values of CH4, CO2, and H2 yields were calculated as 16%, 27.1% and 37.4%, respectively. The deviations between experimental observations and thermodynamic yields have been documented in literature as shown in Table 7 . The deviations in experimental and thermodynamic equilibrium predictions in this study at longer residence times of 45 min could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) The experiments were performed in a batch reactor without reactor mixing. The absence of agitation or mixing could restrict heat and mass transfer by reducing the contact between the biomass particles and water molecules. (ii) The presence of temperature gradient in the reactor could also be responsible for the deviation from equilibrium prediction results. Some lighter intermediate compounds formed could stay trapped in the cooler zones of the reactor. These compounds are prevented from participating in further reactions [78]. (iii) There is no preheater installed in the reactor, the biomass and water mixture are introduced into the reactor to polymerize into heavy molecular weight compounds (e.g. char and tar) [79,80]. The heavy molecular weight compounds may require longer residence time to decompose into gases. (iv) Longer residence time could enhance the decomposition of intermediates into products [81]. As can be seen from Table 7 that most of the studies on SCWG have been performed in the batch reactor because of its simplicity and the ability to effectively gasify solid feedstocks [22]. The heterogeneity of lignocellulosic biomass and their insolubility in water makes it challenging to utilize continuous reactors. Most studies that reported the use of continuous or semi-continuous reactor either operate on biomass model compounds or real biomasses that are soluble in water [20]. Moreover, continuous reactors are usually prone to plugging and non-uniform mixing of biomass in the water. To enhance the gas yields towards equilibrium the hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw and flax straw was carried out at maximum operating conditions in the presence of KOH catalyst (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 ). Alkali homogeneous catalyst (KOH) was selected in this study because of its ability to enhance the water-gas shift reaction and methanation reaction leading to improved H2, CH4 and CO2 yield. During hydrothermal reactions, KOH undergoes initial hydrolysis to form potassium acetate (CH3COOK), which is further decomposed into potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) and CH4 [82]. Furthermore, a recent exergy analysis study reported the catalytic activity of different homogeneous catalysts during hydrothermal gasification to be in the order: Na2CO3 < NaOH < K2CO3 < KOH [83]. As illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, KOH catalyst elevated the yield of H2, CO2 and CH4 close to equilibrium values. For soybean straw, H2, CO2 and CH4 yields increased by approximately 15% (7.64 mmol/g), 17% (6.37 mmol/g) and 18% (2.62 mmol/g), respectively. Similarly, flax straw demonstrated an increase in H2 (57% or 5.99 mmol/g), CO2 (13% or 6.24 mmol/g) and CH4 (15% or 2.78 mmol/g) with KOH catalyst. Similar to the gas yields (of H2, CO2 and CH4), there was also an increase in the RDev values with the use of catalysts as indicated in Table 7. RDev values for soybean straw elevated from 56.7% to 66.6% for H2, 17.9% to 21.2% for CH4 and 27% to 31.4% for CO2. Likewise, for catalytic gasification of flax straw, the RDev values were found to be 58.7% for H2, 18.3% for CH4 and 30.6% for CO2. The improvement in RDev values signifies that the KOH catalyst drives the reaction towards equilibrium."
12,Compositional analysis of liquid products,"3.5 Compositional analysis of liquid products The compositional analysis of liquid effluents obtained from the non-catalytic hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw at 300–500 °C, 45 min of residence time with 1:10 BTW ratio and 22–25 MPa pressure was performed through GC–MS. Table 8 summarizes the identified compound from the GC–MS analysis of the liquid effluent obtained from hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw. The main products identified in the liquid effluents were grouped into alcohols, organic acids, furans, phenolic derivatives, ketones, aldehydes, aromatics and other compounds with a relative area <1% of the total integrated area. The percentage area of each compound identified is defined as the ratio of each identified compound chromatographic area to the total area expressed in percentage [84]. As can be seen in Fig. 9 that with a rise in temperature from 300 °C (SbCW) to 400 °C (SCW), there was a decrease in the concentration of aromatics, alcohols and organic acids. On the other hand, the levels of phenols and aldehydes were utmost at 400 °C. However, with a further elevation in temperature to 500 °C, the concentrations of aldehydes, phenols, acids decreased while that of alcohols and ketones increased. Cellulose and hemicellulose present in the straw undergo hydrolysis at SbCW temperatures 300 °C due to ionic mechanisms to produce organic acids, whereas lignin produces phenols, aldehydes and aromatics at SCW temperatures (>400 °C) due to free radical mechanisms [17,22]. The lowering of acids, phenols and aldehydes at 500 °C indicates their thermal cracking and decomposition to produce gases and lighter hydrocarbons during gasification."
13,Conclusions,"This study explores for the first time the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of soybean straw and flax straw. The effects of temperature (300–500 °C) BTW (1:5 and 1:10), biomass particle size (Particle size A: 0.8 mm and Particle size B: 0.13 mm) and residence time (30–60 min) on the gas yields and composition were investigated. The major products obtained during the hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw and flax straw were H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and C1-C4 hydrocarbons. The desired temperature, BTW ratio, biomass particle size and residence time were found to be 500 °C, 1:10, Particle size B and 45 min, respectively. The gasification of soybean straw at the aforementioned conditions resulted in H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and C2-C4 yields of 6.62, 5.46, 0.31 and 0.30 mmol/g, respectively. At the same experimental conditions, the total gas yield of 14.9 mmol/g, CGE of 20.2% and H2 selectivity of 63% was obtained from soybean straw gasification. A comparative evaluation of gasification efficiency between the two agricultural crop residues showed that soybean straw exhibited superior product yield and gasification efficiency. The thermodynamic estimations show that the experimental observations are far from equilibrium values. However, the use of the KOH catalyst in our study significantly improved the gas yield close to the theoretical observations. The insights from the thermodynamic predictions could provide information that can be useful for catalyst development, process optimization and scaling up. In summary, the findings from this study suggest that soybean straw and flax straw could serve as possible feedstocks to produce H2-rich syngas through hydrothermal gasification."
