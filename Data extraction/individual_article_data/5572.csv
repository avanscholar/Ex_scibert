0,Introduction,"Molecular interaction studies significantly contribute to the understanding of different intermolecular forces, biological functions and stimulate developing supramolecular devices [1,2]. Investigation of specific molecular interactions present in non-ideal systems is of importance in chemical and pharmaceutical industries [3]. Existence of strong intermolecular attractions in liquid mixtures results in the formation of charge transfer or H-bonded complexes depending on the components of the system [4,5]. These complexes play vital role in the field of solar cells, organic semiconductors, photo-catalysis, biochemical and electrochemical processes [6–9]. The excess thermo-acoustic properties of liquid mixtures provide information regarding the strength of molecular interaction between molecules of the components. Knowledge of thermodynamic parameters in such systems is useful in designing equipment in chemical separation, liquid flow, heat and mass transfer [10–13]. Four factors influence the stability of complexes, namely, concentration, temperature, pressure and polarity of the medium. The influence of solvent on the formation of CT complexes has been studied by some authors and correlated the stability of complexes with solvent parameters like dielectric constant [14,15]. Spectroscopy has been employed to study the influence of temperature and pressure on the complex formation and to determine the free energy, enthalpy, entropy and volume of charge transfer reactions [16]. It has been reported that mixtures containing amines exhibit very interesting features with alcohols, phenols and ethers [17–21]. Benzylamine (BA), an aralkyl amine is mainly used in chemical synthesis and for production of pesticides, polymer auxiliaries, pharmaceutical substances and n-propyl amine (NPA) is an aliphatic primary amine used in the production of agricultural chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients [22,23]. The two ethers anisole (ANI) and diphenyl ether (DPE) employed in the present work are aromatic ethers. Anisole is precursor to perfumes, pheromones and pharmaceuticals. Diphenyl ether is used in the manufacture of perfumes and as solvent in petrochemical industry [24,25]. This paper deals with the determination of formation constant (K) values for BA-ANI, BA-DPE, NPA-ANA and NPA-DPE H-bonded complexes in n-hexane medium at different temperatures by ultrasonic method and to determine the thermodynamic parameters using K at different temperatures. Further an attempt has been made to confirm these interactions through UV Visible spectroscopic method at ambient temperature. The trend in K values of these complexes shows structural influence on the formation."
1,Experimental,"The chemicals used in the present study, their purity with CAS number, further purification, boiling point and purity check method are summarized in Table 1 . All measurements were conducted from freshly prepared solutions obtained by mixing accurate masses of pure liquids in the solvent (n-hexane) to get the required range of concentrations (0.02 M to 0.2 M). The measuring instruments were standardized using triple distilled water and the measurements were in good agreement with reported values in the literature. A single crystal variable path ultrasonic interferometer operating at a frequency of 2 MHz and supplied by Mittal enterprises, New Delhi, India (Model F-81) was used for ultrasonic velocity measurement. The accuracy of the instrument is ±0.1 ms−1. A 10 ml specific gravity bottle and Shimadzu digital electronic balance with an accuracy of ±0.1 mg were used for density measurements. The viscosity of the ternary liquid mixtures was measured accurately using Ostwald viscometer. The flow time of the liquid was measured with an electronic digital stopwatch of accuracy ±0.01 s. In all measurements, the temperature of solutions was maintained constant using a thermostatic water-bath, with an accuracy of 0.1 K. The experimental values of ultrasonic velocity (u), density (ρ) and viscosity (η) of pure liquids along with their corresponding reported literature values [26–38] are listed in Table 2. The standard relations used to calculate the various acoustic and excess thermo acoustic parameters using the measured values of ultrasonic velocity (u), density (ρ) and viscosity (η) are reported in literature [39,40]. .The stability constant values were calculated using the following equation proposed by Kannappan [41,42] (1) K = Y / ( b − Y ) 2 where Y = (a-k1/2 b)/(k-k1/2) in which k = x/y, K is the formation constant, x is the difference between ucal and uobs at lower concentration a, y is the difference between ucal and uobs at higher concentration b and ucal is the ultrasonic velocity of the mixture calculated from the mole fraction of the components using additive principle. This equation has been used for several systems and ‘K’ values for the formation of charge transfer and H-bonded complexes were reported [43,44]. In order to substantiate the validity of ultrasonic method, UV- spectral method is also used to calculate to determine K values at 303.15 K. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1650 model spectrophotometer with quartz cell of 1 cm optical path length. The solvent (n-hexane) was used for base line correction. The absorbance spectra were recorded in the region of 200–700 nm at a scanning rate of 0.2 nm/s and a slit width of 1cm. The‘K’ values were obtained in the spectral method from the absorbance values of UV spectra of complexes by employing Benesi-Hildebrand equation as reported [45]. The thermodynamic parameters ΔG, ΔH and ΔS for the formation of these complexes are also reported. Enthalpy of formation is calculated using Van't Hoff's equation (2) ln K = ( − Δ H / R ) ( 1 / T ) + Constant ln K values are plotted against (1/T) and ΔH can be calculated from the slope of the straight line. ΔG values are computed from ‘K’ values using the relation (3) Δ G = − RT ln K From the computed ΔG and ΔH values, ΔS values were calculated using Gibbs-Helmholtz equation [46] (4) Δ G = Δ H − T Δ S"
2,Results and discussion,"The measured ultrasonic velocity (u), density (ρ) and viscosity (η) values for the four ternary systems at four different temperatures are listed in Tables 3 and 4 . The computed values of various thermo-acoustical parameters for the four investigated systems at different temperatures are presented in the Tables 5–8 . The plots of ultrasonic velocity ‘u’ and molar volume (Vm) against equimolar concentration of solutes for the four systems are depicted in the Fig. 1 (a, b, c and d) and 2 (a, b, c and d) respectively. It may be pointed out that in the entire study [Amine] = [Ether] is maintained which is required to calculate the formation constant ‘K’ of the H-bonded complex. It can be seen from the data in Tables 3 and 4 as well as the plots in Figs. 1 and 2 that ultrasonic velocity increases non-linearly with concentration in all the systems. This shows that there are strong solute-solute interactions in all the four systems which may be intermolecular H-bonding between different solutes [19,20,44]. The trends in the other acoustical parameters (decrease in κ and Lf with increase in concentration) also support the existence of strong intermolecular interaction of hydrogen bond type between the amines and ethers [47–49]. Further, it may be observed from the trend in acoustical properties as a function of temperature that the strength of interactions decreases with increase in temperature which may be due to thermal agitation of the component molecules with rise in temperature. The deviations of acoustical parameters from the ideal behaviour of ternary solutions as a function of concentration and temperature are listed in the Tables 9–12 . The trend in the excess properties in the four ternary systems can be envisaged as a resultant of the following opposite effects: (a) breakdown of dipolar and hydrogen bonded self-association in amines (b) disruption of like molecular (ether-ether) interactions (c) amine-ether cross association and H-bonded interactions. Plots of excess ultrasonic velocity (uE) and excess adiabatic compressibility (κE) versus concentration for the ternary systems at different temperatures are shown in the Fig. 3 (a, b, c and d) and Fig. 4 (a, b, c and d) respectively. The uE is observed to be positive for NPA-DPE system at all temperatures but decreases with concentration. For NPA-ANI system, at low temperature uE is found to be negative but at high temperature it becomes positive. uE changes sign form positive to negative at 297.15 K and at 300.15 K. In the case of BA-DPE system (except at low temperature of 300.15 K) uE is positive. For BA-ANI system, uE changes sign from positive to negative at all temperatures at the intermediate concentration range of investigation. Positive deviation and change of sign in uE may be attributed to the existence of strong intermolecular interactions such as formation hydrogen bonded complex [50–52]. Further, the decreasing trend in uE with concentration may be attributed to the dominance of disruption of self-association in amines and reduction of speed of sound due to multi-component cluster formation. It may also be noted here that the behaviour of uE with temperature for all the four systems reveals the influence of thermal energy on the molecular interactions. The formation of similar kind of hydrogen bonded complexes and compact nature of the four ternary systems due to such strong interactions can be identified through the large negative deviations in κE [53–55]. This is very well reflected in the behaviour of Lf E values, which show increasingly negative deviation with concentration except in NPA-ANI system. The negative deviation in both κE and Lf E also reveals the possibility of interstitial accommodation or stacking in the liquid systems [56]. The growing association of multi-component clusters and the rupture of H-bonds in the primary amines can be identified through the large positive values of Vm E. The formation of H-bonded complexes between amines and ethers is clearly established through the positive HE values while the dominant behaviour of volume expanding factor is revealed through the increasingly negative deviations in πi E [57,58]. This behaviour of πi E is very well supported by the large negative deviations of viscosity (Δη) for all the four ternary systems in the concentration range of investigation."
3,UV-Vis spectroscopic study,"3.1 UV-Vis spectroscopic study The formation of H-bonded complex between amines and aromatic ethers was also confirmed through the recorded UV-Vis spectra according to Benesi-Heldebrand theory [45]. The spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5 (a, b, c and d) which were recorded by taking constant (1 × 10−2 M) concentration of ether and the excess and varying concentration of amine (0.1 M to 0.5 M). Fig. 5 shows a distinct shift in frequency and increased absorbance between the spectra of pure components and the solutions in n-hexane medium. Fig. 5 also illustrates difference in the wavelength of maximum absorption between the pure components and ternary solutions which is a clear indication of complex formation between amine and ether. A glance at the spectra depicts the wavelengths of maximum absorption obtained for BA-ANI, BA-DPE, NPA-ANI and NPA-DPE are 288 nm, 288 nm, 286 nm and 287 nm respectively. The stability constant for the ternary systems were computed from the slope and intercept values of B-H plots. Plots (1/[D] versus [A]/ABS) shown in Fig. 6 are drawn using the absorbance values of UV-Vis spectra for various H-donor (amine) concentrations [D] and a fixed H-acceptor (ether) concentration [A]. The obtained B-H plots (Fig. 6) show linear variation with positive slope and positive intercept which indicates the formation of 1:1 complex between the amine and ether in the four systems. Formation constant and molar absorptivity of the complex are calculated from the slope and intercept of B-H plot. The values of K, wavelength of maximum absorption of the complex (λCT) and molar absorptivity (ε) are listed in Table 15. It can be seen from the data that the stability of H-bonded complexes in n-hexane at 300.15 K is in the order BA-ANI < BA-DPE < NPA-ANI < NPA-DPE. It may be pointed out that the trend in K values for the four investigated systems at a given temperature obtained by spectral method is similar to that obtained by ultrasonic method."
4,Thermodynamic parameters,"3.2 Thermodynamic parameters The stability constants for the four H-bonded complexes formed between amines and ethers were calculated by employing Kannappan equation (acoustical method) at different temperatures from the measured values of ‘u’ and are presented in Table 13 . The thermodynamic parameters, free energy of formation (ΔG), enthalpy changes (ΔH) and entropy changes (ΔS) for the four systems are given in Table 14 . The stability constant values obtained through acoustic method are comparable to those obtained by applying Benesi-Hildebrand equation (optical method) at 303.15 K. Comparison of K values for the formation of ether-amine complexes is illustrated in Fig. 7 . K values along with free energy formation (ΔG), wavelength of maximum absorption (λmax) and molar absorptivity (εmax) values are given in the Table 15 . Perusal of ΔG values for the formation of complexes (Tables 14 and 15) shows that all the four complexes are thermodynamically stable as ΔG values are negative. It is known that ΔG for a process reflects the combined effect of ΔH and ΔS. The enthalpy of formation of the four complexes is acquired from the Van't Hoff plots (Fig. 8 a and 8b) of ln (K) versus 1/T. These plots are linear with positive slopes indicating that formation of complex is accompanied by negative enthalpy change. In other words the formation of the complex is exothermic [51]. It may be pointed out that ΔH values are more exothermic for BA systems than for NPA systems. However, we need to consider the contribution of entropy loss to the ΔG value. Entropy is influenced by the orientation and structural arrangement of component molecules in the complex. It has been suggested by both experimental and theoretical studies that in amine-ether systems there exists weak intermolecular attractions besides relatively stronger H-bonded interaction [44,59]. In the case of amine-ether mixtures containing aromatic systems several types of weak C-H..π interactions can exist besides H-bonds. Existence of these intermolecular forces in these systems increases compactness of the structure of the complex. When several such interactions are present the system becomes more compact. This is also supported by the smaller κ and Lf values in the case of systems containing BA compared to those in systems with NPA at a particular concentration and temperature (Tables 5–8) in the present study. There is loss of entropy during the formation of these complexes and hence ΔS are negative for all the four complexes. Further, in systems with BA both the components are aromatic and hence number of interaction and compactness is more in the two systems. This is evidenced from the large negative ΔS values for the two systems with BA. Consequently, ΔG values are less negative for BA-ANI and BA-DPE systems. This study shows that equilibrium point is determined between enthalpy and entropy effects [60]. The trend in the free energy formation of H-bonded complex between primary amines (BA and NPA) and aromatic ethers (ANI and DPE) suggests that stability of H-bonded complexes is in the order, BA-ANI < BA-DPE < NPA-ANI < NPA-DPE. This trend shows that BA forms a slightly less stable complex with the two investigated ethers than NPA. It has been reported that BA is relatively weaker base (pKb = 4.73) than NPA (pKb = 3.47) [61,59]. In the formation of these complexes, amine acts as H-donor and the nitrogen of the base is more electron rich in stronger base and it can be a better H-donor. This trend is observed in the present study. It is found that the stability of H-bonded complex between primary amine and ether is also influenced by the structure of ether. It is found that DPE forms more stable complex with the primary amine than ANI. This is because of the presence of two aromatic rings on either side of ether group in DPE which can release electron by mesomeric effect and the charge density on ether oxygen may be enhanced in DPE and hence it forms a stronger H-bond than ANI. This trend in stability is supported by K as well as ΔG values of the complexes. We can generalize from the observed data in the present study that thermodynamic stability of BA-ANI and BA-DPE complexes is less than that of NPA-ANI and NPA-DPE complexes."
5,Conclusions,"The thermodynamic stability of four molecular complexes formed between the pharmaceutically important amines (benzyl amine, n-propyl amine) and industrially useful ethers (anisole, diphenyl ether) in n-hexane medium is extensively investigated from the trend in acoustical and excess acoustical parameters with concentration. The formation constant of the H-bonded complexes is determined by ultrasonic and UV-Visible spectroscopic methods. K values determined by two different techniques follow similar trend. It is revealed that DPE forms stronger H-bonded complexes with the amines than ANI. It is also noted that in NPA-DPE system relatively stronger H- bond exists than in BA-ANI system. Thermodynamic properties (ΔG, ΔH and ΔS) for the complex formation are determined by acoustic and optical methods. These parameters establish that ether-amine H-bonded complexes are thermodynamically stable as evident from the negative ΔG values. Further, the formation of these complexes in n-hexane is exothermic. We observed that there is decrease in entropy during the formation of H-bonded complex between primary amine and ether. Further, the acoustical investigation also establishes that aliphatic-aromatic interactions are stronger than aromatic-aromatic interactions."
