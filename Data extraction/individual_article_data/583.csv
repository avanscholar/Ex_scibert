0,Introduction,"Energy production is one of the critical sectors in the development of a robust and dynamic economy of the developed and/or developing countries, which can cause environmental pollution (water [1], soil and atmosphere [2]) and serious health issues [3] due to the continuous consumption of fossil fuels such as petrol, coal and natural gas [4]. A census has been reached that despite efforts made for developing new technologies based on renewable energy resources, fossil fuels will remain the main energy supply for the next two decades [5]. Combustion is one of the well-established methods to release the energy content of fossil fuels, which contributes to the production of greenhouse gases (GHG) [6] and release of particulate materials (PM2.5) [7], CO2 and other environmental pollutants. PM2.5 strongly contributes to the increase in the number of patients with lung and gastric cancers [8], while CO2 is the main component severely affecting global warming and world climate change. Therefore, there is a need for further investigation aiming at identifying new processes for the production of clean fuels such as hydrogen or alcohols [9], while decreasing the emission of GHG and pollutants to the environment [10]. Assessments show that hydrogen is by far one of the promising clean fuels, which can be produced from renewable energy to replace the fossil fuels [11]. In comparison with fossil fuels, hydrogen with high lower heating value (LHV, 120 MJ/kg) offers higher energetic performance [12,13]. The current pathway for the production of hydrogen is through reforming of natural gas, which is an energy-intensive process. Apart from the energy aspect, the reforming process delivers a large amount of CO2 to the environment as the process requires several reactors to increase the chemical conversion extent of the reforming reaction. To suppress the emission of GHG, catalytic reforming process was developed to lower the operating temperature aiming at suppressing the emission of GHG. However, the presence of the catalyst in the reactor is associated with further complexities and technical challenge such as carbon deposition, catalyst sintering and deactivation [14], which in turn increase the operating cost of the plants [15]. These challenges are more intensified when catalysts need to be regenerated, which produces a large quantity of CO2 and CO. Another commercial pathway for the production of hydrogen is to utilise water electrolysis cells, however, electrolysis cells have low chemical efficiency (20 to 40%), which requires further improvement. Also, the challenges associated with the use of electrolysis such as a reliable energy storage solution for continuous production together with the corrosion of the electrodes require further study and development [16]. Recently special attention has been paid to the production of hydrogen carriers such as metal-based compounds and ammonia [17], which are suitable for hydrogen storage and transport. For on-site hydrogen production, chemical looping hydrogen production (CLHP) is a recently developed technology, which utilised two reactors namely the fuel and the air reactor [18]. To supply the required oxygen for the hydrogasification or water-splitting reaction, solid metal oxide particles or a molten metal oxide is used to provide a plausible heat and mass transfer medium, and to prevent any reactions between air and feedstock [19]. By doing this, nitrogen is prevented to appear in the gaseous products, which in turn promotes the quality of the produced fuels. This is in addition to the reduction in emission of GHG to the environment. The concept of CLHP has already been employed for synthetic gas production and hydrogen production via sulphur/iodine cycle [20], oxygen production [21], tri-generation energy and fuel systems [22]. In a lab-scale study, the CLHP has recently been demonstrated for producing hydrogen via metals such as copper, iron and cobalt oxides with 85% to 90% efficiency, followed by a series of experiments as a proof of the concept [23]. Likewise, thermodynamic assessment of the cycles of ammonia and nitrogen production integrated with a power block conducted by Juangsa et al. [24] showed that the efficiency and production rate of ammonia can be improved while different chemical looping systems are coupled in a plant. Since, the energy requirement of the proposed system can partially be supplied from exothermic reactors, the developed process showed a high efficiency of 69.3%. In another similar study, Aziz et al. [25] evaluated the exergy analysis of the same system to identify the efficiency and chemical conversion of the ammonia in a chemical looping system. It was found that in comparison with a conventional ammonia plant, the proposed system can decrease the total energy requirements by 43% (3.27 MW versus 5.76 MW for producing 1.0 tmol-N2 h−1). The highest efficiency of 66.9% was calculated for the proposed system together with efficiency of 0.23% for net power generation. Edrisi et al. [26] conducted a series of simulations to identify a plausible configuration and to propose a chemical looping process to produce ammonia. In the developed system, nitrogen and hydrogen were produced inside the plant. Hence, the production rate of ammonia improved by 40% in comparison with a conventional ammonia plant. However, emission of CO2 was one of the technical challenges of the proposed process. Despite potentials offered by chemical looping systems, the operating temperature is relatively high (e.g. T < 1500 °C), thereby limiting the oxygen carrier material to a narrow range of metal oxides. Moreover, the use of metal oxides induce other technical challenges such as sintering and particle deactivation, which add cost to the process [27]. Therefore, more investigation is still required to improve the technology readiness level (TRL) of the chemical looping systems. Development of the photo-sensitive semiconductors for nitrogen fixation is another promising technique for ammonia production in which nitrogen and steam react on a photo-sensitive substrate such as gallium nitride (GaN) nanowires with large specific surface area to produce ammonia. In the study conducted by Liu et al. [28], a photo-driven nitrogen fixation pathway was demonstrated in which a layer of gallium nitride nanowire was developed using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on silicon (Si) wafer. The developed photo-sensitive nano-material could produce ammonia at maximum rate of 450 μmol gcat−1 h−1 rate at room temperature up to 45 °C. This was a promising breakthrough, while it is in its early stage and requires further investigation. Similarly, Michalsky et al. [29] discovered a new pathway for producing ammonia from air, water and concentrated sunlight at ambient pressure using renewable energy integrated with metal nitride chemical looping system. By separating the general reaction of ammonia synthesis into two domains, a new degree of freedom was introduced to the system to add a catalyst for promoting the selectivity and efficiency of the system. The developed process promoted the role of lattice hydrogen in the ammonia evolution. The proposed system could generate ammonia at production rates of 56.3, 80.7, and 128 μmol per mol metal per min at 1 bar and above 550 °C via reduction of Mn6N2.58 to Mn4N and hydrogenation of Ca3N2 and Sr2N to Ca2NH and SrH2, respectively. The same process was also demonstrated Ashida et al. [30] to address the challenges associated with Haber-Bosch process. They used water and air on a new molybdenum-based catalyst at ambient conditions to produce ammonia and demonstrated that by combining samarium (II) di-odide and alcohols or water, nitrogen fixation reaction can be intensified on molybdenum catalyst to generate 4350 equivalents of ammonia with a turnover frequency of 117 min−1. Despite the successful demonstrations of ammonia evolution through photo-sensitive materials, further experiments are required to identify suitable materials with higher efficiency to promote the techno-economic viability and TRL of the process. Currently, ammonia is commercially produced through the nitrogen fixation driven by Haber-Bosch process (HB), which is an energy-intensive process requiring high pressure to shift the thermochemical equilibrium towards high ammonia production point [16]. To achieve this, catalysts (iron-based or transient metal-based) with high specific surface area is employed inside the reactor to increase the chemical conversion extent of the reaction. The HB process has extensively been studied in the literature and it has been shown that the process has reached its theoretical efficiency. Hence, investigation aiming at further decreasing the energy consumption of the process is not economically viable [31]. To bypass the challenges associated with the HB process, nitrogen fixation via sustainable chemical processes is one potential approach. In a sustainable process, not only the side products, but also the energy produced in the process can be consumed by the process itself, while lowering the potential emission of GHG and environmental pollutants (e.g. CO2, CO and H2O). Also, depending on the quality and type of the end-user, the product of a sustainable process can be altered by a change in the operating conditions of the plant. To develop a sustainable process, the reactions should thermodynamically be feasible to occur. Some reactions cannot be driven in the conventional reactions as the Gibbs free energy of the reaction ( Δ G ) is highly positive. Hence, a specific design and/or type of reactor is required to maintain the required energy for driving the reactions. Plasma reactor is one potential option, which provides a highly reactive environment and larger heat and mass transfer rate in comparison with conventional reactors [32]. Plasma is the fourth state of the matter, which includes atoms, molecules, ions, cations, and electrons together with heavy particles [33]. Despite the charged species, the plasma environment is neutral. The plasma reactor can be categorised into different classifications of thermal plasma (hot, equilibrium) [34] and non-thermal plasma (cold, non-equilibrium [35]), which both have their advantages and disadvantages [36]. If a thermal plasma is employed, almost all the reactive species have the same temperature and the conversion extent of the reactor meets the equilibrium extent. However, for a cold plasma, the chemical conversion is far from the equilibrium value, however from the economic and energetic performance point of view, its energy consumption is lower than thermal plasma [37]. To justify the use of a cold plasma reactor for the sustainable process, it is required to promote the performance of the reactor with symbiotic, assisting techniques such as using super-porous nano-electrodes, which facilitate the conversion of the reaction at lower temperatures, which currently ongoing in a project referred to as surface-confined fast-modulated Plasma (SCOPE) [38]. Nitrogen fixation is largely used for the production of ammonia, which is a key component for the production of fertiliser contributing to the agricultural sector. This is taken as motivation for the present study. The estimated rate of global industrial nitrogen fixation is around 413 Tg/year [39], which includes the production of nitric acid and ammonia for industrial and agricultural applications. Up to 2010, the ammonia production rate was 120 Tonnes of N/year and about 80% of it was dedicated to the agricultural sector to produce fertiliser, which in turn exponentially contributed to the quality and quantity of food production. Considering the environmental impact, a high quantity of CO2 is directly or indirectly emitted to environment equivalent to 1.30 kg of CO2/kg of ammonia, reaching 2.6 kg of CO2/kg of ammonia [40]. In light of above, following gaps are identified in the literature: 1) The current pathway for nitrogen fixation is Haber-Bosch which is energy-intensive and requires expensive catalysts and complex regeneration process, which adds to the final cost of ammonia production. Despite extensive research conducted on the efficiency improvement of the Haber-Bosch process, it has reached its theoretical efficiency. Hence, other approaches or alternative processes should be developed. 2) The Haber-Bosch process requires external energy and high-pressure units to shift the equilibrium towards the production of ammonia, which in turn emits large amount of CO2 to the environment. Since Haber-Bosch is an exothermic and pressurised process, hybridisation with renewable energy will not improve the sustainability and economic viability of the process. Hence, there is a need to develop green and sustainable processes to address the aforementioned gaps and technical challenges, while also suppressing the carbon emission to the environment. Also, the alternative process must be economically viable, while offering conditions to meet the sustainability and circular economy criteria. This is the main driver for conducting this research. Thus, in the present work, using the potential of plasma environment and plausible heat and mass transfer characteristics of liquid metals (here gallium), a novel process is developed to take advantage of chemical looping features and nitrogen fixation reaction for producing hydrogen and ammonia via a carbon-neutral and an environmentally benign process. Another novelty of the proposed system is reflected in the plasma reactor, which provide a highly reactive environment to complete the sustainability circle of the process. This is performed by converting the oxidised metal oxide (metal-containing component) to reduced metal in the plasma reactor to participate in the reaction again. Likewise, the proposed offers a great potential to be hybridised with renewable energy such as wind or concentrated photo voltaic system, which can promote the economic viability of the proposed system. Hence, a series of thermo-chemical equilibrium models are developed to assess the effect of different operating parameters including feed ratio, temperature and pressure of the reactors on the production of ammonia and hydrogen. In the present study, gallium is used as a surrogate for more complicated liquid metals. Thermodynamic stability phase diagrams of the gallium in reaction with other components such as nitrogen, steam and oxygen are also developed and studied to identify the best operating conditions for the proposed process. A new statistical model is developed with response surface methodology (RSM) to optimise the performance and operating conditions of the process."
1,Conceptual process design,"Figs. 1a and b presents the schematic diagram of the process proposed for the co-production of hydrogen and ammonia using liquid metals and a plasma reactor. In the present work, gallium (Ga) is proposed to be used as liquid metal and a medium for chemical reaction, which does not require high temperature to form a stable liquid metal phase. Another advantage of gallium is that it is not corrosive at low temperatures. The melting temperature of gallium is 29.7 °C, which is not solidified at ambient temperature or might need a trace heating during winter when the room temperature is less than the melting point of gallium. The proposed system uses three reactors including reactor R1 for gallium nitride (GaN) production from gallium (Ga) and nitrogen (N2), reactor R2 for ammonia, hydrogen and gallium oxide (Ga2O3) production from GaN and steam (H2O), and reactor R3 for dissociation of Ga2O3 and reproduction of gallium, which offers the sustainability of the process. In reactor R1, the following reaction occurs: (1) G a l + 1 2 N 2 g → G a N s , Δ H 100 ° C = - 136 k J m o l The above reaction is exothermic and the released thermal energy can partially be transported to reactor R2 using sensible heat carried by the GaN particles. The product of the reactor is a slurry of liquid gallium and solid particles, hence a kiln rotary reactor is proposed for this reaction which offers the following advantages [41]: 1) Sufficient residence time for contact between the gas, liquid and solid particles; 2) Great heat and mass transfer coefficient by providing effective rotating speed; 3) Capability to handle the continuous operation; 4) Compatibility to operate at low, mid- and high-temperature conditions; 5) High technology readiness level (commercially available). The stability phase diagram of the gallium-nitrogen-oxygen system simulated with Outotec HSC chemistry software 7.0 is depicted in Fig. 2 . As it can be seen, the stable thermodynamic phases are GaN (s) and Ga (l) at operating temperature ranged from 100 °C and 300 °C, in an environment pressurised with nitrogen. Hence, a slurry mixture of the components is expected to leave the reactor using slurry conveyor [42]. The content of GaN is a function of nitrogen, thereby injecting more nitrogen will maximise the quantity of solid GaN particles, which is fed into reactor R2. In reactor R2, the produced GaN reacts with steam to drive the nitrogen fixation reaction using the following two reactions to produce ammonia, hydrogen or both: (2) 2 G a N s + 3 H 2 O g → 2 N H 3 g + G a 2 O 3 s , Δ H 100 ° C = - 239 k J m o l and (3) 2 G a N s + 3 H 2 O g → 3 H 2 g + N 2 g + G a 2 O 3 s , Δ H 100 ° C = - 162 k J m o l Both reactions are highly exothermic and temperature can be self-maintained in the reactor once steam is injected in the system. Notably, reactions 2 or 3 proceeds based on the amount of the injected steam available in the reactor. In fact, the feed ratio of steam/GaN is a determining parameter for both reactions to proceed. The steam injection can provide a plausible mixing, while maintaining the temperature required for the reactions. Also, depending on the molar ratio of steam to GaN, the product can be ammonia, hydrogen or a mixture of both. It is worth saying that the morphology of the GaN particles can be non-uniform due to the operating conditions of rotary kiln, thereby requiring a relatively robust system to drive the reaction to the equilibrium point. Hence, a solid particle fluidised bed is one potential reactor, which can offer the following advantages [43]: 1) Uniform mixing between the particles and gases, which results in the uniform heat and mass transfer due to the sufficient collision of particles; 2) Symmetric and uniform temperature distribution along with the length and diameter of the reactor; 3) Capability to operate continuously; 4) Capability to separate carried-over particles by recovering and returning them to the reactor; 5) Ability to operate at various particle distribution size and morphology. The outlet from reactor 2, gallium oxide, is fed into the plasma reactor (reactor R3), to dissociate it to liquid gallium and oxygen according to the following equation: (4) Ga 2 O 3 s → 2 G a l + 1.5 O 2 g , Δ H 3900 ° C = + 870 k J m o l Notably, the oxygen released from the process can be used in other applications (e.g. green houses or pure gas production units), which can promote the economic viability of the process. This is subject to an efficient cooling loop or a quenching procedure to separate oxygen from gallium quickly. The oxygen produced by the process potentially requires less energy in comparison with air separation units and water splitting technologies. However, this requires a techno-economic assessment, which is beyond the scope of this work. Fig. 3 represents a stability diagram of the gallium-oxygen system for the plasma reactor to dissociate gallium oxide. As it can be seen, the Gibbs free energy of the reaction is negative at T > ~4730 °C, while the reaction is highly endothermic requiring ~1000 kJ/mol of energy to drive the reaction. Also, the stable phases are Ga2O (s) or Ga2O (g) and Ga (l) of Ga (g). Notably, Ga2O can also be dissociated to Ga by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen in the system [44]. Normally, this can be done using a sweeping gas such as argon. Hence, the reactions in reactor R3 is feasible at a minimum temperature of ~3230 °C, however, the equilibrium chemical conversion at this temperature barely reaches ~40%. At T > 4730 °C, the equilibrium chemical conversion extent reaches 100%. It is worth saying that such a high temperature can locally be produced in the plasma reactors such as arc plasma and thermal plasma jets, which require a robust and efficient quenching system to avoid reverse reactions, material corrosion, fatigue and thermal expansion. Currently, there are radiative systems in which by using high energy pulsed lasers, temperature can exceed 4730 °C for a short period of time, followed by a sudden quenching process [45]. Hence, developing a plasma reactor in this operating regime is technically challenging but possible with the current available technologies."
2,Methodology,"To estimate the net enthalpy and the value of Gibbs free energy change for each reaction, the following equation was utilised: (5) Δ M rxn = ∑ prod Δ M i f ( T ) - ∑ react Δ M i f ( T ) . Here, M is a surrogate for either the enthalpy of the reaction, or the Gibbs free energy value belonging to component i. Also, the term Δ M i f T is either the net enthalpy of formation of component i or its Gibbs free energy of formation calculated at operating temperature of T. The subscripts “rxn”, “react” and “prod” stand for the term “reaction”, “reactants” and “products”, respectively. To conduct the simulations, an Aspen Plus software package version 9.0 together with Outotec HSC chemistry 7.0 were employed using Gibbs minimisation method approach. For the plasma reactor, any reactive species including ions, cations and free electrons were taken into consideration. The valid phases were solid, liquid, gas, ion, cation and free electrons and/or positron. The thermochemical equilibrium module of HSC Chemistry together with R-Gibbs reactor were interlinked and used to assess the equilibrium performance of the plasma reactor. To calculate the thermo-physical properties of the components including heat capacity, standard enthalpy of formation, standard Gibbs free energy and density, Aspen properties and Hysys software packages version 9.0 were used, which were verified with the data reported by Barin et al. [46]. Uniquac and the Peng-Robinson thermodynamic equation of states were employed and the estimated results were within ±0.5% of agreement with each other. To evaluate the scalability of the process, the system was simulated at P > 5 bar and 100 °C < T < 300 °C for reactor R2 to produce pure ammonia. The ratio of exergy transported by ammonia to the total energy input of the system referred to as exergy efficiency (χ) was selected as a criterion to assess the portion of energy input converted into chemical exergy shown in Eq. (6) as follows: (6) χ = n ̇ NH 3 × LHV NH 3 ∑ Q net , R z + ∑ i n n i × Δ H i Here, n ̇ is the molar flow of component i, Q net is the net thermal energy requirement for reactor z (z = 1, 2, 3); n is an index for the species in the system including steam, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrogen, oxygen and gallium. The lower heating value (LHV) for ammonia and hydrogen was 18 and 120 MJ/kg, respectively. Also, the thermodynamic thermal efficiency of the system was defined as a ratio of the outlet enthalpy values of the products to the total enthalpy introduced to the system by chemical compounds and steam considering 3% of inlet thermal energy as a heat loss to the environment. (7) η th = ∑ i = 1 n n i × Δ H i out - Q loss ∑ Q net , R z + ∑ i = 1 n n i × Δ H i in Here, η th is thermodynamic thermal efficiency of the system; Qloss is the heat loss to environment calculated based on the extrapolation of data given in the literature [47], which is ~3% of total input of the system at maximum operating temperature."
3,Results and discussion,"To assess the thermodynamic potential of the proposed system, different thermochemical equilibrium models were developed and the results are discussed in the following sub-sections:"
4,Reaction’s enthalpy and Gibbs free energy,"4.1 Reaction’s enthalpy and Gibbs free energy Fig. 4 presents the effect of the operating temperature on the Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ) and enthalpy of the reaction ( Δ H ) for reactor R1. As can be seen, the change in the Gibbs free energy of the reaction is negative within the operating temperatures of 100 °C < T < 700 °C. Within the identified range of the temperature, the reaction is spontaneous and the chemical equilibrium conversion reaches the equilibrium point. For example, at T = 100 °C, Δ G = - 136.8 k J m o l reaching + 13 k J m o l at 700 °C. Interestingly, within the above temperature range, the enthalpy of reaction is highly negative e.g. Δ H = - 230 t o - 228 k J m o l at 100 °C < T < 700 °C. Notably, the thermal energy released in the reactor R1 is utilised to preheat the products and increase the inlet temperature of the reactants of the reactor R2. This will potentially reduce the thermal load of the reactor R2. The preheating of the product occurs with the sensible heat absorbed from the reaction 1 considering the plausible thermal features of GaN particles such as heat capacity of 0.49 J/(g °C) and thermal conductivity of 0.8–1 W/(m °C). Fig. 5 represents the effect of the operating temperature on the calculated enthalpy of reaction ( Δ H ) and the change in the Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ) of the reactions occurring in the reactor R2. As can be seen, this reaction is highly exothermic for both reactions, while the reaction spontaneously occurs within the operating temperature of 100 °C < T < 1000 °C. For example, at T = 300 °C, Δ G = - 148 k J / m o l and Δ G = - 180 k J / m o l for reactions 2 and 3, respectively while reaching −43 kJ/mol and −230 kJ/mol at 1000 °C for reactions 2 and 3, respectively. Hence, the reaction is shown to be thermodynamically feasible at 100 °C < T < 1000 °C. Interestingly, the released thermal energy from both reactors R1 and R2 is used to preheat the products before introducing them to the plasma reactor. This in turn reduces the thermal load of the plasma reactor, which promotes the energetic performance of the process. In Fig. 6 , the effect of the operating temperature on the calculated enthalpy of the reaction ( Δ H ) and the change in the Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ) of the reaction in the plasma reactor R3 is depicted. As can be seen, the Gibbs free energy of the reactor is negative at T > 3230 °C showing that this reaction is thermodynamically feasible to occur in a plasma reactor. Also, the reaction is endothermic requiring a large amount of thermal energy to drive the reaction, although part of the heat can be supplied from reactors R1 and R2. Reactor R2 as perceived from Figs. 1a and b is the heart of the process where the main products are produced, while reactor R3 is a complementary operating unit to create a closed loop and a circular chemical looping plant, which guaranties the sustainability of the proposed process by dissociating Ga2O3 to Ga. Hence, these reactors are further investigated to identify the suitable operating parameters. Likewise, the operation of the reactor R2 is complex as it strongly depends on the temperature, pressure and feed ratio of the reactor, thereby requiring further optimisation via response surface methodology."
5,Steam to gallium nitride molar ratio,"4.2 Steam to gallium nitride molar ratio Fig. 7 represents the effect of the temperature on the mole fraction of the products in the reactor R2 for various molar ratios of steam to GaN (φ). As can be seen, regardless of φ value, within the operating temperature range of 100 °C < T < 400 °C, the main product of the reactor is ammonia, Ga2O3 (solid) and H2. Therefore, it is plausibly the “optimised operating temperature range” for this reactor. For example, at φ = 0.1, the mole fraction of hydrogen changes from zero to ~40%, while that of ammonia decreases from ~41.5% to zero. Hence, a thermodynamic equilibrium trade-off trend is identified between the production of hydrogen and ammonia in the reactor R2 such that the final product of the reactor can be regulated depending on the end-user needs and requirements and storage facility. This can be done by changing the operating conditions of the reactor R2. Interestingly, by increasing φ value to 1.0, the production of ammonia and hydrogen is promoted to ~81% at 100 °C (for ammonia) and ~70% (for hydrogen) at 400 °C. With further increase in φ value, the unreacted steam appears in the products, which in turn decreases the quality of the outlet and requires a system to eliminate water from the system. This is necessary to avoid feeding water into plasma reactor. Thus, an efficient heat exchanger is required to recover the steam and return it to the reactor R2. It is worth saying that if the excess steam is not extracted from the reactor, a side reaction between gallium and steam proceeds resulting in the production of Ga(OOH), which is an amorphous stable phase of gallium hydroxide. The presence of Ga(OOH) in the plasma reactor can produce H+, which aggressively attacks other ions and molecules due to the “ionisation impact” in the reactor. Hence, there is an optimum point for the ratio, which can be identified through conducting experiments."
6,Temperature and pressure of the plasma reactor,"4.3 Temperature and pressure of the plasma reactor Fig. 8 shows the effect of the operating temperature on the mole fraction of the products in the reactor R3. As can be seen, the chemical conversion extent reached the equilibrium point for Ga2O3 (the black line) by dissociating Ga2O3 to Ga, Ga2O and O(g). However, by increasing the temperature of the plasma regime, Ga2O is further dissociated to Ga and O2. Hence, the final product of the reactor is gallium and oxygen which should rapidly be quenched and separated. The oxygen can be used for further applications, while gallium is returned to the reactor R1 for nitrogen fixation reaction. Notably, at T > 4730 °C (~0.43 eV), reactor R3 reaches the equilibrium state with 100% conversion extent in which gallium and oxygen are the main products. Hence, this temperature is an optimum temperature for the plasma reactor, which can easily be maintained by an arc plasma or a plasma jet. In Fig. 9 , the effect of the pressure of the reactor R3 on the mole fraction of the products is depicted. As shown, by pressuring the plasma reactor, gallium oxide (Ga2O) is the dominant product, which is not a favourable component. The formation of Ga2O creates a non-reactive phase of gallium, which does not participate in the reaction. Hence, a stream of gallium should be connected to the process to compensate for a fraction of Ga2O which is economically viable. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid pressuring the plasma reactor. Notably, for reactor R3, the requirements and operating temperature matches with thermal plasma reactors particularly “arc plasma configuration” or “plasma jet”. Basically, operating temperature of the plasma arc and thermal plasma jets ranges from 6000 to 20,000 K and more specifically, the average gas temperature available for reaction systems can range from 3000 to 6000 K [48]. Hence, thermal plasma is completely suitable for the proposed process. Notably, an efficient quenching system or high heat flux removal cooling loop (internal coolers) are advised to avoid any damages to the material of the reactor. Normally, engineering ceramics with passive protection, carbon composites and zirconia-based alloys are suitable materials for such reactors. Notably, for none thermal plasma, as the concept is novel and under development, investigation on its applications have not been studied at high temperatures."
7,Optimisation with response surface methodology,"4.4 Optimisation with response surface methodology Response surface methodology (RSM) is a matrix of solution for a chain of statistical, mathematical and theoretical methods for design and optimisation of the complicated experiments and processes, where there is limited data obtained by simulations and/or experiments [49]. The RSM model employs input parameters including operating conditions of the process and a target parameter to evaluate the sensitivity of the target parameter to those operating conditions and chooses the best response, in which the target parameter is maximised or minimised [50]. Hence, the decision-making algorithm of the model strongly depends on the response of the system to a change in the operating parameters. The responses can be collected by accurate experiments e.g. catalytic fuel production [51] or by conducting high-fidelity simulations. In the present work, optimisation is conducted based on Box-Behnken approach [52] using the RSM modelling technique to identify the sensitivity of the production of ammonia and/or hydrogen to each of the operating parameters. As discussed above, only reactor R2 is assessed since it has a complex operation and is the heart of the process, which determines the mole fraction of the products. Fig. 10 shows the algorithm of solution for the RSM model developed in the present work. As can be seen, the algorithm of the solution has five main stages. After creating the matrix of the model (stage 1 and 2), a series of simulations are conducted based on the operating conditions given in Table 1 developed by RSM. For each iteration, the responses are collected from the simulation results and the optimisation is conducted once all twenty iterations are successfully conducted. It is worth saying that in the present work, the target parameter is the ratio of hydrogen to ammonia (ψ). According to the RSM model, initially, the matrix of the input parameters is created for temperature, pressure and steam/GaN molar ratios (φ). According to Table 1, each operating parameter has three levels including a minimum value (−1.0), a centre value (0) and a maximum value (+1.0). These values for temperature are 100, 250 and 400 °C, and for pressure are 1, 16 and, 31 bar, and for φ are 0.1, 1.05 and 2.0, respectively all selected and chosen by RSM model. Over 20 runs of simulations, the responses were recorded and used in the model to evaluate the sensitivity of the target parameter (ψ) to the operating conditions. As can be seen in Fig. 11 , the Pareto analysis shows that the most important parameter is the temperature of the reactor R2, which considerably affects its chemical performance. As shown in Section 4.2, to produce hydrogen, ammonia or combination of both, the temperature of the reactor must be within a specific temperature range. Likewise, a trade-off trend was identified between the production of ammonia and hydrogen. Hence, temperature was a key parameter in the equilibrium simulations, which was also identified by the Pareto analysis based on the RSM model as well. Interestingly, it was found that not only temperature (A), but also pressure (B) and an interaction between the temperature and pressure (AB) contribute to the performance of the reactor. Hence, through multi-response analysis, the sensitivity of the target parameter to the temperature, pressure and their interactions was assessed. Notably, the model identifies that the steam/GaN ratio (φ) has no effect on the performance of the reactor. This parameter only determines which chemical component can be the dominant product of the reactor, which has already been identified through equilibrium analysis. Apart from Pareto analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is generally used to analyse and identify the differences between two or more mean value of data, which is a method to discover the meaningful relationship between data. In the present work, ANOVA is employed to ensure that a target parameter has a meaningful relationship with the operating parameters of the system. For example, ANOVA is used for reactor R2 to show that the chemical performance of the reactor is a meaningful function of its operating temperature and pressure. This is a statistical approach which increases the reliability of the modelling and is complementary to the regression analysis. In ANOVA technique, by changing the value of a given operating parameter, if the observed change in a P-value >0.05, then the system is responsive to the given operating condition. Hence, the given operating parameter should be considered in the model. Pareto analysis developed by Vilfredo Pareto [53], is a tool for decision-making and ranking the operating parameters based on their importance and effect on the target parameter. This method is used to separate the important operating parameters from less important ones using a cumulative chart. Both methods were used in the present work to increase the accuracy of the RSM model. According to the results obtained with Pareto analysis, temperature and pressure of the reactor are the most important parameters affecting the performance of the reactor. This also confirms that the effect of pressure and temperature and their interaction should be considered in the RSM model. Likewise, ANOVA test further showed that the P-value for temperature, pressure, steam/GaN ratio, interaction between temperature (T) and pressure (P), second-order effect of pressure (P2) are <0.05. Statistically speaking, this shows that there is a meaningful correlation between each of these parameters and the target parameter (ψ value). Also, the P-value for the general model is 0.001 (<0.05 again) showing that the ANOVA model applied to the data is valid. Hence, these parameters are used in the regression analysis. The detailed calculated results with ANOVA test are given in Table 2 . Using regression analysis on the data obtained from the RSM model, the following equation was developed which can predict the molar ratio of hydrogen to ammonia with an R-square >0.97 within the 95% confidence interval: (5) ( H 2 : N H 3 ) r a t i o ( ψ ) = - 24.4 + 0.001 × P P × 0.348 × T - 3.04 × P + 0.5 × φ - 0.014 × T P Here, temperature and pressure values are in °C and bar, respectively. The developed equation correlates the ψ value to the most sensitive operating parameters. This correlation helps one to predict the final composition of the product produced by the reactor R2 without applying a thermochemical equilibrium and RSM models, which are time-consuming to be established and used. Fig. 12 represents the operating map of the reactor R2 for different ψ values obtained at various temperatures and pressures. As it can be seen, three main operating regions can be identified. In region I, in which P < 30 bar and T < 350 °C (dark red), the molar ratio of hydrogen to ammonia is 0, showing that the main product of the reactor is ammonia together with small contents of hydrogen. This hydrogen is separable using a condenser. In region II (dark yellow), the operating pressure is between 1 and 10 bar and reactor operates at higher temperatures (e.g. 220 °C to 280 °C). In this region, hydrogen and ammonia both are produced. In region III (purple), at P < 5 bar and T > 350 °C, the main product of the reactor is hydrogen. Hence, it is not necessary to pressurise the reactor R2 when the target product of the process is hydrogen. Fig. 13 shows the calculated dependence of the sensitivity of ψ to the operating parameters of the reactor R2. As can be seen, in temperature-pressure Figure, the target parameter is very sensitive to temperature such that at T = 200 °C, when P = 1 bar, the sensitivity factor is ~50, while sensitivity level is increased to 125 at T = 300 °C. However, for P = 31 bar, the sensitivity level is very low such that for the given temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C, the sensitivity levels are 0.01 and 0.0005, respectively. Also, for temperature- φ Figure, increasing the temperature increased the sensitivity level of the reactor linearly. Hence, (Tφ) interaction is not as strong as (TP) one. In light of the above discussion, using the equilibrium analysis and the RSM model, the optimised operating condition of the proposed process was estimated and represented in Table 3"
8,Scalability study,"4.5 Scalability study As discussed in the introduction, small-scale production in new business windows suits the introduction of disruptive technologies into the market. In this sense, we question if our new plasma-based looping approach has sufficient performance at small scale and we give the answer in this chapter. Fig. 14 presents the calculated dependence on production scale of the “exergy efficiency” shown with red colour and “thermal efficiency” shown with blue colour. As it can be seen, by increasing the production scale of the process, the exergy efficiency of the system decreases. For example, for a small scale production of 5000 tonnes/year of ammonia, the exergy efficiency and thermal efficiency calculated for the system were 0.46 and 0.40, which decreased to 0.328 and 0.330 for a large-scale (500,000 tonnes/year). For a very large-scale production (1,000,000 tonnes/year), the value was 0.31 for both thermal and exergy efficiency. Hence, it can be stated that the proposed system is more suitable for decentralised ammonia production, in which a small-scale plant is developed on-site according to the requirements, local community and specifications of the location to meet the sustainability criteria. This is because, by increase the size of the production, the energy requirement for the thermal plasma reactor increases massively, while also considering the Qloss which becomes large for large-scale production, the thermal efficiency and exergy of the system decreases. Notably, for large-scale production, development of the plasma electrodes and dielectric lifetime are technically challenging and the major cost barriers which affecting the economic viability of the process as well. While for small-scale production, using plasma reactor is completely justified with renewable energy such as concentrated photo voltaic and photo voltaic systems [54]. Notably, the maximum theoretical thermal efficiency of the system is 0.8, which was calculated with Carnot efficiency equation [55]."
9,Thermal energy transferred to the plasma reactor,"4.6 Thermal energy transferred to the plasma reactor Fig. 15 represents the calculated thermal energy supplied with reactors R1 and R2 through primary heat transfer of GaN particles from reactor R1 to reactor R2 and secondary heat transfer from reactor R2 to the plasma reactor via sensible heat absorbed by Ga2O3 particles. As it can be seen in Fig. 15, to minimise the exergy destruction between reactors R1 and R2, the operating temperatures of the reactors was considered the same to apply isothermal condition between the reactors, which in turn reduces the exergy destruction value to zero due to omitting the temperature difference between reactors. By considering the isothermal condition between reactors R1 and R2, the sensible heat can be transported from reactor R1 to reactor R2 and then is transported to the plasma reactor R3. An energy balance over the system showed that the maximum thermal energy of 12.3% can be supplied from other reactors, which is utilised for increasing the temperature of Ga2O3 particles. This also reduced the thermal load of the plasma reactor resulting in a decrease in its power consumption. It is possible to increase the temperature aiming at supplying more thermal energy to the plasma reactor, which is at cost of reducing the rate of ammonia production and increasing the rate of hydrogen production."
10,"Advantages, potential challenges and future works","The proposed process offers the following advantages in comparison with the current pathways for hydrogen and ammonia production: 1) Zero carbon process: The proposed process takes advantage of nitrogen fixation and does not involve any carbon-containing components, hydrogasification, partial oxidation of carbonaceous feedstock, water-gas shift, Boudouard and methanation reaction, which in turn offers a CO2-neutral process for the production of clean fuels. 2) Sustainability: Thanks to the plasma reactor, the developed process offers a sustainable chain (loop) of chemical reactions from gallium to gallium nitride (via kiln reactor), gallium nitride to gallium oxide (via fluidised bed reactor) and gallium oxide to gallium (via plasma reactor). Reactors R1 and R2 are commercially available and the knowledge of handling gallium up to T ~ 400 °C [56] has already been developed. The products of the process are oxygen and hydrogen which are environmentally benign. For ammonia, the knowledge of handling and storage has already been developed. Considering the fact that the thermo-equilibrium chemical conversion of the reactors can reach the completion point, it can be stated that the theoretical limit for the chemical conversion extent of the reactors is the highest. 3) Flexibility in type of the clean fuel product: The system offers great flexibility in terms of the final products such that depending on the end-user requirements, the final product can be hydrogen, ammonia or a combination of both, which easily can be separated using a low-temperature condenser. Oxygen is also available as a side product, which can be dispatched to the market. To harness the proposed process, the following challenges require further investigation: 1) Robust kiln reactor to handle liquid metals: Containing gallium in a kiln reactor at low-temperature operation is feasible through installing liners and cathode protection of the surface. However, such implementations can, in turn, induce a thermal resistance between the walls of the kiln reactor and the liquid metal. This decreases the thermal efficiency of the reactor. Therefore, a thorough assessment is highly recommended to evaluate the performance of the kiln reactor equipped with liner. 2) Robust nitrogen gas and steam injection technology for the reactors: A high-fidelity gas injection system is required for the kiln reactor to avoid agglomeration of GaN particles, while uniformly distributes the nitrogen gas in the reactor. Also, a robust steam injection system is required for the fluidised bed to maintain the fluidisation, heat and mass transfer rate. 3) Kinetic of the reactions in the plasma reactor: The proposed system requires a novel type of plasma reactor, which to the best of author’s knowledge has not been developed yet. Hence, there is a lack of information on the design, configuration and performance of the reactor together with the lack of study on the kinetics of the gallium oxide dissociation in the plasma reactor. 4) Identification of new liquid metals: Although the proposed process is thermodynamically feasible using gallium as a potential option, it is highly recommended to identify other liquid metals which can potentially work in the system, thereby requiring further work to identify other plausible options. 5) Challenges associated with fluidised bed reactor: Although fluidised bed reactor was suggested as a plausible reactor’s configuration for reactions 2 and 3, following technical challenges associated with fluidised bed should also be considered and requires further investigation: a) uniform dispersion of reactive and/or inert gas within the bed: A robust and high-fidelity gas dispersing system is required to provide the minimum velocity required for fluidisation of the GaN, while providing uniform heat and mass transfer coefficient along with the length and cross sectional area of the fluidised bed reactor; b) pressure drop: gas injection in a slurry or a liquid metal develops significant pressure drop in the system due to the bubble interactions and large density of the liquid metal. Hence, superficial velocity and injection flow rate should be optimised accordingly. While also the geometrical specifications of the fluidised bed require improvement and optimisation; c) sintering, clogging and agglomeration of GaN particles due to the attractive forces and presence of pure gallium. Circulation of an inert gas is a potential solution to avoid agglomeration of the particles; d) temperature homogeneity, and reaction kinetics which are low at dead zones and near the walls of the reactor, which need to be considered in the design stage."
11,Outlook: How plasma-enabled disruptive process design could open industrial transformation,"Considering the main goals of the SCOPE [38], which aims at industrial transformation of nitrogen fixation through innovative disruptive process design enabled by a plasma reactor, the proposed project can bring benefits to the community through agro-environmental and social factors as follows:"
12,Agro-environmental factors,"6.1 Agro-environmental factors Depending on the agricultural requirements of each geographical location such as soil conditions (pH value, nutrients, and soil grain size), rainfall, agricultural products and the size of the farms, the proposed process may be adjusted such that by adjusting the operating conditions of the reactors, suitable product is produced in accordance with the local requirements. For example, if water desalination is a local requirement in a given location and water treatment is a necessary activity for the agricultural sector, hence, hydrogen as a clean fuel can be produced to feed to boilers of the water desalination plants, while ammonia production via the process can be suppressed."
13,Social factors,"6.2 Social factors The proposed process offers a green route for the production of ammonia and hydrogen, which is very well in-line with environmental policy of most of the governments. This may result in financial support of governments, such as financial support for use of sustainable processes in US [57] or China [58]. Also, the carbon zero (carbon neutral) footprint may promote the health and safety in the local community, which may suppress the cost associated with the pollution of water, soil, air and living species in the local nature."
14,Conclusions,"In the present work, the results of thermochemical equilibrium analysis were reported to assess the feasibility and the thermodynamic potential of a novel process for co-production of hydrogen and ammonia using liquid metal and a plasma reactor. The process takes advantage of nitrogen fixation reaction, while offering a sustainable process, which eliminates the production of greenhouse gases. Thermochemical equilibrium and response surface methodology analysis showed that the process is thermodynamically feasible. Some of the advantages and main challenges were identified and the following conclusions were drawn: • Within the identified operating conditions, the Gibbs free energy of the reactions in all reactors was negative showing that the reactions are spontaneous and feasible in the reactors. In reactors R1 and R2, the enthalpy of the reaction was negative, hence, the thermal energy released in the reactor can maintain the temperature and also be partially used to preheat the products before introducing to the plasma reactor. This can plausibly reduce the energy requirement of the plasma reactor. • Thermodynamic assessment showed that the reactor R2 can be used for the co-production of hydrogen and ammonia providing that the temperature, and feed ratio of the reactor (φ) is regulated such that 100 °C < T < 400 °C, P = 1 bar and 0.1 < φ < 1.0. • The plasma reactor was found to be a plausible configuration to drive the dissociation reaction of Ga2O3, for which Δ G is highly positive. This reactor completes the circle of the reactions without emitting any greenhouse gases and environmental pollutants, which bring sustainability features to the process. • Increasing the steam content in reactor R2 can harm the quality of the product by producing Ga(OOH) instead of Ga2O3, which in turn decreases the mole fraction of gallium in the outlet of the plasma reactor. • The response surface analysis showed that apart from temperature, pressure and feed ratio of the reactor, the interaction between temperature and pressure can also affect the performance of reactor R2. Hence, a multi-response optimisation was conducted via a RSM model and the optimum operating conditions for the reactor, was identified. Overall, the proposed process shows a great thermodynamic potential to be used for the nitrogen fixation and production of hydrogen and ammonia using plasma reactor. Despite plausible thermodynamic outcome, a series of experiments in accordance with the objectives defined in the “SCOPE” project, followed by an in-depth techno-economic assessment based on the sustainability and business model developed in the “SCOPE” project is highly required to be conducted aiming at demonstrating the process and its feasibility. Also, an energetic assessment of the system based on the experimental data is highly recommended, which is ongoing and is a future target."
