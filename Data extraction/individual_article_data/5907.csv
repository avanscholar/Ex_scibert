0,Introduction,"Methane hydrate, mainly found in submarine sediment and permafrost [1,2], is a long-term research interest in the oil and gas industry owing to its high combustion value, wide distribution, and environmental friendliness [3,4]. Decompression [5–7], thermal stimulation [8,9], chemical injection [10–12] and gas replacement [13–16] have been reported to be effective in exploitation of methane hydrate. Thermal stimulation and decompression effectively accelerate the decomposition of methane hydrate. However, the two methods require high temperatures and a high vacuum degree, respectively [8,9]. Although chemical injection can improve the efficiency of methane hydrate decomposition [10–12], too much chemical injection, however, will contaminate the reservoir and is expensive. Many researchers have suggested combining the above methods to pool the advantages of each method and improve their individual shortcomings. Decompression is the most frequently used method; however, when using this method, methane hydrate is prone to regeneration owing to the low-temperature environment eventually leading to formation blockage. Thermal stimulation during decompression can effectively solve the blockage problem. Wang et al. [9] and Nair et al. [17] analysed the influence of temperature and pressure on the methane gas production. They reported that thermal stimulation during decompression resulted in a high methane hydrate decomposition rate which was 1.5–2 times higher than only one method. Considering the high energy needed for thermal stimulation, many researchers combine chemical injection and thermal stimulation. By adding a small amount of chemical agent to improve the energy efficiency of thermal stimulation method. Feng et al. [18] injected heated brine to methane hydrate to accelerate its decomposition and studied the synergy between salt and thermal stimulation. They observed that increasing salinity could effectively improve both methane gas production and heat transfer efficiency between injected solution and methane hydrate reservoir. They also observed that when the salinity was kept lower than 100 g/L the methane hydrate decomposed much faster and levelled off at above 100 g/L. Bhattacharjee et al. [19] combined chemical injection and thermal stimulation. They reported that the decomposition of methane hydrate could take place at relatively low temperatures in the presence of alcohol. There are only a few studies on the micro-mechanism of the synergistic effect of heating and alcohol injection on the decomposition of methane hydrate. In this work, the micro-mechanism of the synergistic effect of heating and alcohol on methane hydrate decomposition was investigated using MD simulation. The consistent valence force field (CVFF) was selected as the force field under the isobaric–isothermal ensemble (NPT) [ [20]]. The decomposition rates of methane hydrate at different temperatures before and after adding alcohol are compared. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on methane hydrate decomposition with the presence of alcohol was studied by comparing the interaction energy between alcohol and water, escape rate of methane, and diffusion coefficient of alcohol. Our study will provide a theoretical basis for future research into exploitation of methane hydrate by combining thermal stimulation and alcohol and provide useful guidance for the development of gas hydrate reservoirs."
1,Simulation setup and detailed processes of molecular dynamics simulations,"The MD simulations were constructed with Forcite modules and CVFF using Materials Studio [20–26]. CVFF can precisely describe the decomposition processes of gas hydrates qualitatively and is widely used in the study of methane hydrates, carbon dioxide hydrates etc. [20–23]. The (extensively studied) simple point charge (SPC) potential energy model [24,25] and the SHAKE algorithm [26] were applied when constructing the sI type methane hydrate model (see Fig. 1 (a)). The size of the methane hydrate model was 2.375nm × 2.375nm × 4.751nm with 736 water molecules and 128 methane molecules. The accuracy of the methane hydrate model developed for this work was verified by comparing its radial distribution function before and after the decomposition (of methane hydrate) with those from other works [27]. When 100 alcohol molecules were added into the simulation box, they came in contact with the methane hydrate surface (see Fig. 1(b)). The specific simulation process and parameters are shown in Fig. 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effect of alcohol-thermal stimulation method,"3.1 Effect of alcohol-thermal stimulation method Alcohol, when added to methane hydrate, was found to accelerate methane hydrate decomposition [ [27–31]]. Here, 2000 ps MD simulations under NPT were carried out to investigate the decomposition of methane hydrate. The decomposition of methane hydrate without alcohol was simulated at 277 K, 282 K, 287 K, 292 K, 297 K, 302 K, 307 K 312 K and 317 K. Results showed that methane hydrate could not decompose when the temperature is lower than 307 K. To verify the effect of alcohol on the decomposition of methane hydrate, the model of methane hydrate with added methanol was constructed. To study the coupling effect between alcohols and temperature, 302 K and 307 K were chosen. The snapshots of the four models are shown in Fig. 3a–d. The total potential energy of the 4 models was analysed, and the curve of the total potential energy within 2000 ps simulation time is shown in Fig. 4a–b. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, without alcohols, no decomposition of methane hydrate was observed at 302 K within the time investigated. When the temperature was 307 K, methane hydrate decomposed completely after 1450 ps. Notably, with the presence of methanol, methane hydrate decomposed completely in 400 ps and 200 ps at 302 K and 307 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, adding methanol can reduce the thermal energy needed for methane hydrate decomposition. Thus, alcohol injection can effectively accelerate methane hydrate decomposition. Further investigation was carried out to determine the coupling effect of alcohol and temperature on the decomposition of methane hydrate. Herein, methanol, glycol and glycerol with identical functional units were chosen. The acceleration effects of methanol, glycol and glycerol on methane hydrate decomposition under different temperatures were studied to isolate the influences of the alcohol and the coupling effect of chemical–thermal stimulation. The molecular structures of methanol, glycol and glycerol are shown in Fig. 5 . An equal number of methanol, glycol and glycerol molecules were added to the methane hydrate model sequentially. Additionally, 2000 ps MD simulation under NPT were carried out at six different temperatures. The total potential energy–time curves of the simulation models are shown in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6a–c, it can be seen that methane hydrate cannot completely decompose within 2000 ps at temperatures lower than 280 K in all alcohol models investigated. The time required for complete decomposition of methane hydrate is shown in Fig. 6d. When the temperature was lower than 300 K, the decomposition rate of methane hydrate was sensitive to temperature. The decomposition rate of methane hydrate with glycol or glycerol was much higher than that with methanol. This is probably attributable to the different capabilities of the three alcohols to form hydrogen bonds with water in the hydrate cage. Moreover, the directional orientation of hydroxyl groups of the three alcohols at hydrate interface may be different. For further clarification, the hydroxyl group angle distribution function was defined as: a function for describing the distribution of the angle between hydroxyl groups of alcohol and the methanol hydrate surface, to analyse the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds between alcohol and water in hydrate cage. As shown in Fig. 7 , the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules near the interface tend to point to hydrate. In contrast, the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules in the bulk phase arrange more randomly. For glycol or glycerol, the molecules have more hydroxyl groups pointing to the hydrate interface, and the possibility of forming hydrogen bond is higher than for methanol. As such, glycol or glycerol has a better accelerating effect on methane hydrate decomposition. Notably, glycerol and glycol show the same accelerating effect despite glycerol having more hydroxyl groups. This may be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance of glycerol. Also, when the temperature reached 300 K, the difference between the models with methanol, glycol or glycerol became insignificant. The decomposition rates of different models almost reach the same value when the temperature reaches 310 K. To further understand this result, the evolutions of the microscopic morphology of hydrate cages were investigated as shown in Fig. 8 . It was found that the decomposition process of methane hydrate includes three main steps: first, methanol molecules and water molecules forming hydrogen bonds destroy the cage structure; second, methane molecules escape from the cage structure; third, methanol molecules come in contact with the new hydrate solids through the water membrane. The effect of alcohol–thermal simulation on methane hydrate decomposition was also studied by evaluating the interaction energy between alcohol and water, velocity of escaping methane molecules, and diffusion velocity of alcohol molecules."
4,Interaction energy between alcohol and water,"3.2 Interaction energy between alcohol and water The number of alcohol and water molecules was maintained for different models. The strength of the hydrogen bond between alcohol and water can be compared by calculating the interaction energy between alcohol and water in different models within the same simulation time. The interaction energy between alcohol and water is calculated using the following Eq. (1), (1) E alcohol − water = E alcohol + water − E water − E alcohol where, E alcohol−water is the interaction energy between alcohol and water, E alcohol+water is the total energy of alcohol and water, E water is the total energy of water, and E alcohol is the total energy of alcohol [32]. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the impact of temperature on the interaction energy of glycerol–water is the largest compared to that of methanol–water and glycol–water. When lower than 290 K, temperature has a great influence on the interaction energy between alcohol and water in the models containing alcohol. At the same temperature, the order of interaction energy between alcohol and water follows the sequence of methanol < glycerol < glycol. When the temperature reaches 290 K, the influence of temperature on the interaction energy between alcohol and water becomes insignificant. At the same temperature, the order of the interaction energy between alcohol and water turns to methanol < glycol < glycerol."
5,Escape velocity of methane molecules,"3.3 Escape velocity of methane molecules The decomposition rate of methane hydrate is correlated to the rate at which methane gas escapes from the cage structure. To understand the thermal–chemical coupling effect, the volume of methane that escaped from the cage structure at different temperatures was calculated. As previously mentioned, methane hydrate cannot completely decompose; therefore, methane molecules cannot completely escape within the simulation time at 260 K and 270 K (see Fig. 6). The velocity of escaping methane molecules in different models was only compared from 280 K to 320 K. The number of CH4 molecules released from the cage structure over the simulation time was determined by calculating the number of methane molecules whose displacement is more than the radius of the methane hydrate cage (see Fig. 10a) at different simulation times. Fig. 10b shows the number of CH4 molecules released from the cage within the simulation time. The curves first rise and then tend to be constant. The slope of the rising section represents the escape velocity of methane molecules. The flat section on the curves indicates a complete escape of methane molecules. The time for reaching the platform at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 10c. From Fig. 10 we can observe that the escape rate of methane molecules increases with increase in temperature. The variation in the time taken for methane molecules to completely escape from methane hydrate is similar and decreases with the increase of temperature for different alcohols. This can be mainly attributed to the thermal movement of methane when heated, and the increasing rate at which alcohol destroys the cage structure with increasing temperature. When the temperature reaches 310 K, the escape time of methane molecules is identical for the various models. To intuitively observe the effect of temperature on the rate of methane released from the cage structure in different models at different temperatures, the Levenberg–Marquardt method was used to fit the rising part of the curves as shown in Fig. 10b; and the fitting curve was differentiated to obtain the change in the escape velocity (of methane molecules) at different temperatures. The fitting equations are all nine-term polynomials and the decision coefficient R 2 of each fitting curve is shown in Table 1 . The R 2 of all fitted curves was higher than 97.0%, indicating that the fitted curve could account for the variation in the original curve to the extent of 97.0%. By taking the derivative of the fitting curve, we can obtain the change in the escape velocity of methane with time in simulation models with methanol, glycol and glycerol at different temperatures, as presented in Fig. 11 . The change of the curves in the model with methanol is similar to that with glycol at the temperatures investigated as shown in Fig. 11. At temperatures of 280 K and 290 K, the curve is divided into 3 sections in simulation models with methanol and glycol. In the first section, the escape rate of methane molecules decreases rapidly; in the second section, the escape rate of the methane molecules tends toward zero; and in the third section, a hump appears on the curve. When the temperature is 300 K, a hump appears on the curve and then the curve gradually drops back to 0. At higher temperatures of 310 K and 320 K, 5 humps appear on the curve and the peak value of the hump decreases gradually; then the curve drops back to 0 gradually. In contrast, for the model with glycerol, the curve changes more smoothly than that of the models with methanol or glycol at different temperatures."
6,The diffusion velocity of alcohol molecules,"3.4 The diffusion velocity of alcohol molecules The diffusion of alcohol molecules has a direct influence on the decomposition rate of methane hydrate. MSD refers to the degree of deviation between the molecular space position and its initial position in the simulation model at a given time. For fluids without regular structure, MSD will gradually increase with simulation time. But for solids, MSD should oscillate near a certain value. MSD can be used for calculating the diffusion coefficient, and the relationship between MSD and diffusion coefficient is expressed as, (2) 6 ? ? t = R ? ? = MSD where, D refers to the diffusion coefficient and t denotes time. The above formula is used to obtain the diffusion coefficient of methanol, glycol and glycerol. The curves of diffusion coefficient against different alcohol molecules and temperatures are shown in Fig. 12 . At the same temperature, the order of the diffusion coefficient of the three alcohols is glycerol < glycol < methanol. This is mainly attributed to the diffusion coefficient being inversely proportional to the viscosity whereby: glycerol > glycol > methanol. Also, it was found that the order of the influence of temperature on the diffusion coefficient is glycerol < glycol < methanol, which indicates the higher the steric resistance of alcohol, the lesser its viscosity is affected by temperature."
7,Conclusions,"In this work, the coupling effect of alcohol–thermal stimulation and the influence of temperature on the accelerating effect of methanol, glycol and glycerol on methane hydrate decomposition were studied by MD simulation. The effect of thermal stimulation and alcohol–thermal stimulation on methane hydrate decomposition was compared. We observed that adding methanol can effectively accelerate the decomposition of methane hydrate by reducing the thermal energy required for its decomposition. Furthermore, it was revealed that alcohol accelerating effect on methane hydrate decomposition was significant at temperatures lower than 300 K. Moreover, the results showed that the impact of temperature on the interaction energy between alcohol and water, escape rate of methane molecules, and diffusion coefficient of alcohol in simulation models varies for different alcohols. Also, temperature has a great influence on the diffusion velocity of methanol and the interaction energy between glycerol and water. For glycol, however, the effect of temperature on the above three parameters is almost the same. The results reveal the coupling effect of thermal stimulation and alcohol injection in accelerating methane hydrate decomposition. Our study provides a theoretical basis for future researches into exploitation of methane hydrate ex by combining thermal stimulation and alcohol and provides useful guidance for the development of gas hydrate reservoirs."
