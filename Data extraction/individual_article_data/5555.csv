0,Introduction,"Hydrogen may be considered a renewable energy source and, although much hydrogen is being produced from hydrocarbons [1], research has confirmed the potential for hydrogen generation from water by electrochemical processes, and from renewable raw material by thermochemical means, and by microbial processes such as aerobic/anaerobic fermentation. Anaerobic fermentation is a favorable way to convert high-solid organic wastes to bio-energy sources such as methane, alcohols, acids, and hydrogen [2]. Hydrogen is an intermediate product of anaerobic fermentation. Many studies [3–7] indicate that anaerobic digester sludge, soil, and compost contain many hydrogen-producing microorganisms, especially spore-rich bacteria, which can be harvested post-heat-treatment. Carbohydrate-rich organics are attractive candidates for hydrogen generation. Simple synthetic substrates such as sugar, starch and even wastewaters can be converted to hydrogen with batch cultures [9–12] and in continuous processes [13,14] by seeding material with spore-rich hydrogen-producing bacteria. Different groups of spore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium and Bacillus species [8] have been investigated for hydrogen production. Fang and coworkers [15] used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of the 16rDNA gene fragment from the mixed-culture hydrogen-producing sludge which indicated that about 70% of the bacterial population was anaerobic Clostridium sp. and 14% was aerobic Bacillus sp. Our previous study [13,16–18] using DGGE, functional gene-targeted reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and functional gene-targeted fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) combined with flow cytometry analysis, showed that Clostridium beijerinckii L9, Clostridium butyricum M1, and Bacillus thermoamylovorans B5 predominated in a mixed-culture hydrogen-producing bio-fermentor fed with yeast waste. Chang et al. [17] observed the population relationship between C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans in a batch culture with the sludge from a fermenter converting yeast waste to hydrogen. Unfortunately, C. butyricum M1 was difficult to culture in the bacteria counting experiment [17]. The results demonstrated that B. thermoamylovorans B5 was active in the initial non-hydrogen-producing period of culture. During the hydrogen-production phase, aerobic B. thermoamylovorans B5 was attenuated while anaerobic C. beijerinckii L9 increased because C. beijerinckii can utilize a wide range of carbohydrates, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, and lignocellulosic hydrolysates [18–20]. It was also argued that B. thermoamylovorans could digest yeast waste into small molecules for the Clostridium sp. to utilize, as well as playing the role of anaerobic environment creator [18,21,22]. These observations are similar to those made during the conversion of a mixture of sewage sludge and food waste into organic fertilizer [23,24]. B. thermoamylovorans was initially dominant and could be considered a starter in the composting process [25,26]. Although aerobic Bacillus sp. and anaerobic Clostridium sp. can co-exist during hydrogen production, thus far it has been difficult to attribute specific roles, such as symbiosis and interaction, to respective species in the conversion of complex substances to hydrogen. Response surface methodology (RSM) employs a suite of statistical and mathematical techniques for the assessment of responses influenced by several variables. Responses can be gathered from a series of experiments with variables according to experimental design, such as full factorial design (FFD) and mixture design (MD). The responses and variables can be regressed to the defining polynomial equations with multivariate analysis to assess their relationship [27–29]. Accordingly, a series of co-cultures of Clostridium beijerinckii L9, Clostridium butyricum M1, and Bacillus thermoamylovorans B5 were established to an FFD and an MD. Multivariate and response surface analyses were applied to determine the relationships between the bacteria converting yeast waste into hydrogen."
1,Materials and methods,"In order to investigate and optimize the roles of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 converting yeast waste into hydrogen, the two experimental designs used and their seeding bacteria and defined substrates were as follows."
2,Experimental design,"2.1 Experimental design Full factorial design (FFD) and mixture design (MD) were employed to gain a better understanding of the hydrogen production system by the components C. beijerinckii L9 (X1 ), C. butyricum M1 (X2 ), and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (X3 ). The MD should be limited as in the equation X1 + X2 + X3 = 1. Thus, two FFDs (36 experimental conditions shown in Fig. 1 ) were applied to assess quantitatively the hydrogen-producing relationship between (i) C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (L9 & B5) and (ii) C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (M1 & B5). Each composition of vial bioreactor is listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Additionally, one MD (16 experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 2 which composition was listed in Table 3 ) was used to study the co-culture of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (L9, M1 & B5) in the defined vial bioreactor. Responses derived from FFD and MD could be fitted statistically with defined quadratic models to study the contribution of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 to hydrogen production and the optimization of the process."
3,Seeding bacteria,"2.2 Seeding bacteria C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 used in this study were isolated from a brewery yeast waste fermentation system [17,18] and provided by National Chung Hsing University. C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 were each cultured approximately 16, 8, and 8 h respectively [18], and subsequently transferred to vial bioreactors for the co-cultures according to experimental design. The bacteria were highly active and grew exponentially [30], clostridia having high hydrogen-producing activity/potential in this period consuming, carbohydrates, such as starch [11] and high-solid organics [31]."
4,Yeast waste,"2.3 Yeast waste For this investigation of bacterial conversion of high-solid organics to hydrogen, 2% of brewery yeast waste was used as simulated high-solid organics. The yeast waste, which is more than 50% protein, as well as lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins, was taken from Tainan Cheng Kung Brewery in Tainan, Taiwan. The 2% of yeast waste powder almost completely dissolved and dispersed in water for consumption by the bacteria, and its characteristics are listed in Table 4 ."
5,Vial bioreactor culture,"2.4 Vial bioreactor culture In order to simulate the real bioreactor [13,16], the experiments were performed with 120 mL vial bioreactors at the mesophilic temperature, 40 °C, in a working volume of 80 mL. Different combinations were simultaneously reacted without purging any gas (e.g., CO2 or N2) off their headspace. Each vessel was charged with 1.6 g of brewery yeast waste, 1.0 mL of medium and 24 mL of seeding bacteria according to “Experimental Design-FFD and -MD”. Finally, the vials were topped up with reverse osmosis water to 80 mL, the total solid of each vial adjusted to 10%. Each liter of the medium contains 80 g of NH4HCO3, 40 g of KH2PO4, 4.0 g of MgSO4·H2O, 0.4 g of NaCl, 0.4 g of Na2MoO4·H2O, 0.4 g of CaC12 · H2O, 0.6 g of MnSO4·7H2O, and 0.11 g of FeCl2 [6]. Note that the pH of the contents of each vial bioreactor was initially adjusted to approximately 7.0 with 1.0 N KOH before seeding the inoculum, but not controlled during batch fermentation. The contents of the vials were mixed with a rotory culturer at 30 rpm. Biogas produced was measured by the displacement of the water-lubricated plungers of glass syringes of 5–50 mL and hydrogen production ceased simultaneously with termination of experiments. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The percentage of hydrogen in biogas was determined using a GC-TCD (Shimadzu-8A) with a 2 m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). The concentrations of volatile esters, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate were established using a second GC of the same model with a FID and a 60 m × 0.53 mm capillary column (BP20). The alcohols, including ethanol, propanol and butanol were assayed using another GC-FID of the same model with a 60 m × 0.53 mm capillary column (BP20). The volatile suspended solid (VSS) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured according to Standard Methods (1995)."
7,Response surface analysis,"2.6 Response surface analysis Response surface methodology (RSM) employs a suite of statistical and mathematical techniques including experimental design (ex., FFD and MD), regression, multivariate analysis, and contour plot analysis. Three equations are used in this study. The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [31] was used to describe quantitatively the manner of H2 production, Eqs. (2) and (3) were applied to evaluate the relationships of the defined bacteria. The details are outlined as follows: (1) The data of hydrogen-producing progress were fitted to the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [31] to derive hydrogen-producing lag phase (λ, days), rate (Rm, mL H2/day), and yield (P, mL H2). (1) H ( t ) = P ⋅ exp { − exp [ R m ⋅ e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } The optimum values of λ, Rm, and P of Eq. (1) were calculated by minimizing the sum of square error using “Solver” function in the “Tools” menu in Microsoft Excel 2007. The calculation was initially fitted visually and was subjected to the constraints of P, Rm, and λ. The rate values are normalized and expressed as Rm/seeding material (Rs, mL H2/g VSS-d). In addition Ps, the specific H2 yield, was determined in this study. Ps is defined as P/substrate (mL H2/g COD). (2) The co-culture effects in two FFD experiments with (i) C. beijerinckii L9 (X1 ) and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (X3 ) and (ii) C. butyricum M1 (X2 ) and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (X3 ) on the Ps, Rs and λ were analyzed as: (2) Y i = β o + β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 3 + β 11 X 1 2 + β 22 X 3 2 + β 12 X 1 X 3 where Yi is predicted response (i.e., Ps, Rs, and λ); βo is the offset term; β1 , β2 , and β3 are linear coefficients; β11 , β22 , and β33 are the squared coefficients; β12 , β13 , and β23 are the interaction coefficients. Multiple-regression for Eq. (2) was performed using the function “LINEST” in Microsoft Excel 2007. Subsequently, the regression equation was used to build the contour plot for evaluating the effects of C. beijerinckii L9 (X1 ), C. butyricum M1 (X2 ), and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (X3 ) on Ps, Rs and λ. The response surface contour plots were constructed using Igor Pro v. 4. (3) The co-culture effects of C. beijerinckii L9 (X1 ), C. butyricum M1 (X2 ), and B. thermoamylovorans B5 (X3 ) on Ps, Rs and λ based on MD were analyzed as: (3) Y i = β o + β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 2 + β 3 X 3 + β 1122 X 1 X 2 ( X 1 − X 2 ) + β 2233 X 2 X 3 ( X 2 − X 3 ) + β 1133 X 1 X 3 ( X 1 − X 3 ) + β 22 X 2 2 + β 33 X 3 2 + β 12 X 1 x 2 + β 13 X 1 X 3 + β 23 X 2 X 3 + β 123 X 1 X 2 X 3 Coefficients in Eq. (3) were also calculated by the function “LINEST” in Microsoft Excel 2007. The response surface contour plots of Mixture Design were constructed using Statistica 6."
8,Results,"To clarify the roles of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 in hydrogen production, a series of batch co-cultures were evaluated varying the composition of the cultures (Tables 1–3). Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. Eq. (1) was used to fit the experimental data of each cumulative hydrogen production curve. Tables 1–3 summarize the best values of the parameters of Eq. (1). All R2 values were greater than 0.9, indicating that the parameters were statistically significant. The details are described as follows."
9,Co-culture of C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for hydrogen production,"3.1 Co-culture of C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for hydrogen production To establish the relationship between C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 on hydrogen production, 36 batch cultures based on an FFD were established as in Table 1 and all parameters in Eq. (1) were evaluated using the statistical procedures described earlier (“response surface analysis”). Table 1 summarizes the best values of the parameters and statistical indicator, R2 . An examination of Table 1 indicates that the Rs and the Ps of the trials with B. thermoamylovorans B5 were significant larger than those of the trials without B. thermoamylovorans B5. Additionally, Rs decreased with the increment of the volume of C. beijerinckii L9. However, all Ps of trials No. 8 to No. 36 were kept at around 18–41 mL H2/g COD. Moreover, B. thermoamylovorans B5 conspicuously reduced from 0.7 to 4.0 day to 0.2–0.8 day. To evaluate quantitatively the relationship of L9 and B5 on the conversion efficiency, the design matrix with the corresponding Ps, Rs, and λ in Table 1 were subjected to multivariate analysis with Eq. (2), and the multiple regression equations and figures were generated as shown in Table 5 A and Fig. 3 , respectively. The results showed that correlation coefficients, R2 , were 0.8–0.9, confirming a significant fit to the experimental data. A visual examination of Fig. 3A–C indicates that the axes of the contours represented a right angle, indicating there was no obvious interaction between C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 in hydrogen production. However, L9 and B5 could significantly enhance the Ps and the Rs, and shorten the λ. In order to find an intersecting optimal condition of L9 and B5, Eqs. (4–6) were considered and calculated simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 3D, the optimal condition of L9 and B5 located at 12.5 and 14.8 mL, respectively, for 120-mL vial hydrogen fermentation. These results lead us to believe that B. thermoamylovorans B5 can enhance/stimulate the conversion of yeast waste to hydrogen. Concurring with Chang and co-researchers’ study [18], they indicate that the original microflora can be transformed into a syntrophic bacterial co-culture system contended only by C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5."
10,Co-culture of C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for the hydrogen production,"3.2 Co-culture of C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for the hydrogen production 36 batches were also used to estimate the relationship between C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 in hydrogen production. Table 2 summarizes the best values of the parameters Ps, Rs, and λ and statistical indicator, R2 . Table 2 shows that B. thermoamylovorans B5 could shorten λ from 0.5 to 4.0 day to 0–0.7 day and also enhance Rs and Ps. Rs and Ps increased from 3 to 17 mL H2/g VSS/day to 3–48 mL H2/g VSS/day and from 0 to 5 mL H2/g COD to 4–17 mL H2/g COD, respectively. These phenomena confirmed that the aerobic B. thermoamylovorans B5 could stimulate the anaerobic C. butyricum M1 converting the yeast waste to hydrogen. Similar results were obtained in the Chang et al. study [17,18]. A clostridial strain M1 possessing the identical nucleotide sequences of the C. saccharobutylicum-like hydrogenase gene was then isolated and identified as Clostridium butyricum based on 16S rRNA sequence. Compared to the original inoculum with mixed microflora, either using C. butyricum M1 as the only inoculum or co-culturing with a Bacillus thermoamylovorans B5 extract will guarantee an effective and improved production of hydrogen from brewery yeast waste. To facilitate straightforward examination of M1 and B5 on hydrogen production, contour plots (Fig. 4 ) were constructed using the Eqs. (7–9) listed in Table 5B. In Fig. 4A–C, the axes of the Ps and the Rs contours did not represented a right angle. This reveals that there was a significant interaction between C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 on Ps and Rs."
11,"Co-culture of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for hydrogen production","3.3 Co-culture of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 for hydrogen production 16 batches based on the mixture design (Table 3) were conducted to identify the roles of C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 in the conversion of the yeast waste to hydrogen. To facilitate a straightforward examination of the relationship between C. beijerinckii L9, C. butyricum M1, and B. thermoamylovorans B5 in the conversion of yeast waste into hydrogen. The matrix listed in Table 3 was used to create multiple regression equations of Ps, Rs, and λ as listed in Table 5C. Subsequently, the equations were also used to construct the contour plots in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5A–C show respectively the dependence of Ps, Rs, and λ on the co-culture in this study. Recall that λ and Rs were defined as the activity of Bacillus sp. and hydrogen-producing Clostridium sp. respectively, and Ps represented the hydrogen-producing yield of the co-culture. Therefore, an optimal composition for the co-culture should be observed by considering them simultaneously as in Fig. 5D. An examination of Fig. 5D reveals optimal proportions L9: M1: B5 of 8.9:4.8:10.3 respectively. Ps, Rs, and λ were 46 mL H2/g COD, 318 mL H2/g VSS/day, and 0 day, respectively. The present results were similar to the observations of Chen et al. [3], which showed the yield for food waste conversion to hydrogen was 45 mL H2/g COD in treating 16.1 g COD/L of food waste."
12,Confirmation experiment,"3.4 Confirmation experiment The confirmation experiment results in Table 6 a and b show that the proportional error between original and recheck data is 2–16%, indicating that the co-culture designed by FFD is highly reproducible. Additionally, interpolation of the co-culture results L9 & B5 and M1 & B5 into that of L9 & M1 & B5 (as listed in Table 5) demonstrate that relationship of the latter could be reliably constructed from the former. That is to say, the optimal co-culture conditions of L9 & B5 or M1 & B5 could be derived directly from the co-culture of L9, M1, and B5 according to the MD strategies. These results also reflected the high reproducibility of co-cultures derived by MD. Obviously, the MD strategies used in this study are good and useful techniques in this field of study."
13,Discussion,"The results indicated clearly that L9 and M1 had significant potential to convert the yeast waste into hydrogen but not B5. However, B5 could significant shorten the co-culture’s hydrogen-producing lag phase. Although, there were no further evidence to answer the relationship between hydrogen producers, hydrogen production and metabolite products, FFD and MD strategies helped us to find the relationship between the members of the co-culture, and something of their contributions, as well as their optimal co-culture proportions. The equations listed in Table 5 were determined by polynomial regression with a stepwise approach. The rank of each item represents its significance [32]. Examination of Eq. (12) indicates that B. thermoamylovorans B5 made a higher contribution to the lag phase of hydrogen production than L9 and M1. The interaction of L9 and B5 was more important than that of M1 and B5 to λ. Furthermore, the rank listed in Eqs. (10, 11) indicated that L9 and B5 determined the hydrogen production rate and yield in the co-culture of L9, M1, and B5. Consideration of these results might give credence that a symbiosis occurred between C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5. However, the relationship between C. butyricum M1 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 appears commensalist. These inferences still require confirmation by molecular biological methods. Thus far, many molecular biological techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) polyamine patterns [5,14], fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [33], flow cytometry analysis [34], and immunofluorescence [35] have been applied to analyze the structure of bacterial communities in the environment. An advanced bio-monitoring platform was developed by Chang and coworkers [16] using hydrogenase gene-targeted molecular monitoring and the results suggested that the Bacillus sp. and hydrogen-producing Clostridium sp. represented the major players with high metabolic action in the system fermenting brewery yeast waste. Comparing the hydrogenase gene-targeted RT-PCR results with the results obtained from active microbe, hydrogenase gene-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry analysis, there were two predominant hydrogen-producing clostridia possessing either a C. pasteurianum-like or a C. saccharobutylicum-like hydrogenase gene. Furthermore, the results also reveal that the isolated strain of C. butyricum M1 possessing specific C. saccharobutylicum-like hydrogenase could co-culture with the isolated partner bacteria B. thermoamylovorans B5 which has efficient saccharification, solubilization and biomass-conversion ability to produce hydrogen [17]. Unexpectedly, the other predominant hydrogen-producing clostridia possessing a C. pasteurianum-like hydrogenase gene could not be cultured in artificial media for reasons unclear. In this investigation, the predominant C. beijerinckii L9 was identified as the major hydrogen-producing strain. While little was revealed concerning specific metabolic functions, significantly enhanced hydrogen production was obtained with the co-culture system C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 [18]. Additionally, the hydrogen economy still is an issue for the assessment of anaerobic hydrogen development. According theoretical hydrogen yield of organics, 1 mol of glucose could harvest 4 mol of hydrogen and some by-products. These by-products consists organic alcohols, acids and trace elements, as well as probiotics such as Bacillus sp. and Clostridium sp. These microorganisms could enhance the diversity of soil which could directly/indirectly stimulate plants growth and enhance its sustainability. Obviously, anaerobic hydrogen not only could play a role of biomass energy, but also play an indicator for producing organic soil activator."
14,Conclusions,"120-mL batch co-cultures of Clostridium beijerinckii L9, Clostridium butyricum M1 and Bacillus thermoamylovorans B5 with yeast waste under mesophilic conditions were used according to full factorial design (FFD) and mixture design (MD). Highly reproducible co-culture results confirmed that FFD and MD with multivariate analysis was a fruitful approach to investigate the symbiotic relationship in the defined bacterial co-culture system. B. thermoamylovorans B5 made a higher contribution in the hydrogen-production lag phase than C. beijerinckii L9 and C. butyricum M1. C. beijerinckii L9 and B. thermoamylovorans B5 determined the hydrogen production rate and yield of the co-culture L9 & M1 & B5. The principle conclusions derived from this study are: 1. The experimental results demonstrate that the individuals C. beijerinckii L9 and C. butyricum M1 had high potentials to convert yeast waste into hydrogen. 2. There was no significant hydrogen generation when the individual B. thermoamylovorancs B5 was cultured with yeast waste. However, it could markedly shorten the co-culture’s hydrogen-producing lag phase. 3. Response surface analyses results demonstrated that B. thermoamylovorancs B5 could stimulate the specific hydrogen-producing rate of C. beijerinckii L9 and C. butyricum M1. 4. A hydrogen yield of 46 (mL H2/g COD added yeast waste) was obtained with an optimal volumetric ratio C. beijerinckii L9: C. butyricum M1: B. thermoamylovoranc B5 of 8.9: 4.8: 10.3."
