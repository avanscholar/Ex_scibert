0,Introduction,"One of the most widely used methods for the production of biodiesel is the transesterification of glyceride with extra amounts of alcohol. This results in the formation of a ternary system including alkyl ester/alcohol/glycerol [1]. The separation of the components of this ternary system is an important obstacle for biodiesel production at large scales and the industrialization of this process. There are other important considerations (e.g., movement of alcohol from glycerol to neat biodiesel phase for alcohol regeneration) for the production of biodiesel that all require understanding the LLE behavior of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol ternary system. Although the biodiesel and glycerol are highly immiscible because of their different density, the complete separation of these materials requires time, costs, and construction of extra processing units putting the design and operation of continuous biodiesel production processing plant into several bottlenecks. Therefore, the separation of neat biodiesel from glycerol is a limiting step requiring more research and development. The study of liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) of methyl ester/alcohol/glycerol gives a fundamental insight and understanding into biodiesel phase behavior in the presence of other transesterification agents, thereby identifying those circumstances under which biodiesel production and processing can be effectively managed. This can also facilitate the design and optimization of novel biodiesel production units such as membrane reactors, liquid liquid extraction units, absorption units, etc. [2]. This issue is mostly a matter of thermodynamic science as its ideas with the equilibrium in a ternary system. Although thermodynamics have provided many reliable studies and models for the study of LLE of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol, they are limited to specific conditions (temperature and pressures) and do not possess the universality to cover the entire population of a specific material at different operating points. The thermodynamic activity models and several equations of states have been successfully applied to predict the phase behavior of ternary system biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol with great accuracy. The data for 34 different biodiesel ternary systems were utilized by Do Carmo et al. [3] for tuning the activity models including ASOG, UIFAC, UNIFAC-LLE, and UNIFAC-Dortmund. It has been reported that the UNIFAC-Dortmund outperforms other activity models for the phase behavior of biodiesel ternary systems. They reported differences among activity models exist mainly because of the way they deal with thermal effect in the residual part. Among various types of activity models, the use of NRTL, UNIFAC, and UNIQUAC for biodiesel phase behavior is more common. Sena and Pereira [4] have compared the performance of NRTL and UNIQUAC for phase equilibrium of biodiesel/methanol/glycerol, concluding that the standard deviation of NRTL is 1.25% which is lower than that of UNIQUAC model 2.7%. Zhang et al. [5] have studied the NRTL model for biodiesel/ethanol/glycerol ternary system reporting the RMSE model less than 0.0135. Oliveira et al. [6] have employed the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) to describe the phase behavior of canola oil biodiesel/ethanol/glycerol ternary system between temperatures 303.15 and 333.15 K with average deviations inferior to 3%. Noriega et al. [7] have correlated rather a generalized thermodynamic model for biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol phase equilibria reporting that set of group interaction parameters (GIP) conjugate with the NRTL activity model can predict the LLE phase behavior of 23 vegetable oils in methanol and ethanol with average deviation up to 0.7%. Negi et al. [8] have reported that the UNIFAC and UNIFAC-Dortmund models for the methyl oleate /glycerol/methanol at 60 °C match the experimental data well. However, the prediction of these activity models deviates significantly for the ternary system glycerol/monoolein/methyl oleate at 135 °C. They have concluded that the UNIFAC models are not adequate to address the transesterification processes. Mesquita et al. [9] have pointed out that the NRTL model is able to predict the LEE phase behavior of cottonseed biodiesel/ethanol/glycerol at T = 293.15, 313.15, and 333.15 K with an average global deviation 0.89%. In another similar study, Mesquita et al. [10] have demonstrated that the NRTL and UNIQUAC models are able to describe the LLE of coconut biodiesel/ethanol/glycerol at temperatures 293.15 and 323.15 K with an average deviation 1.27% and 1.52% respectively. In a third study, Mesquita et al. [11] have analyzed the sunflower/soybean biodiesel in equilibrium with ethanol and glycerol at temperatures 293.15 and 323.15 K (for soybean biodiesel), 298.15 and 313.15 (for sunflower biodiesel) with the NRTL activity model. The root mean square deviation of this activity model is about 1.9% for both studied systems. Mazutti et al. [12] have modelled the LLE equilibrium data for castor oil methyl and ethyl ester in presence of water, methanol, ethanol, and glycerol at temperatures 303.15, 318.15, and 333.15 K via UNIQUAC activity model. In a similar work, Mazutti et al. [13] have repeated their experiments and modelling for soybean oil methyl and ethyl ester in presence of water/alcohol/glycerol. Maghami et al. [14] have verified the applicability of UNIFAC, UNIFAC-LLE, UNIFAC-LBY, UNIFAC-DMD, and NIST modified UNIFAC in giving the equilibrium composition waste oil fish biodiesel/methanol/glycerol at three temperatures 298.15, 313.15, and 328.15 K obtaining the respective deviations 2.05%, 2.85%. 2.09%, 2.60%, 3.30%, 2.04%, and 2.05% for these activity models. Assodeh et al. [15] have analyzed the LLE of Linesed oi/methanol/glycerol using both experimentation and activity models. The deviation of developed models from measurement is 1.380%, 1.547%, 3.164%, 3.187%, 3.881% and 3.960 for UNIQUAC, NRTL, UNIFAC-LLE, UNIFAC, UNIFAC-DMD and UNIFAC-LBY, respectively. In two separate studies, Machado et al. [16,17] modelled the LLE phase behavior of castor/soybean oil biodiesel in the presence of ethanol/glycerol+NaOH at two temperatures 298.2 and 333.2 K by virtue of the NRTL model and studied the LLE for different temperatures and NaOH contents. They have reported that the ethanol solubilizes preferably in the glycerol-rich phase. The root mean square deviation of NRTL was equal to 1.6% for soybean and < 1.3% for castor oil ternary systems. Liu et al. [18] have experimentally evaluated the LLE phase behavior of the soybean oil methyl ester/ethanol/glycerol in the temperature range from the 300.15 to 343.15 K. They have revealed that the transesterification reaction takes place in the ethanol phase and reported how the distribution of FAEE and bioethanol changes as the concentration varies among the existed phases. Other similar works [19–51] can also be found in the literature which experimentally analyzed the LLE of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol ternary system and represented the equilibrium phase behavior with activity models and equation of states with great precision. However, these studies are specified for a certain biodiesel ternary system and cannot be generalized over a wide range of conditions for several similar ternary biodiesel systems. In a recent work by Reynel-Àliva [52], machine learning was employed to ameliorate the capability of NRTL in the prediction of the phase behavior of biodiesel in 10 thermodynamic systems over 133 tie lines. In this work, LLE phase behavior of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol was modelled and generalized over a wide range of operating points for different types of methyl ester and alcohol. The capability of developed models in giving tie lines is also validated by the Othmer-Tobias equation and compared with different activity models to assure the developed models have the required degree of preciseness and comprehensiveness. Esipovich et al. [53] have demonstrated that the miscibility among rape seed oil and methanol is extremely low, although it could be increased as the presence of the FAMEs in the system. Both FAME and glycerol have been found to be soluble in methanol, while they are not miscible that much in one another. The authors have been also confirmed that for this specific system FAMEs are more soluble in glycerol-rich phase than glycerol in FAMEs phase. The miscibility among the components shows to some extent an increasing effect on temperature. Activitiy models have shown great modelling potentials for other biodiesel tenrary systems (e.g., biodiesel/methanol/water). Santos et al. [2] have compared the modelling accuracy of NRTL and UNIQUAC for biodiesel/methanol/water ternary system. The UNIQUAC can outperform the NRTL in modelling of the biodiesel/methanol/water ternary system binodal curve. The activity models require many parameters that directly relate to the molecular structures and forces to avoid over-under fitting liquid-liquid equilibrium data [54]. In this work, the LLE phase behavior of FAAE/alcohol/glycerol was modelled, validated, and compared with a thermodynamic activity model. Seven intelligent approaches were tested for the proper modelling of phase behavior. To this end, the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) were connectified with three optimization tools: genetic algorithm (GA), shuffled complex evolution (SCE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). One of the precise models was chosen whether artificial intelligence can be reliably used in the prediction of LLE data of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol systems."
1,Methodology,"The modelling methodology is described in detail in this part. It includes data collection, property estimation, model construction and thermodynamic comparison. These steps are described in detail in the following."
2,Data collection,"2.1 Data collection A database covering different types of biodiesel/alcohol/water ternary systems was collected from the experimental works. The database includes the physical properties of compounds therein which was either measured or recommended by the American Institute of Chemical engineering. It consists of W i mass fraction of FAAE, alcohol, and glycerol in feed, elemental composition FAAE (C, H, O compounds material databases), temperature and pressure of measurements. This latest version of ternary data consists of 28 fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE)/2 alcohols methanol + ethanol/glycerol. It includes the 643 LLE data for FAAE within the temperature range from a minimum 298.15 K and a maximum 393.15 K. Table 1 gives the type, chemical formula and identification number of FAAEs obtained from the literature. Table 2 sorts the LLE systems including their FAAEs, temperature range and the number of data points used in the model development."
3,Determination of molecular properties and input variables,"2.2 Determination of molecular properties and input variables Molecular descriptors or parameters are defined as the numerical characteristics associated with chemical formula, molecular weight, and numbers of double bonds. These descriptors are obtained from the basic molecular properties of compounds and their chemical structure. The components three-dimensional molecular structure geometries were drawn using available software. Afterward, the obtained structures were optimized by means of the MM+ molecular mechanic method (Polak-Ribiere algorithm). The desired properties were calculated from the drawn molecular structure and a desired set of descriptors was obtained if they could contribute to the model preciseness appreciably. The descriptors include temperature, and molecular weight of alcohol and alkyl esters, the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, number of double bonds, and the overall composition of FAAE (I)/alcohol (II)/glycerol (III) in the ternary system."
4,Intelligent models,"2.3 Intelligent models The LLE phase behavior is contingent upon different operational variables of the ternary system which makes it difficult to present it in a more efficient way. A high conventional and theoretically meaningful way for modelling is to shift the reduced set of descriptors through multivariable linear regression to the properties/activities of interest. In this approach, it is an arduous task to find the best subset of variable, the one that is able not only to predict the desired activity with a possible minimum error but also to predict in a time-efficient way. Multi-Layer-Regression (MLR) methods are employed to construct the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) to increase the interpretability of the resulting equations. To increase the intelligibility of regression methods, optimization algorithms are implemented to obtain the model parameters. In the case that the best multivariable model is not accurate enough, the nonlinearity behavior of the system should be examined using different methods of analysis. The nonlinear behavior of the ternary system is used by an optimized regression method to map the selected descriptors to the desired outputs. The neural network and support vector machines are considered as the potential models for the biodiesel ternary systems. 2.3.1 ANN (feed forward neural network (FFNN)) A multilayer-layer feed-forward neural network with the sigmoidal (hyperbolic tangent) transfer function is the standard technique used in many robust QSPR/QSAR systems. It could represent almost any nonlinear behavior between a set of molecular descriptors. The most common neural network connection is the multilayer perceptron feedforward neural network. This technique maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. It comprises at least three layers including the input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. A system of fully interconnected processing units called neurons exists in each layer of the model which its number in the input and output layers is related to the number of input and output data, respectively. The connection between the input and output sets of data is established by the signals which are transmitted from the input layer to hidden layers. The hidden layers process the signals and send them to the output layer. 2.3.2 Support vector machines (SVM) The strategy of SVM is to map the input data into a higher dimensional feature space F by the use of a nonlinear mapping ϕ and carrying out linear regression in this new space. With this approach, nonlinear feature mapping makes it possible to deal with nonlinear problems in a linear space. The predictability of SVM approach and its efficiency depend highly on the hyperparameters as they determine whether the constructed model results in over-fitting or under-fitting. These parameters could be obtained by either the standard trial-and-error or optimization tools for selecting the parameters. The Grid algorithm is also an alternative to set the hyperparameters which is time-consuming and unable to converge to a global optimum [62]. Finally, the terminated strategy is employed and checked for the LLE nonlinear model development. The proposed constructed nonlinear algorithm techniques are named X-Y where X indicates the name of the optimization tool and Y represents the name of the implemented support vector machine. The optimized version of support vector machines can improve the convergence time as well as predictive ability significantly [63–65]."
5,Model construction,"2.4 Model construction To model the nonlinear behavior of LLE descriptors in the best multivariable space, a three-layered ANN with tansig transfer function is employed with regards to our prior encouraging results [66–68]. A standard trial-and-error technique is used to build the ANN structure obtaining the infrastructure of the network. To this end, different ANN are built with different numbers of neurons in the sublayers. To obtain the optimal structure, the constructed networks are then tested and evaluated in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. Finally, the optimum network is obtained and presented. This constructed neural network is using the empirical risk minimization to reduce the error of the training data. To have a more generalized error minimization approach, the SVMs are also tested which could set up an upper bound for the globalization of errors. The conventional support vector machine (SVM) and least square support vector machines (LSSVM) was used for modelling purpose. The optimum hyperparameters of the SVMs are difficult to be found when avoiding the over-fitting and under-fitting. To choose the best algorithm to model the biodiesel LLE, the potential of different optimization techniques: including particle swarm optimization (PSO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and shuffled complex evolution (SCE) is evaluated. The scenario is to obtain the hyperparameters effectively and optimally. Fig. 1 represents the strategy of modelling using the combination of optimization tools and SVM [63,69,70]."
6,Thermodynamic models,"2.5 Thermodynamic models The UNIQUAC/Dortmund [71] model is used for the thermodynamic modelling of the biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol ternary system. The UNIQUAC is based on statistical mechanics which knows that the local composition of different compounds as a result of their different molecular size and energy state. This model is an extended version of the quasi-chemical theory of Guggenheim [72] for non-random mixtures comprised of molecules with different sizes. In this model, the excess Gibbs free energy is calculated from the sum of combinatorial and residual contributions. The combinatorial contribution represents the entropic contribution including the composition, the size and the shape effects of molecules. The residual contribution gives the intermolecular forces that affect the enthalpy of the mixture. The calculation of Gibbs free energy is as follows: (1) g E RT = g comb E RT + g res E RT (2) g comb E RT = ∑ i = 1 nc x i ln ϕ i x i + z 2 ∑ i = 1 nc q i x i ln θ i ϕ i (3) g res E RT = − ∑ i = 1 nc x i q i x i ln ∑ j = 1 nc θ j τ ji (4) ϕ i = x i r i ∑ j = 1 nc x j r j (5) θ i = x i q i ∑ j = 1 nc x j q j The activity coefficient in the UNIQUAC model can be obtained from: (6) ln γ i = ln ϕ i x i + z 2 q i ln θ i ϕ i + l i − ϕ i x i ∑ j = 1 nc x j l j − q i ′ ln ∑ j = 1 nc θ j τ ji + q i − q i ∑ j = 1 nc θ j ∑ k = 1 nc θ i τ kj (7) l j = z 2 r j − q j − r j − 1 where τ ij are adjustable parameters that could be expressed from the following: (8) τ ij = exp − Δ u ij RT = exp − a ij RT (9) τ ji = exp − Δ u ji RT = exp − a ji RT (10) a ij = a ij 0 + a ij 1 T (11) a ji = a ji 0 + a ji 1 T The UNIFAC model developed by Fredenslund et al. [73] assumes that the activity coefficient is the sum of the combinatorial and residual contributions: (12) ln γ i = ln γ i C + ln γ i R (13) ln γ i C = ln ϕ i x i + 1 − ϕ i x i − z 2 q i ln ϕ i θ i + 1 − ϕ i θ i (14) ϕ i = x i r i ∑ j = 1 nc x j r j (15) θ i = x i q i ∑ j = 1 nc x j q j (16) θ i = ∑ k = 1 ng υ k i R k (17) q i = ∑ k = 1 ng υ k i Q k (18) ln Γ i = Q k 1 − ln ∑ k = 1 ng θ m ψ mk − ∑ m = 1 ng θ m ψ km ∑ p = 1 ng θ p ψ pm (19) ψ nm = exp − a nm T (20) θ m = Q m X m ∑ j = 1 ng Q n X n (21) X m = ∑ j = 1 ng v m i x j ∑ j = 1 nc ∑ n = 1 ng v n i x j The UNIFAC-Dortmund model exploits the modifications on the UNIFAC model in terms of ϕ i and temperature-dependent interaction parameters of the residual term. (22) ϕ i = x i r i 3 / 4 ∑ j = 1 nc x j r j 3 / 4 (23) ψ nm = exp − a nm + b nm T + c nm T 2 T The structural residual and Van der Waals parameters for the UNIFAC-Dortmund are given in Table 3 . The binary parameters of the UNIFAC-Dortmund which was used for modelling of the biodiesel/water/glycerol ternary system is given in Table 4 . Other activity models have also been applied for LLE of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol systems. The use of NRTL [74], UNIFAC [73], UNIQUAC [75] and ASOG [76] models will be used for comparison between the results of intelligent models and thermodynamics."
7,Model evaluation and parameter estimation,"A program written and developed in MATLAB was employed to estimate the intelligent modelling of the biodiesel/alcohol/water ternary system. The accuracy and comparison of the model were performed using various statistical parameters. It includes the coefficient of determination (R2), average absolute relative deviation (AARD), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard deviation error (STD) [77]. Table 5 gives the mathematical formula of these four statistical model accuracy assessors R2, AARD, RMSE, and STD for the constructed models. The property of alkyl esters not found in the literature was estimated using the group contribution model [78,79]. This method is useful for property calculations of the long carbon chain molecular structures and was previously used for ionic liquids. The different structure for training and testing of modelling using MLP-ANN was tested to avoid any overfitting problem over the entire test sets. Doing some trial and error to find the best structure, the best fitting for the ternary system of the biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol ternary system was obtained by an MLP-ANN which has two hidden inner layers with ten and four neurons, respectively. The structure of the model was obtained solely by training, testing, and validating the model in terms of accuracy and comprehensiveness. The first hidden layer maps the nine input parameters temperature, molecular weight of alcohol, composition of the ternary system (w1, w2, w3) in weight fraction, the molecular weight of biodiesel, number of carbons, hydrogen and carbon‑carbon double bond to ten neurons using weight and bias numbers. The weight and bias numbers for mapping input parameters to the first hidden layer is reported in Table 6 . The second hidden layer maps the data from the first hidden layer ten neurons to its four neutrons using another set of biases and weights to avoid overfitting problems. The role of this layer is very important as our analysis has shown the desired model neither well trained nor validated using only one hidden layer for whatever the number of neurons, their weight and bias are. Table 7 represents the values of weight and bias for the second hidden layer. Finally, the second hidden layer transfers the processed data within two sublayers-the first layer and itself to the output layer using weight and bias. Table 8 gives the quantities of weight and bias of the output layer for transferring the process data to the weight fraction distribution of glycerol between the two phases-I: glycerol rich, II: biodiesel rich. In the case of support vector machines, three optimization tools GA, PSO and SCE are used to find the adjustable, namely hyperparameters of SVM- c, ε, and σ2 and LSSVM-γ, σ2. According to Fig. 1 flow chart, first the quantities of these parameters are reckoned for the train test data after which an outer loop from optimization tools formed and optimizes the values of the hyperparameters. The test set of data was used to build the classifiers and finally the Lagrange multiplier. After successful modelling using the required degree of accuracy and comprehensiveness, the hyperparameters are employed to finalize the structure of Lagrange multiplier. The optimized values of hyper parameters for SVM and LSSVM obtained from PSO, SCE and GA are reported in Table 9 ."
8,Result and discussion,"In this part, the results of intelligent modelling are presented and discussed. First, the coefficient of models obtained from fitting over the data points are presented and then validated against two data set points at different operating conditions. Afterward, the degree of comprehensiveness in modelling approach will be authenticated using Othmer-Tobias methodology. Finally, they are compared in terms of accuracy with activity models."
9,Model statistical parameters,"4.1 Model statistical parameters The accuracy and ability of the constructed models in describing the phase behavior of ternary system biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol are analyzed using statistical parameters-R 2, %AARD, RMSE, and STD in Table 10 for all built models. Specifically, the ANN has the best fitness over other modelling procedures with R 2 = 0.9802 (the arithmetic average of biodiesel, alcohol and glycerol) in the test set. The coefficient of determination (R 2) for SVM connected to SCE, GA and PSO are 0.9572, 0. 9572, and 0. 9573, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R 2) for LSSVM connected to SCE, GA and PSO are 0.9638, 0.9691, and 0.9626, respectively. In this study, LSSVM-SCE was chosen for further verification and validation of models."
10,Model validation,"4.2 Model validation 8 tie lines associated with the peanut oil ethyl ester/ethanol/glycerol equilibrium data at two temperature 303.15 K, 323.15 K [80] and 15 tie lines of linseed methyl esters/methanol/glycerol at three temperatures 300 K, 315 K, and 330 K are employed For validation of the developed model [15]. The precision of SCE-LSSVM initial guess for modelling of Peanut oil methyl ester/ethanol/glycerol at 303.15 K and 323.15 K is presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 . The coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.9994 and 0.9976 at temperature 303.15 and 323.14. The R2 combined (both temperatures considered) will be 0.9988. Toledo et al. [80] have revealed that the coefficient of determination for UNIQUAC assisted PSO is 0.99. The RMSE (%) for this system at 303.15 and 323.15 is 0.5751 and 0.4230. The definition of general RMSE (%) is defined in eq. 26 further down in the manuscript. To validate further the developed model, SCE-LSSVM results are given for a system including methanol as a transesterification agent. The ternary plots for system linseed methyl esters/methanol/glycerol at three temperatures 300 K, 315 K, and 330 K are given in Figs. 4–6 . The coefficient of determination (R2) for this system at 300 K, 315 K, and 330 K is 0.9967, 0.9936, and 0.9968. The R2 for the combined data set at three temperatures is 0.9993. The ternary plots of linseed oil methyl ester/glycerol/methanol presented in Figs. 4–6 include the binodal curve and tie lines obtained from experimentation and intelligent modelling. Overall, the model performs better when the data of each phase is dispersed rather than close and accumulated. This very fact about the intelligent models was also approved by the validation of the model against peanut oil ethyl ester/ethanol/glycerol (Figs. 2–3). To show the further precision of the model, Fig. 7 gives the modelled weight fractions of biodiesel (w 1), ethanol (w 2), and glycerol (w 3) against their experimental values in both extract and raffinate phases. The model ability for giving whatever the species is in both the raffinate and extract phases is satisfactory except when their mass fraction is below 0.2. Two possible reasons are either the lack of enough experimental data for training the models or the model preference to shift the error to smaller absolute values so that the overall model fitness is improved with a few statistical errors. The model fitness precision gives the biodiesel ternary system including both methanol and ethanol as transesterified agent has been authenticated via Figs. 2–7. However, whether the model could satisfy the established thermodynamic rules still needs to be verified. In the next section, the Othmer-Tobias methodology will be employed for further authentication of the developed models."
11,Modelled data verification,"4.3 Modelled data verification To verify the obtained data from models and the consistency of the modelled tie lines, this works provides both Hand calculations [81] (Eq. (24)) and Othmer-Tobias [82] correlations (Eq. (25)): (24) ln w 3 I w 1 I = A + B ln w 3 II w 2 II (25) ln 1 − w 1 I w 1 I = A ′ + B ′ ln 1 − w 2 II w 2 II In the above equations, w denotes the mass fraction of species in ternary system; the subscripts 1, 2, and 3 indicate the biodiesel, glycerol and alcohol; the superscripts I and II demonstrate the biodiesel rich (i.e., extract) and glycerol rich phases (i.e., raffinate). Eqs. (24) and (25) deliver the quality tests of the experimental results. They have been employed here to show how close the obtained mass fractions of species in ternary system are to experimentation. The modelled data associated with the Eqs. (24) and (25) are mapped and fitted with linear equations in Fig. 8 . The regression parameters for hand calculations and Othmer-Tobias correlation are shown in Table 11 . This includes the fitness parameters from both modelled and experiments [80]. The coefficient of determination in both cases is also given in this table, showing that modelled data can be fitted in a resultant line as experiments. The Othmer-Tobias relationship was also exploited to verify the consistency of the obtained tie lines for data used to develop the models. The coefficient of determination was used to show the precision and consistency of tie lines. Table 12 gives the results including the fitness parameter (A′, B′) and R2 obtained for both experiments and modelling data."
12,Comparison with thermodynamic modelling,"4.4 Comparison with thermodynamic modelling Asoodeh et al. [15] have implemented UNIQUAC, UNIFAC and NRTL models to the linseed oil methyl ester/glycerol/ethanol system. They have also employed the models assisted by the closure Eq. [83]. The closure equation is a linear relationship among the binary interaction coefficients of models. Better performance of thermodynamic modelling for LLE of non-linear systems was reported via assistance from the closure Eq. [84–86]. The accuracy of thermodynamic models along with the intelligent model is presented in Table 13 using RMSE for Linseed methyl ester/methanol/glycerol. The strategy they have used to model the linseed methyl ester/methanol/glycerol ternary system is to define and minimize an objective function as follows: (26) F obj = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ k x i , j , k E , exp − x i , j , k E , cal 2 + x i , j , k E , exp − x i , j , k E , cal 2 where x i,j,k E,exp and x i,j,k E,cal indicate the experimental and calculated mass fraction of component i at temperature j for tie-line k. The thermodynamic models are compared to the results of this work based on this function. To this end, a general definition for RMSE has been defined to compare the result of this work with thermodynamic models: (27) RMSE % = 100 ∑ i ∑ j ∑ k x i , j , k E , exp − x i , j , k E , cal 2 + x i , j , k E , exp − x i , j , k E , cal 2 π N comp N tie − line where π, N comp and N tie−line indicate the number of phases, components and tielines respectively. Do Carmo et al. [3] have verified the accuracy of thermodynamic models for LLE of nineteen methyl ester and fifteen ethyl ester using RMSE. Their data repository includes the accuracy of thermodynamics for giving 179 tie lines of which 82 are for ethyl esters and 97 for methyl esters. The intelligent model has been also applied to these systems. The results are given in Tables 14 and 15 for methyl and ethyl esters. Of 18 investigated methyl esters systems, nine systems RMSE with intelligent approach were comparatively lower than thermodynamics. The best candidate within thermodynamic models is UNIFAC-DMD. The overall RMSE for UNIFAC-DMD was 3.56% for methyl ester systems, while it was 2.71% for LSSVM-SCE combined algorithm. In ethyl ester systems, the intelligent approach completely outclassed the thermodynamic modelling in all six verified systems at different temperatures. The best fitted thermodynamic model for the ethyl ester ternary system was UNIFAC-DMD with RMSE 5.17% generalized for all systems. For LSSVM-SCE model, this was obtained 0.71% overall."
13,Plait point,"4.5 Plait point As the top biodiesel rich and bottom glycerol rich phases coincide and are practically the same composition, their associated tie line is diminished to a single point on the binodal curve and a single phase is observed; this is called the plait point. The plait point locates somewhere in the binodal curve. As it is a tie line, it can be estimated from Othmer-Tobias plot. Othmer-Tobias for both the tie-lines and binodal data is shown in Fig. 9 . The intersection of binodal points and tielines is the so called plait points. The plait point composition obtained from modelling is 61% biodiesel, 38.3% methanol and 0.67% glycerol. Csernica and Hsu [26] have obtained the real composition of the plait points for this system from experimentation: 60.2% biodiesel, 39.1% methanol, and 0.7% glycerol. The RMSE for the estimation of the plait point in this case is 0.665%. The plait points of the peanut oil ethyl ester/ethanol/glycerol have been also estimated from the modelling results. Fig. 10 gives the tie lines and binodal data points along with their associated lines at two temperatures 303.15 K and 323.15 K. The Othmer-Tobias for this system at the investigated temperatures intersect with the binodal line at the correspondence plait points. The results are given in Table 16 ."
14,Conclusion,"This work provides a new methodology for modelling of the non-linear phase behavior of biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol systems using intelligent approaches. The multi-layer artificial neural network had the best fitness over the data set points with the coefficient of determination in both train and test sets over 0.99. The results of connectified SCE-LSSVM were verified, validated and compared with different potent thermodynamic activity models. The modelling results were validated for peanut ethyl ester and linseed methyl ester systems. The Othmer-Tobias and Hand calculations were exploited for verification of modelling results. The precision and accuracy of the developed models have been confirmed through comparing modelling results with NRTL, UNIQUAC, ASOG, UNIFAC, UNIFAC-LLE and UNIFAC-DMD. The RMSE (%) in most cases investigated were obtained lower than activity models. In case, the overall RMSE (%) for 18 methyl ester ternary systems was 2.71% followed by 3.61% activity model UNIFAC-DMD. The RMSE for ethyl ester was 0.71% and for UNIFAC-DMD was 5.71%. The model can also estimated the plait point of the biodiesel/alcohol/glycerol with RMSE 0.665%."
