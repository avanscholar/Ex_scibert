0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from the bacterial fermentation of sugars has been examined in a variety of reactor systems, with overall yields generally larger in continuous flow systems than in batch reactors. Hydrogen yields in continuous culture typically can range anywhere from 0.7 to 4.0mol-H2/mol-glucose depending on the bacterial community (type of inoculum, such as pure or mixed culture), temperature, pH, retention time, and other factors (Nandi and Sengupta, 1998; Schröder et al., 1994). In batch tests in the mesophilic temperature range, it has been observed that the overall hydrogen yield is a function of the organic loading with the highest yields obtained at the lowest organic loading (Van Ginkel et al., 2001). In continuous culture tests, influent glucose concentrations of less than 7g/L have resulted in higher hydrogen yields. For example, at an influent glucose concentration of 20gCOD/L (6h HRT), Lin and Chang (1999) observed a yield of 1.7mol-H2/mol-glucose, but at a lower glucose concentration of 7g/L (6h HRT), Fang and Liu (2002) obtained 2.1mol-H2/mol-glucose. Taguchi et al. (1995) found a higher H2 yield of 2.4mol-H2/mol-glucose at an even lower glucose concentration of 3g/L (5.5h HRT). Kataoka et al. (1997) found that increasing the glucose concentration from 5 to 10g/L (8h HRT) decreased H2 yields from 2.0–2.3mol-H2/mol-glucose to 1.4–2.0mol-H2/mol-glucose. Clostridium pasteurianum is an acid producer and produces hydrogen along with acetate and butyrate according to (Thauer et al., 1977) (1) C6H12O6+2 H2O→2 CH3COOH+2 CO2+4 H2 (4 ATP), (2) C6H12O6→CH3CH2CH2COOH+2 CO2+2 H2 (3 ATP). In earlier work, we observed that species related to C. pasteurianum dominated the culture using similar conditions to the present study. The highest H2 yield that can be obtained using bacteria is therefore 4mol-H2/mol-glucose when acetic acid is produced, and this also results in a net production of 4mol of ATP (Jones and Woods, 1986). However, average yields of H2 using glucose in the mesophilic temperature range are always less than 4mol-H2/mol-glucose and vary widely (Kataoka et al., 1997; Fang and Liu, 2002; Lin and Chang, 1999). According to the model developed by Ruzicka (1996), the main limitation for producing the highest yields of H2 is the inhibitory effect of H2 partial pressure on hydrogen production. In this model, as the concentration of dissolved H2 increases in the liquid phase, the transfer of electrons from glucose to H2 becomes increasingly unfavorable. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, E ∘ NADH ′ = - 320 mV ) is the electron carrier that is involved in the transfer of electrons from the dehydrogenation of triose phosphate to H2 while ferredoxin (Fd, E ∘ Fd ′ = - 400 mV ) is the electron carrier that is involved in the transfer of electrons from pyruvate to H2 ( E ∘ H 2 ′ = - 414 mV ) (Thauer et al., 1977). Since NADH has a higher potential than H2, the dehydrogenation of triose phosphate to produce 2mol of H2 can occur only when the concentration of H2 is less than ∼6×10−4 atm while the production of H2 via the oxidation of pyruvate and ferredoxin can generate another 2mol of H2 at higher H2 concentrations up to ∼0.3 atm (Angenent et al., 2004). Thus, in order to obtain H2 yields greater than 2mol-H2/mol-glucose, the production of H2 via triose phosphate dehydrogenation and NADH must be achieved. However, when all of the NAD+ (oxidized form) is in the reduced form (NADH) because it is unfavorable to transfer electrons from NADH to H2, the flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway and through the phosphoroclastic reaction stops. In order to increase this glucose flux for maximum ATP production, some bacteria (for example, C. pasteurianum) divert electrons in NADH to the production of butyrate, resulting in a decrease in H2 yields and the production of 3mol of ATP (Eqs. (1) and (2)). The production of butyrate rather than acetate allows for NAD+ regeneration, a greater flux of glucose through the bacterial glycolytic pathway, and a greater overall ATP production rate than what acetate production alone could sustain (Crabbenbaum et al., 1985). Several studies have shown that hydrogen yields can be increased in continuous culture by decreasing hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor. One approach to achieve this is to strip hydrogen from the liquid using N2 sparging (Hussy et al., 2003; Crabbenbaum et al., 1985). A second method has been to apply a vacuum to the headspace, lowering the overall partial pressure in the system (Kataoka et al., 1997). We reasoned that an alternative method of lowering the dissolved H2 concentrations would be to reduce the rate of hydrogen production, allowing more efficient stripping of the hydrogen from the liquid phase by stirring. Thus, an experimental matrix was designed to systematically test a combination of four different glucose concentrations and four hydraulic loading rates in order to systematically test the effect of glucose loading rate, and therefore H2 production rate, on hydrogen yields from glucose."
1,Methods,
2,Startup and feeding,"2.1 Startup and feeding Two identical fermentors (New Brunswick BioFlo 110) were used in these experiments. Each reactor was cleaned and scrubbed with hot tap water, filled to 2L with distilled water, and autoclaved for 1h. Reactors were sparged with N2 gas for ∼20min before inoculation to help achieve anaerobic conditions and to cool the medium before inoculation with 10g of a heat shocked agricultural soil. The soil was baked for 2h at 100°C to select for spore forming bacteria that produce hydrogen, such as Clostridia spp. (Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Iyer et al., 2004). Glucose, nutrients, and l-cysteine (0.5g/L; to scavenge oxygen and lower the initial redox potential) were then added. Nutrients were added as previously described (Logan et al., 2002) at a constant carbon:nutrient ratio throughout the study. Feed bottles (10L) were continuously sparged with N2 gas and mixed (∼250rpm) to maintain anaerobic conditions."
3,Reactor operation,"2.2 Reactor operation Reactors were operated at four different glucose feed concentrations (C; 10, 7.5, 5.0, and 2.5gCOD/L) and four different HRTs (θ; 10, 5.0, 2.5, and 1h), producing glucose loading rates calculated as L = CV / θ , where L ranged from 0.5 to 18.9gCOD/h and V = 2 L is the reactor volume. The reactor operating temperature was 30°C. Data were taken to characterize the steady state performance of the system for each combination of HRT and glucose concentration. At the 5g/L glucose concentration, the 10h HRT was repeated four times, the 5h HRT was repeated three times, and the 2.5 and 1h HRTs were repeated twice. Reactors were cleaned and re-inoculated for each glucose concentration. Each reactor was operated in batch mode until the redox potential dropped below ∼−200mV and gas was produced. Reactors were then switched first to the 10h HRT until steady state conditions were obtained as indicated by constant gas production. Each reactor was then sampled at a fixed HRT over at least three HRTs. The reactor retention time was then decreased to the next lower level and the reactor was operated until steady state conditions were achieved as noted above. A regression analysis of reactor performance was performed using the Linest function in Microsoft Excel (2003). Glucose and gas (H2, CO2, and N2) concentrations were measured in triplicate, biomass concentrations in duplicate, and single acid/alcohol samples were taken at each sampling time. A total of three samples were taken for each steady state condition. H2 gas flow rate measurements were taken at least five times per sampling time for a total of 15 measurements per HRT. The HRT was checked by continuous collection of the effluent, and the total uptake of the KOH solution (0.1M) was continuously recorded."
4,Gas production,"2.3 Gas production The H2 gas flow rate was measured using a volumetric gas flowmeter (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) calibrated for pure H2 gas. In order to obtain a pure H2 gas stream, the biogas exiting the reactor was directed through a water trap and was then stripped of CO2 using a strong base (1M KOH). The biogas then flowed into a 30mL vessel or ‘trap’ that was sampled to verify the composition of the gas. Some N2 (1–2%) was measured in the gas stream likely as a result of N2 degassing of the influent feed bottle. Gas flow measurements were therefore corrected for the N2 present by dividing the measured flowrate by the ratio of the N2 and H2 viscosities."
5,Analytical,"2.4 Analytical Hydrogen gas in the headspace was sampled using a Gas-tight™ (Hamilton, Reno, NV) syringe (0.5mL injection volume) and measured using a gas chromatograph (GC; Model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrence, CA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve column (Molesieve 5A 80/100; Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with nitrogen as the carrier gas. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide percentages were measured in the headspace using a gas chromatograph of the same model (Porapak Q column; Alltech) with helium as the carrier gas. Gas samples were compared to four standard levels of pure gas injections. Acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and acetone in the liquid phase were measured using an Agilent GC-FID (Palo Alto, CA) using pure chemicals as standards. All liquid samples were filtered using a 0.2μm pore diameter filter (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and diluted twice with 50% formic acid. Liquid samples were refrigerated before analysis and were compared to five to seven standard levels of pure chemical injections. The biomass concentration was measured using the Total Solids Measurement technique according to Standard Methods (APHA et al., 1998). Glucose was measured (in triplicate) using the phenol sulfuric acid assay (Dubois et al., 1956) using a standard assay of glucose over the range of 10–70mg/L."
6,Results,
7,H2 yields as a function of glucose concentration and HRT,"3.1 H2 yields as a function of glucose concentration and HRT H2 yields were calculated from data on hydrogen production and total glucose consumption in reactors operated at 15 different glucose feed concentrations and HRTs (Table 1 ). Overall, the H2 yield increased with HRT and decreased with influent glucose concentration (Fig. 1 ). The steepness of the plane fit to the data shown in Fig. 1 is greater for the COD concentration than the HRT, suggesting that the glucose concentration had a greater effect on H2 yields than HRT. For example, the average yield increased from 1.8 to 2.6mol-H2/mol-glucose as the glucose concentration changed from 10 to 2.5gCOD/L, but only increased from 1.9 to 2.4mol-H2/mol-glucose as the HRT increased from 1 to 10h. These changes in hydrogen yield are significant, with a multiple linear regression producing a correlation of Y = 0.044 HRT - 0.070 COD + 2.6 ( p < 0.05 ). An analysis of variance using adjusted sum of squares (Minitab) was also used to elicit effects of HRT and glucose on H2 yields. As a whole, both the HRT and the glucose concentration had an important effect on H2 yields ( p < 0.05 ). A pairwise comparison was conducted (Tukey 95.0% simultaneous confidence intervals) to check for H2 yield differences amongst the different levels of HRT and glucose individually. With respect to HRT, of the six pairs to be tested, only two of the pairs (10 and 5h vs. 1h) were considered to be different. In contrast, with respect to glucose concentration, five of the six comparisons were different. This is in agreement with the T-values using Linest where the T-value for glucose (−14) is larger in magnitude than the T-value for HRT (7)."
8,H2 yield and production as a function of the glucose loading rate,"3.2 H2 yield and production as a function of the glucose loading rate When the above data on HRT and influent glucose concentrations are combined to calculate organic loading rates, it can be seen that H2 yields were inversely related to the glucose loading rate (Fig. 2 ). As the glucose loading rate decreased from 18.9 to 0.5g-glucose/h, the hydrogen yield increased from 1.7 to 2.8mol-H2/mol-glucose. H2 production increased approximating a hyperbolic function as shown in Fig. 2. The greatest increase in yield was obtained at glucose loading rates below 2.8g/h, a portion of the data that corresponds to HRT at glucose concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0gCOD/L and the 7.5gCOD/L for a 10h HRT (Table 1). The overall effect of glucose loading on hydrogen gas production was an essentially linear increase in the H2 production rate (per 2L reactor volume) with glucose loading rate (Fig. 3 ). Gas measurements of the reactor headspace showed a high H2 gas concentration in the reactor at all conditions, ranging from 60% to 72% (average of 63.3±3.5%) (Table 1). The greatest H2 gas concentrations were obtained at the lowest influent glucose concentration (average of 69.3±2.5%). In general, the residual glucose concentration increased with glucose feed concentration and decreased with HRT (Table 1). Glucose removal was higher than 90% in all experiments, and was above 97% for an influent glucose concentration of 2.5gCOD/L (Table 1)."
9,Biomass concentrations in the reactor,"3.3 Biomass concentrations in the reactor There was often substantial biomass flocculation in the reactor, as shown by Fig. 4 for the reactor operated at an influent glucose concentration of 10gCOD/L and a 1h HRT. Overall, biomass concentrations in the reactor increased with decreasing HRT and increasing glucose concentration, reaching a maximum concentration of 24.6g/L (10g/L, 1h HRT). The biomass concentration in the reactor was significantly correlated with the overall glucose loading rate (Fig. 5 , p = 0.00008 ). The effect of flocculation on the biomass concentration is reflected by a sharp increase in biomass concentration for the lower HRTs (Table 1). At the 10g/L level, no substantial flocculation was observed at the 10h HRT (no large flocs were visible), but this reactor flocculated when the HRT was decreased to 5h. As a result of bacterial flocculation the solids retention time did not equal the HRT. This increase in solids retention enabled low glucose concentrations even at the shortest HRTs. It has previously been reported that mixed acidogenic cultures have a maximum doubling time of 2h (Ghosh, 2003), and therefore without flocculation it is likely that the culture would have washed out at the 1h HRT."
10,Soluble products produced by glucose fermentation,"3.4 Soluble products produced by glucose fermentation Acetic and butyric acids were the dominant soluble products obtained for all experiments (Table 1). The average molar ratio of HAc/HBu was 0.86±0.14 (range 0.62–1.08), but overall the magnitude of this ratio was inversely related to the glucose loading rate ( p = 0.02 ) (Fig. 6 ). Acetone, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and propionic acid were detected for influent glucose concentrations of 7.5 and 10gCOD/L levels, but the concentrations of these compounds were always each less than 20mg/L. The low production of solvents indicates that the fermentations observed in this study were acidogenic rather than solventogenic fermentations."
11,COD mass balance,"3.5 COD mass balance Since the reactors flocculated a true biomass yield cannot be calculated from the measured biomass concentrations in the reactor. However, a COD mass balance can be approximated by estimating the biomass from energetic calculations given in McCarty (1972) with the average observed HAc:HBu ratio found in this study of 0.86. From this ratio an average cell yield of 0.2g-cell/g-glucose is calculated. In this calculation, the difference between the energy available in glucose and the energy used to produce H2, HAc, and HBu is used to calculate a bacterial yield assuming a 60% efficiency of energy transfer. Assuming 1.63gCOD/g-cell (as CH5O2N), the total mass balance on COD fed into the reactor accounts for 92±7% of the COD in the soluble gas and liquid products, and biomass (0.2g-cell/g-glucose)."
12,Discussion,"Overall, the H2 production rate increased with the glucose feeding rate. While glucose itself is not expected to inhibit hydrogen production, it was observed here that the H2 yields were inversely related to the glucose feeding rate. The highest H2 yields occurred at the lowest glucose loading rate at the 2.5gCOD/L level producing an average of 2.6mol-H2/mol-glucose. The reason for this increase in the yield of hydrogen is likely due to end product inhibition by over-accumulated (supersaturated) hydrogen gas in the liquid at high organic loading rates (Ruzicka, 1996; Doremus et al., 1985). This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that as glucose loading rates were decreased, the hydrogen gas production rate decreased, which would result in less gas accumulation and less inhibition due to hydrogen gas production. At higher feeding rates, where more H2 was produced, there would have been more inhibition of the hydrogenase (Ruzicka, 1996). H2 yields observed in this study are slightly higher than other H2 yields reported in other studies (Fang and Liu, 2002; Taguchi et al., 1995; Kataoka et al., 1997; Lin and Chang, 1999). A comparison of yields produced in five studies (including this one) shows that the influent glucose concentration is a consistent predictor of hydrogen yield on the basis of mol-H2/mol-glucose (Fig. 7A ). The effect of glucose concentration on yield is most noticeable for glucose concentrations less than 10g/L. When retention time is also considered, there is relatively less agreement among these different studies (Fig. 7B). This lack of agreement suggests that other differences in the reactor operation, such as inoculum, stirring, and reactor configuration, contributed to the differences in yield on the basis of loading rate. The hydrogen yields obtained here coincided with lower HAc:HBu ratios than those expected from Eqs. (1) and (2). According to these equations, the average observed yield of 2.6mol-H2/mol-glucose at the 2.5g/L glucose concentration should produce a HAc:HBu ratio of 1.73. At the highest organic loading rates of 3.8–18.9g/h, we obtained a HAc:HBu ratio of 0.78±0.11 ( n = 7 ). The lower ratio obtained here indicates carbon flow into a product other than acetate, which could be a result of biomass production or carbon flow to some other end product not measured in our chemical analyses. While the ratio obtained here is lower than that expected, our results are consistent with the findings of others. For example, Crabbenbaum et al. (1985) found a HAc:HBu ratio of 0.74±0.07 over a wide range of influent glucose concentrations (5.0–55g-glucose/L; 5h HRT) using C. butyricum. Although H2 was not measured in their study due to the degree of N2 sparging, they observed a high ATP yield of 3.27±0.02mol-ATP/mol-glucose which implies 2.7mol-H2/mol-glucose was produced as well (Eqs. (1) and (2)). Their higher ATP yield should coincide with a high HAc:HBu ratio but it did not. Energy production with hydrogen generation is greatest when acetate is produced (4mol-ATP/mol-glucose), but when hydrogen concentrations are high, NAD+ can only be regenerated if compounds other than acetate are produced (such as butyrate or butanol). ATP generation is 3mol-ATP/mol-glucose when butyrate is produced. Although we did not measure ATP here, Crabbenbaum et al. (1985) found that the average ATP yield was 3.27±0.02mol-ATP/mol-glucose, which corresponds to a H2 yield of 2.7mol-H2/mol-glucose based on Eqs. (1) and (2). Thauer et al. (1977) calculated thermodynamic efficiencies for biohydrogen production from glucose, and for a HAc: HBu ratio of 0.86 (0.6mol of acetate and 0.7mol of butyrate from 1.0mol glucose) they concluded that the hydrogen yield would be 2.6mol-H2/mol-glucose at a thermodynamic efficiency of 85%. These values for the hydrogen yield are consistent with results obtained here for the average HAc:HBu ratio of 0.86±0.14."
13,Implications of increased hydrogen production with low organic loading rates,"4.1 Implications of increased hydrogen production with low organic loading rates The present work has focused on the maximization of H2 production yields by lowering the glucose loading rate. Previously, researchers have primarily studied H2 production at much higher glucose concentrations and longer HRTs than those examined here (Lin and Chang, 1999; Majizat et al., 1997). Since it has been shown in the present study that the glucose concentration has a greater effect on H2 yields than the HRT, this suggests it is more advantageous to operate biohydrogen reactors at lower HRTs and keep the glucose concentration as low as possible, perhaps through dilution or recycle. It remains difficult to economically justify biological hydrogen production from commercially produced pure substrates, such as glucose and sucrose, as typically most of the organic matter cannot be converted to hydrogen. This observation, coupled with the findings here that relatively dilute concentrations of sugar seem to increase hydrogen yields, suggests that the most immediate application of biological hydrogen production will be as a pretreatment method for wastewaters high in dissolved carbohydrates. Recent work using batch reactors has shown that hydrogen can be produced from these wastewaters (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). Future work should concentrate on the development of continuous flow studies in order to obtain high yields of hydrogen from these waste resources."
14,Conclusions,"Based on the experiments conducted here, the following conclusions can be drawn. 1. H2 yields increased from 1.7 to 2.8mol-H2/mol-glucose as the glucose feeding rate decreased from 18.9 to 0.5g/h. 2. Glucose concentration (2.5–10gCOD/L) has a greater effect on H2 yields than the HRT (1–10h). 3. Flocculation resulted at glucose loading rates greater than 3.8g glucose/h and allowed high H2 production rates and low residual glucose concentrations to be obtained."
