0,Introduction,"Despite the rapid growth of renewable energy, fossil energy still occupies the absolute dominant position. According to U.S. Energy Administration report, coal, oil and natural gas account for more than 90% of the international energy framework in 2018, and refinery throughput in Asia increases by 60% between 2018 and 2050 [1]. The rapid depletion of traditional resources leads to an increasing role for unconventional resources (such as heavy crude oil) [2,3]. Compared with conventional heavy crude oil, high viscosity and density make heavy crude oil difficult to be exploited and utilized effectively [4,5], therefore, it is imperative to upgrading of heavy crude oil before transportation. The difficult problem of upgrading heavy crude oil is that the resin and asphaltene in heavy crude oil are composed of thick ring compounds with strong intermolecular forces [6–8]. Simultaneously, resin and asphaltene contain number of heteroatoms (N, O, S), make the structure of heavy crude oil more complex. For conventional thermal cracking, there is serious coking problem in pyrolysis, and high temperature is accompanied by huge energy consumption, which is contrary to the idea of sustainable development. Biomass as a clean energy with great potential to meet the development of human society in the future [9–11]. The amount of global biomass annual production is estimated to be more than 10 billion tons (dry basis), and the energy contained in biomass is more than that of 2 billion tons of standard coal [12–14].Some researchers proposed that the possibility of using biomass in heavy crude oil upgrading and greatly improved the quality of crude [15–20]. From the point of view of hydrogen supply, water is employed as hydrogen donor for the upgrading of heavy crude oil, and its mechanism is that water–gas reacts to generate H2 as hydrogen source for hydrogen supply. Whereas, the effect of hydrogen supply is limited due to uneven mass transfer between phases and oil–water separation. In contrast, the organic hydrogen donors (such as alcohols, aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons) are more effective. It is worth noting that biomass pyrolysis oil contains these hydrogen supplying components, which have the potential to replace organic hydrogen donors. Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of three key building blocks: cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin [21], and different components have different decomposition temperatures. For example, in the biomass pyrolysis process, hemicelluloses decompose first at 200-260 °C, whereas cellulose breaks down at 240-350 °C, and decomposition of lignin starts at temperatures of 280–500 °C [22]. Lignin cracking produces more phenols, which is bad for heavy crude oil upgrading because it contains more oxygen and is more acidic [23]. By contrast, cellulose has relatively mild reaction conditions, and the decomposition temperature is close to the upgrading temperature of heavy crude oil, thereby, cellulose pyrolysis oil can be considered as hydrogen donor for heavy crude oil upgrading. The products of cellulose pyrolysis mainly include alcohols, aromatics, furans, aliphatic-hydrocarbons and esters [24–27], most of which can be taken as heavy crude oil upgrading hydrogen donors. Theoretically, organic compounds with low oxidation potential can be taken as hydrogen donors, and the lower oxidation potential enables the hydrogen donors to realize hydrogen transfer under mild reaction conditions [28]. Some related reports [29–33] have shown that aromatics and alcohols as hydrogen donors to provide active hydrogen for breaking C-X (X:C, S, N, O) bond in upgrading of heavy crude oil. Likewise, the colloidal structure of heavy crude oil was changed by polar substances such as esters [34]. Efficient catalyst is indispensable for in heavy crude oil upgrading, reports have included water/oil-soluble metal salt [35,36], nano-catalyst [2,37] and solid acid catalyst [38,39]. Recent years, ZSM-5 had rich acid centers and developed pore structure characteristics, which was employed as a carrier to load transition metal oxide (such as Iron oxide) for heavy crude oil upgrading [40] and biomass pyrolysis [41–45]. HZSM-5 can selectively catalyze the occurrence of aromatization, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction while improving the yield, so that there are more aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. However, although the addition of metal oxides can enhance the catalytic activity of HZSM-5, the effects of metal centers on the acidity and strong and weak acids of HZSM-5, as well as the regulation of cellulose cracking products, have not been analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the hydrogen supply analysis of cellulose pyrolysis oil in heavy crude oil upgrading needs to be studied. The purpose of this study was to investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of hydrogen supply from cellulose pyrolysis oil in upgrading heavy crude oil and the effect of acid center regulation via incorporation iron oxide on cellulose pyrolysis. Thus, the effects of operating conditions on heavy crude oil upgrading were also evaluated based on the heavy crude oil group (SARA), stability and functional group change. Considering the applicability of the reaction in the heavy crude oil upgrading (long reaction time may lead to condensation and coking of heavy crude oil), and combining with previous studies, all experiments were carried out below 30 min."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The heavy crude oil comes from Bohai oilfield of China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Microcrystalline cellulose, n-heptane, iron nitrate nonahydrate and acetone were obtained from Kelong Reagent Factory in Chengdu. All chemicals mentioned above are analytical pure grade. HZSM-5 zeolites (SiO2/Al2O3 = 36) purchased from Nankai university catalyst plant. The zeolite was calcined to remove the template before used. Heavy crude oil properties were described in Table 1 ."
3,Preparation of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst The preparation method of the catalyst has been mentioned in our previous research [46], the details are as follows. Fe-loaded HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method. Before Fe loading, the HZSM-5 was calcined at 500 °C in a muffle furnace to remove the template and residues. HZSM-5 was then immersed in a 50 mL solution of iron nitrate (containing desired loading of Fe) for 3 h at room temperature. The Fe/HZSM-5 sample obtained was then dried at 105 °C overnight and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the agglomerated Fe/HZSM-5 solid was gently ground into a powder and stored for further use."
4,One-pot catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose-heavy crude oil,"2.3 One-pot catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose-heavy crude oil High temperature autoclave has been taken in experiment of heavy crude oil upgrading. About 90 g of heavy crude oil, a certain amount of cellulose (1-5 wt%) and Fe/HZSM-5 (0.4 wt%) were added to the autoclave. Nitrogen purge three times to ensure an oxygen-free environment before heated. The reactor was stirred and heated at 500 rpm and 4 °C/min respectively. The reactor was naturally cooled to room temperature after the reaction lasted 30 min, the modified oil was taken out for subsequent analysis. The viscosity of all samples was determined by NDJ-8SN digital display viscometer, and the viscosity reduction (Δ η) was calculated with the Eq (1): (1) Δ η = η 0 - η η 0 Where η0: the viscosity of heavy crude oil; η: the viscosity of oil sample after upgrading."
5,Cellulose catalytic liquefaction,"2.4 Cellulose catalytic liquefaction The liquefaction process was carried out in a high temperature reactor with stirring. Detailed as follows, the inert solvent n-heptane provides a liquid environment for catalytic liquefaction of cellulose on Fe/HZSM5. The ratio of cellulose to catalyst and the reaction conditions were the same as viscosity reduction experiment of heavy crude oil. The reaction was terminated and cooled to room temperature, gas products are directly evacuated due to negligible gas production, acetone is employed to clean the inner walls of the reactor and solid residue. Separation of solid and liquid phases by filtration. Finally, reduced pressure distillation was employed in bio-oil treatment to remove acetone. The yield of each fraction was calculated according to the following material balance Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) B i o - o i l y i e l d ( % ) = w b i o - o i l w c e l l u l o s e ; (2) C h a r y i e l d ( % ) = w c h a r w c e l l u l o s e ; (3) Gas yield % = 1 - Bio - oil yield % - Char yield % Noteworthy, in this system, n-heptane does not participate in the reaction. Likewise, low saturated vapor pressure is another key factor for n-heptane as a solvent, which can effectively reduce the pressure of the reaction system and reduce the experimental risk. The recovery of the catalyst can be easily achieved by calcining the solid residue at 500 °C for 3 h."
6,Analysis methods,"2.5 Analysis methods 2.5.1 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to the crystal structure characterization of catalysts, it was an X’ pert pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The scan rate was 5°/min for the 2θ from 5° to 80°. Catalysts with different crystalline phases were identified by comparison with JCPDS cards. The specific surface area and pore structure parameters of the catalyst were calculated via BET method according to N2-adsorption–desorption Isotherms, which was measured by a Quadrasorb SI system at 77 K. The acidity of catalysts was analyzed by automatic Temperature Programmed Desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD, Auto Chem Ⅱ 2920, Micromeritics, America). The microstructure of the catalyst was analyzed by SEM, which were determined on a ZEISS EVO MA15 device. The morphological and structural features of the nanoparticles were investigated by an FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope. XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) was used to analyze the changes of chemical valence states of iron species in the catalyst. 2.5.2 Products analysis Group compositions of heavy crude oil (SARA: saturate, aromatic, resin and asphaltene) were analyzed via the industry standard of China Petroleum NB/SH/T0509-2010. The flocculation point of asphaltene was analyzed by UV1800 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer and seeing the supporting document for the specific method [47–50]. FT-IR analysis of heavy crude oil was characterized by WQF-520 apparatus. The element analysis of resin and asphaltene (C, H, O, N, S) was performed by an Elemental Vario EL cube. The thermogravimetric analysis was conducted by Germany STA449F3. GC–MS analysis of bio-oil was carried out using GC9790Ⅱ system, NIST08 and NIST08s mass spectral data library were applied for identification of bio-oil components."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of catalyst Textural properties of Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts with different iron loadings were illustrated in Table 2 . Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions of all catalysts are shown in Fig. A1. With the incorporation of iron, the specific surface area of the catalyst greatly increases and then decreases, and the specific surface area of 3% of the load reached a maximum of 358.2 m2/g. The decrease of VMicro means iron may be able to take up the catalyst surface and internal space. Simultaneously, the changes in VMeso/macro indicated that more of the pores were overwhelmed by the iron oxide species due to the continuous accumulation of iron in the channels. For 5%Fe/HZSM-5, the VMeso/macro of 0.08 can provide a wider site for the reaction. The formation of iron oxide species at the pores and/or the external surface of HZSM-5 was the main cause of these phenomenon. NH3-TPD was served as acidity analysis of Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst. According to the research of some scholars, the curve can be divided into three different NH3 desorption peaks, which represent the weak, medium and strong acid peaks of the catalyst respectively [51]. The NH3-TPD curves and the distribution of acidic sites are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . Seeing Table A1 and Fig. A2 for more details in Appendix. A. The incorporation of iron oxide had a limited influence on pore structure, but caused a significant change in catalyst acidity. The acid amount and the acid center distribution of the catalyst were modulated, which was caused the by introduction of iron. The total acid content of the catalyst decreased significantly due to the addition of iron, the acid sites were covered by the active metal centers, which was the main factor that the acid strength of catalyst is modulated. 110 °C-120 °C, 180-200 °C, 380–410 °C correspond to weak, medium and strong acid peaks respectively, the addition of iron had no significant effect on the peak temperature of desorption attachment. The relative content of strong acid sites increased significantly with the increase of iron dosage, and the strong acid ratio of the catalyst reached the peak value of 47.32% for 5% Fe/HZSM-5. The crystal structure of the Fe/HZSM-5 was investigated by XRD, and the results were shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen from the curves, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 8-10° and 2θ = 22-25° indicated the classical MFI structure of HZSM-5, the structure of the catalyst was not changed even with the addition of iron. The diffraction peaks of iron oxide appeared at 2θ = 45°and 2θ = 33° after iron-loaded but not obvious. The absence of a sharp Fe2O3 diffraction peak indicates the uniform distribution of iron species. Of course, for further verification, SEM and TEM were employed to analyze the microscopic morphology and structural feature of the catalyst. Seeing Fig. A3 for SEM image. TEM image of the catalyst was shown in Fig. 4 . It can be intuitively seen that compared with HZSM-5 catalyst, there are more shadows on the surface of Fe/HZSM-5, and these shadows represent iron oxide particles. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles are well distributed on zeolite with an average size of 10 nm, this is consistent with the findings of Hosseinpour et al [52].The lattice fringes with an interlayer distance of 0.204 nm correspond to the spacing between of α- Fe2O3. Studies have shown that [53], over 96% of the B acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite were located inside the zeolitic channels. At the same time, according to our previous work [40], around 400 °C is the peak temperature of B acid center. In this paper, 400 °C is the peak temperature of strong acid, and the proportion of strong acid center increases obviously after iron loading. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that part of the Fe species should have migrated into the zeolitic channels, where the weak or medium acid protons on the internal surface of the zeolite are replaced by the Fe ions [54]."
9,Cellulose catalytic pyrolysis,"3.2 Cellulose catalytic pyrolysis The effect of catalyst on cellulose pyrolysis was summarized in Fig. 5 . The bio-oil and char yields obtained were 84.25% and 13.68% catalyzed by 5%Fe/HZSM-5. Compared with the blank group, the 5%Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst improved the yield of bio-oil significantly. The composition of cellulose liquefaction bio-oil was classified in detail, which mainly includes ketones, alcohols, esters, furans, aromatics and aliphatic-hydrocarbons. The relative content of each components was adjusted by the Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst. It was found that there was a significant difference between the blank group and the 5%Fe/HZSM-5 group with the best catalytic effect. In particularly, high oxygen content components such as ketones and acids ranged from 28.97% to 15.6%, and from 6.55% to 1.5% respectively. Beneficial components such as furans, aromatics, and aliphatic hydrocarbons increased to different degrees. The increase of these components improves the quality of bio-oil, which made the heavy crude oil upgrading process more efficient. To further reveal the relationship between Fe/HZSM-5 acidity and cellulose pyrolysis, the relationship between strong acid content of catalyst and bio-oil yield, Part of the product yield were analyzed. According to Fig. 6 , we found that the yield of bio-oil, furans, aromatics and aliphatic-hydrocarbons were highly positively correlated with the content of strong acids. This means that under the same conditions, more strong acid centers on the catalyst are better for the formation of these products. Previous studies have shown that C-O bond breaking, hydrogen transfer, and aromatization are more likely to occur at strong acid sites [55–57]. Simultaneously, the metal active center improves the decarbonylation and aromatization of molecular sieves, which is coupled with the ability of molecular sieves to catalyze other reactions. Unfortunately, with the increase of Fe content, the aggregation of iron species leads to the decrease of metal center activity, and the blockage of pore channels reduces the shape-selecting catalytic ability of molecular sieve catalysts, leading to secondary polymerization of small molecules and increasing coke yield."
10,Heavy crude oil upgrading assisted by cellulose,"3.3 Heavy crude oil upgrading assisted by cellulose 3.3.1 Effect of reaction condition Factors influencing the heavy crude oil upgrading include temperature, cellulose dosage and catalyst iron content in this paper, and the experimental results are summarized in Fig. 7 . The temperature has a significant influence on the quality improvement of heavy crude oil. 350 °C is a suitable temperature, which not only achieves good viscosity reduction, but also has relatively low energy consumption. The proportion of cellulose also affects the upgrading effect. Under the condition of 3 wt% cellulose ratio, the viscosity reduction rate of heavy crude oil was 65%. cellulose can reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil, but there is also a component with high oxygen content. Excessive addition of cellulose was accompanied by high oxygen content of heavy crude oil, which is unfavorable for viscosity reduction of heavy crude oil. At the same time, in the absence of catalysts, the ketones and acids in the bio-oil were also responsible for the viscosity of heavy crude oil. As can be seen from the Fig. 7(c), when there's no cellulose in the system, HZSM-5 catalyst has a certain promotion effect on the catalytic upgrading of heavy oil, and the catalytic performance does not significantly improve after loading iron. Compared with HZSM-5, the catalyst with iron loading of 5% had the best effect, and the viscosity reduction rate increased from 48% to 55%. In Fig. 7 (d), heavy crude oil under the effect of cellulose and 5%Fe/HZSM-5, the viscosity reduced from 10,460 mpa·s to 2083 mpa·s, the viscosity reduction rate was 80.1%. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the decrease in viscosity is due to the deep cracking of cellulose. In addition, 5%Fe/HZSM-5 has more efficient catalytic activity, which can catalyze the selective pyrolysis of cellulose into small aromatics and aliphatic-hydrocarbons more efficiently. These hydrogen donors play a more important role in heavy crude oil upgrading. 3.3.2 Evaluation of properties of the upgraded heavy crude oil A significant characteristic of heavy crude oil is that the content of resin and asphaltene is much higher than that of conventional heavy crude oil, so SARA analysis is indispensable. As shown in Fig. 8 , the content of resin decreased from 41.32% to 26.8% as a result of heavy crude oil upgrading, which was consistent with the viscosity change trend. A 9% increase in the saturation component indicates a higher degree of lightness in heavy crude oil. Meantime, it is reasonable to expect a slight increase in asphaltenes as condensation coking occurs in some heavy crude oils at high temperatures. FT-IR and Elemental and FT-IR analysis was taken to analyze changes in chemical bonds of resin and asphaltene molecules during upgrading. Seeing Fig. 9 , the weakening of methylene and methyl (–CH3, –CH2-) peaks at 2800–2950 cm−1 indicated the occurrence of dealkylation during upgrading. More critical was the fracture of the C-S bond at 750 cm−1, which was the main reason for the significant reduction in the viscosity of heavy crude oil. The slight enhancement of the 3700–3200 cm−1 vibrational peak is most likely due to the large amount of hydroxyl carried by cellulose. The elemental analysis results of resin and asphaltene before and after the upgrading were listed in Table 3 . After the upgrading, the sulfur content of resin and asphaltene was significantly reduced, which proved the breaking of C-S bond. The reduction of sulfur content was consistent with the weakening of C-S bond stretching vibration peak in the infrared spectrum. The decrease of C content in resin was related to the dealkylation reaction in the upgrading. The oxygen was removed in the form of CO2 and H2O by means of decarboxylation and dehydration reactions during upgrading. The microscopic appearance of asphaltene can be clearly seen by scanning electron microscope, while the flocculation point of asphaltene explains the change of particle size from another point of view. The change of transmittance was related to the dilution of n-heptane and the aggregation effect of large particles of asphaltenes, and n-heptane accumulates continuously in toluene-heavy crude oil system, and the dilution of n-heptane is dominant at this time. When n-heptane reaches a certain amount, asphaltene aggregates were caused by the destruction of asphaltene colloidal structure, and the dispersion of the system to light is enhanced, which is reflected in the decrease of transmittance change rate. However, due to the limited transmittance of ultraviolet spectrophotometer, heavy crude oil can only be measured by high dilution, and the content of asphaltene is relatively low, so there are less asphaltenes that can flocculate. Therefore, the addition of n-heptane with reduced transmittance was taken as the asphaltene flocculation point. The curves clearly shown that the asphaltene flocculation point was related to the dilution multiple of heavy crude oil by toluene in Fig. 10 . The more severely the heavy crude oil is diluted, the more n-heptane is required for asphaltene flocculation. Through linear fitting of asphalt flocculation points at different dilution multiples, asphaltene flocculation point was finally obtained in Fig. 11 . The asphaltene flocculation point of heavy crude oil, blank group, upgrading of crude and cellulose (3 wt%) and catalytic upgrading of crude and cellulose were 20.98, 26.27, 38.99 and 49.23 (g n-heptane/g oil) respectively. The backward movement of asphaltene flocculation point was considered as a signal, which indicated that after the upgrading reaction, the asphaltene particles were smaller and difficult to aggregate into large particles, which further confirms the influence of upgrading on the viscosity of heavy crude oil. 1HNMR was widely taken in the analysis of petroleum products, especially for heavy crude oils (such as resin and asphaltene) that are difficult to volatilize. The 1HNMR hydrogen spectra of resin and asphaltene in heavy crude oil before and after reaction are shown in Fig. A4. The relative percentages of different hydrogen types can be obtained by integrating different chemical displacement intervals in the spectra. Seeing the Appendix. A for detailed calculation method. After upgrading, the aromaticity and aromatic condensation showed an opposite trend as shown in Fig. 12 (c). This phenomenon is particularly evident for resin, which, as the main reactant, is greatly cracked in the upgrading process, and the content of resin decreases from 41.32% to 26.8%. The main reasons for this result are the fracture of long-alkane chain or side chain, hydrogenation of unsaturated group and heterocyclic-ring opening. Compared with resin, asphaltene has a more compact and complex structure, and upgrading has little effect on the polycyclic aromatic framework of asphaltene. However, the slight increase in aromaticity indicates that the asphaltene may have condensation association during upgrading. HA mainly represents the degree of aromatic ring hydrogenation, of which the change is consistent with the hydrogen content [29]. Fig. 12 (a) and (b) clearly shows a slight increase in HA of resin and asphaltene, which may be caused by the partial destruction of the thick ring system and the active hydrogen provided by the bio-oil from cellulose."
11,Mechanism analysis,"3.4 Mechanism analysis 3.4.1 Hydrogen supply mechanism of bio-oil To investigate the change of chemical states of Fe species during the reaction process, XPS analysis was performed on the catalysts before and after the reaction, and the results are shown in Fig. 13 .The Fe 2p XPS spectra of the 5%Fe/HZSM-5 comprised two components at BE of 712 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 723 eV (Fe 2p1/2), respectively. Both peaks are accompanied by distinct satellite peaks at around 718 and 732 eV. These features are characteristic of Fe oxides [58–60]. Analysis of the spectra revealed the existence of both Fe3+ (712 eV) and Fe2+ (710 eV) species on the surface of fresh and recycled 5%Fe/ZSM-5 samples. The presence of Fe2+ in the fresh 5%Fe/HZSM-5 may result from surface reduction under the ultrahigh vacuum conditions [54]. After catalytic upgrading and catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose, the XPS signal of the catalyst was greatly weakened, due to large number of Fe species were covered by the carbon deposition produced during the reaction. It is still obvious that the amount of Fe3+ decreased and the amount of Fe2+ increased in the catalyst. According to the previous results, the possible hydrogen supply mechanism of bio-oil in the catalytic upgrading process of heavy crude oil was proposed. As shown in Fig. 14 , in the process of producing active hydrogen, there is a process of oxygen storage and release on iron oxide, which has been proved by relevant studies that iron oxide has a certain capacity of oxygen storage and release, while oxidizing heavy crude oil into light oil. The aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, small molecular acids and a small amount of water in the bio-oil produce active hydrogen on the catalyst, which is taken for catalytic upgrading of heavy crude oil. The change of surface chemical valence states of iron species in Fig. 13 demonstrates this process. 3.4.2 Mechanism of heavy crude oil upgrading The previous analysis proved that catalytic upgrading with cellulose significantly improved the quality of heavy crude oil. The catalytic upgrading mechanism of heavy crude oil is divided into two parts, including physical dilution of bio-oil and hydrogen supply upgrading of bio-oil. The physical dilution experiment of bio-oil is shown in Fig. A8. The result shown that the bio-oil has a certain physical dilution effect on the heavy crude oil, and the viscosity reduction rate of bio-oil is increased from 27% to 32% in the solvent (toluene). According to the heavy crude oil supramolecular structure model [61], it is difficult for the catalyst to directly catalyze heavy crude oil. In the early stage of reaction, the cellulose after depolymerization enters the pore of the catalyst and is converted to alcohols, furans, aliphatic-hydrocarbons, and aromatics under the strong acid centers. Most of the aliphatic hydrocarbons belong to cycloalkanes (mainly cyclohexane), which are catalyzed by Fe/HZSM-5 obtain active hydrogen [62]. Meantime, the alcohol reacts with the water molecules removed from the cellulose to form H2 [33]. As more reactive hydrogen is produced, the C–C bond and C-S bond of the heavy crude oil colloid system were broken, the partially broken colloid enter the catalyst and combine with the strong acid center and iron oxide active center, resulting in the deep cracking of heavy crude oil and the production of lighter components. As a weak hydrogen donor [63], aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylene) have no obvious hydrogen supply effect, but rely on dilution to reduce the concentration of free radicals in the system, and it can improve the aromaticity of the reaction system, so as to increase the compatibility of asphaltene, and has a good effect on the upgrading of heavy crude oil. Therefore, the proposed cellulose-assisted catalytic upgrading of heavy crude oil over the Fe/HZSM-5 is assumed as shown in Fig. 15 ."
12,Conclusion,"In view of the difficulty of direct utilization of heavy crude oil, this study combined with cellulose to catalyze the upgrading of heavy crude oil, it is of positive significance to solve the crisis of fossil fuels and reduce environmental pollution. The hydrogen supply and catalysis of cellulose and Fe/HZSM-5 in heavy crude oil upgrading were studied. The composition of bio-oil can be adjusted by changing the activity of Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst via incorporation iron oxide, and the upgrading of heavy crude oil can be realized indirectly. The viscosity of heavy crude oil decreased from 10460mpa·s to 2083mpa·s after heavy crude oil upgrading for 30 min at 350 °C. SARA, FT-IR, elemental analysis, and asphaltene flocculation point shown that the improved stability of heavy crude oil."
