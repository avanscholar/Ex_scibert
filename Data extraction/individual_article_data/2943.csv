0,Introduction,"Novel semiconductors which are photoactive under UV or visible light have gained importance as they are able to provide new alternatives for environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Semiconductors such as TiO2 can be modified with transition metals, specifically with noble metals [1–3] enhancing photocatalysis [4–7]. A system that provides a valuable alternative for hydrogen production is the Photo-CREC water II Reactor employed in the present study [8]. The Photo-CREC water II Reactor can be operated at close to ambient pressure and temperature, using ethanol, as a sacrificial agent. This sacrificial agent can be oxidized to CO2 and H2O, or reduced to H2, CH4, C2H6 and other useful hydrocarbons [9]. It is anticipated that photocatalytic hydrogen produced in the Photo-CREC water II will provide an environmentally friendly approach to generate hydrogen, having net zero CO2 emissions [10–12]. Nonetheless, the application of photocatalysts for hydrogen production is still negatively influenced by the following issues [13]: (a) The lack of performing and stable photocatalysts with reduced band gaps, capable of absorbing wavelengths from the visible light spectrum, (b) The non-availability of scaled high efficiency photoreactors with controlled irradiation distributions, and (c) The lack of phenomenologically based kinetic models for photoreactor scale up. Given all these facts, it is proposed in the present study to establish a kinetic model for hydrogen production in the Photo-CREC water II Reactor having ethanol as an organic scavenger [10]. It is anticipated that the proposed rate equations should include ethanol adsorption and conversion, as well as hydrogen peroxide formation."
1,Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics in photocatalysis,"1.1 Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics in photocatalysis The heterogeneous photocatalytic conversion of organic chemical species such as ethanol can be described using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) model. The general form of the LH equation for a photocatalytic reaction is given by: (1) r i = LVRPA f [ H + ] k i I K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j = k i ∗ K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j where the LVRPA is the local volumetric rate of photon absorption, f [H+] represents the influence of the pH on the photocatalytic reaction, k i ∗ stands for an apparent reaction kinetic constant (mol/gcat h), Ki A denotes the adsorption constant (L/mol), and Ci represents the concentration of chemical species (mol/L). A photoreactor such as the Photo-CREC water II Reactor is operated in the batch mode. Thus, the chemical species balances for each observable chemical species “i” allow the photoreaction rate definition to be as follows: (2) r i = 1 W irr , cat dN i dt = V W irr , cat dN i V dt = V W irr , cat dC i dt where Wirr,cat represents the mass of the irradiated photocatalyst in grams, V is the total reactor volume in liters, Ni stands for the moles of “i” species and t is the irradiation time in minutes. When replacing Eq. (2) into Eq. (3), a photoreaction rate for the “i” chemical species can be expressed as follows, (3) r i = dC i dt = W irr V k i ∗ K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j Furthermore, we can also express the above equation using an apparent constant k i = W irr V k i ∗ K i A as: (4) dC i dt = k i C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j Thus, Eq. (4) can be used to describe chemical species changes in a Photo-CREC water II Reactor including chemical changes in the sacrificial agent as well as the chemical intermediate species [14]. The estimation of the kinetic and adsorption parameters of Eq. (4) can be developed via non-linear regression. This could lead to models with high cross-correlation. Nonetheless, given that adsorption parameters can be calculated independently, this allows decoupling the calculation of kinetic parameters and adsorption parameters. The outcome is a set of kinetic parameters with narrow spans and a good fit for the reactant, the intermediate and the final product chemical species [13]. A review of the technical literature on photocatalytic hydrogen production using organic scavengers, shows that there is a lack of suitable kinetic models. The present study shows that these models should include competitive site adsorption and as a result, Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics."
2,Experimental methods,
3,Photocatalyst preparation of TiO2-1wt% Pt,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation of TiO2-1wt% Pt A modified TiO2-Pt photocatalyst was synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation [10]. The semiconductor employed as a “support” was DP25 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) from Evonik Degussa Co. Furthermore, a 99.9wt% H2PtCl6·xH2O reagent from Sigma–Aldrich Co. was utilized to generate the platinum (M0) metallic particles formed on the TiO2 outer surfaces [10] [15,16]. Furthermore, the modified TiO2-Pt photocatalyst was fully characterized as presented in Escobedo Salvador et al. [10]."
4,Photocatalytic reactor,"2.2 Photocatalytic reactor Fig. 1 reports the novel Photo-CREC water II Reactor for hydrogen production used in the present study. This modified Photo-CREC water II Reactor operates as a “well mixed” batch unit. The modified Photo-CREC water II Reactor for hydrogen production includes two concentric tubes. The first tube is a transparent inner cylinder of Pyrex glass, that was used due to the fact it only absorbs 5% of the emitted near-UV Light. Pyrex glass has a good near-UV transmission properties and low cost. A USHIO Blacklight Blue Lamp of 15W was used as the irradiation source inside this glass tube and has an emission range of 340–410nm. The radiation spectrum for this lamp is reported in Escobedo et al. [10]. The second and outer tube is made of UV opaque polyethylene to minimize radiation reflection. Moreover, this outer reactor tube facilitates radiometric and spectroradiometric measurements as well as the performance of macroscopic energy balance for energy efficiency calculations. In addition, it provides a free- flowing photocatalyst suspension in the concentric annular channel with a volume of 4500mL. Fig. 1 reports a schematic diagram of Photo-CREC water II Reactor and accessories. This figure shows the overall unit configuration: a sealed stirred tank chamber connected in series with a tubular photocatalytic reactor. The Photo-CREC water II Reactor includes the additional following components: (i) A BLB Lamp, (ii) A Pyrex glass tube, (iii) A UV-opaque polyethylene cylinder, (iv) Fused-silica windows, (v) A centrifugal pump, (vi) A H2 storing/mixing tank, (vii) A gas sampling port, (viii) A slurry sampling port, (ix) A purging gas injector and (x) A jet driving mixing port, (xi) A self-driven mixing impeller and (xii) A draining gas valve. This unit for hydrogen production also includes major enhancements versus CREC earlier units [17]. Main additional components in the Photo-CREC water II Reactor include a self-driven mixing impeller and a hydrogen storage tank with a total volume of 7216mL, which 1500mL are for the liquid phase and 5716mL are for the gas phase (refer to Table 1 ). Dimensions of the main components of the Photo-CREC water II Reactor as adapted for hydrogen production are given in [10] (Table 1). Regarding the free of sealing issues and hydrogen losses and well mixed tank, it was designed and equipped to accomplish the following: (i) To provide good gas and liquid mixing in the hydrogen storage tank, a self-driven mixing impeller was placed in the head space of the hydrogen storage tank, (ii) To take aliquot samples (gas and liquid), allowing measurements of organic scavengers and hydrogen, (ii) To add the photocatalyst (Pt/TiO2), (iii) To store H2, (iv) To feed inert gases (N2 or Ar) as needed, (v) To measure the pH and (vi) To monitor the temperature. A centrifugal pump circulates the fluid throughout the system and is used to modify the flow rate. Prior to the experiments, the photocatalyst was sonicated for a 10min. period to ensure good particle distribution in the slurry solution before being added to the water/ethanol solution in the storage tank."
5,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods There were key chemical species to be considered in the development of the kinetic model such as: (a) Ethanol and its various oxidized and reduced parent chemical species, (b) Hydrogen peroxide. Thus, in order to quantify these species two techniques were employed. A first technique was used to determine hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at various irradiation times. With this end, a redox-titration using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was adopted [17]. The oxidation agent was added drop-by-drop over a filtered and acidified sample taken from the Photo-CREC water II Reactor, until a pinkish color was observed. To determine the concentration of H2O2 in the collected samples, a 0.01mM potassium permanganate, KMnO4 redox solution was used for titration. In an acid media, the KMnO4 reacts with hydrogen peroxide according to the following: (5) MnO 4 ( aq ) - + H 2 O 2 ( l ) → Mn ( aq ) 2 + + O 2 ( g ) Once the color changed from clear to pink, the titration was considered complete, as shown in Eq. (6): (6) 5 H 2 O 2 + 2 KMnO 4 + 3 H 2 SO 4 → 2 MnSO 4 + K 2 SO 4 + 5 O 2 + 8 H 2 O As a result, the moles of hydrogen peroxide formed were determined using Eqs. (6) and (7): (7) Mol H 2 O 2 = V ‾ Titration KMnO 4 × ( KMnO 4 Molarity ) × 5 mol H 2 O 2 2 mol KMnO 4 × V T PCW - II Reactor Tank V Sample of H 2 O 2 where V ‾ Titration KMnO 4 is the volume of the potassium permanganate solution used in the titration of hydrogen peroxide in mL, V TPCW - II Reactor is the total volume of the Photo-CREC water II Reactor Tank in mL and the V Sample of H 2 O 2 is the volume of hydrogen peroxide employed in the analysis (e.g. 5mL). A second analytical technique was considered to quantify ethanol adsorption on the DP25-1wt% Pt. To accomplish this, the Photo-CREC Water II Reactor was operated with the same nominal 2 v/v% of ethanol. Samples were taken periodically with the lamps turned “off”. Changes in ethanol concentration were quantified with a UFLC-Shimadzu HPLC unit using a Supelcogel C-610H Column of 30cm×7.8mm ID. Regarding the various chemical species analyzed during the photocatalytic runs, two GC units manufactured by Shimadzu were used. One was a GC-2010 equipped with a Grace Hayesep D Packed Column with a 100/120 mesh of 9.1m×2mm×2μm nominal SS. It was used to separate H2 from O2 and N2 (Air). A second GC-2014 setup using an Alltech Porapak-Q Packed Column with a 80/100 mesh of 1.83×3.175mm×21.59mm nominal SS was implemented for CO2, CH4, and C2H6 detection. Furthermore, these GCs have TCD and FID detectors as required for the quantification of various gas phase species (e.g. hydrogen, methane, ethane and CO2). Ultra high purity argon and helium carrier gases (Praxair 99.999%) were used in the GC-2010 and the GC-2014, respectively. The use of argon in the Shimadzu GC-2010, as a carrier gas allows increasing the sensitivity of the detector toward H2. The GC was interfaced with a desktop PC to enable the analyses of the injected samples. Gas samples of 0.8mL were taken manually (with a Hamilton Co. gas tight valve-syringe of 1mL) from the Photo-CREC water II Reactor gas sampling port at set times. They were then injected in a GC port for analysis. The calibrations of the GC-TCD and FID detectors were made using several mixtures of known gases and liquid concentrations. Regarding the chemical species in the liquid phase, a UFLC-Shimadzu HPLC unit with a Supelcogel C-610H Column of 30cm×7.8mm ID was employed to separate both the carboxylic acids and the alcohols in water. In addition, a UV (LC-20AB) and a RID-10A detectors were employed for quantitative chemical species analyses at various irradiation times. This was done with the intent of tracking the formation of organic acids (Acetic Acid) and ethanol. Each sample was filtered using a 13mm PTFE GD/X (Whatman, 0.2μm) syringe before being analyzed."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Langmuir adsorption isotherm,"3.1 Langmuir adsorption isotherm A Langmuir adsorption isotherm can be considered a suitable expression for species chemisorption at equilibrium. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm can be represented as [18,19]: (8) θ A = Q eq , ads Q eq , max = K eq A C eq ( 1 + K eq A C eq ) where θ A stands for the dimensionless surface species concentration and Q eq , ads and Q eq , max represent the current and maximum equilibrium adsorption surface concentrations in mol/gcat, respectively. On the other hand, C eq denotes the species gas phase concentration at equilibrium (mol/L) and K eq A represents the adsorption equilibrium constant in L/mol. In the present study, 2v/v% of ethanol was used as a hole scavenger. Thus, excess ethanol was present in the liquid phase at all conditions. This ethanol concentration was always much larger than the other organic species formed during photoconversion. At the beginning of every experiment, the photocatalyst was suspended and recirculated with the lamps turned “off”. Fig. 2 reports the progressive changes of adsorbed ethanol with slurry recirculation time. Thus, it was considered that the time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium was 60min. Furthermore, when using a linearized representation of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm [13, 20], the following was considered: (9) 1 Q eq , ads = 1 Q eq , max K eq A C eq + 1 Q eq , max Fig. 3 reports the linear regression and the K EtOH A =1.427L/mol and Qeq,max =0.163mol/gcat adsorption parameters determined. Table 2 reports the adsorption parameters determined by using Eq. (9). Data fitting is reported with its regression coefficient (R 2 =0.998). One should also notice that the adsorption constants determined under dark conditions, could somewhat differ from those under irradiation [13]. Xu and Langford reported adsorption constants being inversely proportional to irradiation intensity. Nonetheless, the same authors mentioned that at 14×10−7 (einstein/s), there was no considerable change of the adsorption constant [21]. In the case of our study, the emission rate was 1.14×10−5 (einstein/s), using a 15W BLB lamp [10]. Thus, one can conclude that adsorption parameters established without irradiation are adequate for the kinetic modeling during the irradiation period."
8,H and OH radical group balances,"3.2 H and OH radical group balances Photocatalytic experiments for hydrogen production using ethanol as a scavenger require a good carbon elemental balance closure. For the carbon elemental balance closure, one has to consider all carbon sources including ethanol and various oxidation and reduction product species. Carbon Element input and outputs were: (a) 4.11mol of Carbon,in fed as ethanol, (b) 4.07mol of Carbon,out for all carbon containing species after 6h of irradiation. Regarding the frequently hypothesized stoichiometry, of one photon interacting with a site and leading to one H and one OH radical, one has to account for: (a) the hydrogen element in hydrogen gas, (b) the hydrogen element in hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen contained in all species resulting from ethanol oxidation/reduction processes. Fig. 4 reports a progressive change in hydrogen peroxide after 6h of photocatalytic hydrogen production. One can observe a higher rate of hydrogen peroxide formation during the first hour of irradiation. Following this initial period, the rate of H2O2 decreases significantly while staying close to steady values for the remaining of the runs. Fig. 5 reports the OH radical group calculated using stoichiometric equations for CH3COOH, CH3CHO, CH4, C2H6, CO2 and H2O2 formation. On this basis, the OH radicals formed are compared with the H radicals formed. Appendix A provides additional details of this calculation showing that 3.09×10−3 moles of OH and 3.32×10−3 moles of H , were observed after 6h of irradiation. This leads to an acceptable OH and H radical balance of 93%. As a consequence and based on the strength of these results, one can conclude that photocatalytic reaction experiments performed in the Photo-CREC Water II Reactor using ethanol as an organic scavenger comply with carbon elemental balances and are close to the equimolar formation of H and OH radicals."
9,An “In Series–Parallel” kinetic model for the conversion of ethanol during photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 An “In Series–Parallel” kinetic model for the conversion of ethanol during photocatalytic hydrogen production Ethanol photoconversion via OH radicals during hydrogen production leads to H2, CH4, C2H6, CO2 and other intermediates such as CH3COOH. The various reaction steps can be modeled using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) model [13,18,22]. Regarding Pt on DP25, it is expected that Pt does not interfere with adsorption phenomena. Nevertheless, Pt deposits mainly affect the photocatalytic activity and hydrogen formation on the photocatalyst [23]. Regarding the kinetic modeling of the ethanol scavenger conversion, there are specific assumptions that are considered as applicable: (i) ethanol as well as the various intermediate species can be adsorbed on the photocatalytic surface, (ii) adsorption is a dynamic equilibrium process, and (iii) ethanol and various intermediate species are not affected by photolysis. On this basis and considering that the observable chemical species during the photocatalytic production of hydrogen, have ethanol as a scavenger and have an “In Series–Parallel” model, it can be postulated that the Reaction Network (RN) can be described as shown in Fig. 6 : This “In Series–Parallel” reaction model (RN) includes the following additional assumptions: (a) A 0.15g/L of 1wt% Pt-DP25 photocatalyst in the slurry phase was used in the Photo-CREC Water II unit. This optimum photocatalyst concentration was established using macroscopic energy balance [10]. (b) The photocatalytic reaction takes place in a Photo-CREC water II Reactor with a slurried 1 wt% Pt-DP25 photocatalyst in a water–ethanol solution. (c) The selected pH=4 a most desirable one following Escobedo et al. [10]. (d) Near-UV photons reach the photocatalyst surface with wavelength smaller than 410nm, thus allowing electron/hole pair separation. This promotes both oxidation and reduction steps. (e) Produced electron holes react with the OH- groups forming OH radicals. At the same time, electrons produced, favor the formation of H radicals. OH radicals convert ethanol as described in the above reported RN, following reaction steps 1, 2, 4 and 5. (f) Acetaldehyde intermediate is neglected in the RN to avoid model over-parameterization. (g) Acetic acid intermediates are generated and consumed through steps 2 and 3. (h) Methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) end product species are produced via steps 1, 3, 4 and 5. (i) Carbon dioxide (CO2) is formed via steps 1, 3 and 4. (j) Hydrogen (H2) is formed via steps 2, 3 and 4. (k) Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is generated via step 5. One should notice that the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) rate equation can be considered applicable for each one of the reaction steps involved in the “In Series–Parallel” reaction network. For the specific case of ethanol, one can postulate the following: (10) r EtOH V L = dN EtOH dt = - V L C EtOH ( k 1 + k 2 + k 4 + k 5 ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH + K AA A C AA + K EtOH A C EtOH + K H 2 A C H 2 + K CO 2 A C CO 2 + K E A C E + K M A C M Eq. (10) can be considered in the context of having ethanol in excess, with respect to the other organic species in the liquid phase. This appears to be adequate given the mild ethanol changes, as shown by HPLC analysis. Fig. 7 shows the ethanol concentration varying in a very restricted range during the experiments. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that ethanol concentrations remain close to C EtOH ≈0.34mol/L, with ethanol being the dominant adsorbed species. Thus, K EtOH A C EtOH ≫ K H 2 A C H 2 + K CO 2 A C CO 2 + K E A C E + K M A C M . On this basis, one can conclude that the changes of concentrations for various chemical species can be described using the following ODEs: (a) For acetic acid (AA), (11) dN AA dt = V L ( k 2 C EtOH - k 3 C AA ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH (b) For carbon dioxide (CO2), (12) dN CO 2 dt = V L [ ( k 1 + k 4 ) C EtOH + k 3 C AA ] 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH (c) For ethane (E), (13) dN E dt = V L C EtOH ( 1 / 2 k 4 + k 5 ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH (d) For methane (M), (14) dN M dt = V L ( k 1 C EtOH + k 3 C AA ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH (e) For hydrogen (H2), (15) dN H 2 dt = V L C EtOH ( 2 k 1 + 2 k 2 + 2.5 k 4 ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH With NCO 2 representing the total number of moles of CO2 in both gas and liquid phases. 3.3.1 Kinetic parameter estimation for the proposed “In Series–Parallel” reaction network The kinetic parameters of the proposed model were determined by using MATLAB® subroutines. The objective function employed was lsqcurvefit, a nonlinear least square fitting. This method considers that the adjustment of parameters is obtained with a minimum value for the sum of the square residuals (difference between the modeled data and the experimental data). This objective function involved the minimization of the moles of acetic acid, methane, ethane and CO2 as follows, (16) min = ∑ i = 1 n ( N i , exp - N i , model ) 2 With N i , exp being the experimentally observed moles of the “i” species and N i , model standing for the calculated moles of these “i” species using the proposed kinetic model. For the numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations, an Ode45 was used. This method implements fourth/fifth order Runge–Kutta methods. The kinetic model parameter evaluation was implemented using experimental data obtained with a pH=4, 2 v/v% ethanol and DP25-1wt% Pt. The kinetic rates involved in each of the steps were modeled using LH expressions as described before. On this basis, each kinetic rate was considered as a function of: (a) The ki which is the intrinsic rate constant, (b) The Ci which stands for the concentration of chemical species “i” and (c) The adsorption constant Ki A which represents the “i” component. Results of the “In Series–Parallel” model predictions for photocatalytic hydrogen production using eqs (11)–(15) are reported in the upcoming figures. The estimation of kinetic parameters was developed using the adsorption constant reported in Section 3.1. The DOF (degree-of-freedom) for the model analysis was calculated as follows, (17) DOF = m - p where m is the number of experimental data points and p denotes the number of model parameters. One should note that the degree of freedom (DOF) for the 5 model parameters was 235. This included the four repeats per every run. Thus, the DOF was well in excess of zero and the experimental data points were valuable to estimate the kinetic parameters. Fig. 8 displays the good fit achieved for acetic acid concentrations using the “In Series–Parallel” kinetics described in Fig. 6. Furthermore, Fig. 9 reports the methane concentration and its changes with irradiation time both measured and modeled. One can conclude that the proposed kinetic network having methane as an end product describes the experimental data well. Fig. 10 reports the ethane concentration changes with irradiation time with a close to linear pattern. It can also be observed that the fit of the suggested kinetics for ethane formation, with ethane being another end product of the photocatalytic reaction, is again very adequate. Finally, Fig. 11 describes the steady increase of carbon dioxide with irradiation time. Carbon dioxide is an end product that represents the total mineralization of the organic scavenger. CO2 is produced along with hydrogen, methane and ethane under the conditions set for the photocatalytic H2 production using 1wt% Pt on TiO2 and pH=4. It is important to note that again, the predictions of the proposed reaction network described the CO2 data points well. Table 3 reports photocatalytic hydrogen production with five kinetic constants. These five optimized kinetic constants are given with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and their standard deviations (STD). In this respect, Table 3 shows the narrow 95% confidence intervals and the small STD which confirms the adequacy of the kinetic parameters obtained. Furthermore, Table 4 , describes the cross-correlation coefficients matrix. The cross-correlation coefficients are a very useful approach to predict the dependency between two variables. As stated by El Solh et al. [24], if one or more parameters were not significant or were highly correlated, the correlation would be close to ±1.0. In the case of the present study, acceptable low levels of interaction lower than ±0.93 between kinetic constants with cross-correlation coefficients, were consistently obtained (see Table 4). Regarding the reconciliation plot reported below, a data quality analysis can be made as shown in Fig. 12 . This figure describes randomly distributed experimental and modeled data points, as well an adequate correlation with a R 2 coefficient of 0.9977. In addition, Fig. 12 shows that the data reported is not clustered in horizontal or vertical bands. On one hand, horizontal bands may be the result of changes in the observed conversion caused by an independent variable which is not included in the kinetic model. On the other hand, vertical bands may be an indication of the kinetic model over-parameterization [13,24,25]. Therefore, it is proven in Fig. 12 that the suggested kinetic model fits the experimental data acceptably within the ±5% limit of experimental error. As a result, one can conclude that the model predicts the experimental data parameters properly. The reconciliation plot reported in Fig. 12 describes in detail what was observed for the species concentrations of 2×10−5 mol and lower, with a good prediction of the experimental data. Fig. 13 describes the residuals for the “In Series–Parallel” model with five (5) kinetic constants following the parameter optimization. As one can see, the “In Series–Parallel” model provides random error predictions between the experimental and the modeled data. 3.3.2 Issues with kinetic modeling and kinetics of hydrogen production Model predictions for hydrogen production can be compared with the hydrogen evolved as predicted using Eq. (15) and the parameters reported in Table 2. Fig. 14 shows that the proposed reaction network predicts well the experimentally observed quasi-linear trend of hydrogen production with irradiation. There is, however, a 35% difference between the experimental data and model predictions. This leads to a consistent overestimation of the moles of hydrogen produced by the model. Regarding this overestimation, one can state that this is likely the result of inaccuracies introduced while predicting the equilibrium liquid phase CO2 concentrations. This was done in the present study, by using CO2 measured in the gas phase and the Henry liquid–vapor equilibrium relations. This approach may be affected by the following: (a) at a 32°C, typical reaction temperature, following 6h of operation due to the energy added to the slurry in the slurry by the centrifugal pump, one surpasses the 29.14°C critical temperature for CO2. Thus, CO2–water are in the supercritical region, and (b) the pH of 4 can affect the solubility of CO2 in water. Thus, in order to provide a much closer agreement of the hydrogen produced, the following is postulated: (18) dN H 2 dt = α V L C EtOH ( 2 k 1 + 2 k 2 + 2.5 k 4 ) 1 + K EtOH A C EtOH with α providing a model correction for adequate data fitting. Fig. 15 provides a representation of the revised model with α =0.65. This shows an excellent linear fitting of the experimental data. As a result, one can notice that the reported model is able to describe all the observed quasi-linear rates and this for all experimentally observed chemical species produced, including hydrogen. However and for further model validation the following is advised: (a) To select operating temperatures below the 29.14°C critical temperature, (b) To measure directly the CO2 dissolved in water at pH=4."
10,Conclusions,"(a) Ethanol provides a valuable environmentally friendly organic scavenger for hydrogen production. (b) A radical balance including OH and H groups with a 93% closure confirms the soundness of the equimolar formation of OH and H radicals. (c) Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate models are proven adequate for an “In Series–Parallel” reaction network for ethanol consumption. This model can be used successfully to describe CH3COOH, CH4, C2H6 and CO2 product changes. (d) Parameter estimation of the proposed models leads to a kinetics suitable to fit the experimental concentrations of all by-product species resulting from the scavenger consumption. (e) Hydrogen linear formation is satisfactorily described when using a reaction rate additive model based in the proposed reaction network. (f) An adjustable and empirically based “α” parameter is required for a closer prediction of the hydrogen produced."
