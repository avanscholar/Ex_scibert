0,Introduction,"When a highly-oriented poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA, -[CH2CH(OH)]n-) film is immersed into an aqueous KI/I2 solution of an iodine concentration of 0.001–0.01 M, PVA-iodine complex is formed, which is industrially utilized as an optical polarizer [1–6]. The complex is said to be created in the amorphous region of PVA [4–12]. Because of the unclear X-ray diffraction pattern, however, the inner structure of the polarizer has not yet been established enough well beyond the speculative images, in spite of the increasing usage of the polarizer in these several decades. When the iodine concentration is increased in 1–2 order (ca. 0.1–3 M), the iodine complex is formed even in the crystalline region of PVA [13–20]. In a series of the papers [16–20], we found the various types of crystalline PVA-iodine complexes, the formation of which depends on the iodine concentration, the type of counter cation species (K+, Na+, Li+, H+, etc.) and so on. These complexes are called the forms I, II and III. Based on the quantitative analyses of the 2D X-ray diffraction and IR/Raman vibrational spectroscopic data in combination with the computer simulation technique, we proposed the aggregation structures of PVA chains and iodine ion species in the crystalline lattices of these complex forms. The detailed structure information of these crystalline complexes should be a good hint for the study of inner structure of the polarizer. However, the iodine concentration used in our previous studies is appreciably higher than that required for the industrial production of an optical polarizer [1–6,21,22]. In the present study, we have changed our target on the PVA-iodine complex formed from a dilute iodine solution of 0.001–0.05 M concentration. The 2-dimensional X-ray diffraction pattern detected for the thus-prepared sample was found to be different from those of forms I, II and III. The crystal structure analysis was performed successfully for the thus newly-found crystalline form by combining the X-ray diffraction data, the Raman data, and the quantum mechanical calculation. This new crystal form was found to be similar to that of a commercial polarizer itself. By referring to all the experimental data and the structure information revealed for the various forms of PVA-iodine complexes, the inner structure of the polarizer was investigated concretely. Before the detailed description of the analyzed results, it is useful to remind about the X-ray diffraction patterns and the corresponding crystal structures characteristic of the previously-revealed crystalline forms of PVA-iodine complexes. As mentioned above, depending on the iodine concentration, the crystalline PVA-iodine complexes are classified into 3 types; I (ca. 0.1 ∼ ca. 0.8 M), II (ca. 0.8 ∼ ca. 3 M) and III (ca. 3 M, only for H+ counter ion) [16–20]. The observed 2D X-ray diffraction patterns of these complexes are shown in Fig. 1 . The corresponding crystal structures are shown in Fig. 2 [20]. (i) PVA Fig. 1 (a) shows the 2-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pattern of a uniaxially-oriented PVA sample measured using a Mo-Kα X-ray beam. As seen in Fig. 2 (a), the 2 planar-zigzag PVA chains are contained in the monoclinic unit cell, and they are combined together by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of OH⋯O type [20,23–25]. But, this structural model is only an approximation, and could not satisfy the independently-measured neutron diffraction data enough well [20]. The introduction of the chain packing disorder was found to reproduce both of the X-ray and neutron diffraction data consistently. The individual domains are composed of the above-mentioned pairs of the hydrogen-bonded PVA chains. But, these domains are aggregated together with the 1/2 slippages along the 110 planes [see Fig. 2 (a)]. In this way, the crystalline phase of PVA consists of the disordered arrays of the domains composed of the hydrogen-bonded chains [20]. (ii) PVA-iodine complex form I By the immersion of an oriented PVA film into a dilute iodine solution of ca. 0.1 M ∼ ca. 0.8 M concentration, the crystal form I is created [16–19]. As seen in Fig. 1 (b), the several sharp diffraction peaks are observed along the equatorial line in a low diffraction angle range. The strong streak lines are detected along the layer lines, which are originated from the 1-dimensionl columnar structure of I5 − and I3 − ions with the relative height disordering [16,17]. These iodine columns invade into the spaces between the originally-hydrogen-bonded PVA chains, and the OH⋯I hydrogen bonds are formed between PVA chains and iodine ions. However, the crystalline phase is not totally occupied by the iodine complex structure, but the PVA chain pairs remain coexistent partly in the crystalline lattice [Fig. 2 (b)]. The occupancy of iodine ions is not very high. (iii) PVA-iodine complex form II As the iodine concentration is increased to ca. 1–3 M, the form II complex is obtained. The equatorial diffraction peaks are sharp. The strong streak lines characteristic of the I3 − columnar structure are detected along the layer lines. In the cases of the original PVA crystal and form I, the zigzag planes of the PVA chains are oriented along the rolled plane (or the film plane). In form II, these PVA chains are rotated by 38° around the chain axis so as to form the more effective packing structure of PVA and I3 − ion columns. The O–H⋯I hydrogen bonds are formed in higher population, as known from the IR and Raman spectral data and the detailed calculation by the density functional theory (DFT) [19]. The packing disorder of the finite domains, as observed in the original PVA crystal, is still detected in forms I and II, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b) and (c), respectively [20]. (iv) PVA-iodine complex form III This complex is formed by immersing the PVA film in the HI/I2 solution of 3 M concentration for a long time [18]. The counter cation is H+. Such counter cation as Li+, Na+ and K+ does not create the form III even when the immersion time is longer. The packing structure of PVA chains and I3 − ion columns becomes more regular [see Fig. 2 (d)]. Purpose of the present study In this way, the various types of PVA-iodine complexes are detected. However, these complexes are formed for the solutions of iodine concentration ca. 0.1 ∼ ca. 3 M. How about the case of highly-diluted iodine solution of 0.001–0.05 M, as used for the industrial production of a polarizer ? The several models were proposed for the aggregation state of PVA and iodine ion species in the dilute solution or in the amorphous region. For example, Zwick proposed a helical structure model [4], where the long iodine rod is trapped inside the helical PVA chain as seen in the iodine complex of amylose [26] (see Fig. 3 (a)). Choi and Miyasaka proposed the PVA-iodine complex model in the amorphous region, where an I5 − ion is enclosed by the 4 PVA chain segments as illustrated in Fig. 3 (b) [7]. Unfortunately, however, any clear experimental evidence, for example, X-ray diffraction data, was not presented for deriving the model, which is only speculative. Matsunaga et al. drew a model of the I3 − ion rods adsorbed on the PVA crystallite surfaces [Fig. 3 (c)] [8]. By analyzing the small-angle neutron scattering data collected for the solution containing the PVA oligomers of about 15 monomeric units, iodine ions, and CuCl2 as a color inducing agent, Yajima [9] proposed a double-cylindrical model in which the I3 − ion column of 66 Å length is surrounded by the 4 PVA chains and then by the 8 PVA chains as the second cylindrical tube. The thus-created cylinders were speculated to aggregate together in the solution. However, their inner structure of the cylinders was that transferred from the speculative model proposed by Choi and Miyasaka [7]. In this way, the PVA–iodine complex produced from the dilute iodine solution has not yet been investigated enough well. Besides, no experimentally-confirmed structure model was reported. As will be described here, we have found out a new X-ray diffraction pattern intrinsic to the PVA sample immersed in a dilute iodine solution. This new complex is called form IV here. By using mainly the wide-angle X-ray diffraction method, the various factors (iodine concentration, immersion time, effect of boric acid etc.) have been investigated to establish the formation condition of form IV. The quantitative analysis was performed for the observed X-ray diffraction data, and the concrete structure model has been derived successfully by combining with the Raman spectral data and the DFT calculation. As a result, we have obtained the information of the aggregation structures for 4 types of PVA-iodine complexes in total. On the basis of these structural information, the formation mechanism of a series of complexes has been discussed. Finally, the X-ray diffraction pattern obtained for the commercial polarizer was found similar to that of form IV, although the details of the preparation conditions of the polarizer are not necessarily the same as those reported here. The concrete information about the chain aggregation structures in forms I–IV can help us to speculate the aggregation state of iodine complexes in a commercial polarizer. In order to avoid the misunderstanding of the readers, we need to point out here the significance of the present report. As mentioned above, the several models were reported about the PVA-iodine complex in the oriented amorphous region or in the solution [4,7–9], which were believed to be the real model of the polarizer. The SANS analysis derived the cylindrical aggregation model experimentally [9]. However, the inner structures proposed in Refs. [4,7,9] were only speculative and were not supported confirmatively by the experimental data. Especially, no X-ray diffraction pattern had been reported about the oriented-amorphous PVA-iodine complex at all. The discovery of form IV complex has allowed us to imagine the concrete structural image of the polarizer."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples and preparation conditions,"2.1 Samples and preparation conditions Samples PVA samples were supplied by Kuraray Co. Ltd., Japan. The degree of polymerization was 1700, and the degree of saponification was 99.9%. The sample was dissolved into hot water and cast to the films at room temperature. The films were stretched about 5 times the original length on the hot plate at 90 °C. The film thickness was about 80 μm. Annealing of the film was performed at 160 °C for 60 min in a vacuum oven. The as-stretched or heat-treated films of the same thickness were immersed into the KI/I2 aqueous solutions of the various concentrations of 0.001–3 M (= mol/L) at room temperature under tension, where the ratio of KI:I2 was ca. 2:1. The immersion time was seconds, minutes to hours and days. The effect of boric acid was investigated by stretching the original PVA film in the boric acid aqueous solution of 4 wt% concentration, followed by immersion into the iodine solution. The samples necessary for the measurement of UV–Vis absorption spectra were the films of a few μm thickness cast on the quartz plates, which were immersed in the iodine solution of various concentrations for 1 h."
3,Measurements,2.2 Measurements The 2-dimensional X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using a Rigaku Rapid-2 X-ray diffractometer equipped with the cylindrical imaging plate detector of radius 127.4 mm. The incident X-ray beam was Mo-Kα line with wavelength 0.7107 Å. The resonance Raman spectra were measured using a Japan Spectroscopic Company NRS2100 dispersion-type Raman spectrometer with an excitation laser beam of 532 nm wavelength. The measurement of UV–Vis absorption spectra was performed with a Japan Spectroscopic Company V-670 UV–Vis spectrometer.
4,Computer simulations,"2.3 Computer simulations The DFT calculation was performed for the geometry optimization of PVA-iodine complex using a DMol3 program of Materials Studio package (version 7.02, Biovia-Accelrys) [19]. The GGA-PBE [27] functional and DNP basis set were used, where double numerical basis set with polarization p-function was applied to all hydrogen atoms and d-function to all non-hydrogen atoms. Core electrons were treated with DFT semi-core pseudopotentials [28]. Dispersion force was corrected with Tkatchenko-Scheffler scheme [29]. Energy minimization was assumed to be converged when the energy convergence condition was satisfied along with either the displacement or gradient criteria: energy: 2 × 10−5 a.u., max force: 0.004 a.u./Å and max displacement, 0.005 Å. The BSSE (basis set superposition error) was corrected using the counterpoise method [30]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of iodine concentration on X-ray diffraction pattern,"3.1 Effect of iodine concentration on X-ray diffraction pattern The 2-dimensional X–ray diffraction patterns were measured for the as-stretched and un-annealed PVA samples immersed in the KI/I2 solutions of the various iodine concentrations. Fig. 4 (a) shows the typical 2D WAXD patterns and Fig. 4 (b) shows the corresponding 1D diffraction profiles along the equatorial line. The diffraction patterns of forms I (0.5 M concentration) and II (1.0 M concentration) are the same as those shown in Fig. 1. The newly-found diffraction pattern is that of form IV (tentative name), which was obtained by immersing the PVA sample in the iodine solution of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.08 M as seen in this figure. The equatorial diffraction profiles are appreciably different from those of forms I and II. The characteristic peaks are indicated by arrows. For example, as indicated by red arrows, form II is identified by the 3 peaks at 2θ = 4.2, 5.3 and 6.7° [16]. Form I shows the broad two peaks at 2θ = 2.9 and 6.2° (green arrows). The form IV possesses the peaks at 2θ = 2.0, 3.5 and 6.3° (blue arrows). Fig. 5 (a) shows the diffraction profiles traced along the meridional direction of the 2D WAXD patterns [Fig. 4 (a)]. These peaks are originated from the columnar structure of iodine ions and the PVA zigzag chain [14–17]. The combination of Raman spectra (Fig. 6 ) with X-ray meridional diffraction data allows us to identify the iodine ion species. The Raman peak at 110 cm−1, for example, indicates the existence of I3 − ion, as observed for the cases of 0.75–1 M solution [31,32]. The X-ray meridional peaks at 2θ = 8.5 and 12.8°, as indicted by red arrows for the 0.75–1 M samples, correspond to the 002 and 003 diffraction peaks intrinsic to the I3 − ion columnar structure with about 9.6 Å period, consistent with the calculated diffraction pattern (Fig. 5 (b)). On the other hand, the samples of 0.01–0.05 M show the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 8.0, 10.7 and 13.4° as indicated by blue arrows. They are assigned to the 003, 004 and 005 diffractions of the I5 − ion columnar structure of 15.2 Å period, as reproduced by the calculation (Fig. 5 (b)). In fact, as seen in Fig. 6, the strong Raman peak at 160 cm−1 is detected for these samples in addition to the 110 cm−1 peak. The former corresponds to the I5 − ion species [31,32]. From these data analyses, we might speculate the ion species contained in these complexes: the form II contains mainly the I3 − ion columnar structure and form I contains the I5 − and I3 − ion columnar structure. The form IV contains the I5 − columnar structure. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the relative contents of these two ion species in these samples individually. It might be better to note some characteristic points of these data for understanding the reasons. (i) the Raman spectra measured here are the so-called resonance Raman spectra and detect only the iodine ion species, which appear in the frequency region below 250 cm−1 [31,32]. The information of PVA and/or PVA-iodine complex itself is, unfortunately, difficult to detect from the Raman spectra in the higher frequency region (Therefore we measured the polarized infrared spectra for this purpose and found the changes of interactions between PVA and iodine species, as reported in Ref. [18]). Besides, as already mentioned in our previous report [16], an incidence of a strong laser beam onto the iodine complex surface damages the sample easily and causes the change of I5 − to I3 −. As a result, the relative intensity ratio of these two Raman bands is modified remarkably from the real one. In order to avoid such a technical problem, the laser-irradiated position was moved continuously during the Raman measurement. Strictly speaking, however, even for a short time irradiation of laser beam during the sample movement, the decomposition of ion species might have occurred more or less. As seen in Fig. 6, a weak Raman peak of I3 − species detected for the samples prepared from the highly-dilute solutions might come from such a laser-induced damage of I5 − ion as a possibility. In such a sense, the Raman spectral data are difficult to use for the quantitative estimation of the relative content of the iodine species. Additionally, the polarized Raman spectra are useful to know the orientation of iodine ion species. All of the PVA-iodine complexes prepared in the present experiments showed the overwhelmingly strong iodine peaks in the polarized Raman measurement of the ZZ polarization geometry and weak peaks in the ZX polarization (Z//chain axis and X ⊥ chain axis), indicating the parallel orientation of these iodine ions along the PVA chain axis [31], which is consistent with the X-ray diffraction data. (ii) On the other hand, the X-ray meridional diffraction peaks reflect more explicitly the iodine columnar structure as seen in Fig. 5. For example, the form II sample (1 M concentration) shows only the peaks intrinsic to the I3 − ion columnar structure. Similarly, form IV samples (0.03–0.05 M) shows only the meridional peaks of I5 − species. For the sample of 0.5 M concentration, the meridional peak profiles look to be the overlap of the peaks coming from these two different ions, indicating the mixture of I3 − and I5 − ion species. But, as known from the equatorial line profile shown in Fig. 4, the 0.5 M sample contains almost pure form I complex. The combination of the equatorial and meridional line profiles indicate that form I complex contains both of these two ion species, as a conclusion."
7,Effect of immersion time (0.01 M iodine solution),"3.2 Effect of immersion time (0.01 M iodine solution) The X-ray diffraction patterns were measured for the oriented un-annealed PVA sample (80 μm thickness) after immersion in the 0.01 M iodine solution for various fixed times. Figs. 7 and 8 show, respectively, the 2D WAXD patterns and the equatorial and meridional line profiles. Starting from PVA, the diffraction peaks characteristic of form IV were detected for the sample immersed for 1 h, and the intensity increased remarkably by increasing the immersion time furthermore. Observing more carefully, the peaks of form IV might have generated in such an earlier time as several tens minutes, as seen actually for the meridional I5 − peaks [Fig. 8 (b)]."
8,Effect of annealing,"3.3 Effect of annealing So far we compared the data for the samples without heat treatment. The PVA samples were annealed at 160 °C to increase the degree of crystallinity. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) show the X-ray diffraction peaks compared between the annealed and un-annealed PVA samples before and after being immersed in the 0.01 M iodine solution for 3 h. In the case of neat PVA samples shown in Fig. 9 (a), the diffraction peaks became sharper after annealing. However, after the sample was immersed in the iodine solution (0.03 M for 3 h), the whole diffraction profile was not very much different between the annealed and un-annealed samples as seen in Fig. 9 (b). The profile is that of form IV for both of the samples."
9,Effect of boric acid solution,"3.4 Effect of boric acid solution In the industrial production of a polarizer, boric acid aqueous solution is usually used [21,22]. The boric acid molecules are combined with the OH groups of the amorphous PVA chains to form the cross linkages between the chains [33–47]. In the actual process of polarizer production, the sample is stretched in an iodine solution containing some amount of boric acid [21,22]. However, in the present experiment, the PVA samples were immersed in a boric acid solution at first, and then these samples were immersed in the iodine solution. The reason is to know the effect of boric acid on the PVA sample at first before they change to the complexes by immersion into an iodine solution. As an extreme example, the PVA film was mixed with boric acid at 3:1 wt ratio in the aqueous solution, and the cast film was prepared. Then, the film was stretched at 60 °C about 5 times the original length. Fig. 10 compares the X-ray diffraction patterns between the PVA samples without and with the treatment by boric acid. Compared with the original PVA sample, the amorphous halo became stronger and the diffraction peaks were broader. Fig. 9 (a) shows clearly this situation. The quite broad peak was detected at around 2θ = 9.7°, corresponding to the position of the amorphous halo peak. After immersing the sample in the iodine solution of 0.03 M concentration for about 3 h, the equatorial line spots characteristic of the iodine complex form I were detected, different from those observed for the PVA samples without boric-acid-treatment, which gave the form IV. In order to check the effect of boric acid on the complex formation, the X-ray diffraction was measured for a series of PVA samples stretched in boric acid and immersed in the iodine solution for the same period. Fig. 11 shows the X-ray diffraction profiles along the equatorial line measured for the boric-acid-treated PVA samples which were immersed for 2 days in the iodine solutions of different concentrations. The original PVA samples gave the form IV by being immersed in a dilute solution of 0.01–0.05 M (Figs. 4 and 8), but the boric-acid-treated PVA sample gave the form I even when the iodine solution was in the same concentration range. As reported already [33–47], the PVA chains in the amorphous region are partially linked together by boric acid molecules. The crystallite size becomes smaller as known from the broader diffraction peak [Fig. 9 (a)], where the lateral size of the X-ray-coherent crystallite size was roughly estimated to change from ca. 100 Å (PVA) to ca. 40 Å (boric acid treated), as estimated from the half width of the peak at around 9° in Fig. 9. The iodine ions are speculated to penetrate more easily into such smaller crystallites to accelerate the complex formation in the crystals. The acceleration of the complex formation can be detected even when the iodine concentration is much lower in the range of 0.001 M order. For example, the neat PVA sample was immersed in a dilute iodine solution of 0.005–0.01 M. The iodine complex (form IV) grew slowly and saturated for the first time after the immersion for several days (Fig. 8). Contrarily, when the PVA sample stretched in the boric acid solution was immersed in a dilute solution of 0.005 M concentration (Fig. 12 ), the formation of the complex form IV was detected to be almost saturated in a short time of 1–2 h. From these results, we can understand one reason why PVA sample is immersed in the various solutions of the different boric acid concentrations in the actual production of polarizer [21,22]. In this way, we have confirmed the condition for the preparation of the PVA-iodine complex form IV. This complex is created by immersing the PVA sample in the dilute iodine solution of ca. 0.001–0.05 M concentration. Of course the immersion time should be long (several hrs to days) in order to detect the corresponding X-ray diffraction pattern clearly. The heat treatment of the PVA samples did not affect the formation of form IV very much, because the sample is immersed in an aqueous solution for a long time and the crystallites may be swollen more or less to decrease the crystallinity. The formation of form IV is accelerated by treating the original PVA sample in the boric acid solution for a while. These conditions are similar to those utilized in the industrial production of polarizer, although the details are different from the present experiments; for example, for the production of a polarizer, the roll-stretching, not a uniaxial stretching, is performed in the mixed solution of boric acid and iodine species instead of the sequential treatment in the boric acid and in the iodine solution, and so on. However, the present experimental data are expected to become a good hint for the estimation of the inner structure of polarizer. The concrete discussion will be made in a later section. But, before it, we need to know the concrete aggregation state of PVA chains and iodine species in the form IV."
10,Structure of form IV,"3.5 Structure of form IV We analyzed the crystal structure of form IV by using the thus-confirmed X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 4). The equatorial line peaks are indexed using the hexagonal-type unit cell of a = b = 23.1 Å and γ = 120°. The meridional line peaks gives the repeating periods of 2.55 Å, which corresponds to the period of a zigzag PVA chain, and the repeating period of 15.2 Å, which comes from the existence of I5 − ion columnar structure. The packing models consisting of PVA zigzag chains and I5 − ions were constructed by referring to the structure models proposed in the literatures (Fig. 3) [7–9]. After many trial-and-error procedures, a cylindrical model proposed by Choi and Miyasaka [7] was assumed to be plausible. Their model was utilized in the quantitative analysis of the small-angle neutron scattering data by Yajima, in which the iodine column was surrounded by the double PVA cylinders [9]. Then, at first, we checked whether such cylindrical model was energetically reasonable or not. The energy minimization was performed using the DFT for the models of I5 − ion rod surrounded by 4, 5 or 6 PVA zigzag chains, which are called here the 4-PVA-chain ring model and so on. The effective length of I5 − ion is 15.2 Å. Then, one PVA chain may take a little longer length to enclose the iodine ion, that is, PVA chain was assumed to contain the 7 monomeric units of syndiotactic configuration (the length is 2.55 Å/unit × 7 units = 17.8 Å). The details of the concrete calculation process were already described in the experimental section. Fig. 13 shows the initial models and the energetically-optimized structures. After the energy minimization, the 4-PVA-chain ring model was broken: 4 PVA chains could not enclose the I5 − ion. The 5-PVA-chain ring model attained the tight enclosure of an I5 − ion. The 6-PVA-chain ring model was more stable, though the hexagonal ring was a little bit deformed [ΔE = stabilization energy = −2.4 kcal/mol monomeric unit (4-PVA) < −2.5 (5-PVA) < −2.6 (6-PVA)]. The atomic charge distribution was found to change after the complex formation. For example, in the case of 6-PVA-chain ring structure, the charge transfer from I5 − ion to the OH groups of PVA chain is 1.204 e− [19]. Since the X-ray-analyzed unit cell was of the hexagonal type, the 6-PVA-chain ring model was employed as a candidate. The 8 CH2CH(OH) units were contained in the repeating period 20.4 Å so that the PVA chain became infinitely repeated along the chain axis, different from the above-mentioned finite PVA chain model used in the DFT calculation. Fig. 14 shows the thus-constructed crystal lattice model. The regular 6-membered rings were packed with the space group P3 assumed and the energy minimization was performed using a commercial software Cerius2 (version 4.10, Biovia), where the universal force filed was used and the charges obtained by the ab-initio molecular orbital calculation were assigned to the atoms. The equatorial-line profile calculated for this model is compared with the observed data, as shown in Fig. 14 (b). The calculation was performed using a commercial software Cerius2. The crystallite size was assumed to be 50 Å along the a, b and c axes, the lattice strain was 2%, and the isotropic temperature factor was 5 Å2. The occupancy (or the probability) of the I5 − ion column in the unit cell was 0.9. The agreement between the observed and calculated diffraction profiles is fairly good. The fractional coordinates of atoms are listed in Table 1 ."
11,X-ray diffraction of a polarizer,"3.6 X-ray diffraction of a polarizer At this stage, we compare the X-ray diffraction data of a commercial polarizer with those collected for the PVA samples treated under various conditions mentioned above. As well known, the actual commercial polarizer is a multiple films with glues. In order to avoid the effect of these additional factors in the quantitative analysis of the produced polarizer plate, we obtained a neat polarizer plate without any additional treatment (Roughly speaking the polarizer was prepared by rolling the solution-cast PVA film by 5 times the original length in the aqueous solution containing the KI/I2 of concentration of ca. 0.005 M and boric acid of 0.1 M at 60 °C). Figs. 15 and 16 show the 2D WAXD patterns of a neat polarizer. Fig. 15 shows the diffraction intensity in a logarithmic scale so that the diffraction peaks in the low-angle region characteristic of PVA-iodine complex form IV can be seen more clearly. Some of the characteristic points are picked up as follows. (i) The 2D WAXD pattern and the equatorial line profile of the polarizer are similar to those of form IV as a whole. The positon of the strong equatorial-line peak is not equal to that of the crystalline phase of PVA (2θ = 9.1°), but it is almost the same as that of the amorphous halo peak (2θ = 9.7°), as seen in Fig. 17. (ii) The X-ray diffraction pattern of a polarizer is diffuse as a whole. The equatorial line profile is also broad (see Fig. 16) as a result of the sample treatment in the boric acid solution, as mentioned in the preceding section. (iii) As seen in Fig. 15, the meridional streak lines are originated from the columnar structure of I5 − ions as supported by the Raman peak position. (iv) In order to check the PVA crystalline state in the polarizer, a sheet of polarizer was washed by being immersed in sodium thiosulfate aqueous solution (hypo) for a while and dried up. The washing for a long term resulted in the recovery of the pure and oriented PVA film. When the polarizer was washed for a relatively short time, the X-ray diffraction signals of PVA crystallites and form IV became clearer (see Fig. 15 (b) and 16 (b)). The absorbed water might play a role of a plasticizer to enhance the micro-Brownian motion of the amorphous region and then to induce the regularization of the higher-order structure. The clearer observation of form IV diffraction pattern for the shortly-washed polarizer indicates that the clusters of form IV may originally exist in the polarizer. (v) The points (i) - (iv) indicate that the PVA-iodine complex form IV is created in the oriented amorphous region of the polarizer (Fig. 18 (a)) [4,6–12]. The degree of orientation of such an oriented-amorphous region was estimated as about 93% from the arc length of the 9.7° peak intensity [Fig. 15 (a)], indicating an appreciably high orientation of the amorphous chain segments. (vi) In Fig. 16, we can see the small peaks located in the vicinity of X-ray beam stopper. For example, in Fig. 16 (c), these peaks are found to correspond to the so-called small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) pattern, indicating the existence of the stacked lamellar structure [48–51]. The SAXS peak intensity is quite high, because the existence of iodine ions in the oriented amorphous region may enhance the electron density contrast remarkably. As seen in Fig. 16 (a) and (b), the polarizer also shows the detectable SAXS pattern corresponding to the stacked lamellar structure, but the scattering signal itself is quite diffuse and weak, because the population of iodine complex is very low as seen in the weak streaks corresponding to the I5 − ion columns. The more detailed study of SAXS data must be made in future. (vii) When the X-ray diffraction signal is investigated carefully, we can notice the following important point: the observation of the equatorial streaks near the beam stopper at around 2θ ∼ 1° or less. The streak is not detected for the PVA-iodine complex samples prepared in the laboratory after immersion for a long time. As reported in the several papers [48–51], the oriented PVA sample in the wet and dry states gives the strong streak line along the equatorial line in the SAXS region, suggesting the existence of some periodical structures along the lateral direction. One possibility is the periodical locations of the oriented amorphous regions. The oriented amorphous regions are speculated to consist of the so-called taut tie chain segments, which might locate in the transition region from the crystalline lamella to the poorly-oriented amorphous region or on the crystallite surfaces (see Fig. 18 (b)) [52–56]. Once when the sample is immersed in the iodine solution, the iodine ions may penetrate into these oriented amorphous regions and are stabilized by forming the iodine complex (form IV). Since the spacing might distribute in a wide range of several tens Å order, the corresponding peaks might appear at various 2θ positons, resulting in the streaky line as observed in the small-angle region (see Figs. 15 and 16)."
12,Structure of PVA-iodine complex in the polarizer,"3.7 Structure of PVA-iodine complex in the polarizer On the basis of the X-ray diffraction data explained in section 3.6, one plausible model of the polarizer is deduced as schematically illustrated in Fig. 19 . The polarizer is considered to consist of 5 main parts; the oriented PVA crystalline regions, the oriented amorphous regions, the loosened amorphous regions, the iodine complex parts with the concrete structure shown in Fig. 14, and the cross-linked amorphous chain segments. The oriented amorphous parts are speculated to distribute in the normal (loosened) amorphous region and also near the crystallite surfaces with the various repeating periods of several tens Å order in the lateral direction. The I5 − ions penetrate into these oriented amorphous regions to create the form IV complexes (see Fig. 20 ). By increasing the concentration and immersion time in the dilute iodine solution, the relative population of form IV is increased. The complexes of the various sizes may absorb the visible light of the various wavelengths. Correspondingly, the wavelength region of the absorbed visible lights becomes wider, reflecting on the optical quality of a polarizer [57–61]."
13,Formation mechanism of PVA-iodine complexes,"3.8 Formation mechanism of PVA-iodine complexes In the previous paper [20] we proposed the formation mechanism of a series of PVA-iodine complexes starting from the pure PVA crystal to form I, form II and form III. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we notice that the packing structures of crystalline forms I, II and III are appreciably different from that of form IV. From the many experimental data presented here, the form IV has been concluded to be created in the oriented amorphous region, not in the crystalline region. This situation may be the same in the production of the polarizer. The polarizer is produced by roll-stretching the PVA film in the boric acid solution (and in the dilute iodine solution), the crystallites are appreciably small in size and low in population. Correspondingly, the relative content of oriented amorphous regions is high. Now, let us speculate the invasion of iodine ions from the aqueous solution of low concentration. As reported [16], the I3 − ions are rich in the dilute solution. Once these ions penetrate into the solid sample, they change to such longer iodine ions of rod shapes as I5 −, I9 −, and so on, though the exact transition process is still riddle (In the case of nylon model compounds, the X-ray diffraction analysis of the single crystal revealed the existence of I9 − rods in the crystal [62]). The I5 − ions migrate toward the amorphous phase and are trapped by the PVA chains to create the form IV complex in the oriented amorphous regions. Of course, the unoriented amorphous region might also form the complex, which cannot be detected clearly in the X-ray diffraction measurement. By immersing the polarizer (or the PVA sample containing form IV) in the iodine solution of much higher concentration of ca. 0.1 ∼ ca. 0.8 M, the complex of the oriented amorphous region may change to the form I, and besides the iodine ions diffuse inside the crystalline lamellae by passing through these oriented amorphous parts. The form I part is increased gradually. In an extreme case of ca. 1–3 M solution, the form II is produced by rearranging the iodine ions and PVA chain stems as illustrated in Fig. 2. In parallel, the I5 − ions transform to the I3 − ion species, and their population increases as the crystalline form changes from form I to form II. In this way the formation process is complicated and contains various such elementary factors as the transportation of iodine ions from the solution to the solid sample, the change of iodine ion species, the interactions between PVA and iodine ions, the stability of packing structures among the various complex forms, and so on. These factors work cooperatively to result in the formation of the complicated aggregation structure of PVA chains and iodine ion rods. As for the penetration route of linear iodine ions into the crystalline region, one possibility is the diffusion of iodine ion rods from the oriented amorphous region to the crystallite surfaces, and then penetrate into the inner parts of the crystallites (see Fig. 20). The theme of the penetration route of iodine ions is important for controlling the formation process of the polarizer with higher functionality."
14,Summary and conclusion,"In the present report, the creation of a new form IV was detected for the PVA sample immersed in an iodine solution of an extremely low concentration of 0.001–0.05 M. The structural characteristics of form IV were extracted successfully by the detailed quantitative analysis of X-ray diffraction and Raman data as well as the DFT calculation. The crystal structure of form IV was proposed, which is the hexagonal-type aggregation of the cylinders composed of I5 − ion rod enclosed by 6 PVA zigzag chain segments. This structure model was found to reproduce the observed X-ray diffraction profile satisfactorily. Secondly, by comparing the X-ray diffraction pattern of a commercial polarizer with those of forms IV, I and II, the polarizer was found to consist of the aggregation of form IV clusters, which are speculated to be created in the oriented amorphous regions. The high stretching of PVA film at a relatively low temperature induces the generation of the oriented amorphous regions more easily. In addition, the treatment of PVA in the boric acid solution depresses the formation of the large crystalline regions, and the relative amount of the oriented amorphous region is increased instead, as known from the broad and diffuse X-ray diffraction pattern. This situation accelerates the formation of form IV complex more easily even in the iodine solution of an appreciably low concentration and for a short immersion time. It must be noted here that the preparation process of a commercial polarizer is a little different from that in the present experiments; for example, the samples for the commerical polarizer are the rolled films, not such uniaxially-oriented samples as used here. The rolled films might have the 3-diensionally-oriented complicated higher-order strucutre. The present sudy did not investgate the higher–order structure of the stacked lmellae in details. The most important key point of the present study is that the PVA-iodine complex form IV exsists in the polarizer, in particular, in the oriented amorphous regions, as illustrated in Fig. 19. The detailed study of the higher-order struture of a commercial polarizer should be a future theme indispensable for the total understanding of the structurl characteristics of a polarizer. The commercial polarizer is still becoming important for the practical application in the various fields. The optical quality of the polarizer is requested to improve furthermore. In order to realize such a request, the aggregation structure of PVA-iodine complex in the oriented PVA film must be controlled systematically. The structural information of the PVA-iodine complex form IV revealed here may be useful for the further study of a polarizer and then for the industrial production of a polarizer with more excellent optical property as well as the mechanical property."
