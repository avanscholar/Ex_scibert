0,Introduction,"The development of hydrogen energy has been on the vital worldwide agenda recently [1]. The source and production of hydrogen energy have attracted great attention in the energy research sector [2]. It is a research hotspot that seeks alternative technology for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production to meet growing demand. At present, there are no more than two essential technologies of hydrogen industrially produced by non-renewable energy resources, that have been put into large-scale industrial production [3]. One is the cracking of fuel hydrogen production from non-renewable resources such as petroleum and coal, and the other is electrolytic hydrogen production from commercial electricity generated by non-renewable energy. These mature technologies produce hydrogen at a large-scale, but it consumes a lot of non-renewable energy with unsustainable hydrogen production. Therefore, concurrent hydrogen production has been switched to water electrolysis powered by renewable energy [4]. On this aspect of solar energy utilization, the photocatalytic hydrogen production is a prevalent work. It extensively associated with the exploration of various photocatalysts [5]. The best current representative system of the photocatalytic splitting of water was reported to have a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.1% [5]. The overall solar quantum efficiency of water splitting is typically lower than 10% [6]. It is a quite low efficiency. The other approach is photovoltaic hydrogen production, which utilizes solar energy as the energy source for solar cells to generate electricity, and then uses that to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen. This system was driven only by the solar electricity, without using the solar heat covered by the majority of the solar spectrum, for the chemical sector. So, due to the limitations of solar cell efficiency, solar utilization efficiency is not very high, with the current limit in efficiency ∼20% for non-concentrated silicon-based solar cells. The total solar hydrogen production efficiency is commonly less than ∼15% in view of the electrolysis efficiency. Even in our previous research, the elegant high-efficiency multi-layer AlGaAs/Si solar cells were directly coupled to the RuO2-catalyzed electrolytic water unit, the total solar hydrogen production efficiency can only reach 18.3% [7], but this was also a good record at that time [8]. According to the potential diagrams, the various species, such as single sulfur, polysulfides (Sx 2−, with x = 2,3, 4, …), dithionite, sulfite, tetrathionate, and thiosulfate, are involved in the oxidation of sulfide solutions [9]. Ateya [10] observed sulfur deposition on the surface of the graphite anode. Many authors summarized that the continuous oxidation of sulfur to oxyanions should be much slower than the oxidation of sulfide to sulfur. However, the continuous deposition of elemental sulfide may lead to anodic surface passivation [11]. Panizza [12] proved that complete oxidation and good energetic efficiency could be obtained only at high oxygen overpotential on the specified anode featured with high chemical inertness, great current efficiencies, long lifetime, and high overpotential for oxygen evolution. Despite many pieces of papers for the investigations of the sulfide anodic oxidation, only a few were focused on the dominated oxidation of sulfide to sulfate by breaking the sulfur passivation film [13]. It is worth noting that all the researches were conducted under the atmospheric temperature, without an input of high heat. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a valued commodity and an alternative source of H2. H2S to H2 conversion has become an active topic recently. Antonio [14] highlights some of the methods of H2S to H2 utilization, such as partial oxidation, reformation, and decomposition techniques. To date, almost no way exists to suitably convert H2S to sulfur and H2 for industrial-scale applications. Currently, many technologies have been researched for the H2S chemical decomposition to hydrogen. Fletcher [15] and Al-Shamma [16] utilized hydrogen sulfide as hydrogen source by thermal, Wang [17] performed the chemical cycle of the H2S by thermochemical, Petrov [18] produced hydrogen and sulfur and Huang [19] recovered hydrogen and sulfur by electrochemical; Reverberi [20] presented a review on hydrogen production from hydrogen sulphide by photochemical, and Nunnally [21] and Reddy [22] employed the plasmochemical splitting methods with fair results. The electrochemical approach of sulfide in aqueous solution with simultaneous hydrogen production offers a sustainable hydrogen energy production and an environmental pollution abatement strategy. But many authors，including Crisci [14], Huang [19], Jain [23] arrived at a conclusion, addressed in the principal obstacle of passivation film formation [19]. In early 1982, Noring [24] pointed out some economic benefits that could arise from the production of sulfur and hydrogen by electrolysis of H2S. For an approach to this goal, the anodic sulfur passivation must be solved or removed. Therefore, the sulfur passivation film has been considered as the big gap for the sulfur-containing wastewater electrochemical oxidation. Water splitting redox chemistry involves two-electrode reactions. The water splitting redox can occur directly through electron transfer between the anode and cathode. The following equation summarizes the electrode reaction of the water splitting via an electron donor (H2O) on the anode and an electron acceptor (H+) on the cathode: (1) Overall cell reaction H2O → 1/2 O2 + H2. So, the standard water-splitting potential is: (2) E o H 2 O = ϕ c o – ϕ a o = 1 . 229 V ( SHE, 25 ∘ C ) The energy efficiency of water electrosplitting varies widely. Most consistent reports often publish efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolyzers. Recently, the addition of carbon, alcohols, and organic compounds to water electrolysis cell has been reported as a viable option to reduce the energy input [25]. These carbon/hydrocarbons assisted water electrosplitting technologies could be utilized for hydrogen production in an electrochemical cell. The carbon-assisted system can reach the energy balance only around 40% electric input, with 60% harvesting from the chemical energy offered by carbon/hydrocarbon [26]. As is well known, water-splitting is an endothermic reaction. The input of much heat favors the decrease of the electrolysis potential. The potential could be reduced to less than 1.229V (SHE, 25 °C) under high temperature. The lower potential is mostly facilitated for the energy-saving and efficiency of the water-splitting electrochemistry. Herein, the input of solar heat can realize that goal. Another approach is to switch out the anodic reaction with a low anodic potential donor, that is, a change of the electron donor. The low-potential shuttle-electron donor will be oxidized on the anode under the lower potential of ϕ a = 1.229V (SHE, 25 °C). The S2− ions exactly match the anodic reaction. Generally, the anodic oxidation follows the reaction: (3) S 2 − → S + 2 e − ϕ c o = − 0.44 V ( SHE, 25 ∘ C ) Or (4) S 2 − → SO 4 2 − + 8 e − ϕ a ∘ = − 0.677 V ( SHE, 25 ∘ C ) The anodic potentials of ϕ S 2 − / S or ϕ S 2 − / SO 4 2 − are mostly lower than the ϕ H 2 O / O 2 in the single water splitting. In that way, E sulfur is determined to less than E water = 1.229V. On the other hand, the S2− ions are preferably oxidized to a S deposition intermediate, which blocks further oxidation to sulfate SO 4 2 − . It is presumed that the direct oxidation of sulfide ions will be oxidized to sulfate under the high-temperature range. In this situation, the solar thermal facility could be instrumental in the reduction of water splitting potential and complete oxidation of sulfide ions. Therefore, solar thermo-assisted electrochemical oxidation of water plus sulfide would be expected to gain efficient production and clean water only containing the non-toxic sulfate radicals. Solar energy is the most ideal green due to its high abundance worldwide. Water treatment is also an essential element for our survival. How to efficiently produce hydrogen and effectively treat wastewater is a critical scientific issue to relink hydrogen production and water treatment via solar energy organically. Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting is considered as a promising approach toward effectively utilizing solar energy [27]. Choi [28] successfully illustrated the simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen and 4-chlorophenol degradation system by using fluoride and Pt nanoparticle comodified TiO2. Nie [29] exhibited graphene quantum dots composite photocatalysts for both organic pollutant treatment and hydrogen production. Recently, a state-of-the-art work was updated by Wu [30]. Light-driven photocatalysis was employed to construct a system simultaneously for the generation of hydrogen and the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. However, the dual-functional photocatalysis systems, one for hydrogen production and the other for pollutant degradation, have not achieved an efficient charge separation for the photoreduction and photooxidation. As a result, the water reduction and pollutant oxidation might interfere with each other, causing a low simultaneous reaction efficiency. So, the huge gap has appeared in the low light and reaction efficiency for the simultaneous action of hydrogen generation and water treatment. The solar STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process) is a solar multifield-driven hybrid chemical process. The solar-driven multifields, typically photo and electro and thermo-energy, initiate hybrid chemical processes, dominantly photochemical, electrochemical, and thermochemical reactions. Considering the distributions of the solar-to-photo, solar-to-thermal and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency, and differences of photochemical, electrochemistry, and thermochemistry for a specific molecular reaction, an exact coupling of the solar multifield with the hybrid chemical process can provide a comprehensive solution to the efficient utilization of solar energy for any chemical reaction. The goal is great to improve solar energy conversion, solar reaction efficiency, and solar product selectivity. The solar STEP has been exemplified by the STEP theory [31]. STEP carbon capture [32], STEP organic synthesis [33], STEP water treatment [34] and STEP biomass degrdation [35]. The theoretical framework is just fitted for the chemical utilization of solar energy for a total solution of the efficient hydrogen production and effective wastewater treatment. Via the STEP strategy, the sun serves as a sole energy source for reactions on electrochemical and thermochemical processes. Exactly as we know, the highly thermal effect can decrease the thermodynamic energy of water splitting chemistry and the electrolysis potential. The co-utilization of solar heat and electricity could increase the overall solar utilization efficiency (more than 40%). The other strategy, an alternative donor, is matched to the STEP process. An alternative electron donor, such as the S2− ion from wastewaters, instead of H2O →O2 on the anode, is coupled with the system solar-driven water splitting redox chemistry towards low-potential and efficient production of hydrogen plus wastewater treatment. An alternative electron donor could lower the water-splitting potential with the self-extinction to non-toxic sulfur species. The electrolytic potential could be decreased to 0.6–0.7V (compared with the direct water electrochemical splitting potential, more than 1.5V). In addition, the high heat could promote the full oxidation of sulfide. Mechanistically, the solar thermal-induced conversion is that sulfide is directly oxidized to sulfate beyond the sulfur passivation film. Kinetically, the solar conversion rate is largely to be enhanced. So, we focused on the solar energy and contaminants in wastewater from oil and petrochemical sectors. The combination of solar-generated hydrogen and sulfide treatment is provoking much attention as a highly frequent research carrier. Solar-powered hydrogen generation and wastewater desulfurization are used to enable direct and efficient conversion of water to hydrogen and sulfide to sulfate via the solar STEP plus the alternative electron donor. Due to the dominant role of the sulfide donor and solar thermal utilization, this system is basically to be significantly high solar utilization efficiency and effective chemical hydrogen production rate. The novelty of the paper can be further highlighted. A new solar system was proposed and constructed for efficient solar-enabled hydrogen and water treatment. One solar technology enables simultaneously to resolve two problems. Two strategies, solar thermal action plus the alternative electron donor, was implemented for enhanced the solar system. The effect was to drop the electrolytic potential and stop the sulfur passivation film. The goal was achieved for highly efficient hydrogen and effective water treatment."

9,The reactive mechanism and thermodynamics calculation of solar water-plus sulfide splitting redox for hydrogen and wastewater treatment,"3.1 The reactive mechanism and thermodynamics calculation of solar water-plus sulfide splitting redox for hydrogen and wastewater treatment Until now, authors have reported the chemistry of water splitting redox for the production of hydrogen. Water redox can occur directly through electron transfer between the anode and cathode. For a redox reaction, the electrolytic potential E o, can be calculated by Gibbs free energy ΔG. Thus, to get a spontaneous reaction (ΔG° < 0), E cell o must be positive, where: (5) E ° cell = E ° cathode − E ° anode Where E anode is the standard anodic potential, and E cathode is the standard cathodic potential as indicated in the textbook. Electrochemically, the small the value of the standard oxidation potentials, the easier it is for the element to be oxidized (losing electrons); in other words, they are better reducing agents. 1. Direct electrochemical water splitting On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (6) H 2 O → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - ϕ a o = 1.229 V SHE, 25 ∘ C On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (7) 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 ϕ c o = 0.00 V SHE, 25 o C Overall cell reaction. Overall: (8) H 2 O l = 1 2 O 2 g + H 2 g So, the standard water-splitting potential is: (9) E o H 2 O = ϕ c o − ϕ a o = － 1 . 229 V SHE , 25 o C 2 Indirect electrochemical water splitting with the better electron donor The equations summarize the electrode reactions and electrode potentials of electrochemical water splitting with the sulfide donor. (a) Sulfide is presumed to be oxidized to sulfur in aqueous acidic solution (10) Anode : H 2 S → S + 2 e - + 2 H + ϕ a o = 0 . 177 V SHE , 25 o C (11) Cathode : 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 = ϕ c o 0 . 00 V SHE , 25 o C (12) Overall : H 2 S g = S s + H 2 g (13) E o S 1 = ϕ c o − ϕ a o = − 0 . 177 V SHE , 25 o C (b) Sulfide is presumed to be oxidized to sulfur in aqueous basic solution (14) Anode: Na 2 S → S + 2 Na + + 2 e - ϕ a o = − 0.44 V SHE , 25 o C (15) Cathode : 2 H 2 O + 2 e - → H 2 + 2 OH − ϕ c o = − 0.827 V SHE , 25 o C (16) Overall : Na 2 S l + 2 H 2 O l = S s + H 2 g + 2 NaOH l (17) E o S 2 = ϕ c o − ϕ a o = − 0 . 377 V SHE , 25 o C (c) Sulfide is presumed to be oxidized to sulfate in aqueous acidic solution (18) Anode : H 2 S + 4 H 2 O → H 2 SO 4 + 8 e − + 8 H + ϕ a o = 0 . 377 V SHE , 25 o C (19) C a t h o d e : 8 H + + 8 e − → 4 H 2 ϕ c o = 0.00 V SHE , 25 o C (20) Overall : H 2 S g + 4 H 2 O l = H 2 SO 4 l + 4 H 2 g (21) E o S 3 = ϕ c o − ϕ a o = − 0.377 V SHE , 25 o C (d) Sulfide is presumed to be oxidized to sulfate in aqueous basic solution (22) Anode: Na 2 S + 8 OH - → Na 2 SO 4 + 8 e ϕ a o = − 0.677 V SHE , 25 o C (23) Cathode: 8 H 2 O + 8 e - → 4 H 2 + 8OH - ϕ c o = − 0.8277 V SHE , 25 o C (24) Overall: Na2S(l)+4H2O(l) = Na2SO4(l)+4H2 (SHE, 25 °C) (25) E o S 4 = ϕ c o − ϕ a o = − 0.15 V SHE , 25 o C Table 1 summarizes the ΔG o and E o of the equations of the electrochemical splitting of water plus alternative donors. The data demonstrate that all the chemical equations are E°< 0, and the processes are nonspontaneous. The E° values can be converted to the applied electrolytic cell voltage for a clear indication of the dramatic reduction of the required cell potential by a switch of the alternative sulfide donor. The composition reaction of hydrogen sulfide ( H 2 S g = S s + H 2 g , ΔG 0 = 33 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically less stringent compared with the water-splitting reaction (26) H 2 O l = 1 2 O 2 g + H 2 g Δ G ∘ = 273 kJ / mol Due to the ϕ a − s o < ϕ a − H 2 O o , the V c e l l − S o is less than the direct V cell − H 2 O o . Therefore, the addition of the sulfide switches the smooth pathway of hydrogen production from the water splitting to the oxidation (elimination) of sulfide with a small applied voltage and high efficiency. Also, the STEP process can conduct a high heat operation. Thus, this offer is that the actual electrolysis potential can be significantly decreased to less than 1.0 V in comparison to 1.5 V for the conventional water electrosplitting reaction. As known, the water-splitting redox is an endothermic reaction. The solar-thermal coupling can reduce the energy required for the water electrolytic reaction, which is manifested in the fall of the electrolytic potential. For the calculation of the thermo-dependent potential, the cell potential (E cell) can be determined by using the entropy S, enthalpy H, and free-energy G, the primary thermodynamic data citing from NIST Chemistry Webbook. Principally, in an electrolytic cell, E o cell must be deduced from Gibbs free energy ΔG o by the following equation: (27) ΔG o cell = −nFE o cell Where n is the number of transferring electron moles per mole product, and F is the Faraday constant, 96485 C/mol. At any electrolytic temperature, and at the unit activity, the electrolytic reaction has an electrochemical potential of E cell. The value can be calculated by using the fixed thermodynamic data, as: (28) E o cell = E o standard (T = 25 °C, in the standard condition) In the above equation, E o cell is the standard electrode potential (SEP) of the reaction. The SEP can judge whether an electrochemical reaction occurs spontaneously. If E o cell＞0, the reaction can occur spontaneously without an external electric field, while if E o cell＜0, the reaction is nonspontaneous. The patterns are identified by a negative isothermal temperature coefficient of the cell potential. The isothermal coefficient can be obtained from the electrolytic potential of a constant temperature cell: (29) ( d E / d T ) i s o t h = Δ S / n F = ( Δ H − Δ G ) / n F T For the calculation of E cell, Δ G ο can be achieved through the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, as below: (30) Δ G ο = Δ H ο = T Δ S ο For a non-standard Δ H ο condition, it needs to be calculated: (31) Δ H ο = Δ H 298 ο + ∫ 298 T Δ C p Δ d T (32) Δ S ο = Δ S 298 ο + ∫ 298 T Δ C p / T d T Here: (33) Δ C p = ∑ i n i Δ C p ⋅ By using the 298K data of the reactants and products, we gain the integral constant value of ΔH° 298 , so for any standard enthalpy change ΔH°, for any Gibbs energy ΔG°, we finally obtain the standard electrode potential E cell under arbitrary temperature. Because V cell =−E o cell, from the electrolytic cell reaction, we can get the cell voltage. For the calculation program, firstly, the basic thermodynamics data，such as Cp°, ΔH° and ΔS°, are searched from the Website and Chemical handbook. The ΔH° and ΔS° are calculated by Equations (31)–(33). Then, ΔG° can be derived through the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (30). Finally, the cell reaction ΔG° can get the theoretical electrode potential by Equation (27). For the case of five reactive equations of the water plus sulfide splitting redox, thermodynamic data can be listed in Table 1 by referring to the electrolytic potentials and required applied voltages under the different temperatures. The calculated plots of the electrolytic water-plus-sulfide splitting potential on temperature are presented in Fig. 4 (a–e). The curves are drawn for the temperature-dependent potentials of the sole water and water-plus-sulfide to be oxidized to sulfate in the aqueous basic/acidic solution in Fig.4 (a) to Fig.4 (c), which is a negative temperature coefficient. The three reactions demonstrate that the electrolytic potentials decrease with increasing temperature, resulting in a remarkable gap from 25 °C to 100 °C. The heat is favorable for the S2− to- SO 4 2 − - oxidation. The calculated potentials of the two S2--to-S reactions indicate a positive temperature coefficient. The elevated temperature leads to the increase of the potential, which is unfavorable for the S2− -to-S oxidation. The data have elucidated that the solar heat can be applied favorably to the S2--to- SO 4 2 − oxidation, but not to the S2--to-S oxidation. This effect offers a theoretical basis for the solar thermo-assisted process to efficient hydrogen production and complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate beyond the occurrence of a sulfur passivation film. Based on the above thermodynamic data, the electrolysis potentials are indeed decreased for these endothermic oxidations at the elevated temperature. A produced system of hydrogen can be effectively driven with low consumption of the electrolysis energy via the decreased potential operation."
10,Thermo-dependent CV curves of water plus sulfide for solar water-splitting redox,"3.2 Thermo-dependent CV curves of water plus sulfide for solar water-splitting redox The CV method is a crucial tool for screening the redox reaction with scanned potential. It can reflect that the possibility of a redox reaction occurs in a particular potential and current magnitude - the magnitude of the potential and current measures the difficulty of oxidation and reduction. Thermo-dependent CV is recorded by varying temperature. The variation of redox reaction (potential and current) is screened for probing the change of the oxidation and reduction. During direct sulfide electro-oxidation, sulfide is oxidized on the anode surface either to sulfur (S), thiosulfate ( S 2 O 3 2 − ), sulfite ( SO 3 2 − ), or sulfate ( SO 4 2 − ), depending on the anode material and applied anode potential. At very high potentials, sulfate can be oxidized to sulfate ( SO 4 2 − ), and further to strong oxidant persulfate ( S 2 O 8 2 − ). Oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur is preferred from an economic point of view as it requires the least number of electrons and thus energy input. But a crucial disadvantage is the anodic passivation produced by the deposition of elemental sulfur to lead a low rate oxidation or to stop the reaction. The best way is to complete oxidation to non-toxic sulfate, allowing for it to be dissolved in aqueous solution. Fig. 5 illustrates the cyclic voltammograms of aqueous sulfide solution and water at varied temperatures. It is seen that three oxidation peaks (AI to AIII) emerged in the positive range (oxidation sector) when scanning towards a positive mode, which correspond to the two oxidation reactions of the sulfide electro-oxidation (AI and AII) and the other originating from water oxidation to oxygen (AIII, publicly recognized as H2O→O2). The potentials of the two sulfide peaks were much lower than the one of oxygen evolution from water. It indicates that the sulfide oxidation (AI and AII) is apt to occur instead of the oxygen evolution by the water oxidation (AIII) on the anode under a particular potential. Based on the above calculation and sulfur potential–pH diagram in the textbook, the peak AI anodic reaction was formed at about −200 tõ−300 mV, attributed to the oxidation of S2− to elemental S or polysulfur Sn: (34) Na 2 S → S + 2 Na + + 2 e - The peak AII anodic reaction was matched to the oxidation of S2− to sulfate SO 4 2 − at about +500 to ∼+700 mV: (35) Na 2 S l + 4 H 2 O l = Na 2 SO 4 l + 4 H 2 g At about 750 mV, the anodic reaction started the evolution of oxygen by (36) H 2 O → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - The data are consistent with the thermodynamic analysis and the cited references, opposed to the three oxidation peaks, two remarkable reduction peaks (CI and CII) appeared in the range of −0.8V to ∼1.0 V potential towards a negative scanning. It implies that only one oxidized S site was reversibly reduced in the negative potential (CII). The elevated line (CI) was to the beginning of the hydrogen evolution on the cathode. It is noticeable that the CV curves showed a switch of the anodic reaction from the pure water splitting (H2O→O2) required in the high potential to sulfide oxidation (S2− →S or SO 4 2 − ), preferably in low potential. The Vpeak values (AI and AII) were distinctly decreased while the Ipeak values were sharply increased when lifting the temperature, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). And the rise of the Ipeak A II was more than that of the Ipeak A I Obviously, the reaction rate of the peak AII is much faster than that of the peak AI. It means that the oxidation of S2−→S was shifted to the complete one of S2− → SO 4 2 − . Therefore, it gives evidence that the solar thermal effect has merit to facilitate the lowering of the electrolysis potential and altering of the anodic oxidation pathway. At the same time, the tremendous Ipeak lifted by increased temperature also displays that the heat could promote the reaction degree of the sulfide oxidation. The heat energy, activating the reactant molecules into the easily oxidized intermediates, reduces the demand for electric energy in the reaction process, and the low-potential electrolysis makes the reaction more energy-efficient. Due to a lower potential of the sulfide half-reaction on the anode instead of the oxygen evolution from water (AIII), the hydrogen production on the cathode was apt to the occurrence. Moreover, it is noted that the magnitude of hydrogen evolved by the electrolysis of the water plus sulfide was more than that by the electrolytic water, and it was increased with the elevated temperature."
11,Indoor experiments of water plus sulfide for solar water-splitting redox to hydrogen and wastewater treatment,"3.3 Indoor experiments of water plus sulfide for solar water-splitting redox to hydrogen and wastewater treatment For the full understanding of the roles of the alternative electron donor and solar thermal effect, the condition and control experiments were performed in the indoor experimental device. The effectiveness is indexed by the rate of the hydrogen production, RHydrogen, and the concentration of sulfate completed reacted by sulfide, Csulfate or efficiency of the conversion of sulfide to sulfate, η sulfate. 3.3.1 Dependence of the conditions on the electrolysis of water plus sulfide solution Fig. 6 shows the variations of SO 4 2 − concentrations on time-dependent electrolysis of water-plus-sulfide solution at the different temperatures. The conversion of sulfide to sulfate was raised by increasing the reaction time. But, the sulfate increment in the low range of temperature (30 °C–50 °C) was mostly less than the one gained in the high conversion of the SO 4 2 − under the 90 °C electrolysis. These curves indicate that the sulfide ions are easily oxidized to sulfate ions in the high temperature. The declining rate of the reactant S2− is displayed in Fig. 7 . The decreased rate was much faster at the 90 °C. Figs. 8 and 9 present the variations of the cell potential on the electrolytic time under the different currents and temperatures. All the potentials were lifted by increasing the current and decreasing the temperature. The applied potentials at the higher temperatures were lower than the ones at low heat under the same current. The reasonably small potentials (0.65V–0.85V) were expected in the low current (1–2 mA) and at the high temperature (70 °C–90 °C). The maximum potential was most under the potential of 1.25V. This potential is impossible to drive the electrolytic water splitting. 3.3.2 Dependence of the temperature on solar hydrogen production yield and wastewater treatment Solar heat has a significant effect on the described electrolytic reaction. Therefore, the temperature is a prioritized factor of solar hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. The solar thermally-dependent electrolytic experiments were implemented with both anode and cathode (Ti/IrO2&Ta2O5 DSA electrode and Pt sheets (2 × 2 cm2) in water-plus-sulfide solution at the initial concentration (S2−/ SO 4 2 − = 50/150 ppm, corresponding to oxidation of 50%), then flowed in a constant rate of 3 mL × 100 ppm S2− per hour. For the verification of the hydrogen production in the critically small potential, the test was conducted under constant current (1 mA), electrolyzed in the cell potential of 0.60V–0.70 V, and the rate of hydrogen production was analyzed for 30 min duration samples. The temp-dependent curves on the rate of hydrogen yield are shown in Fig. 10 . The system experimentally achieved a high hydrogen rate in a small potential range at 90 °C, only reaching up to 0.17 mL/h H2, reasonably more than that of the room-temperature electrolysis and direct electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen (nearly no evolution). Fig. 11 displays the temp-dependent curve of the sulfide-to-sulfate conversion. The data give a high efficiency of 93% S2− to SO 4 2 − in high heat input. It is obviously noted that the hydrogen produced by water plus sulfide electrolysis in the varied temperatures is enormously more than the one of the pure water splitting. In contrast, almost no hydrogen, practically, is evolved by the sole water electrolysis in such a potential range (0.6 V–1.25V), as shown in the variations of potential vs. time, current, and temperature (Figs. 8 and 9). The facts show the advantages of sulfide as an alternative electron donor. More advanced merit was manifested in the sharp increase of hydrogen rate by the elevated temperature. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the hydrogen volume at 90 °C is 3.8 times higher in the ambient temperature (25 °C). It can be concluded that the hydrogen yield at the high temperature was much higher than the one at the low temperature. On the efficiency of the sulfide-to-sulfate conversion, there is the same rule, which is consistent with the hydrogen production, indicating that the hydrogen generation and sulfide oxidation are interactive. It has been seen that more sulfates in the high temperature (80 °C–90 °C) were produced compared to the ones at room temperature (25 °C), which revealed that sulfides were converted entirely to sulfates in the high thermal effect. The conversion of sulfate at 90 °C is 2.5 times higher in the ambient temperature (25 °C). The electrolytic cells were pictured before and after the electrolysis. Table 2 demonstrates the pictorial variations of the anodic surface and solution before and after the electrolytic oxidation in the different temperatures. It can be seen that the electrolysis at 30 °C led to the deposited sulfur was dissolved to form the yellow solution and yellow passivation S film on the anode while the S deposition was not created at 90 °C. The thermo-electrochemical redox of sulfide would occur directly to produce sulfate and hydrogen by altering the reactive pathway of the sulfide to sulfur deposition. A solar thermo-assisted electrolytic system was constructed in the S2− shuttle-electron donor solution provided by wastewater. It was successfully operated for the hydrogen production and desulfurization with a high redox efficiency under an applied bias of 0.60 V to ∼0.80V, which is comparable with the sole water-splitting required bias of at least 1.5 V. Herein, we have sufficiently explained that both hydrogen production and wastewater treatment are greatly enhanced by the addition of an alternative electron donor and the coupling of the solar thermal effect for the water splitting redox."
12,Solar study of thermo-assisted electrochemical water-plus-sulfide splitting redox for the production of hydrogen and wastewater treatment,"3.4 Solar study of thermo-assisted electrochemical water-plus-sulfide splitting redox for the production of hydrogen and wastewater treatment For a test and verification of the solar thermo-electrochemical water-plus-sulfide splitting redox for the production of hydrogen and wastewater treatment, the fixed-volume flow experiments were conducted in the outdoor experimental facility, at constant current and temperature with a 100 ppm of the initial sulfide wastewater. Wastewater was continuously pumped into the sealed and heatable reactor (50 mL) equipped with a 2 × 2 cm2 Ti/IrO2&Ta2O5 DSA anode and 2 × 2 cm2 Pt cathode with a 30-min interval sampling. The H2 production volume and sulfate concentration were detected throughout the electrolytic/irradiation time. H2 production volume (60 min accumulated evolution) and sulfate concentration (in real-time) were plotted versus solar electrolysis/irritation time. As shown in Figs. 12 and 13 , both the H2 production rate and sulfate concentration were kept constant for 8 h at 90 °C. The high hydrogen rate and sulfate conversion verified the crucial roles of the alternative donor and solar thermal effect on the system. Fig. 14 tracked the variation of the potential in the electrolysis time. The sole water electrolytic splitting to hydrogen cannot occur at all in such an applied voltage (0.70V–0.90V, constant current 0.2 mA). The solar system experimentally achieved the reaching of 0.25 mL/h H2 and 93% S2− to SO 4 2 − with continuous and stable operation. So, the innovative solar thermo-electrochemical system has achieved a fast and stable production of hydrogen plus wastewater treatment. In the post check, the anode surface and nearby solution kept clear without the yellow sulfide film and muddy materials."
13,Chemical kinetics analysis of the solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment,"3.5 Chemical kinetics analysis of the solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment This system is composed of the solar energy conversion sector and solar chemistry sector, each sector contains three subsystems, and there is coupling between the subsystems, which is a very complicated system. The solar energy conversion sector is a conventional solar energy conversion system. The solar chemical sector is the key part of this system. We focused on the chemical sector in this study. So, firstly, we have done a numerical analysis for solar chemical sector, including the chemical thermodynamics (as shown in section 3.1) and kinetic analysis. The chemical kinetics data were calculated further. The solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment can occur directly in oxidation of sulfide to produce hydrogen, also generating sulfate radical in the absence of complex intermediates. The principal anode, cathode, and overall reactions are matched by the following Equations. Anode: Na2S+8OH−→Na2SO4+4H2O+8e - Cathode:4H2O+ 8e −→ 4H2 +8OH− Overall: Na2S(l)+4H2O(l) = Na2SO4(l)+4H2(g) Based on the chemical kinetics principles, first order kinetics is assumed: (37) − d [ S 2 − ] t d t = k t With variables defined as follows. [S2−] t concentration of S2− at time t. The logarithmic form of this formula. (38) l n [ S 2 − ] 0 [ S 2 − ] t = k t The above data are used for drawing the ln[S2−]0/[S2−] t ∼ t curves. Table 3 presents the first-order kinetics constant and error analysis. The data exhibit that the apparent constant k in 90 °C is greater than in 25 °C. It means that the chemical rate in the high temperature is largely faster than in the low temperature (see Fig. 15 ). It proves that the solar heat is positive for solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment. In Section 3.1, the new solar system, the efficient solar-enabled hydrogen and water treatment, was theoretically studied for the chemical reaction model and thermodynamics via two strategies of the solar thermal action plus the alternative electron donor. The CV technology is a powerful tool to study the electrochemical redox reaction. In Section 3.2, CV was adopted to experimentally prove that the chemical reaction model and the potential change of this solar system combined with the solar heat and sulfide substitution. In Section 3.3, the experimental results demonstrated the performance and controlling conditions. The theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results. The solar thermal action plus the alternative electron donor achieved highly efficient hydrogen and effective water treatment."
14,Efficiency of the solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment,"3.6 Efficiency of the solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen and water treatment Two parts contribute to the solar energy utilization of the system, solar energy conversion (primary conversion of solar to thermal and electricity) and thermo- and electrochemical reactions. Thus, solar efficiencies are related to the efficiencies of solar multifield conversion and hybrid chemical reaction. In other words, the overall efficiency of solar utilization is really dependent on the coupling of all efficiencies [31] The total efficiency is denoted: (39) η S o l a r H y d r o g e n = η S o l a r c o n v e r s i o n × η H y b r i d c h e m i c a l H y d r o g e n For the solar-water-plus sulfide splitting system, there are two conversion processes, which are solar to electricity and solar to heat for driving the hybrid chemical reactions. Two modes exist in the utilization of the sunlight band. The full spectrum sunlight of the entire solar band is utilized to the individual unit (full irritation from the UV, visible to IR range). The splitting sunlight divided into serial bands (UV, visible to IR ranges) is distributed to different units (each partially). So, the total efficiency can be written as: (40) η S o l a r c o n v e r s i o n = η S o l a r t o t h e r m o + η S o l a r t o e l e c t r o (In the utilization of the splitting sunlight). Or (41) η S o l a r c o n v e r s i o n = η S o l a r t o t h e r m o × η S o l a r t o e l e c t r o (In the utilization of the full spectrum sunlight). The reported efficiency has reached to 65%–80% of the present maximum value to solar-thermal conversion (full spectrum sunlight mode, less for splitting sunlight mode), and to 20%–40% (Si-based solar cell and concentrated solar cell, applicable to full-spectrum sunlight mode, less for splitting sunlight mode) of the recorded value to solar-electro conversion in the current technology [33]. In our experimental section, we utilized a solar Si-based cell panel to power the electrolysis cell with an efficiency of ∼20% (full spectrum sunlight mode) and a solar concentrating collector to provide heat with an efficiency of ∼85% (full spectrum sunlight mode). The η Solar conversion is up to ∼17% in the mode of the splitting sunlight while the higher efficiency, estimated in 60%–70% range, will be achieved in the mode of the splitting sunlight. The solar multifield-driven hybrid chemical process takes advantage of full utilization of solar thermo- and electro-effect, which have thermally induced the molecules and electrochemically promoted the reactions. So, the efficiency of the STEP chemical reaction should be: (42) η H y b r i d c h e m i c a l H y d r o g e n = η T h e r m o − i n d u c e d e l e c t r o c h e m + η E l e c t r o − i n d u c e d t h e r m o c h e m It can be summarized that the total solar efficiency is: (43) η S o l a r H y d r o g e n = η S o l a r c o n v e r s i o n × η H y b r i d c h e m i c a l H y d r o g e n = [ η S o l a r t o t h e r m o + η S o l a r t o e l e c t r o ] × [ η T h e r m o − i n d u c e d e l e c t r o c h e m + η E l e c t r o − i n d u c e d t h e r m o c h e m ] (In the utilization of the splitting sunlight) (44) η S o l a r H y d r o g e n = η S o l a r c o n v e r s i o n × η H y b r i d c h e m i c a l H y d r o g e n = [ η S o l a r t o t h e r m o × η S o l a r t o e l e c t r o ] × [ η T h e r m o − i n d u c e d e l e c t r o c h e m + η E l e c t r o − i n d u c e d t h e r m o c h e m ] (In the utilization of the full spectrum sunlight). The η Hybrid chemical Hydrogen, including η Thermo−induced electrochem and η Electro−induced thermochem, was ∼80%–90% for the hybrid chemical reaction of the water splitting to hydrogen in our experiments, which is a regular record for the water electrolysis. The total solar efficiency can be predicted and estimated for the solar water plus sulfide splitting system to hydrogen as follows: η Solar Hydrogen ≈15% for the utilization of the full spectrum sunlight to individual unit and ∼63% in the utilization of the splitting sunlight to several bands used by individual unit. The accurate efficiency, based on the local solar parameters and testing conditions, needs to be determined in ongoing research. For a comparison of previous researches, both the overall solar utilization efficiency and chemical reaction efficiency are a big jump. A representative system in the single photocatalytic water splitting was reported only in currently highest efficiency of 1.1%. For the simultaneous system for the hydrogen generation and the wastewater treatment [29], the reported efficiencies in some papers [30] were evaluated in the less than 10%. In addition, the coupled solar heat and remediated alternative have enhanced the performance of this solar system. This is not reported in other systems."
15,A perspective of the system application,"3.7 A perspective of the system application For a full understanding of the pattern, a schematic perspective is presented for the future application of the solar-enabled wastewater treatment and simultaneous hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 16 . The system consists of the solar tower, solar reactor cell, PV module array, hydrogen collector, and wastewater input and clean water output facilities (reservoir and user). The solar tower serves as a central reactor cell receiving the focused sunlight, which uses an array of flat, movable heliostats to concentrate the solar rays upon a collector tower (reactor). Condensed solar thermal is employed for heating the wastewater. T systems will be in operation by using molten salts (potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate) as the working fluids. These working fluids have high heat capacity, which can be used for the energy storage to heat wastewater. These designs also allow power to be generated when the sun is not shining. The wastewater, exchanged in high heat capacity of molten salts, can be operated in more than 100 °C, even at the critical water temperature. The high-temperature system will obtain extremely high efficiencies in the solar utilization and the thermo-electrochemical water-splitting production/pollutant oxidation. The PV module array on the ground powers the solar reactor cell on the top. The wastewater from the oil refinery complexes and oil fields can directly be pumped to the solar tower. The clean hot water was output to the user or family. The hydrogen gas is collected and incorporated into the city hydrogen station as vehicle fuel."
16,A brief technical-economic analysis of the solar system,"3.8 A brief technical-economic analysis of the solar system The solar system is mainly composed of solar energy conversion subsystem and solar chemical subsystem. The system is fully driven by the renewable solar energy. The industrial wastewater is input to produce the useful hydrogen. Wastewater is simultaneously treated. The core investment cost is in a large proportion for the solar energy conversion system equipment. The solar conversion facilities, including the solar-electric unit (PV module) and solar-thermal unit (heat concentrator) are mature in the technology and are available in the commercial market. The reactor can be made of the ordinary metal with the low equipment investment. The equipment and technology are is very feasible. The operation cost of the system is also very low. There is no need for raw materials, only labor and maintenance costs. From the perspective of energy and environment, the utilization of solar energy and industrial wastewater is contributed for the hydrogen production and wastewater treatment, which is conducive to the new energy and environmental benefits. So, the feasibility and profitability are greatly positive for the solar system (the detailed data is attached in the SI)."
17,Conclusions,"Based on the theoretical framework of the STEP model and the enhanced strategy, a new solar system was proposed and constructed for efficient solar-enabled hydrogen production and water treatment by capturing renewable solar energy and S2− shuttle-electron donors provided by troublesome wastewater. One solar technology enables simultaneously to resolve two problems. Two strategies, solar thermal action plus the alternative electron donor, were implemented for enhanced the solar system. The system functionalizes a preferential change of the anode reaction (sulfide oxidation) and a great fall of the electrolysis potential. The theoretical calculation displays that such an approach is beneficial to lowering the electrolytic potential by an alternative sulfide shuttle-electron donor and solar thermal induction for overcoming the energy required for the endothermic water-splitting redox. It was successfully operated for hydrogen production and desulfurization with high efficiency under an applied bias of 0.6V–0.8V, which is comparable with the sole water-splitting required bias of at least 1.5V. The experimental results indicated the alternative oxidation half-reaction, dominated the sulfide-to-sulfate coupling instead of the H2O-to-O2 anodic oxidation. The factor-controlling experiments illustrated that the sulfide donor and solar thermal utilization were dominant factors for highly efficient hydrogen generation and sulfide oxidation. In the solar hybrid chemical system under outdoor sunlight, remarkable solar energy utilization was achieved in the high hydrogen production and sulfide conversion efficiency the reaching of 0.25 mL/h H2 and 93% S2− to SO 4 2 − , considerably more than that of the direct electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen (nearly no evolution) under the same applied bias (>1.2V). The mechanism demonstrated that the positive response was a result of the alternative oxidation half-reaction and the complete thermal-induced oxidation of sulfide to sulfate. The system is a green, efficient, and sustainable process to enable, hydrogen generation and water treatment, fully facilitated by solar energy."
