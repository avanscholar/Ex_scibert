0,Introduction,"Human’s daily life and production activities are closely related to the surrounding environmental components. In 2013, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a study on air quality in Europe, which showed that the VOCs reduce life expectancy (by an average of 8.6 months) [1]. If the human body inhales VOCs for a long time, it will cause damage to the nervous system and hematopoietic function, or even lead to life-threatening diseases such as cancer [2–5]. Therefore, in recent years, the realization of qualitative and quantitative analysis of various VOCs have become the research focus of many scholars [6–9]. It can improve the gas-sensing performance by controlling the nanostructures [10–12], doping with two-dimensional nanomaterials [13], modifying by precious metal nanoparticles [14–16] and forming heterojunction [17,18]. However, the serious cross-sensitivity problem has not been solved. Therefore, the dynamic measurement method is introduced. The application of periodic heating waves [19,20] is one of the most commonly used method [21–23]. Essentially, the measurement temperature is modulated by changing the ratio of heating waves, duty period, and other influencing factors [24]. After contacting the VOCs, gas-sensing materials generate different dynamic response signals at periodic operating temperatures. However, the identification of homologous gases with the same functional group is a difficult issue for traditional dynamic measurement method. As a result, dynamic interval temperature modulation mode is proposed. In dynamic interval temperature modulation mode, although the period is different, the dynamic response signals can be steadily obtained for the tested VOCs under the same wave [25,26]. The unsaturated signals refer to that under the same experimental conditions, the dynamic response signals of some VOCs present a state of gradually rising in a continuous period. An inadequate temperature range will lead to the unsaturated signals in the measurement [27] as well as the similar dynamic response at different concentrations. In other words, the characteristic peak of the dynamic response signals will have the similar amplitudes and positions. At the same time, the amplitudes and positions of characteristic peak are the main judgment of pattern recognition. The unsaturated signals lead to errors in qualitative and quantitative analysis of alcohol homologue gases, which led to the wrong estimation in dealing with the leakage of VOCs. In order to solve the above issues, the dynamic interval temperature modulation mode is adopted in this paper. By changing the period of triangular heating wave, the appropriate period is obtained. The calibration of the operating temperature in different periods is measured by the thermocouple. At the end, the decision tree classification algorithm is used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the four alcohol homologues gases."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of nanomaterials and fabrication of sensors,"2.1 Synthesis of nanomaterials and fabrication of sensors In this paper, ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by the hydrothermal method [28]. First, 1.1 g Zn(AC)2 were dissolved in 30 mL absolute ethyl alcohol, and 0.6 g urea were dissolved in 30 mL distilled water. Second, the two standard solutions were ultrasonic, stirred, hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 6 h to obtain the suspension and centrifuged to get white sediment. Absolute ethyl alcohol and distilled water were used for washing alternately. The precipitated products were left for 6 h in an oven at 80 °C to form white powder. Finally, the white powder was sintered in a crucible at 800 °C in a muff furnace for 3 h to get ZnO nanoparticles. The manufacturing process of metal oxide gas sensor has been introduced in previous studies [29]. The prepared ZnO nanomaterials, 17.25 mg, were placed in a small centrifuge tube, 38 μl of absolute ethyl alcohol were dropped with a gel head droplet, followed by ultrasonic for 3 min until the suspension presented white turbidity emulsion. There is a gold electrode on the cylindrical ceramic tube, and then the white turbidity emulsion was evenly wrapped on the ceramic tube. The signals were transmitted through the gold electrode for the tested VOCs."
3,Construction of gas sensitivity measurement platform,"2.2 Construction of gas sensitivity measurement platform The laboratory's gas measurement platform is shown in Fig. 1. The experimental platform is mainly composed of seven parts: programmable DC power supply DP832A (manufactured by RIGOL Technologies), precision source/measure unit B2902A (manufactured by KEYSIGHT Technologies), computer, gas cylinder, gas chamber, thermocouple and seven types of sample gases. Programmable DC power supply is used for heating resistance wire and applying periodic heating waves, which can display the current heating voltage and current information in real time. The precise source/measurement unit is used for acquiring real-time dynamic response signals of the ZnO gas sensor to different VOCs, and transmitting the data to a computer for subsequent pattern recognition. The precision source/measure unit can measure output current of pA level, which can fully meet the current accuracy of a level of μA in the experiment. The composition of synthetic air in the cylinder is 79% N2 and 21% O2. It is used for cleaning the gas chamber and eliminating the interference from other impurities. The thermocouple is used to measure the real-time temperature change at both ends of the gold electrode. The accuracy of thermocouple is 0.1 °C, which can meet the requirements of the experiment. The sample gases are 100% pure (made by TianJin FUYU Chemical)."
4,Experimental measurement process,"2.3 Experimental measurement process The ZnO gas sensor was aged for 48 h. Before each experiment, dry synthetic air was injected within 60 s to eliminate interference. The tested gas was injected into the gas chamber with a syringe, and DP832A applied periodic heating waves. After the real-time dynamic response signals collected by B2902A were stabilized, the signals were collected and transmitted to the computer. After the experiment, the synthetic air was used to exhaust the VOCs in the air chamber. The unsaturation phenomenon can be solved in this experiment by adjusting the interval temperature. A periodic heating triangular wave of 2–6 V was used in the experiment. First, the 100 ppm benzene, acetone, formaldehyde and the alcohol homologues gases of ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and n-butyl alcohol were measured using a triangle wave with the symmetry of 50% and the period of 20 s (TW-1). After that, under the condition of same basic periodic heating wave, 10 s period 50% symmetry (TW-2), 30 s period 50% symmetry (TW-3), 35 s period 57% symmetry (TW-4) were adopted to measure the above four alcohol homologue gases, respectively. In order to prove that the ZnO gas sensor is indeed responsive to the seven types of VOCs, we measured in air under the TW4. During the test process, the thermocouple was fixed on the ZnO gas sensor to measure the real-time operating temperature of different periods. The temperature information was collected in the third period after stabilization, and the average value of the three measurements was calculated. Finally, the concentration gradient measurement with 100–400 ppm of the four alcohol homologues gases were carried out under the experiment conditions using a triangle wave with the TW-4. In order to ensure the reliability of the experimental data, data were collected from the sixth period in each experiment for later pattern recognition. Each experiment was repeated three times and the errors of periodic dynamic response signals were no more than 5 μA."
5,Experimental results and discussion,
6,Characterization and stability of ZnO nanomaterials,"3.1 Characterization and stability of ZnO nanomaterials Multilayer porous flake ZnO nanoparticles were successfully prepared by hydrothermal method. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of ZnO nanomaterials with calcination at 800 °C for 5 h has shown in Fig. 2. The results indicated that the porous structure exhibits large specific surface area, a large number of active sites, high interfacial charge transfer efficiency and good permeability [30]. This structure is conducive to the adsorption and desorption of VOCs on ZnO nanoparticles. The experimental results also prove that ZnO nanomaterials have good conductivity and response to several VOCs. The gas sensitive response values of 100 ppm ethyl alcohol at 250 °C were tested over 30 days at 5 days interval as shown in the Fig. 3. It can be seen that the stability of the ZnO gas sensor is good."
7,Effects of different period lengths of alcohol homologues gases,"3.2 Effects of different period lengths of alcohol homologues gases TW-2 was used to measure 100 ppm various VOCs at 2–6 V. The B2902A, which as a part of the laboratory's gas measurement platform, can fully acquires real-time output current of the ZnO gas sensor to different VOCs. At the same time, the DP832A is used for applying periodic heating waves. The output current represents the response of ZnO gas sensitive materials to different VOCs when the heating temperature changes periodically. The output current of different types and concentrations of VOCs is different, so as to identify VOCs. The dynamic response signals curves were shown in Fig. 4. The dynamic response signals curves of ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and n-butyl alcohol were shown in Fig. 5. The experimental results show that the dynamic response signals of benzene, acetone and formaldehyde by ZnO gas sensor can reach saturation. The dynamic response signal is extremely unsaturated when measuring the four alcohol homologue gases, which leads to errors in distinguishing the alcohol homologues gases. Therefore, the influence of different periods of triangular waves for alcohol homologue gases were explored, as shown in Figs. 6–8. As can be seen from Fig. 6, when the triangular wave period is 10 s, the dynamic response signals are more unstable compared with a period of 20 s, where the curve shows a periodic rising trend. The symmetry of the triangular waves is not changed, and the period is increased to 30 s, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that when the decreasing time of the triangular wave is 15 s, the four alcohol homologue gases can be completely desorbed in the temperature decreasing process, but the high temperature segment still presents an increasing trend. The response time is also a key index of the dynamic measurement method. Therefore, the falling period of the triangle wave does not change. The rising period is increased from 15 s to 20 s. The dynamic response signals as shown in Fig. 8. The heating and cooling processes of ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and n-butyl alcohol were measured by ZnO gas sensor without unsaturation phenomenon. With the same experimental conditions as Fig. 8, we measured in the air, and the dynamic response signal is shown in Fig. 9. We can conclude that ZnO does respond to seven kinds of VOCs."
8,Interval temperature ranges with different period lengths,"3.3 Interval temperature ranges with different period lengths In the periodic heating mode, the heating voltage, amplitude, period and symmetry will affect the dynamic response signal of gas sensor to various VOCs, and the essential factor is temperatures [24]. As can be seen from Fig. 10, although periodic heating triangular wave with the same voltage amplitude are applied, different periods have a different influence on the interval temperature. When the heating period of the triangle wave is 10 s, the interval temperature range is between 270 and 370 °C. The interval temperature rises from 210° to 400°C when the triangle wave period is increased to 20 s, when the period is 30 s, the corresponding working temperature range is 190–430 °C. With the prolongation of the period of the triangular wave, the reaction between alcohol homologue gases and ZnO nanomaterials has reached saturation completely. As shown in Fig. 10d. When the temperature is lower than 180 °C and higher than 460 °C in the dynamic test, the hydroxyl groups of alcohols can completely react with the oxygen negative ions. It makes the energy at working temperature match the energy needed for alcohol chemical reaction, thus solving the unsaturated phenomenon. Considering the power consumption of the sensor is a significant factor, the optimal interval temperature range selected by experiment is 180–460 °C."
9,Reaction mechanism of interval temperature modulation mode,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of interval temperature modulation mode The response mechanism of MOS gas sensor can be illustrated as follows: When ZnO gas sensor is exposed to air, electrons are captured by oxygen molecules from the conduction band of ZnO, resulting in a decrement of the electron concentration, a thicker depletion layer, and an increment of the resistance. Oxygen molecules in the air are adsorbed on the surface of materials in the form of oxygen negative ions (O2 -, O- and O2-) [18]. Under constant temperature, there will be an equilibrium of three kinds of oxygen ions. However, the change of temperature will directly affect the morphology of oxygen negative ions on the surface of nanomaterials. When the working temperature is lower than 100 °C, all oxygen molecules are dissociated into O2 -; when the temperature is between 100 and 300 °C, all O2 - disappears and turns into O-; when the temperature is higher than 300 °C, the oxygen molecules are all dissociated into O2-. The above rule can be proved by TPD, FTIR and ESR [22]. When the tested VOCs are injected, the target molecules will react with adsorbed oxygen to generate CO2 and H2O, while the captured electrons will return to the conduction band. The absorbed oxygen can be converted into each other at a proper temperature. The capability and recovery rate of the gas capture hole determine the response of the sensor film in different gas environments. At different temperatures, different gases to be measured react with different adsorbed oxygen. In this way, the main oxygen ion state can be regulated and the response characteristics of specific gas can be regulated, which is also the fundamental reason for the obvious improvement of the selectivity of ZnO gas sensor. The response time is defined as the time required to reach 90% of the steady-state output resistance. The recovery time is defined as the time required from steady state to 90% of the initial resistance. As shown in Fig. 11, when ZnO gas sensor contacts with 100 ppm benzene, 100 ppm acetone and 100 ppm formaldehyde, the resistance has a straight downward trend with fast response time. The reason may be that the benzene ring, ketone carbonyl group and aldehyde group with oxygen negative ions are one step reaction with quick response, and the temperature is less affected. As shown in Fig. 12, for the 100 ppm four alcohol homologue gases with hydroxyl groups, the resistance shows a trend of slow down. The adsorption energy of ZnO for 7 VOCs is based on the Forsite module of Materials Studio. Firstly, the structure of ZnO was optimized by Smart Algorithm. Secondly, the adsorption energy was simulated by the energy of the ZnO (1 1 1) surface with 7 VOCs molecule. As shown in Fig. 13, the adsorption energy of ZnO for all the four alcohol homologues is around 2 eV, while that for benzene, acetone and formaldehyde is above 3.7 eV. Alcohol homologues gases exist hydroxyl group, which on the H and O. The electronegativity of O is higher than H and the ability to attract electrons is very strong. The electrons in the hydrogen-oxygen bond are heavily biased towards O, resulting in the polarity of the hydrogen-oxygen bond, so it is easy to break and form O ions and H ions. In the process, other products will appear. Literature shows that for ethanol, part of it can react with adsorbed oxygen to directly produce CO2 and water. Most of it will lose H ions due to being captured by adsorbent oxygen. Three intermediates CH3CH2O−, CH3CO− and CH3COO− are also generated when the CO2 is generated [31]. Acetone can be quantitatively converted to CO2 in the absence of intermediates [25]. Therefore, the greater the adsorption energy, the faster the reaction of VOCs and oxygen ions at different temperatures can reach the saturation state. For alcohol homologues gases, due to the existence of hydroxyl group, it is slow for alcohol homologues gases and oxygen ions in different temperature states to reach saturation state, so there is a higher requirement of temperature modulation range for identifying alcohol homologues gases."
10,Qualitative and quantitative analysis of alcohol homologue gases,"3.5 Qualitative and quantitative analysis of alcohol homologue gases According to the previous experiments, the ZnO gas sensor achieves saturation with a periodic heating triangular wave at TW-4. Under the experiment condition, the dynamic measurement concentration gradient curves of 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 300 ppm, 350 ppm and 400 ppm are shown in Fig. 14. The dynamic current trend and the location of characteristic peak of the four alcohol homologues gases are all different. The same VOCs has a similar dynamic response trend and the characteristic peak appears at the same position. When the gas concentration increases, the amplitude also increases. There are several ways of pattern recognition [32–35]. In this paper, it can completely realize the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the four alcohol homologue gases through data preprocessing and decision tree classification algorithm. In the experiment, five cycles of sample data were obtained at each concentration of each gas, and seven concentration gradients of four alcohol homologues were tested. There was a total of 140 samples, of which 30% were used as training sets and 70% were used as validation sets. The optimal values of the three parameters are max-depth= 5, min-samples-leaf= 1 and min-samples-split= 4, which are got by drawing the learning curve. The recognition rate of the qualitative and quantitative analysis for ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and n-butyl alcohol reached 97.62%."
11,Conclusions,"In this paper, the Detection of Four Alcohol Homologue Gases by ZnO Gas Sensor in Dynamic Interval Temperature Modulation Mode is realized. The results reveal that the dynamic response signals of different VOCs vary in the various temperature range. Benzene, acetone and formaldehyde have achieved saturation based on a periodic heating triangular wave with a period of 20 s and a symmetry of 50%. However, under the same experimental conditions, there is unsaturation phenomenon for the four alcohol homologue gases with hydroxyl groups. The experiment results show that the alcohol homologue gases can reach saturation with a period of 35 s and a symmetry of 57%. Moreover, thermocouple is equipped to collect the real-time operating temperatures of four triangular waves with different periods. The results show that only when the low temperature is lower than 180 °C and the high temperature is higher than 460 °C, the unsaturation phenomenon can be solved. Under this experimental condition, the four alcohol homologue gases were tested at the concentrations of 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 300 ppm, 350 ppm, 400 ppm. The five samples were collected for each concentration of each gas, with a total of 140 samples. The optimal values of the three parameters are max-depth= 5, min-samples-leaf= 1 and min-samples-split= 4 by drawing the learning curve with the decision tree classification algorithm. The recognition accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis for the four alcohol homologues gases reaches 97.62%."
