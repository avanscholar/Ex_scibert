0,Introduction,"Crude bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis, has unfavourable properties compared to petroleum, such as high acidity, high aromaticity, low stability, and high viscosity, limiting its use as a fuel. The problems arise largely from the high oxygen content and a low effective H/C ratio [1]. In order to create a fungible fuel the bio-oil must undergo an expensive upgrading process that may not be economical. To date the most successful upgrading method is hydrodeoxygenation of the bio-oil. The process seeks a partial removal of oxygen, aiming to increase the stability of the oil and to produce a fuel compatible with petroleum products, or further upgraded in existing petroleum refineries. Upgrading of pyrolysis oils to remove oxygen in order to produce drop-in transport fuels typically requires additional 3–5wt% hydrogen, on a pyrolysis oil feed basis. Using hydrodeoxygenation hydrocarbon yields of between 56 and 58% by weight of bio-oil are possible [2]. However this upgrading technique has many major disadvantages. It requires the pyrolysis vapours to be condensed and then reheated for the treatment, which demands significant energy. Furthermore, problems such as the re-polymerisation of the bio-oil can occur during reheating. Because of rapid catalyst deactivation, and reactor clogging from coke formation, the process is carried out at very low space velocities (0.1–0.2 LHSV), high pressures (70–200bar) [3], moderate temperatures [4] and short run times. Catalytic hydropyrolysis has been investigated as a potential method to try to resolve many of the issues associated with bio-oil upgrading [5,6]. This process involves carrying out the pyrolysis under hydrogen pressure, promoting deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions during pyrolysis. In that way a large secondary batch reactor is not required and the energy requirement is significantly decreased. Hydropyrolysis rapidly adds hydrogen to biomass fragments, removes oxygen, and caps free radicals as soon as the biomass devolatilizes [6]. Oxygen removal is rapid, particularly at elevated hydrogen pressures and with the help of an effective catalyst. Catalytic hydropyrolysis has been shown to remove large amounts of oxygen as both water and CO x , while simultaneously lowering the amount of undesirable acid catalysed polymerisation and coking reactions [7]. Another major advantage of the catalytic hydropyrolysis process is that both the pyrolysis step and the catalytic step, when oxygen is removed and hydrogen is added to the biomass fragments structure, are exothermic. This will reduce/eliminate the need for the recirculation of solid heat carriers required for conventional endothermic pyrolysis [7]. The process is therefore more economically attractive. Pindoria et al. [8] hydropyrolysed eucalyptus in a two stage reactor and found that pressure has a considerable impact on the products arising from the hydropyrolysis of biomass. Mild hydropyrolysis occurred in the first reactor, followed by hydrocracking in the presence of H-ZSM-5 catalyst in the second. That study found a significant decrease in tar yields when the pressure was increased from 10 to 40bar. Tar yields of <10% were obtained at 40bar. HZSM-5 resulted in a substantial increase in light volatiles at both pressures. That suggests that the catalyst promotes cracking reactions to a much greater extent than hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. Cracking reactions are promoted by acidic sites on the catalyst. Rocha et al. [9] have shown that bio-oil that is increasingly aromatic is produced with the removal of oxygen through the hydropyrolysis process. However, the overall extent of the aromatisation is lowered with the increase in the hydrogen pressure because of the production of less char and the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds. During pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere Melligan et al. [10] found that a large portion of the lignin in Miscanthus was converted to char, but with the addition of H2, lignin conversion to low molecular weight phenols was shown to increase, reducing char yields. Single stage hydropyrolysis at pressures of about 10MPa has the ability to reduce the oxygen level to less than half that achievable by conventional fluidised bed pyrolysis [9]. Additional deoxygenation of the bio-oil can be achieved at lower pressures through the incorporation of an appropriate catalyst. Rocha et al. [9] used a FeS catalyst to obtain oxygen contents as low as 11%, and this reaction was carried out at 10MPa. The work presented utilised M. x giganteus as the feedstock for pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis. M. x giganteus, the sterile hybrid between Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus sacchariflorus, is a high yielding perennial energy crop with yields ranging from 4–25t/ha.pa. dry matter in central Europe, to 30–40t/ha.pa. in the warmer climates of southern Europe [11]. Very importantly, Miscanthus can achieve these high yields with very little herbicide control or fertiliser addition, making it a suitable choice for the production of biofuels. The plant can store large amounts of dry matter in the root and rhizomes, and hence is an excellent sequesterer of soil carbon [12]. The work presented is strongly connected with a previous publication by the authors, titled Hydro-pyrolysis of biomass and online catalytic vapour upgrading with Ni-ZSM-5 and MCM-41 [6]. This manuscript continues on from the work in [6] and describes the hydropyrolysis of M. x giganteus at pressures ranging from atmospheric to 30bar. The reactions were also carried out in the presence of 10wt% Ni on ZSM-5 catalyst. ZSM-5 has shown great potential for upgrading pyrolysis vapours by promoting cracking, dehydration and decarboxylation reactions. The addition of nickel to the ZSM-5 the catalyst will promote hydrogenation reactions to a greater extent [6]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation using nickel nitrate. 1.477g of Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma–Aldrich) was added to water, the solution was then added to 5g of ZSM-5 (Alfa Aesar) support, thoroughly mixed, and then dried in an oven at 105°C. This was followed by calcinations in air; samples were heated at 10°C/min up to 450°C with a hold time of 2h."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation XRD analysis was carried out using a Philips X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with nickel filtered KαCu radiation (l =1.542Å) between the X-ray source angles of 10 and 70°. The Ni particle size was determined using the Scherrer equation. Prior to analysis, all samples were ground using a mortar and pestle and then made into self-supporting disks. Specific surface areas and the pore size distributions were measured using a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system. Nitrogen was used as the adsorptive and adsorption was carried out at −196°C. Typically, the sample (100mg) was degassed under vacuum at 200°C for 12h. The BET surface area was determined from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Pore volumes and distribution were calculated from the adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda theory. Nickel content was determined using a Varian SpectrAA Atomic Absorption spectrometer. In preparation for analysis the catalyst was completely dissolved using a concentrated acid solution of aqua regia. A measure of Brönsted acidity was determined using NaCl (aq) as an ion-exchange agent. For this analysis 0.05g of catalyst was added to 40ml of an aqueous solution of 0.1M NaCl and allowed to equilibrate for 24h. The resulting suspension was titrated by the dropwise addition of standardised 0.10M NaOH (aq)."
4,Biomass characterisation,"2.3 Biomass characterisation Miscanthus moisture was determined when constant weight was achieved following oven drying at 105°C. For C, H and N values an Elementar “Vario EL Cube” and hemicelluloses was used as the standard. Oxygen was determined by difference. The higher heating value (HHV) was determined using an oxygen bomb calorimeter 6200 no. 442m (Parr Company), with benzoic acid as the standard. Volatile material associated with the biomass was determined from weight loss on heating for 7min at 900°C, according to the standard procedure CEN/TS 15148:2005. Cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin contents were measured according to ASTM E1758-01."
5,Py-GC/MS,"2.4 Py-GC/MS Pyrolysis was carried out using a CDS Analytical 5200 pyroprobe. This instrument contains two separate reactors: pyrolysis occurs in the first reactor, the second is a catalyst reactor. The general layout of the instrument can be seen in Scheme 1 . For all experiments 1.5mg (±0.01mg) of M. x giganteus was placed in a quartz tube, and a plug of quartz wool was placed above and below the feedstock. Due to the strict sample preparation process the corresponding peak areas of the compounds can be compared and indicate the changes in their yields. Moreover, the relative peak area percentages of the compounds can be used as an indicator of relative changes in composition of the pyrolysis vapours. Catalyst (5mg) was placed in the catalyst reactor. Due to the large amount of catalyst compared to biomass, a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was used in order to distinguish between various process parameters. The GHSV was calculated to be about 240,000h−1. Prior to all reactions the catalysts were reduced at 400°C under a flow of 40cm3/min of H2 for 2h. Pyrolysis was carried out under a flow of either H2 or He. The heating rate was 20°C/ms and the biomass was then held at 600°C for 20s. After pyrolysis the vapours passed through the catalyst reactor, which was held at 300°C. All product vapours from the catalytst reactor were trapped on a Tenax adsorption column (held at 30°C). Tenax is a porous polymer based on 2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide, which is highly efficient at adsorbing a wide range of compounds with molecular weights between 40 and 310. The adsorption column was then rapidly heated to 280°C; this will readily desorb all of all compounds within the molecular weight range mentioned above. The vapours were passed directly to the GC/MS (Agilent GC 7890A and Agilent MS 5975C). The chromatographic separation was carried out using an RTX-5MS capillary column (30m×0.25mm i.d., 0.25μm film thickness). Helium (CP grade) was used as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 15.28cm3/min and a 1:50 split ratio. The oven temperature was programmed from 30°C (10min hold time) to 280°C at the heating rate of 5°C/min and a final hold time of 10min. The injector temperature was kept at 280°C and the GC/MS interface was held at 250°C. The mass spectrometer was operated in EI mode at 70eV and the mass spectra were obtained from m/z 40 to 400 with a scan rate of 500amu/s. Identification of chromatographic peaks was determined according to the NIST MS library, and in cases where low probabilities were indicated by the library, identifications were made by examining the individual mass spectra. Experiments were carried out at least three times in order to confirm the reproducibility of the procedures. Peak areas were determined from peak integration from the total ion chromotagrams. Peak area percentages are based on the total area of the ion chromatogram. The error bars presented on all graphs represents the range in the peak area percentages from all experiments under the same conditions. Analytical pyrolysis can provide a substantial amount of useful information. However, there are some drawbacks to this technique. The products cannot be collected, so the exact amount of bio-oil cannot be determined. However, the peak area can be considered to be linear with the quantity, so the change in the total peak area will give a good indication to the change in the amount of bio-oil produced under the different reaction conditions. For further details about the pyroprobe reactor and its limitations the reader should refer to a previous paper by the author [6]."
6,Properties of catalysts,"2.5 Properties of catalysts Table 1 shows some properties of ZSM-5 (C1) and ZSM-5 with 10% Ni (C2). As expected, a decrease in the surface area and pore volume occurred with the addition of the Ni to the support The SiO2:Al2O3 ratio for the ZSM-5 is 23:1; therefore it is mildly acidic. A more detailed characterisation of the catalyst can be found elsewhere [6]."
7,Properties of M. x giganteus,2.6 Properties of M. x giganteus Presented in Table 2 are some of the properties of M. x giganteus which are important with respect to its potential as a feedstock for pyrolysis and the subsequent production of bio-oil.
8,Results from Py-GC–MS,
9,Effect of hydrogen pressure on the quantity of pyrolysis vapours,"3.1 Effect of hydrogen pressure on the quantity of pyrolysis vapours Fig. 1 shows the total chromatographic peak areas for the different treatments. As expected, the total peak area decreased with the increase in hydrogen pressure and with the incorporation of the catalysts to the system. That is attributable to the promotion of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions which will result in the production of higher levels of CO2 and H2O. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that under the most severe reaction conditions (20bar H2, with the catalyst) there was approximately a 65% decrease in the total peak area. That indicates that almost complete deoxygenation had occurred as the pyrolysis vapours were comprised primarily of hydrocarbons, which can be seen in the subsequent results."
10,Effect of pressure on chromatograms,"3.2 Effect of pressure on chromatograms Fig. 2 shows selected chromatograms to illustrate how the different treatments used for pyrolysis affect the composition of product vapours, a list of the compounds detected in the highest quantities are presented in Table 3 (with corresponding reference numbers). An important difference observed with the various treatments is the decrease in the level of the higher molecular weight compounds; this is particularly evident as the H2 pressure increased and with the addition of the catalyst. In the He atmosphere a portion of the vapours is composed of compounds with molecular weights of up to 190g/mol (Fig. 2A), however at 20bar H2 pressure with the catalyst (Fig. 2D) most of the detected compounds have a molecular weight less than 140g/mol. Furthermore, the type of compounds identified varies considerably, addition of the catalyst and at increased H2 pressure deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions are promoted, resulting in an increase in the level of saturated hydrocarbons. It is also noteworthy the presence of the series of long chain alkanes resulting from the introduction of H2 to the system, this series becomes more evident as the H2 pressure increases and is most prominent at 20bar in the absence of the catalyst. This is evident from the series of peaks found in Fig. 2C after a residence time of 30min. The first peak in the series was identified as Tridecane (C13), followed by tetradecane (C14), pentadecane (C15), hexadecane (C16) and heptadecane (C17), respectively. This homologous series was not present when the catalyst was used, due to the cracking of the long chains to form low molecular weight species."
11,Effect of pressure on the level of carboxylic acids,"3.3 Effect of pressure on the level of carboxylic acids Carboxylic acids are major components of bio-oil produced during biomass pyrolysis, and in many cases ethanoic acid makes up in excess of 15wt% of the bio-oil, resulting in a low pH. The reactivities of carboxylic acids give rise to many undesirable reactions, such as polymerisation reactions which occur during storage. Before the bio-oil can be used as a fuel or as fuel additive, carboxylic acids must be removed, or at least their contents should be significantly lowered. The most effective way to deal with this problem is to inhibit the production of the acids, or to remove them during the bio-oil production stage. Fig. 3 shows the effects of the catalyst and of hydrogen pressure on the production of ethanoic acid. There is about a 20% decrease in the level of ethanoic acid as the pressure is increased from atmospheric pressure to 10bar. This decrease becomes much more evident as the pressure is increased above 10bar, and the conversion of ethanoic acid is complete at a hydrogen pressure of 20bar. When the Ni on ZSM-5 catalyst is introduced into the system a much lower hydrogen pressure is required to eliminate ethanoic acid from the pyrolysis product. This result shows that the metal and acid sites present on the support play an important role in the decarboxylation of the ethanoic acid, hence the reduced hydrogen pressure required for the removal of the acid from the pyrolysis vapours. The primary degradation products in the presence of both H2 and the catalysts are likely to be CO2, and lighter components which are not detected by GC/MS. Other products resulting from the degradation of ethanoic acid are water and coke [13]. Gayubo et al. [14] observed that deoxygenation of ethanoic acid occurs mainly via a decarboxylation reaction pathway, and to a much lesser extent by dehydration."
12,Effect of pressure on the level of phenols,"3.4 Effect of pressure on the level of phenols Volatile monomeric phenolic compounds, from the degradation of both lignin and holocellulose, are major products arising from the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. The possible reaction pathway for phenol formation is shown in [6] and the conversion of phenols is shown in Scheme 2 . Problems arise from the pyrolysis of lignin in a non-hydrogen donor atmosphere. These include low liquid yields, and high coke formation which gives rise to rapid clogging of the reactor and the blocking of any catalyst sites which may be present. When lignin is pyrolised in a hydrogen atmosphere, much higher conversion rates and greater yields of oil are obtained [15]. The effect of hydrogen pressure on the phenolic compounds, present in the greatest amounts are shown in Fig. 4a and b. These results show that an increase in hydrogen pressure from atmospheric to 10bar gives rise to an increase in the overall yields of lower molecular weight phenols confirming the results from Pandey et al. [15] who demonstrated that hydrogen plays an important role in the degradation of lignin. The presented results indicate that nickel present on the catalyst increases the depolymerisation of lignin and lignols to form monomeric phenols. It is evident that Ni has a large role in these reactions than acidic sites present on the ZSM-5. A further increase in hydrogen pressure results in a slight decrease in the yields of phenol because hydrogenolysis reactions are promoted and aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons are formed. The changes in aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. The removal of the hydroxyl group from phenol can be achieved either by direct elimination of the hydroxyl group by hydrogenolysis or by thermal dehydration of a saturated or partly saturated cyclic alcohol formed by the addition of H2 to the aromatic ring [16]. The conversion of phenols is further promoted by the presence of the Ni on ZSM-5 catalyst. Hydrogenolysis of phenols to form aromatic hydrocarbons is favoured by high nickel loadings and elevated temperatures (approx. 300°C) [17]. Compounds detected that can be related to reactions involving phenols include derivatives of cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, cyclohexene, and cyclohexane. The reaction mechanism responsible for these compounds is shown in Scheme 3 . It is expected that, with the increase in hydrogen pressure and the incorporation of the catalyst, the rate of lignin degradation will increase and that the amount of pyrolytic lignin will decrease. This will result in an increase in the bio-oil yield and may decrease the average molecular weight of the bio-oil."
13,Effect of pressure on the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons,"3.5 Effect of pressure on the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons The formation of compounds such as benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) is important because these compounds are excellent platform chemicals and fuels. BTX have shown to significantly increase the octane number of petroleum fuels. However, because of its carcinogenicity, there are stringent regulations regarding the use of benzene [18,19]. Fig. 5 shows the effects of both hydrogen pressure and the 10% Ni on ZSM-5 catalyst on the major aromatic compounds. Substantial changes arising from the increase in pressure in the absence of the catalyst were observed for toluene, ethyl-benzene and ethyl-methyl-benzene. Less significant differences were observed for the other compounds. The extent of hydrogenation of the aromatic compounds increased in the presence of the catalyst. The properties of the support play an important role in the hydrogenation. An enhancement of the hydrogenation rate is known to occur in the presence of metals supported on an acidic support, such as zeolite compared to non-acidic supports, such as silica (Aleksandra et al. [20]). A suggested explanation is that compounds adsorbed on the acid sites of the support, in the metal–acid region, could be further hydrogenated (Chou et al. [21]). The hydrogenation of benzene is the most probable reaction mechanism for the formation of cyclohexane (Scheme 3). Hydrogenation of benzene is typically carried out at 20bar of hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 300 to 350°C in the presence of either Ni, Pd or Pt catalysts Halligudi et al. [22]."
14,Effect of pressure on the yields of cyclo-alkanes,"3.6 Effect of pressure on the yields of cyclo-alkanes Cyclic hydrocarbons are high energy density compounds and are well established as excellent fuels, so increasing the yield of cycloalkanes is important for the formation of a high quality bio-oil. Some of the possible reaction pathways for the formation of cyclohexane are presented in Scheme 3, and the effect of both pressure and the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst is shown in Fig. 6. The results show that hydrogen pressure plays an important role in the hydrogenation to cycloalkanes of the aromatic compounds. It is evident that all the reaction pathways shown in Scheme 4 are active to some extent. However, due to the presence of much larger quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkanes than of cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and cyclohexene derivatives (many of which were detected in small amounts) at all pressures, the most active reaction pathway appears to be the direct removal of the hydroxyl group from phenol to form benzene, followed by the complete hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. While acid sites play a role in the conversion of phenols to aromatics, they have very little activity in the hydrogenation of the aromatics, however Fig. 6 shows that Ni is much more active in the hydrogenation of aromatics to saturated cyclohexane derivatives, this was also observed by Masalska et al. [23] who investigated the hydrogenation of toluene with Ni on ZSM-5. This investigation also found that by increasing the number of brÖnsted acid site the level of side reaction increased. Methyl cyclopentane is one of the side products from the hydrogenation of benzene. This can be attributable to the acidity of the ZSM-5 [24]. However, it is expected that the largest amount of cyclopentane derivatives are produced from the conversion of cyclopenten-1-one derivatives. These derivatives are produced in large quantities during the pyrolysis of both cellulose, and to an even greater extent of hemicelluloses [25]. The effect of H2 pressure is shown if Fig. 7 . Cyclopenten-1one can be hydrogenated to form cyclopentanones as intermediate products in the formation of cyclopentane derivatives. Wang et al. [26] have shown that it is possible to produce cyclopentane through the hydrodeoxygenation of cyclopentanone, with over 70% selectivety in the presence of a Ni supported catalyst. Biomass contains large amounts of both C5 and C6 sugars. The overall reaction mechanism for the hydrogenolysis of sugars is complex, and is complicated further by interactions with lignin. From the hydrothermal processing of cellulose and hemicelluloses, compounds such as furans, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are produced. Furfural is one of the major products from the pentoses, and it can undergo decarbonylation and hydrogenation reactions to form alcohols, such as butanol and pentanol. Suggested reaction pathways are presented in Scheme 4. Reduction of aldehydes and ketones from the dehydration of levoglucosan will also give rise to alcohols. Fig. 8 shows how pressure influences the production of low molecular weight alcohols. A significant increase in the production of both butanol and pentanol takes place with an increase in hydrogen pressure. However, in the presence of the Ni/ZSM-5 the alcohols undergo dehydration and reduction to form the corresponding alkenes and alkanes. Due to the complexity of the pyrolysis vapour composition it was very difficult to achieve good separation between the alkenes and their corresponding alkanes. However, from the MS of the peaks it is evident that both were present, although the exact peak area of each was not determined. The yields of butene/butane and pentene/pentane are presented in Fig. 9 . In the absence of the catalyst only trace amounts of these light aliphatic compounds were detected. The dehydration/reduction of alcohols may have a negative effect on the liquid fuel properties of the bio-oil and also reduce liquid yields. Addition of alcohols to bio-oil has been shown to improve the viscosity and stability, and to lower the rate of ageing (Diebold et al. [27]). Alcohols can be excellent additives to petroleum fuels. They result in an increase of the octane number of most fuels. The formation of low molecular weight aliphatic compounds will decrease the yields of liquid fuel; it will result in a high energy density fuel, with HHV in excess of 45MJ/kg."
15,Conclusions,"The rates of hydrodeoxygenation reactions and the extents of hydrogenation increase with an increase in hydrogen pressure and with the incorporation of the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The overall effect from the promotion of these reactions is a significant increase in the HHV of the condensable products, attributable to the removal of a large portion of oxygen and the addition of hydrogen to many of the compounds. Other important changes include the removal of ethanoic acid and a lowering of the average molecular weight of the products. Using hydrogen during pyrolysis has also been shown to increase the degradation of lignin."
