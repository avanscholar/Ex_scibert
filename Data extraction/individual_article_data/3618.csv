0,Introduction,"The solar driven splitting of water offers a potential source of renewable H2, but the efficiency and scalability of current solar based methods are inadequate as alternatives to fossil derived H2. This has spurred research into microorganisms that convert water into H2 and O2 using solar energy (Kruse and Hankamer, 2010; Quintana et al., 2011; Schütz et al., 2004). The use of solar energy for the biological production of H2 can be divided into two stages: an aerobic photosynthetic stage leading to accumulation of energy storage macromolecules such as starch (in green algae) or glycogen (in cyanobacteria), followed by anaerobic catabolism of these storage molecules by metabolic reactions that provide intracellular reductant for H2 production (Prince and Kheshgi, 2005). One biological route to hydrogen production is by fermentation of the cells own carbohydrate reserves, so-called autofermentation. This form of metabolism occurs under conditions where light and oxygen are not available and accordingly the cell is incapable of oxidative- or photo-phosphorylation for ATP generation. Microalgae have also attracted significant attention for their potential use as biodiesel and biomass feedstocks (Chisti, 2007; Williams and Laurens, 2010). Energy demands on the cell such as macromolecule repair, maintenance of ion gradients, and osmolyte synthesis require ATP which is produced by substrate level phosphorylation in the glycolytic reactions, along with NADH (Lehninger, 1982). This NADH must be recycled to NAD+ for the reactions of glycolysis to continue, and one such route to NADH oxidation is by the bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Tamagnini et al., 2002; Carrieri et al., 2011). This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to H2 coupled to the regeneration of NAD+. It is not present in all cyanobacteria genomes (Bartacek et al., 2007). The cyanobacterium studied here, Arthrospira maxima sp. CS-328 (A. maxima), exhibits the highest known rate and yield of autofermentative H2 production reported to date among the cyanobacteria (up to 36mL of H2/g dry weight and a maximum 18% H2 in the headspace) (Ananyev et al., 2008). The maximal yield of reductant generated during acetogenic fermentation through glycolysis alone (absence of any respiratory electron acceptors) is four equivalents of NADH and four equivalents of ATP per glucose catabolized to 2 acetates: (1) C6H12O6 +4NAD+ +4ADP+4Pi +2H2O→4NADH+4H+ +4ATP+2CH3COOH+2CO2 This maximum yield of 4 NADH per glucose, known as the Thauer limit (Thauer et al., 1977), is one third of the theoretical yield of 12 NAD(P)H if each glucose were to be completely oxidized by the enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, which has never been achieved in vivo. However, in vitro reconstitution of the 13 enzymes of the OPP pathway has been demonstrated to produce this maximum yield (Woodward et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2007). Recent work by our group has demonstrated that nitrate can induce a switch to the OPP pathway during autofermentation (Ananyev et al., submitted for publication). H2 production by autofermentation is termed indirect biophotolysis, as reductant powering the evolution of H2 originates from previously accumulated carbohydrate reserves (glycogen, osmolytes and soluble sugars) rather than directly from water. This process differs from direct photolysis (usually catalyzed by an [FeFe]-hydrogenase found in some eukaryotes, e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) where reductant originating from water is directly transferred from PSII through PSI to the hydrogenase (Hallenbeck, 2005; Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Indirect biophotolysis has an advantage over the direct route when the O2 sensitivity of hydrogenase is considered. Because indirect biophotolysis occurs in the dark, O2 production by PSII is circumvented. To date, algal systems performing direct biophotolysis have had to utilize harsh methods to inactivate PSII (e.g. by sulphur deprivation (Ghirardi et al., 2007) or copper cations (Surzycki et al., 2007)) or selectively excite PSI through the use of infrared illumination (Meuser et al., 2011). The bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by the hox gene cluster) is the only hydrogen metabolizing enzyme in A. maxima. It is constitutively expressed at a constant level, but reversibly inactivated by O2; its activity is restored immediately upon the onset of anaerobiosis. Biotechnologically, hydrogen production by A. maxima is very promising in that: (i) routine headspace H2 accumulation of 10–12% (occasionally up to 18%) is achieved (Ananyev et al., 2008), (ii) at the end of exhaustive autofermentation (7–8days) the culture is still viable and able to be returned to a photobioreactor for another cycle of carbohydrate accumulation (we have demonstrated that at least 3 cycles are possible), and (iii) the H2 yield is dependent upon the initial carbohydrate content of the cells, which can be up to 48% of cell dry weight after nitrate depletion, phosphate depletion, or growth in high salt (above 1M NaCl) (Carrieri et al., 2010; Aoyama et al., 1997; Dephilippis et al., 1992). For comparison to non-phototrophic systems, the maximal observed H2 headspace accumulation is 74% from Clostridium spp. (which contains the more efficient [FeFe]-hydrogenase) fermenting on exogenous glucose (Zhang et al., 2006). In Clostridia species, the presence of the gaseous products in the fermentative medium and headspace negatively affect biomass accumulation and H2 production (Alshiyab et al., 2008). Removing CO2 from the headspace (decreasing its partial pressure from 24% to 5%) was shown to increase H2 accumulation by 87% (Park et al., 2005). Various studies of Clostridia have established other key metabolites whose concentration in the culture medium directly affects H2 production: acetic and butyric acids (Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005), ammonia (Salerno et al., 2006), glucose, and initial biomass (Zhang et al., 2006). We note that the higher H2 headspace accumulation by Clostridia is most likely due to the functioning of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase, which operates at a stronger driving force with FDx as its electron donor. Building upon the knowledge gained from studying the Clostridia systems, we have identified secondary metabolites and physiological conditions to increase the autofermentative H2 yield by A. maxima. While other studies have focused on creating transgenic strains where pathways competing with hydrogen production are eliminated (e.g. lactate production (McNeely et al., 2010) and nitrate reduction (Baebprasert et al., 2011)), herein, we focus on manipulating the equilibrium and thermodynamics of the hydrogenase reaction itself. Because the redox couples of NADH/NAD+ and H2/H+ are nearly identical under biological conditions, the reaction equilibrium is especially sensitive to the concentrations of reactants and products. We define “milking” as the act of accelerating the reaction rate by removing the product H2 gas and thereby shifting the equilibrium of the hydrogenase reaction. We use two methods for “milking”: (i) selective removal of H2 gas from the reaction by consuming it with a fuel-type electrochemical cell, and (ii) non-specifically diluting the biomass concentration used for fermentation (along with the spent medium) and as a result, diluting the excreted products, salinity of medium, and extracellular nitrate concentration. Furthermore, we illustrate that by incubating cultures with a mixture of fermentative products (lactate, formate, ethanol) to shift their reaction equilibria to substrates, we are able to redirect NADH to hydrogenase and increase the H2 yield."
1,Materials and methods,"A. maxima sp. CS-328 was obtained from the Tasmanian CSIRO Collection of Living Microalgae and was grown at 30°C by batch culture in 2.8L Fernbach flasks containing 500mL modified Zarrouk's medium (initial pH 9.0) supplemented with 1μM Ni2+, 10mM NO3 −, 1mM H2PO4 −, and 200mM additional NaHCO3 (Carrieri et al., 2007, 2008). Cultures were illuminated by cool fluorescent lamps in 12h light/dark cycles. Optimal light intensity was about 30–70μEm−2 s−1. For simultaneous H2 and NAD(P)H measurements we used samples taken after the 10th hour of the illumination cycle. A two channel device was fabricated that allows simultaneous, continuous, monitoring of dissolved H2 gas and fluorescence from reduced pyridine nucleotides with a time resolution longer than 0.1s as described below and in Ananyev et al. (submitted for publication)."
2,H2 sensor based on fuel cell design,"2.1 H2 sensor based on fuel cell design The first generation of the H2 Clark-type electrode (covered by gas permeable membrane) is described elsewhere (Ananyev et al., 2008). The second generation of home-built electrochemical cell is based on “fuel cell technology” (see review, Korotcenkov et al. (2009)) for measuring the rate of dissolved H2 concentration change. It uses a thin 5μm Teflon membrane covering a 4mm Pt–Ir electrode. For H2 oxidation the electrode is poised at +220mV vs. Ag/AgCl in 100mM KCl. Between the Teflon membrane and the Pt–Ir electrode is a 20μm thick H+-conducting membrane Nafion DE 1020 (Ion Power, Inc., US) doped with micro-dispersed Pd black particles. The second generation H2 microcell has a sensitivity of ∼2nC (concentration 2.6nM H2), fast response time (>0.1s for 95% signal response), and small sample volume (8μL). Such small sample volume and thickness (0.63mm) provide fast H2 consumption throughout the whole sample. During measurement, H2 is efficiently consumed, so the H2 production rate (rather than concentration) is measured (Ananyev et al., 2008). The microcell has a linear response to H2 and is capable of working for months (∼11–12) at stable dark current with excess AgCl (∼0.5g) in the reference electrode compartment. In this study, H2 rate is presented as electrical current (I, nA) and can be converted to gas volume using Faraday's second law (Korotcenkov et al., 2009) after digital integration of the current (total electrical charge dQ = I × dt (Coulomb)). For a diagram of the fuel cell, please see Carrieri et al. (2006)."
3,Optical fluorescence unit for NAD(P)H measurement,"2.2 Optical fluorescence unit for NAD(P)H measurement The design is based on intermittent illumination of the sample from the top at a 45° angle by pulsed illumination (250ms) UV-365nm LED (Nichia, Japan). This source (optical power 1000μW/cm2) was pulsed at a fixed duty cycle of 20% (0.2s on, 0.8s off). This illumination has been found to have a negligible effect on photosynthetic electron transfer and autofermentative dark H2 production. The use of an additional interference filter 365±10nm (Intor, Inc., US) greatly reduced artifacts from excitation light. NAD(P)H fluorescence emission was selected by interference filter centered at 450±30nm (Intor, Inc., US). The signal from an amplified photodiode S5591 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) was filtered by a preamplifier in the range of DC-100Hz (Model 113, EG&G, US). All parts of the optical unit were made using black Delrin that has very low UV induced fluorescence. The irradiated parts were coated with carbon containing black enamel NG SF 100 (Dupli-Color, US), to further reduce the UV background fluorescence an additional 3–5 fold. For measurements, A. maxima cells were taken from the growth phase (∼1g DW/L), concentrated to ∼15g DW/L, and transferred to the sample cavity of the electrode. After covering the electrode cavity, cellular respiration consumes the dissolved O2 and the culture becomes anaerobic (within 2–3min, measured electrochemically by bare Pt electrode). All figures presented are from representative measurements of replicated experiments (3 or more) unless otherwise noted."
4,Chlorophyll fluorescence and quantum efficiency,"2.3 Chlorophyll fluorescence and quantum efficiency Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) variable fluorescence yield, which is proportional to PSII quantum efficiency, was measured with a home-built laser-based fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRF) described elsewhere (Ananyev and Dismukes, 2005). Cultures were examined before and after autofermentation for quantum efficiency of PSII and contaminant microbial growth using optical microscopy."
5,Fermentative hydrogen incubation in glass air-tight vials,"2.4 Fermentative hydrogen incubation in glass air-tight vials For vial measurements, cells were taken from the growth phase and transferred to glass vials, leaving 55–75% of the volume as headspace. Each was made air-tight by crimp top caps containing rubber septa, and the headspace was purged for 20min with argon. Cultures incubated in darkness were wrapped carefully in aluminum foil."
6,H2 measurement by gas chromatography,"2.5 H2 measurement by gas chromatography H2 gas was measured from the headspace by gas chromatography. Gas samples (200μL) were taken from the headspace of the incubation vials by air-tight syringe (Hamilton Company, US) and injected into a Gow-Mac (Newark, NJ, US) gas chromatograph equipped with a 6ft 13× molecular sieve packed column and thermal conductivity detector. Argon (Airgas, Inc.) was the carrier gas, running at 30mL/min."
7,Results,
8,Autofermentative H2 production yields at different biomass concentrations,"3.1 Autofermentative H2 production yields at different biomass concentrations Batch cultures of A. maxima cells produce H2 by indirect biophotolysis (Ananyev et al., 2008; Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Photoautotrophic growth of A. maxima produces biomass yields of up to 8.2gDW/L at a quantum efficiency up to 6.2% when grown with 650±10nm LED illumination (Carrieri et al., 2010). A. maxima cells can be composed of up to 48% carbohydrates (glycogen and osmolytes) and during (dark) autofermentation, carbohydrates are converted to H2 and a variety of excreted secondary metabolites (succinate, lactate, acetate, formate, ethanol, and CO2 have been reported (Ananyev et al., 2008)). The genes for the corresponding enzymes have been identified in the genome (Carrieri et al., 2010). To identify the upper limit of H2 producing capacity, we diluted the sample (containing growth medium and cells) with double deionized water prior to anaerobic incubation. Fig. 1A shows dark autofermentative H2 accumulation in the headspace at different degrees of dilution. The sample diluted 2-fold shows a total H2 increase of 19%, while samples diluted by 4- and 8-fold show decreases of 15.4 and 64%, respectively. However, the H2 accumulation normalized to biomass (cell dry weight) is significantly higher among all dilutions tested (Fig. 1B). The results show that decreasing the concentration of biomass and residual nutrients by dilution prior to autofermentation increases the H2 yield between 2.5- and 3-fold. The cultures that were hypotonically stressed the most (dilutions of 4- and 8-fold) exhibited cell lysis (rupture) after 9 and 5days autofermentation, respectively, when examined by bright field microscopy. This is a result of an increased rate of catabolizing intracellular storage carbohydrates, soluble sugars, and osmolytes (trehalose and glucosyl-glycerol) in response to the hypotonic stress."
9,H2 uptake from headspace and equilibrium constant,"3.2 H2 uptake from headspace and equilibrium constant The bidirectional hydrogenase present in A. maxima is reversible and accordingly could take up H2 and reduce NAD+ under certain conditions. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of H2 production and consumption by A. maxima at 30°C starting from an initial headspace concentration of 20% H2 (80%N2 to balance) during 6days of dark or light incubation. A simple calculation shows that the amount of H2 withdrawn for GC measurement (0.2mL×7 measurements=1.4mL, that is 4.2% of headspace) is coincident with the decrease observed in the experimental light time course. Illumination suppresses hydrogenase activity and we therefore utilize this light time course as our control. When this control is subtracted from the dark time course, the differential trace indicates a near complete elimination of H2 production activity in an atmosphere of 20% H2 above the culture. Interestingly, while H2 uptake is not observed in the experiment even in the presence of 20% H2 in the atmosphere, biological H2 production is inhibited due to the H2 backpressure."
10,Selective “milking” of H2 from A. maxima electrochemically,"3.3 Selective “milking” of H2 from A. maxima electrochemically A faster, more exhaustive, and selective method for the removal of the product H2 directly from the medium during autofermentation is through the use of a fuel cell electrode (see Section 2). When the Pd/Nafion coated electrode is separated from the culture by a gas permeable membrane and polarized by +220mV, such a device is specific to hydrogen gas and does not react to other excreted products. The fuel cell generates electrical current arising from the oxidation of H2 (linear over a wide range of H2 concentrations). This electrical current reflects the rate of H2 production; it can be converted to electrical charge by integration over a period of fermentation time. The fuel microcell is safe for cyanobacterial samples because the PTFE (5μm) hydrophobic membrane prevents diffusion of any products between the sample and the anode electrochemical compartment except H2 gas. Fig. 3A shows sustained H2 production during 7days of dark autofermentation. The A. maxima culture was conditioned for maximum H2 production by the approach described in Ananyev et al. (2008). Oxygen was fully consumed from the 8μL sample within 2–3min, and H2 production started during that same period, indicative of (i) a hydrogenase quickly activated upon anoxia and (ii) the depletion of nitrate, a electron acceptor competing for reductant, initially supplied in the growth medium. The average electrical current density during the initial 4days of dark anaerobic incubation reaches about 5.6μA/cm2 at the anode surface. After 4–5days the H2 production rate decreases and eventually reaches zero after the 7th day. During this time, the total carbohydrate content of the cells decreased drastically from 48% (initial) to below 1% (terminal) (Carrieri et al., 2010). The carbohydrate availability therefore defines the capacity for fermentative H2 production, and an initial carbohydrate content of 48% allows A. maxima cells to survive for at least 7 and up to 10–12days, after which point H2 production ceases. In most cases such cells remain viable and can be used for repeated autotrophic growth in fresh Zarrouk's medium. Fig. 3B shows the digital integration of the data in Fig. 3A. This concentration kinetic shows the maximal cumulative production of H2 (yield) by A. maxima cells in the absence of any inhibition by H2 uptake (280mL H2/gDW). The plateau of the H2 yield kinetic after 7days indicates the point at which H2 production ceases due to completed carbohydrate consumption. The data representing headspace H2 accumulation from undiluted control cells was taken from Fig. 1 and replotted here (diamond trace) to illustrate the 11-fold increase in autofermentative H2 yield (over 7days) when the product H2 is continually consumed electrochemically (“milking” conditions)."
11,Status of photosynthetic viability following several days of autofermentation,"3.4 Status of photosynthetic viability following several days of autofermentation For biotechnological applications, it is important to know if the cultures are still viable after a single cycle of autofermentation. PSII activity can serve as a general gauge of cell integrity. Loss of PSII activity over several days of autofermentation is due to degradation of the PSII reaction center (including the D1 protein) and the water-oxidizing Mn4Ca1O5 active site. Fig. 4A shows the PSII activity, measured by Chl-a variable fluorescence yield, before and after 10days of autofermentation. The results indicate that within 24h following the anaerobic incubation, total recovery of PSII activity is achieved for the sample. Initially, about 80–90% of A. maxima cells have lost their PSII activity (initial quantum efficiency Fv/Fm is about 0.05), but it is recoverable. The application of low intensity light (average 2μEm−2 s−1, 660nm) recovers 50% of PSII activity in 50min (Fig. 4B), and about 70–80% of PSII activity was restored to the initial level after 24h of low light illumination. Of course, the overall survival and viability of cells after autofermentation depend on a number of factors, including: (i) microbial contamination; (ii) initial carbohydrate content; (iii) length of anaerobic incubation; (iv) incubation temperature; (v) stirring of bioreactor; (vi) biomass concentration; (vii) pH of media; and (viii) net yield of H2 produced. Balancing all factors, our current and previous (Ananyev et al., 2008) studies have found that the maximal incubation period for “milking” H2 production from A. maxima is about 7–8days, which allows greater than 70–80% recovery of cell viability."
12,H2 production in the presence of external organic acids and ethanol,"3.5 H2 production in the presence of external organic acids and ethanol Another potential mechanism to increase the yield of fermentative H2 production is to re-direct the partitioning of the NAD(P)H produced by the catabolic reactions (glycolysis and OPP pathways). In principle, this may be possible by altering the concentrations of the secondary metabolites that require NADH to form and thus compete with H2 formation. A. maxima excretes six main secondary metabolites: lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol, CO2 and H2 (Ananyev et al., 2008; Carrieri et al., 2010). The fraction of each metabolite is variable and depends on many factors, including cell age and osmotic stress (Carrieri et al., 2010). We focused our approach on suppressing the generation of the metabolites whose production consumes the most reducing power, such as lactate, formate, and especially ethanol (see Scheme 1 for the number of NADH molecules involved in reactions). Because H2 production must accompany a pathway for the excretion of the main carbon product of glycolysis (pyruvate), and because the production of acetate from pyruvate generates additional NADH which can be utilized by hydrogenase, we consider acetate production the optimal variety of carbon fermentative product. Fig. 5 demonstrates a 35% increase in the maximal rate of H2 production as a result of adding a mixture of lactate, formate and ethanol (3mM of each) to fermenting cultures. The addition of these products is expected to shift the equilibrium of their fermentative reactions from products to substrates and thereby increase the available NADH for hydrogenase. Not only does the maximal H2 production rate increase after the addition of the mixture, but also the time before the maximal H2 production rate is reached decreases 45%, and the rate at which the NAD(P)H is consumed by the system (measured as the slope of the NAD(P)H kinetic) is decreased as well (from 0.93μM/h in control to 0.49μM/h with treatment). Together these data confirm a decreased ability to recycle NADH by the lactate-, formate-, and ethanol-pathways, translating directly into increased NADH oxidation by hydrogenase and accordingly increased H2 production."
13,Discussion,"In this article we present a novel, so called “milking,” approach to increase H2 production by a factor of up to 11-fold in yield and 3.4-fold in rate. When transferred to dark anoxic conditions, cyanobacteria quickly begin to catabolize their carbohydrate reserves for maintenance of energetic demands (ATP, NAD(P)H, and reduced FDx) and produce fermentative by-products (Stal and Moezelaar, 1997), including molecular hydrogen. Scheme 1 presents a simplified functional model of dark fermentative metabolic pathways in A. maxima that produce energy, excreted carbon products (organic acids, ethanol and CO2), and molecular H2 (for detailed pathways see Carrieri et al. (2010)). An important consideration for attaining maximal H2 yield is the partitioning of carbon and reductant during autofermentation. Fig. 6 shows an Eh–pH Pourbaix stability diagram indicating the redox potential of H2/H+ at various partial pressures of H2. These data show that the reduction of protons by [NiFe]-hydrogenase is a process operating close to thermodynamic equilibrium under biologically relevant conditions (intracellular pH between 7 and 7.5) at 0.001bar, and as such the system is especially sensitive to changes in H2 product concentration and competing pathways. The removal of H2 by “milking” is therefore expected to increase the net rate of H2 formation and thus provides a mechanistic explanation for the large, 11-fold, increase observed under “milking” conditions. The Pourbaix diagram additionally indicates that acidification of the cytoplasm is another mechanism that would favour proton reduction from NADH. Previous work has found that the hydrogenase is constitutively expressed in A. maxima under oxic and anoxic conditions (Ananyev et al., 2008) and immediately activated by NAD(P)H upon transfer to an anoxic environment (Germer et al., 2009). Moreover, dynamic electrochemical investigation has found that product H2 is a common and potent inhibitor of [NiFe] hydrogenases in general (Armstrong et al., 2009). Additionally, the accumulation of excreted carbon products (organic acids and alcohols) in the medium may cause feedback inhibition and slow the reactions of glycolysis. In this article we report three ways to increase the yield of auto-fermentative H2 by the cyanobacterium A. maxima. The first is based on optimizing the concentration of biomass in the reaction vessel by dilution. This approach increases H2 production from 3.6 to 13.2mL/g DW/day, a 3.7-fold increase. In addition to decreasing the extracellular concentration of fermentative products, this dilution approach decreases the availability of extracellular nitrate (an electron acceptor in competition with protons) thereby shifting metabolism from nitrate reduction to proton reduction, while also decreasing the osmolarity of the culture medium, which may induce catabolism of some osmolytes and soluble sugars in A. maxima. The second approach is based on “milking” by continuous removal of H2 from the medium throughout the autofermentative incubation by its selective consumption at an electrode. By eliminating product inhibition, “milking” increased H2 yield from 3.6 to 40mLH2/gDW/d, or 11-fold compared to non-milking conditions. Biotechnologically, this approach could be used to continuously consume H2 produced from cyanobacterial cultures and provide electrical current. A similar biotechnological approach has been developed utilizing hydrogenases adsorbed to electrodes to consume H2 and generate electrical current (Shastik et al., 2011; Vincent et al., 2005). A clear implication of this finding is in the design of bioreactors, where sufficient headspace is required to prevent excessive H2 backpressure from accumulating on the system. Alternatively, the inclusion of an inorganic H2 sponge or electrode to consume the H2 would be highly beneficial to attain maximal H2 production rates. The latter approach would allow direct electrochemical oxidation of H2 to produce electricity. The third method focuses on changing the profile of fermentative products by adding a mixture of formate, lactate, and ethanol to shift the equilibria of their fermentative reactions towards substrates (NADH) and thereby increase the NADH available to hydrogenase. This is based upon the principle of Le Chatelier, stating that a chemical system at equilibrium will react to a change in concentration of its reactants or products and respond by creating a new equilibrium. The range of concentrations of excreted organic acids and alcohols by A. maxima is up to 3.0mM (Carrieri et al., 2010) with H2 in the headspace in the range of 12–18% (Ananyev et al., 2008). In the present work we have chosen to utilize a mixture of formate, lactate, and ethanol to inhibit the fermentative production of each. In a metabolic mode consisting of glycolysis alone, pyruvate will be generated from the oxidation of glucose equivalents and the carbon corresponding to this pyruvate must be excreted from the cell (Scheme 1). Accordingly, our aim is to funnel all this pyruvate to acetate via pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) or pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) as this route will generate more internal reductant to the cell that could be converted to H2. Under this metabolic mode, glycolysis is required to generate ATP within the cell. We note, however, that if carbon could be catabolized by the enzymes of the OPP pathway, glucose equivalents could be more fully oxidized to CO2, with less of a flux required from pyruvate to acetate. The functioning of this pathway would generate more reductant for the cell per glucose catabolized (4 NADH for glycolysis alone, 8 NAD(P)H for a glycolysis/OPP hybrid pathway shown to occur in our experiments, 12 NADPH for OPP alone which occurs in vitro (Woodward et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2007)). While the functioning of the glycolysis/OPP hybrid pathway directly provides ATP by the carbon flux through lower glycolysis, complete catabolism of glucose through OPP (yielding 12 NADPH) is not directly coupled to substrate level ADP phosphorylation. We note that a more direct way to attenuate pathways competing with hydrogenase for NADH utilization would be to genetically eliminate them. This approach has been taken by numerous groups, for instance to eliminate lactate dehydrogenase (McNeely et al., 2010) and nitrate reductase (Baebprasert et al., 2011). Unfortunately a genetic system does not yet exist for strains of the genus Arthrospira which would allow these experiments. We believe that the knowledge obtained from this study supports the rationale for targeting these pathways (lactate, ethanol, and formate production) as prime targets once such a system is developed. We cannot rule out the possibility that part of the increased fermentative H2 production we observe in the presence of these exogenous metabolites is due to their oxidation by the cell, ultimately supplying additional reductant to hydrogenase. However, because (a) the redox poise of the cell is known to drastically increase under fermentative conditions and because (b) the aforementioned studies observed that the elimination of competing pathways utilizing reductant led to an increase in H2 production, we believe that the effect observed here is due to the inhibition of the forward reaction of these competing pathways (NADH consumption) rather than the stimulation of the reverse reaction (NADH generation). Most importantly, maximal H2 yield depends on the total amount of carbohydrate stored in the cell prior to fermentation. The best way to cause the cell to accumulate highest levels of carbohydrate is by nitrate depletion, low light (40–70μEm−2 s−1), and a prolonged growing period. Under said conditions, 0.48g of carbohydrate per 1g DW is achievable and could provide a theoretical maximal H2 yield of (1490×0.48)=716mLH2/g DW. Our maximal observed experimental H2 yield is 282mL/g DW corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency (ECE, carbohydrate to hydrogen) of 282/716=39%. We note that this ECE is very similar to the ECE expected (33%) from 4 equivalents H2 per glucose as outlined by the Thauer limit. The fact that it is slightly higher than the 33% ECE of the Thauer limit may indicate that there is some contribution from the OPP pathway to reductant generation in the native system. We close in calling attention to A. maxima as a promising candidate for biological H2 production. Building upon the role of [NiFe]-hydrogenase to recycle NADH to NAD+ and allow fermentative reactions to continue (Carrieri et al., 2011), it follows that microbial phototrophs with high metabolic rates and high cellular ATP demands are promising platforms for efficient [NiFe] hydrogenases and efficient H2 production. A. maxima routinely experiences anaerobic conditions during the dark phase of its diurnal cycle and has evolved to thrive in an environmental niche consisting of high osmolarity and alkalinity (Vonshak, 1997). These environmental conditions demand a high catabolic rate for the strain to satisfy the ATP requirements demanded by this environment, and we observe this high metabolic rate translate directly into high rates of fermentative H2 production from the strain."
