0,Introduction,"In the past decade, ionic liquids (ILs) have gained large interest from an academic and industrial viewpoint based on their thermophysical properties and lower environmental impact [1,2]. ILs are usually synthetized from an organic cation and organic/inorganic anion that are liquids at room temperature. ILs can present several industrial desirable properties such as high ionic conductivity, nonflammability, high thermal and chemical stabilities, and excellent solvation ability for a wide range of compounds and materials. The most distinctive ILs properties are their negligible volatility, capacity for reuse, and the possibility of tuning their properties to suit specific application by changing their structure, through the simple combination of different ions [1–3]. There are two classes of ionic liquids: aprotic ionic liquids (AILs) and protic ionic liquids (PILs). PILs are produced through proton transfer from a Brønsted acid to a Brønsted base and have been characterized by lower cost, easier synthesis, lower toxicity, and higher biodegradability [4–7]. Ionic liquids have generally displayed a much higher viscosity than many of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), somehow hampering their industrial process applications because of their handling difficulties (pumping and agitation) and mass transfer problems, causing significant increase in equilibrium contact time in the liquid extraction or gas absorption process [8,9]. There were several studies already reporting on the synthesis of low viscosity ionic liquids for a wide range of applications. Some investigations have been conducted for lower viscosity ILs into the effect of structural changes on the physical properties [7,9–12], while other researchers have been studied the developing ionic liquids with viscosity suitable for industry applications such as gas absorption [13–15], oil miscible additives for lubrication enhancement [16], and liquid-liquid equilibria [17]. Lactam, especially γ-butirolactam and ε-caprolactam, and their derivates are relatively cheap, present a lower toxicity, and they are easily available for industrial applications [18]. A series of lactam-based ILs were produced by Du et al. [18] through the neutralization reaction between γ-butirolactam or ε-caprolactam and inorganic acids, some of them presented low viscosities (11–28 mPa·s) and high thermal stability in a wide range of temperature (from 390.15 to 522.15 K). Since then, some lactam-based ILs were synthesized, characterized, and investigated trying to find some industrial application. Several ILs containing the caprolactam cation and halogenated anions were produced and characterized by Jiang et al. [19]. PILs produced from γ-butyrolactam or ε-caprolactam and carboxylic acids showed low viscosities and high thermal stability [11]. Lactam-based ionic liquids were applied in SO2 absorption and in esterification and transesterification reactions [20–23]. The present study aims to synthetize low viscosity lactam-based ionic liquids. Therefore, the synthesis and characterization of the following protic ILs: γ-butyrolactam acetate (BTA), γ-butyrolactam butyrate (BTB), γ-butyrolactam hexanoate (BTH), ε-caprolactam acetate (CPA), ε-caprolactam hexanoate (CPH), 12-aminododecanolactam acetate (DTA), 12-aminododecanolactam hexanoate (DTH), and 1-octyl-2-pyrrolidone acetate (OBTA) were investigated. Mutual miscibility between the different ionic liquids and organic compounds such as aliphatic, aromatic, cyclic, and water and alcohol were determined."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Table 1 gives some chemicals characterization (furnisher, CAS number, and purity). All chemicals were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Ultrapure water with resistivity of 18.2 m·Ω·cm at 298.15 K was obtained by the purification system Direct-Q-Millipore."
3,Ionic liquids production,"2.2 Ionic liquids production Lactam-based ionic liquids synthesis procedure followed the methodology presented in the literature [11,18]. For solid cyclic amides (ε-caprolactam and 12-aminododecanolactam) a 0.38 g/mL solution were prepared, by adding water in a triple neck round bottom flask containing amides equipped with thermometer and a reflux condenser. Equimolar amount of carboxylic acid was added slowly through a dripping funnel during vigorous stirring. The reaction, at room temperature, lasted for another 24 h. Water was removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator and further dried at 338.15 K under 20 kPa for 24 h. Ionic liquids structures were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Thermophysical properties (density, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and decomposition temperature), acidic scale, and water content were also determined."
4,FTIR and 1H NMR,"2.3 FTIR and 1H NMR ILs spectra were recorded in a FTIR Cary 630 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). This equipment enables the use of liquid or solid samples without any previous preparation. The FTIR spectra were acquired in the 4000–400 cm−1 region, with a resolution of 1 cm−1. To assess the formation of the ionic liquid, tree samples were analyzed for each IL, i.e., amide, carboxylic acid and IL itself. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer, equipped with an inverse detection One Probe of 5 mm of diameter. To confirm the formation of the ionic liquid, the simple mixture of the ILs precursor was analyzed along with the IL itself. Therefore, they were obtained 1H NMR spectra of the amide, acid carboxylic and ionic liquid. The γ-butirolactam-based ILs samples were dissolved in 600 μL deuterated chloroform (CDCl3, Sigma - Aldrich) and ε-caprolactam based ILs samples were dissolved in 600 μL deuterated dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO‑d 6, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The PROTON pulse sequence was applied, and the spectra were acquired under controlled temperature to 299.1 K with 16 scans using 16,000 of time domain points for a spectral window of 16.0 ppm, and recycling delay of 2 s. The processing of the 1H NMR spectra was performed by applying exponential Lorentzian broadening of 0.3 Hz and zero filling to 16 k points."
5,"Density, viscosity, water content, ionic conductivity, acidic scale and TGA","2.4 Density, viscosity, water content, ionic conductivity, acidic scale and TGA Density (ρ) and viscosity (η) were measured at atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), at the temperature range of T = (293.15–393.15) K, by using an Anton Paar SVM 3000 digital oscillation U-Tube viscodensimeter, with the temperature uncertainty, u(T) = 0.01 K. The expanded combined uncertainty for density (u c (ρ)) and viscosity (u c (η)) data are 0.0018 g·cm−3 and u c (η) = 0.02·η mPa·s, respectively for a confidence level of 95%. This apparatus has been calibrated by using Cannon mineral oil (CAS no. 68037.01.4) in the temperature range from 273.15 to393.15 K. The water content was measured by Karl Fischer Metrohm 870 KF Titrino plus, using chloroform/methanol solution with 3:1 (vol/vol) ratio. ILs thermal stability were measured using the SHIMADZU DTG – 60 TGA instrument with the temperature ranging from 303.15 to 773.15 K. The mass of the samples varied from 17 to 20 mg. The nitrogen flow was 50 mL·min−1 and heating rate of 283.15 K·min−1. The conductivity was measured by Gehaka-CG2000 conductometer, by using a conductivity cell K = 1, at 298.15 K. ILs relative acidity was evaluated based on the determination of the Hammett acidity function. For that, a UV–visible spectroscopy (Thermos model Evolution 210) carried out this analysis by using the 4-[4-(Dimethylamino)phenylazo]benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt indicator, according to the literature [18,24]. This indicator was diluted in methanol and added to an IL/methanol solution (80 mmol/L) and the absorbance determined in the 300 and 800 nm region. The Hammett acidity function (H0) could be calculated by using the Eq. (1). (1) H 0 = pKa I + log I IH + where pKa(I) is the pKa value of the indicator (3,39 for 4-[4-(Dimethylamino) henylazo] benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt), [I] and [IH +] are the molar concentrations of the unprotonated and protonated forms of the indicator in the solutions, respectively. The [I]/[IH+] ratio could be calculated by intermediate of the indicator absorbance difference after the ILs addition. As expected, ionic liquids with greater acidity have lower values of H0."
6,Miscibility,"2.5 Miscibility Miscibility determination was carried out by using an equilibrium cell, previously described by Santiago and Aznar [25]. Miscibility data for binary mixtures containing ILs and different organic solvents, water and n-butanol were determined at 298.15 K by titration method based on the cloud point. Two modes of titration were performed during these experiments, i.e., solvent-to-IL and IL-to-solvent, both of them using a titration analysis. Firstly, an 8 g pure IL sample was added to the equilibrium cell, coupled to a thermostatic bath (Tecnal TE-184) and magnetic stirrer. This mixture was continually stirred a second component was added until reach the onset of turbidity in the solution. Binary mixture components were determined by gravimetric method, by using an analytical balance (Shimadzu, uncertainty of ±0.0001 g). The miscibility data were reported in IL mass fraction."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Ionic liquids production and structural characterization,"3.1 Ionic liquids production and structural characterization The products obtained from the chemical reaction between γ-butyrolactam, ε-caprolactam, and 1-octhyl-2-pyrrolidinone + carboxylic acids were all liquids at room temperature with a slightly yellowish, exception made for the mixtures between 12-aminododecanolactam and acetic and hexanoic acids that remain solid at room temperature. Ionic liquids structure and bonding features have been determined by FTIR technique. The spectra of the reagents and products obtained by the neutralization reaction between amides and carboxylic acids are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 . From Figs. 1 and 2, it can be observed that there was any new band formation of the ILs synthetized that could be an indicative the absence of covalent bonds between components. However, small vibrational shifts observed are due to the interactions between amides and organic acids. The FTIR spectra of the ILs, in contrast to the spectra of the original compounds, small vibrational shifts of the CO stretching band of the ILs BTA (from 1669 to 1651 cm−1), BTB (from 1669 to 1654 cm−1), BTH (from 1669 to 1654 cm−1), CPA e CPH (from 1651 to 1625 cm−1) were observed. After protonation, coordination elongates the CO bond in amides what causes decrease in absorption frequency. The CO bond length in acetic acid is shorter after protonation, however, the absorption frequency does not show large displacements due to weak coordination of this acid. Thus, the authors concluded that these changes indicate the formation of ionic liquid. This shift was also observed in the protonation of ε-caprolactam (from 1660 to 1645 cm−1) and N-methyl caprolactam (from 1660 to 1645 cm−1) using hydrochloric acid (HCl) as an electron donor [26]. The production of the ionic liquid using ε-caprolactam and trifluoroacetic acid [HCPL][TFA] also presented shift of the CO stretching mode, the characteristic absorption bands of stretching vibration of CO (1680 cm−1) disappeared while new absorption bands of COO− (1610 cm−1) appeared [27]. Similar behavior was reported by [28] in the formation of the ionic liquid acetamide acetate (ATAA) [28]. The band at 1687 cm−1 is assigned to the CO stretching mode of acetamide and it shifts to 1648 cm−1 after reaction with acetic acid. The bands of stretching vibration of CO acetic acid shifts to 1708 cm−1 from 1703 cm−1, it can be considered a negligible change, which was also observed for the ILs evaluated in this work. In addition to vibrational shifts of the CO stretching band, other changes were observed in the frequencies and absorbances of the bands referring to bonds that are modified with the formation of the ionic liquid. Spectra of ILs based on γ-butyrolactam and ε-caprolactam (BTA, BTB, BTH, CPA e CPH) showed a reduction in the intensity of the absorbances of the broad band attributed to the hydrogen-bonded OH out-of-plane bending (~900 cm−1) vibration characteristic feature in the spectrum of a carboxylic acid. This band is present in carboxylic acid dimers and their reduction indicates that this hydrogen bonding was modified by the deprotonation of the acid. The NH bending band which appears in 800 cm−1 in amides disappears in the spectra of the ionic liquids which may be another indication of the formation of an ionic bond of these with the evaluated carboxylic acids. The product of reaction between 12-Aminododenanolactam and acetic acid (DTA) presented FTIR spectra like the constituent amide. The small variations observed in the infrared spectra indicate that the ionic interaction of this amide with the acid evaluated did not occur, as shown in Fig. 3. This could be associated with the larger size of the ring chain of 12-aminododecanolactam which causes steric hindrance, making the reaction impossible. The DTH product presented a similar result to the DTA. The product of reaction between 1-Octhyl-2-pyrrolidinone and acetic acid (OBTA) presented small vibrational shifts of the Carbonyl stretching band indicating the formation of IL. However, it was found that during the drying process part of the acid was removed. The presence of acetic acid in the evaporation residue was confirmed by FTIR analysis and modification in the stretching band of the C = O bond of the amide of the OBTA spectra before and after the drying process, as shown in Fig. 3b. After reaction, CO shifts the absorption band to a lower frequency (from 1681 to 1640 cm−1). After evaporation a new band appeared at 1680 cm−1, characteristic band amide, indicating the presence of free 1-Octhyl-2-pyrrolidinone. This behavior can be justified by the weak interaction between 1-Octhyl-2-pyrrolidinone and acetic acid caused by the distancing of the ions due to the long carbon chain ramification of the amide. Accordingly, the DTA, DTH and OBTA products were not considered as ionic liquids. Table 2 shows the structures, names, abbreviations and water content of the ionic liquids produced. In addition, the synthesized ILs were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The Table 3 presents the chemical shits of the simple mixture of the precursors of the ILs and the obtained ILs. The Figs. 4 and 5 shows comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of the simple mixture (SM) of the precursors (Figs. 4a and 5a) and produced BTA and CPA respectively (Figs. 4b and 5b). For BTA (Fig. 4), any change in the chemical shifts was observed. This might be related to the weak interaction of the ionic groups of the precursors. However, these results may also indicate that the BTA, BTB and BTH formation reactions occurred quickly. The same feature was observed for BTB and BTH. Unlikely BTA, the chemical shifts changes for specific groups of CPA are notorious. There were no changes in chemical shifts for the CH2 groups H3, H4, H5, H5, H6, and H7 as observed in the Table 3 e and Fig. 5. However, for the hydrogen 1H (attached to nitrogen group) from caprolactam and the methyl hydrogens (H3m) from acetic acid is observed a variation of −0.22 ppm (from 7.41 to 7.19 ppm) and −0.01 (from 2.05 to 2.04 ppm) respectively. This result indicates that the ionic liquid is indeed a product of acid-base neutralization reaction of acetic acid with caprolactam, which generated a salt, and not merely a physical equimolar mixture of the two reactants. The BTB, BTH and CPH 1H NMR and ILs purity data are presented in the Supplementary data file. ILs relative acidity decreasing the following order: BTA > CPA > BTB > BTH > CPH, suggesting that lactam-based ILs Brønsted acidity was dependent upon the anion structure. Ionic liquids with acetate anions (BTA: H0 = 3.89 and CPA: H0 = 4.69) showed greater acidity indicating ILs with higher chain anions presented less acidity. These results were shown in Fig. S6 of the Supplementary Material."
9,Density and viscosity,"3.2 Density and viscosity Table 4 shows density (ρ) and viscosity (η) experimental data for BTA, BTB, BTH, CPA, and CPH ILs, as a function of temperature (303.15–343.15 K), at atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa). From these data, it was observed that all ILs present a typical liquid behavior, with density decreasing with temperature. As expected, γ-butyrolactam IL density is higher than ε-caprolactam. This result could be attributed to the difficulty of ε-caprolactam IL to form hydrogen bonds, as the packing effect caused by ion asymmetry. When compared to the ILs containing cations with different structures and alkyl chain length (e.g., 1-methylimidazolium, 1-ethylimidazolium, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, ethylammonium, propylammonium, butylammonium, N,N-dimethyl-N-ethylammonium, and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium) and the acetate anion, lactam-based ILs studied here present higher densities values [12,29–34]. These results indicate the effect of cation structure upon density. Higher densities may be related to the packing effects because of the lower carbon chains of γ-butyrolactam and ε-caprolactam cations of BTA and CPA compared to the ILs mentioned. The effect of the anion length on the density could be observed by comparing BTA, BTB, and BTH (or CPA and CPH). The density values decreased in the following sequence: BTA > BTB > BTH (CPA > CPH). As stated before, these results are influenced by the ions asymmetry. This behavior is more pronounced for the caprolactam-based ILs because of their structural conformation. Caprolactam-based ILs containing cyclic, aromatic, and halogenated anions showed higher densities than the CPA and CPH, produced from aliphatic anion [18,23]. The density increasing observed could be related to the steric hindrance increases in the presence of aromatic or cyclic branched structures when compared to the anion linear chain replacement. As presented in Table 4, γ-butyrolactam acetate (BTA), γ-butyrolactam butyrate (BTB), γ-butyrolactam hexanoate (BTH), ε-caprolactam acetate (CPA), and ε-caprolactam hexanoate (CPH) dynamic viscosity experimental data, higher anion alkyl chain length, along with larger cationic ring size, show higher viscosities, as expected. Compared these values to ILs containing cations with different structures, alkyl chain length, and the acetate anion reveal that viscosities of the lactam-based ILs are lower, e.g., CPA has a viscosity almost 100 times lower than 3-hydroxypropylammonium acetate [12,29,30,32,33]. It is important to notice that lactam-based ILs viscosities are comparable to the organic solvent commonly used in industrial applications, e.g., ethylene glycol (16 cP), dimethyl phthalate (14 cP) or ethanolamine (21 cP). Lactam-based ILs low viscosity could be associated to the weak ionic interaction because of their lower ability to form strong hydrogen bonds between the cation and anion's nitrogen atoms. However, there is a significant rise in viscosity caused by the increase in the number of carbons in the lactam ring. BTH has four more carbons in the anion chain than BTA and the viscosity has been found to rise from 6.419 mPa·s in BTA to 11.89 mPa·s in BTH. For the IL CPA, the viscosity obtained was 38.54 mPa·s, that is, the presence of two more carbons in the cation ring has a more noticeable effect on the viscosity than the increase of the anion chain. This behavior can be explained by the difference in molecular geometry between the evaluated ILs. The larger chain of the ring present in caprolactam makes its conformation nonlinear which may add a difficulty in its transport property [11]."
10,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Table 5 show the thermal decomposition temperatures at the onset decomposition temperature (Tonset), the apparent onset temperature at which IL loses 5% of its mass (Tonset (5%)) and the experimental ionic conductivity of ILs at 298.15 K. The onset temperature (Tonset) demonstrates the thermal stability of the ILs and refers to the temperature that corresponds to the intersection between the baseline mass and the tangent of the mass dependence on the temperature curve. Most of the aprotic ionic liquids do not exhibit a measurable mass loss at temperatures up to 200 °C [35]. Lactam-based protic ionic liquids studied presented less thermal stability compared to imidazolium and ammonium-based aprotic ionic liquids [35–37]. The thermal stability of ILs primarily depends upon the strength of their heteroatom–carbon and heteroatom–hydrogen bonds. Increase in the number of carbons in the lactam ring is not influenced in the apparent onset temperature (Tonset (5%)) of the ILs with increasing temperature. This can be explained by the chemical similarity between the amides evaluated. However, ε-caprolactam-based ionic liquids presented higher thermal stability than the γ-butyrolactam-based ionic liquids for the same anion. This occurs due to the addition of carbons in the lactam ring and by chair conformation of caprolactam ILs which favor the formation of hydrogen bonding and affects their thermal stability, as compared to planar geometry of butyrolactam ILs. This observation indicates that ILs with longer carbon chains of the anion are more thermally stable (Fig. 6 ). ILs ionic conductivities (at 298.15 K) decrease in the following order: BTA > BTB > CPA > BTH > CPH. This behavior is similar to those found in the literature [34,38,39], i.e., conductivity decreases by increasing ion alkyl chain length. The alkyl chain length increases significantly the dispersion interactions in the liquid phase, which renders difficult ion mobility. As a consequence, there is a decreasing in the ionic conductivity. The relationship between ILs viscosity and ionic conductivity was reported in the literature [32,39], i.e., when viscosity increases, fluidity decreases and leads to an ion movement reduction and a lower ionic conductivity. It is important to stress that ILS ionic conductivities studied here were lower than ILs containing acetate anion and imidazolium or alkylammonium cations with different alkyl chain length, even for ILs with higher viscosity [31,33,38,40,41]. This phenomenon could be attributed to many factors, such as: cation and anion chemical structure, diffusion coefficient, and hydrogen bond interactions. Comparing the conductivity between BTA, BTB, BTH, CPA and CPH and ILs containing cation caprolactam or butyrolactam and anion trifluoroacetate shows that the latter presents higher conductivity because of the presence of fluorine atoms which facilitates charge delocalization being responsible for weak hydrogen bonds [18,42]."
11,Miscibility tests,"3.4 Miscibility tests For this study, the liquid-phase behavior was determined for the 40 binary ionic liquid + (or + aliphatic, or + aromatic, or + cyclic hydrocarbon, or + water, or + n-butanol) systems, as shown in Table 6 . When a binary mixture is partially miscible, two miscibility data could be obtained, one using the IL as titrant and one as titrated. This behavior was reached for 12 binary mixtures with partial miscibility, as introduced in Table 6. BTA, BTB, and CPA ILs showed partial miscibility in heptane, while BTH and CPH were completely miscible, as expected. Generally ILs have low miscibility in alkanes because of the weak interactions between alkanes and the ions, involving only dispersion van der Waals forces [43]. Indeed, experimental miscibility of n-heptane in BTA, BTB, and CPA are lower than 0.007 on a mass fraction basis. Moreover, the solubility of n-heptane increases when the hydrophobic character of ILs increases, as observed for solvents produced from γ-butyrolactam (BTA, BTB, and BTH). BTA showed low miscibility in heptane while BTH was completely miscible. Acetic acid (BTA) IL showed low miscibility in heptane while the produced with hexanoic acid (BTH) was miscible. BTB, which has an intermediate carbon chain acid between BTA and BTH, presented a small composition range in which the formation of two phases with heptane occurs. This behavior shows the strong influence of the acidic carbon chain size on the miscibility of these ILs. Comparing the BTA and CPA ionic liquids, it was found that the increase in the amide carbon chain reduced the miscibility in heptane which can be attributed to differences in the geometry of these cations. In general, cyclic alkanes showed greater miscibility in ionic liquids than linear aliphatic because of the similar structure of these compounds and their cations. In addition, the molar volume of cyclic alkanes is smaller than the molar volume of linear alkanes, so the packaging effect may increase the miscibility of cyclohexane and cyclohexene in the evaluated ILs [36]. Cyclohexane and cyclohexene were partially miscible only in BTA and it was found that an increase in cyclohexene miscibility compared to cyclohexane. Ionic liquids based on γ-butyrolactam and ε-caprolactam amides showed total miscibility in aromatic hydrocarbons regardless of anion chain size. The complete miscibility of toluene, styrene and ethylbenzene in the studied ionic liquids can be attributed to the strong interactions π- π and n-π between the free electrons located in the aromatic bonds and the polar structure IL [35]. The n-butanol presented total miscibility in the evaluated ionic liquids because of its high polarity and the presence of van der Waals interactions because of the alcohol alkyl chain. The water presented similar behavior, i.e., it was partially miscible only in ILs with the hexanoate anion that has more nonpolar characteristics."
12,Conclusions,"Four cyclic amides (γ-butyrolactam, ε-caprolactam, 12-aminododecanolactam, and 1-octyl-2-pyrrolidone) with different ring sizes and branching were evaluated in the production of ionic liquids with carboxylic acids of different chain sizes. It has been observed that long chain and branching cyclic amides are not able to form ionic interaction with carboxylic acids making synthesis of such ILs impossible. The characterization of ionic liquids formed from γ-butyrolactam, ε-caprolactam, and carboxylic acids indicated that ionic interaction occurs and can be verified by changes in FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Density and ionic conductivity decrease as viscosity increases with increasing cation ring and anion carbon chain. Thermal stability is most influenced by the carbon chain of the anion. Miscibility tests of BTA, BTB, BTH, CPA, and CPH ionic liquids in linear and cyclic alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, water and n-butanol were performed by titration method. It was found that the anion chain has greater influence on miscibility. ILs with lower carbon chain anions are partially miscible in heptane while ILs with larger carbon chain partially miscible in anions. All ILs were fully miscible in aromatic hydrocarbons and n-butanol."
