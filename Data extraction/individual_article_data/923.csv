0,Introduction,"Deoxygenation of amine oxides to corresponding amines is one of the important reactions in the fields of organic chemistry, biochemistry and medical chemistry [1–5]. Various selective deoxygenations of amine oxides to amine derivatives have been reported as summarized in Table 1 . Various oxygen transfer reactions using oxygen acceptors such as 2-methyl-2-butene and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) over a ruthenium(VI) meso-tetramesitylporphyrin dioxo complex (Ru(TMP)(O)2) [6], oxorhenium(VII) complex (CH3Re(O)(SR)2PPh3) [7], N-fused tetraphenyl porphyrin Re(VII) trioxide (Re(NFTPP)O3) [8] and dichloro dioxo molybdenum(VI) (MoO2Cl2) [9] have been reported. Moreover, amine oxides were deoxygenated to amines by an MoO2Cl2 catalyst using hydrogen (H2) gas (50 atm) as a reducing agent at a high temperature (393 K) [10]. In addition to homogeneous catalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides, there have been several reports on deoxygenation of amine oxides over heterogeneous catalysts such as gold loaded on hydroxyapatite (Au/HAP) [11] and Au loaded on carbon nanotubes (Au/CNT) [12] in the presence of dimethylphenylsilane as a hydrogen donor. However, these catalytic systems need precious metals (Ru, Re, Mo and Au) as active sites for deoxygenation of amine oxides and are performed in undesirable organic solvents (such as 1,4-dioxane, dichloromethane). Therefore, a simpler catalytic reaction system for deoxygenation of amine oxides working under milder conditions is highly desired. A photocatalytic process can be regarded as one of the most promising methods for deoxygenation (reduction) of amine oxides to corresponding amines under milder conditions because a photocatalytic reaction occurs at a room temperature and under atmospheric pressure in the presence of a hole scavenger and satisfies almost all of the 12 proposed requirements for green chemistry [13]. A titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst, a representative semiconductor photocatalyst, causes redox reactions by electron-hole pairs formed in its conduction band and valence band when it is irradiated by UV light. Titanium is an abundant and inexpensive element because it has the tenth smallest Clarke number. Since TiO2 is a stable solid, TiO2 powder is easily separated from the reaction mixtures after the reaction and can be repeatedly used for reactions. The fact that TiO2 is not toxic for humans and the environment is consistent with the policy of green chemistry. Due to the strong oxidation power of holes in the valence band, detoxifying pollutants and decolorizing dyes over a TiO2 photocatalyst have been extensively studied. Production of H2 by water splitting and by degradation of organic wastes in water under deaerated conditions has also attracted attention. The number of reports on reductive conversion of organic compounds by using photogenerated electrons has recently been increasing [14,15]. However, most of the reports deal with reduction of nitrobenzene to aminobenzene [16–29]. In this background, we have focused on a new application of photocatalysis to conversion of organic compounds such as cyclization of amino acid in an aqueous suspension of platinum-loaded TiO2 [30,31] and other photocatalytic redox reactions for organic compounds [32–36]. During the course of our studies on photocatalytic transformation of various organic compounds [37–41], we have reported selective deoxygenation of sulfoxides to sulfides [42] and epoxides to alkenes [43] over a TiO2 photocatalyst at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. In these photocatalytic systems, photogenerated electrons were used for deoxygenation, while positive holes oxidize hydrogen (electron and proton) sources such as organic acids and alcohols. These photocatalytic processes are regarded as a redox reaction, i.e., reduction of sulfoxides and epoxides with the hydrogen sources. In this study, we examined photocatalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides in alcohol suspensions of pristine (cocatalyst-free) TiO2. Here we report 1) variation of this reaction system such as substrates (amine oxides) and alcohols and 2) effects of reaction conditions (amine oxide concentration, reaction temperature and light sources) on deoxygenation. The characteristic of this reaction system, i.e., a thermal acceleration effect, is discussed in detail on the basis of results of physicochemical analysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,2.1 Chemicals Various amine oxides and alcohols with guaranteed reagent grades were used without further purification. Pyridine N-oxide and ethanol were mainly used.
3,Photocatalytic deoxygenation of pyridine N-oxide in an alcohol suspension of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light,"2.2 Photocatalytic deoxygenation of pyridine N-oxide in an alcohol suspension of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light In a typical run, bare TiO2 (P 25, 50 mg) was suspended in an alcohol (5 cm3) containing pyridine N-oxide (PyNO, ca 50 μmol or ca. 500 μmol) in a test tube. The tube was sealed with a rubber septum under argon (Ar) and then photoirradiated at a wavelength > 300 nm by a high-pressure mercury arc (Eiko-sha, 400 W, Osaka) with magnetic stirring in a water bath kept at 293 K. In experiments to examine the effect of the reaction temperature, the reaction mixture in another water bath at various temperatures was photoirradiated with UV-LED (PJ-1505-2CA, CCS Inc., Kyoto) because the temperature of the reaction setup using high-pressure mercury arc was not controlled. Multi-wavelength irradiation monochromator (MM-3PK, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd, Tokyo) was used to obtain an action spectrum and details are described in supplementary information. The light source used for the reaction was described in figure captions. Product analysis was described in supplementary information."
4,Competitive adsorption of pyridine N-oxide and pyridine on TiO2 in an ethanol solution,"2.3 Competitive adsorption of pyridine N-oxide and pyridine on TiO2 in an ethanol solution TiO2 (P 25, 300 mg) was suspended in an ethanol solution (5 cm3) containing PyNO (500 μmol) and Py (500 μmol) in a test tube and sealed with a rubber septum under Ar. The test tube was magnetically stirred in a water bath for 4 h in the dark. After the suspension had been filtered to remove the particles, the amounts of PyNO and Py in the liquid phase were determined in the same way as that for the photocatalytic reaction."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalytic deoxygenation of pyridine N-oxide in a 2-propanol suspension of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light,"3.1 Photocatalytic deoxygenation of pyridine N-oxide in a 2-propanol suspension of TiO2 under irradiation of UV light Fig. 1 shows the results of photocatalytic reaction of PyNO (42 μmol) in a 2-propanol suspension of TiO2. After 30 min, Py was obtained in high yield (42 μmol, >99%), indicating that neither reaction of the aromatic ring nor re-oxidation of the amine group of Py occurred in the present system. As also shown in Fig. 1, the amount of acetone increased as the deoxygenation of PyNO to Py proceeded, and Py and acetone were obtained during the reaction. Since the amount of acetone was slightly larger than that of Py, a small amount of dissolved oxygen was reduced. Even after consumption of PyNO, CO2, which is the fully oxidized product, was not detected. These results clarified the characteristics of this reaction, i.e., stoichiometric redox reaction of PyNO and 2-propanol to Py and acetone occurs as shown in Eq. (1). (1) Eq. (1) shows that the by-product of this reaction is only H2O if acetone (a carbonyl compound) is regarded as a useful product. Based on this consideration, the atom efficiency of this reaction is calculated to be 88% according to Eq. (2), (2) Atom efficiency / %= molecular weight of desired product s (Py and acetone) molecular weight of all reactant s (PyNO and 2‐propanol) ×100 This large value indicates that this photocatalytic system satisfies a part of the green chemistry concept [13]. Table 1 summarizes catalytic deoxygenations of amine oxides to amines. However, in most cases, by-products derived from reductants such as PPh3 and dimethylphenylsilane were formed, resulting in small values of atomic efficiency in contrast to the present photocatalytic system. To determine the scope of applicability of different alcohols for the photocatalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides over TiO2, we applied various alcohols as hole scavengers (hydrogen donors) to deoxygenation of PyNO to Py. The results are summarized in Table 2 . In C3-C5 alcohols, Py was obtained in high yields and the values of RB were almost unity (Entries 1–5). We also found that glycerol, a typical biomass-derived compound, can be used as the electron source (Entry 6). Methanol and ethanol could be used for deoxygenation of PyNO at a higher concentration (0.1 mol dm−3 = 0.5 mmol/5 cm3) (Entries 7 and 8). These results indicate that a large variation of alcohols can be used in the photocatalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides to amines. Hereafter, we mainly used ethanol because it is a typical biomass-derived compound and is easy to use."
7,Effects of reaction conditions on photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py in ethanol suspensions of TiO2,"3.2 Effects of reaction conditions on photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py in ethanol suspensions of TiO2 Table 3 shows the effects of various reaction conditions on the deoxygenation of PyNO to Py in ethanol suspensions of TiO2. The TiO2 photocatalyst was reusable at least three times without notable loss of activity (Entries 1–3). The results of three blank reactions indicate that the TiO2 photocatalyst and UV light irradiation were indispensable for the deoxygenation of PyNO to Py (Entries 4–6). Various commercial TiO2 samples were used for deoxygenation of PyNO in a short time (30 min) (Entries 7–16). Nine samples (Japan Reference Catalysts, JRC-TIO series registered at the Catalysis Society of Japan) and MT-150A TiO2 were used. All TiO2 samples converted PyNO to Py. A clear correlation was not found between catalytic performance and physical properties of TiO2. These TiO2 samples are manufactured by different methods such as the chlorine method (gas phase method) and sulfuric acid method (liquid phase method) under different conditions (starting materials, temperatures and pressures), and these differences complicate the effects of physical properties on the photocatalytic performance due to variations in crystal form, crystallinity, impurities, specific surface area and other factors. In the action spectrum (Fig. 2 , see details in supplementary information), the wavelength dependency of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) value over TiO2 was similar to that of photoabsorption, indicating that the production of Py from PyNO in an ethanol suspension of TiO2 was induced by the photoabsorption due to its band gap excitation. The value of AQE reached 32.7% at 361 nm and 3.1 % at 413 nm. The shift of absorption edge and deoxygenation under visible light irradiation are caused by the rutile phase of P 25 (Table 3). As far as we know, this is the first report showing selective deoxygenation of amine oxides to amines under UV light irradiation without the use of H2 and undesirable additives."
8,Applicability of photocatalytic deoxygenation of various amine oxides in ethanol suspensions of TiO2,"3.3 Applicability of photocatalytic deoxygenation of various amine oxides in ethanol suspensions of TiO2 To evaluate the applicability of a TiO2 photocatalyst in deoxygenation of amine oxides under irradiation of UV light, various amine oxides were used as substrates and the results are summarized in Table 4 . When PyNO having a methyl group was used as substrate, the corresponding amine was obtained with high selectivity (Entry 1). Amine oxides having reducible functional groups such as cyano, carboxyl and chlorine were also examined. 4-Cyanopyridine N-oxide (Entry 2), isonicotinic acid N-oxide (Entry 3) and 3-chloropyridine N-oxide (Entry 4) were almost completely reduced to the corresponding amines with maintenance of the reducible groups. Isoquinoline N-oxide (Entry 5) and 4-phenylpyridine N-oxide (Entry 6) were converted to isoquinoline and 4-phenylpyridine, respectively, with high selectivity. These results indicate that various amine oxides having reducible groups can be chemoselectively converted to the corresponding amines over a TiO2 photocatalyst without the use of any additives and the need for careful observation. We previously achieved photocatalytic reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzene to benzene over palladium-loaded TiO2 (Pd-TiO2) [44] and photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of an aromatic ring to an aliphatic ring over rhodium-loaded TiO2 (Rh-TiO2) [41] under irradiation of UV light. In the deoxygenation of amine oxides, these reducible groups were not influenced because TiO2 was used without a co-catalyst."
9,Effects of concentration and reaction temperature on deoxygenation of PyNO in an ethanol suspension of a TiO2 photocatalyst,"3.4 Effects of concentration and reaction temperature on deoxygenation of PyNO in an ethanol suspension of a TiO2 photocatalyst Photocatalytic reaction of PyNO in ethanol was carried out in a water bath kept at 295 K and 337 K under irradiation of UV light (λmax: 368 nm, 26 mW cm−2) from a UV-LED (PJ-1505-2CA, CCS Inc., Kyoto). As shown in Fig. 3 , 500 μmol of PyNO in 0.1 mol dm-3 ethanol solution was almost completely converted to Py at 295 K after photoirradiation for 6 h. The reaction at 337 K revealed that photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py over TiO2 was accelerated at 337 K and that the time required to complete the reaction was greatly shortened only by a slight elevation of the reaction temperature (42 K) (Fig. 3). To evaluate the possibility of photocatalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides over TiO2 for practical use, photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO at a higher concentration (0.42 mol dm-3 = 2.1 mmol/5 cm3) was examined (Figure S1) at 337 K under the same irradiation condition. After 8-h photoirradiation, PyNO was almost quantitatively reduced to Py. In the last condition, the turnover number for Py formation based on the amount of TiO2 (50 mg, 0.63 mmol) was calculated to be 3.3. These results show that TiO2 worked as a catalytic material and that a TiO2 photocatalyst can be used for deoxygenation of amine oxides. To understand the effect of reaction temperature, photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO was examined at various temperatures for 1 h (Fig. 4 (a)). At any temperature, deoxygenation of PyNO to Py proceeded with maintenance of high selectivity. Since Fig. 1 shows that photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO over TiO2 can be treated as zero-order kinetics, rate constants (k values) at various temperatures were determined from the slope of the plot of yield against reaction time. As shown in Fig. 4(b), a linear correlation was observed in the Arrhenius plot, i.e., the plot of the logarithm of k against reciprocal of temperature, and the apparent activation energy (E a) was calculated to be 25 kJ mol−1 from the slope. Since the relatively large value of E a interested us, we examined the effect of reaction temperature on another reaction in an ethanol suspension of a TiO2 photocatalyst. In the reduction of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol (Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV)-type reduction) [39], the yield of benzyl alcohol slightly increased at elevated temperatures (Fig. S2(a)) and the value of E a for the photocatalytic MPV-type reduction was calculated to be 11 kJ mol−1 (Fig. S2(b)), which is almost the same as the value of E a (ca. 10 kJ mol−1) in photocatalytic H2 evolution from sacrificial reagents such as alcohol and water over various semiconductor materials [45–49]. The larger value of E a for the photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py over TiO2 suggests that a process other than generation of electrons and positive holes under light irradiation is the rate-determining process. The value of E a for photocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes in alcohol suspensions of copper-loaded TiO2 had been determined to be 54 kJ mol-1 and it had been concluded that the catalytic process, i.e., hydrogenation of alkynes over the copper co-catalyst, controlled the overall reaction [50]. Since no co-catalyst was used in the present reaction, the possibility that the catalytic process controls the reaction can be eliminated. It is known that both adsorption of a substrate(s) on the catalyst surface and desorption of a product(s) from the active sites are important processes of catalytic reactions. In the case of a photocatalytic reaction, the reaction rate is determined by the amount of the substrate adsorbed on the photocatalyst [51]. From these results and the results of this study, we reached the idea that the reaction rate of deoxygenation of PyNO is dependent of the amount(s) of species adsorbed on the TiO2 surface and that the amount(s) is dependent of the temperature."
10,Effect of temperature on adsorption of PyNO and Py on the surface of TiO2,"3.5 Effect of temperature on adsorption of PyNO and Py on the surface of TiO2 To clarify the effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py, we examined competitive adsorption of PyNO and Py in the dark at various temperatures (Fig. 5 ). Three important results were obtained: 1) both PyNO and Py were adsorbed on TiO2 powder and Py was adsorbed more than PyNO was, 2) PyNO and Py were less adsorbed at a higher temperature and the total amount of PyNO and Py adsorbed decreased to one-third at 333 K compared with the total amount at 295 K, and 3) the temperature dependencies of the adsorption of PyNO and the adsorption of Py were different, i.e., Py adsorption was affected more negatively than PyNO adsorption was at a higher temperature. The ratio of amounts of PyNO and Py (PyNOads/Pyads) increased with elevation of the temperature as also shown in Fig. 5. Py is often used as a probe molecule to estimate types of acid sites through Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy [52]. Therefore, result 1) was explained by the acid-base interaction between TiO2 and Py. Result 2) was explained by the exothermic nature of adsorption on a solid surface. The large decrease in the amounts of both PyNO and Py adsorbed at a higher temperature indicates that the amount of ethanol solvent adsorbed on the TiO2 surface increased instead, although estimation of the amount of ethanol adsorbed on the TiO2 surface is difficult. The amount of ethanol adsorption, at least, increased with the same amount of PyNO and Py desorbed at a higher temperature, resulting in efficient hole trapping by ethanol. The increase in the value of PyNOads/Pyads indicates that the ratio of ethanol to PyNO increased at a higher temperature, which greatly contributes to the large increase in the total rate of the photocatalytic reaction at an elevated temperature."
11,Photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py under solar light,"3.6 Photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO to Py under solar light In order to demonstrate the possibility of practical use of photocatalytic deoxygenation of amine oxides to amines over a metal-free TiO2 photocatalyst, we examined this reaction in the same test tube under solar light with and without magnetic stirring (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 7 shows the time courses of deoxygenation of PyNO to Py and the reaction conditions (UV light intensity and temperature) measured using a data logger (TR-74Ui, T&D Corporation, Tokyo). The time courses of light intensity (I) and temperature show that UV light at around 2 mW cm−2 was stably supplied and that the temperature of the reaction system was elevated at around 330 K by solar light. As expected from the results obtained with artificial light sources (mercury arc, Xe lamp and UV-LED), deoxygenation of PyNO to Py occurred under solar light and 500 μmol of PyNO was almost converted in 4 h with magnetic stirring. These results indicate that solar energy (solar light energy and solar thermal energy) was effectively used for photocatalytic deoxygenation. Very interestingly, 249 μmol of Py (ca. 50% yield) was obtained even under the static condition (no magnetic stirring) with only a part of TiO2 being suspended and most of it being precipitated. The results under the static condition indicate that the deoxygenation process requires no energy other than passive solar energy."
12,Conclusions,"Photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO in a 2-propanol suspension of pristine TiO2 under irradiation of UV light with 2-propanol acting as a hydrogen donor was examined, and it was found that Py and acetone were formed with a high stoichiometry. The photocatalytic deoxygenation occurred under very mild conditions compared with the conditions for other heterogeneous and homogeneous thermocatalytic systems, and its atom efficiency (88% for the case of PyNO and ethanol over TiO2) is larger than the atom efficiencies of the thermocatalytic systems. Action spectrum analysis showed that the deoxygenation was driven by photoabsorption due to the band-gap excitation of TiO2, and the value of AQE reached 32.7% at 298 K under irradiation of light (λ = 361 nm). The TiO2 photocatalyst was recyclable for the deoxygenation of PyNO to Py without notable loss of activity. Various amine oxides were successfully deoxygenated to corresponding amines in high yields, and various alcohols were used for this reaction. A slight elevation of the reaction temperature from 295 K to 337 K (ΔT = 42 K) greatly accelerated the reaction rate, and the time required to complete the reaction was greatly shortened. The photocatalytic system was applied for conversion of PyNO in 0.42 mol dm−3 at 337 K. Kinetic study revealed that the photocatalytic deoxygenation of PyNO over TiO2 had a relatively large value of E a (25 kJ mol-1) compared to typical values of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (ca. 10 kJ mol-1) and photocatalytic Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley-type reduction (11 kJ mol-1). Adsorption experiments at various temperatures showed that the amounts of both PyNO and Py adsorbed decreased at a higher temperature and that the amount of ethanol solvent adsorbed on the TiO2 surface increased instead, resulting in efficient hole trapping by ethanol and an increase in the reaction rate. Solar light drove the deoxygenation of PyNO even under a static condition, in which both solar light energy and solar thermal energy were effectively utilized for the photocatalytic reaction."
