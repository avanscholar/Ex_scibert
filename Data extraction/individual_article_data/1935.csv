0,Introduction,"Due to the increasing demands for energy and the unsustainability of conventional fossil resources, the utilization of renewable resources is of great significance. Biomass, which is environmental friendly, holds an important position among the renewable energy all over the world. The bio-oil obtained from biomass fast pyrolysis has the advantages of high energy density and convenience for transportation. However, its application is limited due to its high oxygen content and poor stability and thus further refining is necessary. Catalytic cracking over zeolite catalysts is an important bio-oil upgrading technology. It can remove the oxygen in bio-oil in the forms of CO2, CO and H2O, and aromatic hydrocarbons in the gasoline distillation range can be obtained [1]. Therefore, it is a promising way to utilize bio-oil instead of fossil fuels to produce aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the problems of low aromatic hydrocarbon yield and serious catalyst deactivation by coke formation exist in the bio-oil direct cracking process. Zhang et al. [2] studied the direct cracking of bio-oil over HZSM-5 catalyst, and the results showed that the carbon selectivity of coke was up to 49.5%. Thus, the improvement of cracking process is necessary to increase the conversion efficiency of bio-oil. In view of the extremely complicated composition of bio-oil, model compounds were often studied first when conducting cracking process improvement [3]. Furfural is a typical component in bio-oil, and the furanic ring and the aldehyde functional group in it are representative. It was reported that the content of furanic ring in the bio-oil volatile was about 24.3% [4]. In the study of furan cracking over ZSM-5 catalyst by Cheng et al. [5], the conversion of furan was only 48% and a high coke yield of 33.8% was obtained. Meanwhile, for the cracking of aldehyde compounds [6], it was also found that the conversion efficiency to hydrocarbons was low and the catalyst was easily coked and deactivated. Therefore, choosing furfural as a model compound of bio-oil to study the improvement of cracking process has a great referential significance for solving the coking problem during bio-oil cracking. Researches have mentioned [7,8] that the coking problem in bio-oil cracking was attributed to the high oxygen content and high degree of unsaturation. When dehydration reaction happens to remove oxygen, some hydrogen is taken away, and combining with the low hydrogen content in the feedstock, the formation of cracking products with low H/C ratios is favored [8]. Therefore, if enough hydrogen can be provided for cracking, the coke formation can be suppressed and more liquid aromatic hydrocarbons can be produced. Now there are two ways to supply hydrogen for the cracking process: one is hydrogenation pretreatment of feedstock before cracking [9,10] and the other is coprocessing some hydrogen-rich compounds during cracking [11]. Hydrogenation pretreatment is usually conducted under mild conditions. It aims at saturating some unsaturated compounds in bio-oil, such as compounds with carbon-carbon double bond and aldehydes. As a result, the coking problem in cracking due to the hydrogen-lacking property of feedstock was relieved. The research of bio-oil hydrogenation-cracking carried out by Vispute et al. [9] showed that, some unsaturated compounds like aldehydes and ketones were turned into the corresponding alcohols through mild hydrogenation, and because of the increase of hydrogen content in feedstock, the coke yield was reduced in the cracking stage. For the two-stage hydrogenation-cracking process, the hydrogenation degree of bio-oil components in the hydrogenation stage, which corresponds to the amount of hydrogen supplied, may affect the subsequent cracking process. In the studies of hydrotreatment of typical bio-oil components by Shin et al. [12] and Gutierrez et al. [13], it was found that the double bonds were saturated by hydrogenation at a low temperature first and then hydrodeoxygenation took place as the increase of hydrogenation temperature. Therefore, it is important to regulate the hydrogen supply by selecting the suitable hydrogenation temperature so as to improve the overall efficiency of the hydrogenation-cracking process. In addition, coprocessing hydrogen-rich materials like methanol can also supply hydrogen and thus promote the transformation of bio-oil. In the study of cocracking of bio-oil model compounds and methanol, Mentzel et al. [8] pointed out that the existence of methanol could suppress coke formation and extend the lifetime of catalyst. For the cocracking process, the coprocessing ratio will determine the amount of hydrogen that can be supplied. The results of cocracking of hydroxyacetone and ethanol obtained by Wang et al. [14] showed that, a too low coprocessing ratio of ethanol would lead to the low selectivity and quality of the generated oil phase. Meanwhile, taking the economy into consideration, it is necessary to find a suitable coprocessing ratio for cocracking. Taking the inferior cracking characteristics of furfural into consideration, hydrogenation pretreatment and methanol-coprocessing were combined in this work to supply hydrogen for the conversion of furfural to aromatic hydrocarbons. The regulation of hydrogen supply was conducted by varying the hydrogenation temperature and the methanol coprocessing ratio."
1,Experimental,"Furfural (FF) was purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng chemical co., LTD, and methanol (MeOH) was purchased from Sinopharm chemical reagent co., LTD. The hydrogenation catalyst Ni-Cu/SiO2 was prepared by incipient impregnation method, and the loading amounts of Ni and Cu were both 5wt.%. Before the hydrogenation experiment, the catalyst was reduced at 500°C for 2h with a H2 flow rate of 50mL/min. HZSM-5 (Si/Al=25) zeolite was used as the cracking catalyst. The experimental system is shown in Fig. 1 . For the single-stage hydrogenation experiment, only one reactor was used, while two reactors were connected for two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking process. 2g of Ni-Cu/SiO2 and HZSM-5 catalysts were supported on quartz wool and packed in the hydrogenation and cracking reactors, respectively. The mixed reactants were pumped by a HPLC pump. H2 was used to maintain the reaction pressure, and its flow rate was 50mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of the reactants was kept at 2h−1. Liquid product and non-condensable gas were separated and obtained after the condensation of outlet gas from the reactor. Each operation ran for 5h. The cracking temperature and system pressure were set at 400°C and 4MPa, respectively. The effects of different hydrogenation temperatures (150°C, 200°C, 250°C and 300°C) and different methanol coprocessing ratios in the feedstock (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) on hydrogenation-cocracking were studied. Here, the coprocessing ratio was defined as the mass percentage of a specific compound in the feedstock. The obtained products included gaseous product, liquid product and coke. The gaseous products were analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6820). The liquid product obtained from one-stage hydrogenation was homogeneous, while the liquid product after cracking contained separable oil phase and aqueous phase. The homogeneous liquid product from hydrogenation and oil phase product from cracking were analyzed qualitatively by a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry system (GC–MS), and then analyzed quantitatively through the area normalization method. The residual reactants in the liquid products were quantified by a gas chromatography. The mass of the coke on the surface of catalyst was measured by thermogravimetry analysis. The calculation formulas of reactant conversion and product yield are shown as follows, in which the symbol “m” represents the mass of the corresponding substances and the subscripts “in” and “out” represent inlet and outlet of the reaction system.

3,Hydrogen supply regulation by varying hydrogenation temperature,"3.1 Hydrogen supply regulation by varying hydrogenation temperature 3.1.1 Hydroprocessing behavior Considering that the hydrogenation temperature may affect the hydrogenation degree of furfural which corresponds to the amount of hydrogen supplied in the hydrogenation stage and thus result in different cracking performances, the hydrogenation behaviors of furfural and methanol at different reaction temperatures were studied first. A mixture of 25% furfural and 75% methanol was used as the feedstock. The conversions of the reactants in hydroprocessing at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2(a). Furfural was almost completely converted at all hydrogenation temperatures, while the conversion of methanol remained at a low level in the range of 150–250°C and a little increase at 300°C was observed. The yields of products in hydroprocessing at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2(b). The liquid product yield was above 95% between 150°C and 250°C, and it decreased to 85.2% at 300°C. The yields of COX and gaseous hydrocarbons were low in the temperature range of 150–250°C, while higher yields of COX and gaseous hydrocarbons were observed at 300°C. In particular, the gaseous hydrocarbon yield (mainly saturated hydrocarbons) reached to 7.3% at 300°C. This illustrated that decomposition and hydrodeoxygenation reactions were enhanced at high temperature, which generate more gaseous hydrocarbons. In the study of tetrahydrofuran hydrogenation by Furlmsky [15], the yield of gaseous hydrocarbons increased gradually with the increase of hydrogenation temperature. In the study of furfural hydrogenation, Sitthisa et al. [16] also found that a high temperature was beneficial for the generation of saturated gaseous hydrocarbons. The liquid products were analyzed by GC–MS, and the identified components (excluding unconverted furfural and methanol) were classified into five groups namely single-furanic-ring compounds (SFRC), tetrahydro-single-furanic-ring compounds (THSFRC), furanic dimers (FD), alcohols and ketones, as shown in Fig. 3 . The contents of SFRC were as high as 99.0% and 94.0% at 150°C and 200°C, respectively. With the increase of hydrogenation temperature, the content of SFRC decreased significantly. In the temperature range of 150–250°C, the content of THSFRC kept increasing as the increase of hydrogenation temperature, reached the maximum value of 26.2% at 250°C, and then decreased to 17.0% at 300°C. Few alcohols were produced at 150°C and 200°C while its content in the liquid products increased remarkably to 14.2% and 44.0% at 250°C and 300°C, respectively. In addition, a few FD, ketones, and some other substances were also observed in the liquid products at higher temperatures. Based on the composition of liquid products and the reaction mechanism of furfural hydrogenation proposed by Zheng et al. [17], it was deduced that the initial hydrogenation products of furfural were SFRC, which were predominant at 150°C and 200°C. The typical SFRC included furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, 2-methoxymethyl-furan, which showed that the aldehyde group of furfural was first saturated to form furfuryl alcohol, and then the generated alcohol hydroxyl group was eliminated or underwent etherification with methanol. THSFRC, such as 2-methoxymethyl tetrahydrofuran and 2-tetrahydrofuranmethanol, started to be generated at 250°C, corresponding to the saturation of parts of furanic rings through hydrogenation. Meanwhile, some alcohols like n-butanol and 1,2-pentanediol were also obtained at 250°C, indicating a certain intensity of hydro-ring-opening reactions after the hydrogenation of furanic rings. When the temperature increased to 300°C, the content of THSFRC decreased, but the content of alcohols increased significantly. This demonstrated that the hydro-ring-opening reactions of THSFRC were further promoted at a higher temperature. Additionally, a few furanic dimers (FD) were also detected, which might be attributed to the condensation of some SFRC. In the cracking study of bio-oil model compounds by Gayubo et al. [6] and Mentzel et al. [8], it was found that higher saturation degree of feedstock led to higher yield of aromatic hydrocarbons and lower yield of coke, and alcohols showed the best cracking activity. Meanwhile, linear ethers were also proved to have superior cracking performances [18,19]. For the hydrogenation of furfural and methanol, the saturation of the aldehyde group was almost completed at 150°C and 200°C, while few furanic rings were hydrogenated at these two temperatures. Meanwhile, a small amount of methanol was converted to linear ether structure which had good cracking characteristics. At the temperature of 250°C, the aldehyde group of furfural was efficiently hydrogenated, and a part of furanic rings were also hydrogenated, as well as some further ring-opening reactions, resulting in the formation of THSFRC and alcohols. Therefore, the hydrogenation products under 250°C might be more suitable for subsequent cracking than those under 150°C and 200°C. It was found that more alcohols were produced at the hydrogenation temperature of 300°C. However, more saturated gaseous hydrocarbons were also generated through hydrodeoxygenation, which might have a negative influence on the oil phase products yield in the following cracking process because of the low cracking reactivity of saturated gaseous hydrocarbon on HZSM-5 catalyst [20]. The above discussion showed that the variation of hydrogen temperature successfully regulated the hydrogenation degree of furfural in the hydrogenation stage, which was very important for the subsequent cracking process. 3.1.2 Hydrogenation-cocracking behavior Based on the effects of reaction temperature on the hydrogenation behaviors of furfural and methanol, further research concerning the effects of hydrogenation temperature on the overall hydrogenation-cocracking process was conducted. The feedstock was still a mixture of 25% furfural and 75% methanol. Fig. 4(a) shows the conversion of reactants from hydrogenation-cocracking using different hydrogenation temperatures. It was found that the conversions of furfural and methanol were both between 98% and 100%. The yield of products is shown in Fig. 4(b). The yield of oil phase increased with the increase of hydrogenation temperature, reached a maximum value of 26.4% at 250°C, and then slightly decreased at 300°C. The yield of aqueous phase was between 44% and 48% under all conditions. The yields of COX and gaseous hydrocarbons decreased with the increase of hydrogenation temperature in the range of 150–250°C, and when the hydrogenation temperature rose from 250°C to 300°C, an obvious increase of gaseous hydrocarbon yield was observed. The coke yield was below 5%, and it reduced gradually with the increase of hydrogenation temperature. The composition of oil phase products in hydrogenation-cocracking using different hydrogenation temperatures is shown in Fig. 5 . The oil phase products were all completely composed of hydrocarbons, in which the content of monoaromatics ranged from 83% to 88%. The total content of naphthalenes and indenes was about 6–11% and the aliphatic hydrocarbons accounted for 5–7%. According to the conclusions drawn in literatures [6,21], the deoxygenation pathway in the cracking process was affected by the saturation degree of the feedstock. Dehydration was predominant during the cracking of compounds with high saturation degrees, while decarbonylation and decarboxylation were the main deoxygenation pathways for the compounds with low saturation degree. Meanwhile, a low saturation degree of feedstock also favored to the formation of coke. The above study of hydrogenation behaviors of furfural and methanol showed that at the hydrogenation temperatures of 150°C and 200°C, the hydrogenation of furanic ring was insufficient and thus the unsaturation degree of the hydrogenation products was higher than that at 250°C. As a result, in the cracking stage the trends of decarbonylation and decarboxylation to produce COX and the formation of coke were more obvious, which reduced the carbon selectivity of oil phase products. Additionally, the hydrogenation of furfural and methanol at 300°C produced more saturated gaseous hydrocarbons with low cracking activity, which also resulted in the decrease of oil phase yield in the subsequent cocracking stage. Therefore, the oil phase yield reached the maximum value when the hydrogenation temperature was 250°C. Based on the influence of hydrogenation temperature on the yield and quality of the oil phase, it was confirmed that the regulation of hydrogen supply by the variation of hydrogenation temperature in the hydrogenation stage, which led to the different saturation degrees of the hydrogenation products, consequently resulted in the difference in liquid aromatic hydrocarbon generation for the cracking stage. The optimum hydrogenation temperature in the hydrogenation stage was 250°C. Furthermore, to illustrate the importance of hydrogen supply by the hydroprocessing pretreatment, the direct cracking of 25% furfural and 75% methanol without hydroprocessing was conducted to be compared with the two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking processes. The result showed that although the reactants were almost completely converted, the oil phase product yield was only 16.8% containing hydrocarbons of 94.6% and furanic compounds of 5.4%. Therefore, the yield of liquid hydrocarbons was obviously lower than those in two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking processes. This result demonstrated that the hydrogen supply by hydroprocessing pretreatment which could saturate the aldehyde group and furan ring was significant, because it could improve the deoxygenation efficiency and facilitate the formation of liquid hydrocarbons."
4,Hydrogen supply regulation by varying methanol coprocessing ratio,"3.2 Hydrogen supply regulation by varying methanol coprocessing ratio 3.2.1 Hydroprocessing behavior Similar to the previous research of hydrogenation temperature, the effects of methanol coprocessing ratio on the hydrogenation behaviors of furfural and methanol were investigated first, and the optimal hydrogenation temperature of 250°C obtained before was selected as the hydrogenation temperature. The conversions of reactants in hydroprocessing with different methanol coprocessing ratios are shown in Fig. 6(a). Under all conditions, furfural was nearly completely converted, while the conversion of methanol increased from 4.2% to 37.7% when the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased from 75% to 25%. Fig. 6(b) shows that the yields of liquid products from hydroprocessing with different methanol coprocessing ratios were all above 90%, while the yields of COX and gaseous hydrocarbons were very low. Fig. 7 shows the composition of liquid products (excluding unconverted furfural and methanol). The contents of SFRC were between 40% and 65%, and higher contents of SFRC were observed when the methanol coprocessing ratios were 50% and 75%. The content of FD increased continuously as the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased, which reached the highest value of 27.6% when 100% furfural was used as the feedstock. Therefore, the decrease of SFRC content when the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased from 25% to 0 was due to the condensation reactions. The contents of THSFRC and alcohols increased with the increase of methanol coprocessing ratio in the feedstock. Meanwhile, the total content of compounds produced from etherification involving methanol, including 2-methoxymethyl-furan and 2-methoxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran, was in the range of 10%–17%. Therefore, the increase of methanol conversion with the decrease of methanol coprocessing ratio was mainly attributed to the larger amount of furfural fed in, which underwent hydrogenation and then etherification to consume more methanol, and also the smaller amount of methanol fed in. In general, the decrease of methanol coprocessing ratio did not significantly change the categories of hydrogenation products but affect the hydrogenation degree to some extent because the transforming ability of the hydrogenation catalyst was limited. 3.2.2 Hydrogenation-cocracking behavior Based on the hydrogenation behaviors, the influence of methanol coprocessing ratio on hydrogenation-cocracking was further studied to investigate the regulation of hydrogen supply by methanol-coprocessing. The temperatures of hydrogenation and cracking were set at 250°C and 400°C, and the results were compared with direct cracking of methanol at 400°C. The conversions of reactants in hydrogenation-cocracking with different methanol coprocessing ratios are shown in Fig. 8(a). With the decrease of methanol coprocessing ratio, the conversions of furfural were all above 95%, while the conversion of methanol decreased slightly but were still higher than 90%. The decrease of methanol conversion might be owing to the competition of transformations of methanol and furfural on the limited active sites of the cracking catalyst when more furfural was fed in. Fig. 8(b) shows the yields of products. The oil phase yields were 26.4%, 23.2% and 29.5% when the methanol coprocessing ratios were 75%, 50%, 25%, respectively, whereas that of 100% furfural hydrogenation-cocracking dramatically increased to 54.1%. The oil phase yield from 100% methanol cracking was 22.6%, which was lower than those in hydrogenation-cocracking processes. Meanwhile, high yields of aqueous phase product and gaseous hydrocarbons were observed in 100% methanol cracking, which was related to the relatively high hydrogen and oxygen contents of methanol. When the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased from 100% to 0%, the aqueous phase yield decreased from 51.6% to 17.4% and the COX yield increased gradually. This was mainly due to the larger amount of highly unsaturated furanic ring structures which favored the removal of oxygen in the form of COX during cracking. In addition, it was found that the coke yield increased from 1.8% to 9.6% when the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased from 100% to 25%, and then slightly decreased for hydrogenation-cocracking of 100% furfural. In a typical condition with the methanol coprocessing ratio of 75%, the coke yield was only 3.1%, which was much lower than the coke yield of 49.5% in the direct cracking process of bio-oil [2] and the coke yield of 33.8% in furan cracking [5]. This result illustrated that methanol had a promotion effect on the cracking of furfural hydrogenation products and could attenuate coke formation efficiently. Because of the easy coking characteristics of furanic ring structures, when the methanol amount for cocracking was insufficient, carbonaceous deposits would easily form on the catalyst surface. As a result, the activity of the catalyst would be reduced and thereby its ability for aromatization was affected, which led to the release of more gaseous hydrocarbons as observed in hydrogenation-cocracking with methanol coprocessing ratios of 50% and 25%. The composition of oil phase products from hydrogenation-cocracking with different methanol coprocessing ratios is shown in Fig. 9 . The oil phase was completely composed of hydrocarbons when the methanol coprocessing ratios were 100% and 75%, and higher aromatic hydrocarbon content was observed in the latter one. As the methanol coprocessing ratio decreased from 50% to 0%, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons decreased from 68.3% to 24.4% and the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons were all less than 1%, while the content of furans (including furfural, other SFRC and FD) increased from 22.1% to 46.2%. Certain amounts of THSFRC and alcohols were observed in the oil phase products from 100% furfural hydrogenation-cracking. These results showed that the existence of methanol which could supply hydrogen significantly promote the conversion of hydrogenation products of furfural into liquid hydrocarbons. The capacity of hydrogen supply in the cracking stage was determined by the coprocessing ratio of methanol in the feedstock, and more hydrogen could be supplied by increasing methanol coprocessing ratio to achieve higher degree of deoxygenation and higher yield of desired products. Meanwhile, it was found that the hydrogenation-cocracking of 25% furfural and 75% methanol was more advantageous than direct cracking of methanol for the generation of liquid aromatic hydrocarbons. This was mainly attributed to the hydrogen-rich characteristics of methanol which strengthened the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the cracking process, and the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons with relatively low H/C ratios could be promoted by a moderate incorporation of unsaturated compounds. The previous hydrogenation study of 100% furfural showed that a great deal of furanic products was generated. Without the hydrogen supply by methanol in the cracking stage, these furanic compounds were difficult to be converted because of the low cracking activity of the furanic ring structure. Consequently, a large number of byproducts containing furanic rings entered into the oil phase products, leading to the high yield of oil phase and the low yield of gaseous hydrocarbons. According to the influence of methanol coprocessing ratio on the hydrogenation-cocracking results, it could be concluded 75% was the optimum methanol coprocessing ratio, under which sufficient hydrogen could be supplied from methanol for the conversion of furfural hydrogenation products."
5,Discussion of the two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking reaction mechanism,"3.3 Discussion of the two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking reaction mechanism On the basis of the experimental results, a two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking mechanism of furfural and methanol was proposed as shown in Fig. 10 . The mechanism included two stages namely hydrogenation stage and cocracking stage. In the hydrogenation stage, first the aldehyde group of furfural was hydrogenated to form furfuryl alcohol. Afterwards, furfuryl alcohol could undergo elimination of the terminal hydroxyl group to generate methyl furan, and etherification with methanol to generate 2-methoxymethyl-furan. According to the distribution of hydrogenation products, all these reactions could occur under the temperatures between 150°C and 300°C. When the hydrogenation temperature was beyond 250°C, saturation of furanic ring and further hydro-ring-opening reactions happened to generate THSFRC and alcohols, while these products were hardly found at 150–200°C, indicating that the aldehyde group in furfural a had higher hydrogenation activity than the furan ring structure. In the study of furfural hydrogenation by Zheng et al. [17], it was also found that when the hydrogen temperature was 200°C, furanic products predominated, while a significant amount of products from saturation of furanic ring and further hydro-ring-opening reactions was observed at 250°C. Meanwhile, decomposition and hydrodeoxygenation of THSFRC and alcohols also occurred to produce saturated gaseous hydrocarbon at 250°C and 300°C, and these reactions were more intensive at 300°C. As summarized by Elliott [22], the hydrodeoxygenation of aliphatic ethers and aliphatic alcohols started at 250°C, and higher reaction temperature promoted the hydrodeoxygenation of the compounds with relatively stable chemical characteristics. Generally, the hydrogenation of aldehyde group in furfural was almost completely achieved by hydrogen supply in the hydrogenation stage, which played a positive role in reducing the coke formation in the cracking process. In the cracking stage, as mentioned in the literatures [14,23], the bio-oil oxygenated components first underwent deoxygenation to form light olefin intermediates, and then aromatic hydrocarbons were produced by the further aromatization of light olefins. In this work, as the feedstock for the cracking stage, the hydrogenation products of furfural and methanol also followed this way to produce aromatic hydrocarbons. However, due to difference in chemical structures, different hydrogenation products showed different cracking activities. The hydrogenation products mainly included furanic compounds, THSFRC, alcohols and saturated gaseous hydrocarbons. The cracking activity of saturated gaseous hydrocarbons was low. THSFRC and alcohols were the completely saturated oxygen-containing compounds, which could be more easily transformed into light olefins by deoxygenation [21]. In the cracking process of furanic compounds, the study by Cheng et al. [5] showed that because of the high unsaturation degree, light olefin intermediates were formed by deoxygenation accompanied with coke formation, and the conversion was low. Therefore, to inhibit coke formation during deoxygenation of furanic compounds, hydrogen supply was needed. In this paper, methanol was introduced as a hydrogen supplier to promote the catalytic cracking of furfural hydrogenation products. In the cracking of individual methanol [24], first light olefins like ethylene and propylene were obtained by dehydration of methanol, and then these light olefins (H/C=2) underwent aromatization to form aromatic hydrocarbons with relatively low H/C ratios, which could generate surplus hydrogen atoms. Through hydrogen transfer reactions, these surplus hydrogen atoms could participate in the deoxygenation process of furanic compounds, and thus promoted the conversion of furanic compounds to light olefin intermediates, inhibited the formation of coke, and thereby increased the overall efficiency of cracking. The above discussion on hydrogenation-cocracking mechanism showed that among the hydrogenation products of furfural, THSFRC and alcohols were the most suitable for the subsequent cracking. Therefore, the regulation of hydrogen supply by hydrogenation temperature was achieved by the appropriate hydrogenation degree at 250°C, which produced THSFRC and alcohols as many as possible and did not produce many gaseous hydrocarbons. However, because of the inevitable formation of furanic compounds, using methanol as the coprocessing feedstock was still necessary. Meanwhile, according to the cocracking mechanism in the cracking stage, the amount of hydrogen supplied from methanol for the conversion of furanic compounds was determined by the coprocessing ratio of methanol. Therefore, under a high methanol coprocessing ratio such as 75% in this work, sufficient hydrogen could be supplied to promote the conversion of furanic compounds from furfural hydrogenation to liquid hydrocarbons, and oil phase with high yield and quality could be obtained. When methanol was insufficient for cocracking, the conversion efficiency of furanic ring was affected, resulting in the formation of a large number of furanic by-products in the oil phase, and meanwhile the selectivity of coke increased."
6,Conclusions,"In this paper, a two-stage hydrogenation-cocracking process was developed for the conversion of furfural to aromatic hydrocarbons, and the regulation of hydrogen supply was investigated. The hydrogen supply in the hydrogenation stage was successfully regulated by the hydrogenation temperature. 250°C was the optimum temperature because of the appropriate hydrogenation degree of furfural under it, which facilitated the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons in the cracking stage. Meanwhile, the regulation of hydrogen supply in the cracking stage was studied by varying methanol coprocessing ratio. A methanol coprocessing ratio of 75% was found to be suitable because it could supply sufficient hydrogen for the efficient conversion of furanic compounds and the suppression of coke. Under the optimum condition, the yield of oil phase was up to 26.4%, and it was completely composed of hydrocarbons, in which the content of aromatic hydrocarbons reached 94.4%. Based on the experimental results, the corresponding regulatory mechanism was explained through building the hydrogenation-cocracking reaction mechanism."
