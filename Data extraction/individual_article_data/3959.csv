0,Introduction,"Heavy metals are present in significant concentrations in some industrial wastewaters and municipal sludge, and are often the leading cause for the upset of the wastewater treatment process (Lester et al., 1983; Stronach et al., 1986; Fang and Chan, 1997). Heavy metals can be stimulatory, inhibitory, or even toxic in biochemical reactions depending on their concentrations. A trace level of many metals is required for activation or function of many enzymes and co-enzymes. Excessive amounts, however, can lead to inhibition or toxicity. This is mostly due to the chemical binding of heavy metals to the enzymes, resulting in the disruption of enzyme structure and activities (Vallee and Ulmer, 1972). Sludge and concentrated wastewater are conventionally treated by anaerobic processes leading to the production of methane (Gallert et al., 2003). More recently, a new anaerobic technology has been developed to convert organic wastes into H2 (Li and Fang, 2007). Recent research has shown that the H2-producing sludge may agglutinate into granules, similar to methane-producing sludge, in upflow reactor to facilitate H2 production with high biomass concentration (Li et al., 2006). Although the effects of heavy metals on the anaerobic methane-producing process have been widely studied (Fang and Hui, 1994; Fang and Chan, 1997; Lin and Chen, 1999), little is known on their effects on fermentative H2 production. A series of batch experiments were conducted in this study to investigate the inhibition effect of heavy metals on the production of H2 from a sucrose-containing wastewater by granular sludge. The six heavy metals selected were those commonly found in electroplating effluents, including Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pb."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculums,"2.1 Inoculums H2-producing granular sludge was sampled from a packed-bed upflow reactor which has been operated at 26°C treating sucrose-containing wastewater for over 500d. This sludge had a H2 production yield and rate of 1.22mol-H2 mol−1-sucrose and 6.17l-H2 l−1 d−1, respectively. Detailed characteristics of this granular sludge have been reported in a previous study (Li et al., 2006)."
3,Batch tests,"2.2 Batch tests Six series of batch tests were conducted in duplicate for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb, respectively, in 250ml glass serum vials. Each vial was filled with 150ml of synthetic wastewater containing 10gl−1 of sucrose (equivalent to 11.2gl−1of COD) as substrate along with proper dosages of nutrient and trace metals using the formulation reported before (Fang et al., 2006). Each vial was then added with 1.0g (wet weight) of H2-producing sludge, corresponding to 35mg of biomass as measured by the volatile suspend solids (VSS) content, plus individual heavy metals. The dosages of heavy metal varied from 20 to 5000mgl−1, plus one for each set without any metal dosage to serve as the control. All vials were then capped with butyl rubber, completely purged with nitrogen, and incubated in a constant temperature chamber at 26°C with constant mixing device. The pH of the mixed liquor during the H2 production process was controlled twice a day at pH 5.5 by adding either HCl or NaOH. H2 production data were measured over 10d for each batch until the production leveled off. The inhibition effect of an individual metal at a given concentration was quantified by the decreases of H2 potential, the specific H2-producing activity (SHA), and the degradation sucrose relative to the controls."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The biogas production from each vial was monitored daily using a syringe. The composition of biogas and concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols in the effluent were determined daily (Fang et al., 2006). Sucrose concentration was measured using the anthrone-sulfuric acid method (Gaudy, 1962). COD and VSS were measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1992)."
5,Kinetic modeling,"2.4 Kinetic modeling The cumulative H2 production in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation (Lay et al., 1997; Fang et al., 2006): (1) H = P exp - exp R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative H2 production (ml), λ is the lag time (h), P is the H2 production potential (ml), R m is the maximum H2 production rate (mlh−1) and e =2.718281828. Values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 5.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm. The SHA (in l-H2 g−1-VSSd−1) was calculated by dividing the R m by the initial VSS in the reactor. The H2 yield (mlg−1-sucrose) was calculated by dividing P by the sucrose content of the feedstock."
6,Results and discussion,"In all experiments, the biogas produced contained only H2 (35–56%), CO2 (44–65%) and residual N2 from the initial purging. The biogas was free of methane due to the lack of methanogenic activity in the sludge. The VFA and alcohol residues in the mixed liquor were mainly acetate, butyrate, ethanol and propanol, plus small amounts of butanol, valerate and caproate. Inhibition of individual metal to H2 production was represented by concentration C I,50, at which the H2-producing activity of the sludge was reduced 50% relative to the controls."
7,Effect of heavy metals on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of heavy metals on hydrogen production In all batches of this study, H2 production data satisfactorily fitted Eq. (1) with R 2 >0.95, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , using Zn as an example. In general, the lag time λ of H2 production, increased with the metal concentration. For the 12 control batches, the average H2 yield was 171±7ml, corresponding to 114±5ml-H2 g−1-sucrose or 1.6±0.1mol-H2 mol−1-sucrose. The maximum slope of specific H2 production represented the SHA of the sludge. For the control batches, the SHA averaged 3.5±0.2l-H2 g−1-VSSd−1, corresponding to 2.3±0.1g-H2-CODg−1-VSSd−1. Table 1 summarizes the kinetic parameters of the modified Gompertz equation at various Zn concentrations. It shows that the lag time increased with Zn concentration, from as low as 4.6h for the control to 29.9h for 5000mgl−1 of Zn. Low dosages of Zn (80–400mgl−1) slightly increased the H2 potential from 171ml up to 188ml, and the R m from 4.9 to 5.4 ml h−1, corresponding to an SHA from 3.5 to 4.0 l g−1-VSS d−1. Further increases of Zn dosage (from 1000 to 5000mgl−1) adversely affected both the H2 potential and the SHA. Similar trends of inhibition as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 were observed for the other five metals although to different degrees. Fig. 2 illustrates the inhibition effects of individual metals for concentrations up to 5000mgl−1: (a) changes of H2 production potential, P, and (b) changes of SHA, as compared to the controls. Fig. 2a illustrates that H2 production potential decreased with the increase of heavy metals except Zn. Low concentrations (80–400mgl−1) of Zn actually resulted in the increase of H2 production by 8–10%. Fig. 2b illustrates SHA decreased similarly with the concentration increase of heavy metals, except Zn and Pb. Low concentrations of Zn (80–400mgl−1) and Pb (80mgl−1) resulted in the increase of SHA. Of the six heavy metals tested, Cu appeared to be most toxic to H2 production. Fig. 2 illustrates that Cu at concentrations as low as 40mgl−1 reduced the H2 production potential and SHA by over 90% as compared to the controls."
8,Effect of heavy metals on sucrose conversion,"3.2 Effect of heavy metals on sucrose conversion In all the control batches, sucrose was completely degraded in the absence of heavy metals. However, residual sucrose at various concentrations was found in batches dosed with heavy metals. Fig. 3 illustrates the relative conversion of sucrose at various concentrations of individual heavy metals. Similar to Fig. 2, Fig. 3 shows that, of the six heavy metals tested, Cu was the most inhibitive and Pb was the least. For the other four metals, sucrose degradation was adversely affected by high concentrations of metals, but was little affected at low concentrations (20–1000mgl−1)."
9,Comparison of inhibition effects of heavy metals,"3.3 Comparison of inhibition effects of heavy metals The inhibition effect of each individual metal may be expressed by C I,50, the concentration at which the H2 production parameter was 50% relative to the control (Lin, 1993; Fang, 1997; Fang and Chan, 1997). The values of C I,50 for the six heavy metals to H2 production potential, sucrose conversion and SHA are summarized in Table 2 . The C I,50 values in this study ranged from 10 to over 5000mgl−1, indicating the inhibition effect by individual metals varied substantially. The inhibition effect on H2-producing activity was in the following order: Cu (most toxic)≫Ni∼Zn>Cr>Cd>Pb (least toxic). The reason that Cu had considerably lower C I,50 values for hydrogen production compared to the other five metals is unclear. A further investigation is warranted. Table 2 also lists the limited C I,50 data for H2 production in the literature for comparison. Zheng and Yu (2004) reported that Cu (with a C I,50 of 350mgl−1) was more inhibitive than Zn (C I,50 >500mgl−1) in converting glucose to H2. Similarly, in two other studies of H2 production from dairy wastewater, Cu (C I,50 65mgl−1) was found more inhibitive than Zn (C I,50 120mgl−1) (Yu and Fang, 2001a), and Cr (C I,50 72mgl−1) more than Cd (C I,50 170mgl−1) (Yu and Fang, 2001b). The inhibitive effect of these metals was in the order of Cu>Cr>Cd>Zn, slightly different from that observed in this study. Also listed in Table 2 are the corresponding C I,50 data for methanogenic activities of granular sludge degrading starch (Fang and Hui, 1994), benzoate (Fang and Chan, 1997) and VFA (Lin and Chen, 1999). Heavy metals inhibited the methanogenic activity of starch-degrading sludge in the order of Zn>Ni>Cu>Cr>Cd, while the corresponding orders for benzoate- and VFA-degrading sludge were, respectively, Ni>Zn>Cd>Cu>Cr and Cu>Cr>Cd∼Zn>Ni>Pb. Results indicate that the inhibition effect was substrate dependent. Overall, with the exception of Cu, the C I,50 values in this study were substantially higher than those reported in the literature, indicating that heavy metals were less inhibitive to the H2-producing sludge than to other granular sludge producing either H2 or methane. This may be attributed to the higher concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the H2-producing sludge (Fang et al., 2002; Liu and Fang, 2002), and their dense distribution at the outer layer of the granular sludge (Zhang and Fang, 2004). As such, EPS protect the H2-producing cells against the harsh external environment (Liu and Fang, 2003). EPS were found crucial to the flocculation and dewatering of sludge (Liu and Fang, 2003) as well as to the microstructure of methanogenic and H2-producing granular sludge (Schmidt and Ahring, 1996; Fang et al., 2002). Their effects on the resistance of toxic metals and other chemical on H2-producing sludge warrant a further study."
10,Conclusion,"Inhibition of six heavy metals commonly found in electroplating effluent inhibited the bioactivity of H2-producing sludge in the following order: Cu (most toxic)≫Ni∼Zn>Cr>Cd>Pb (least toxic). The C I,50 values for individual heavy metals were Cu 30mgl−1, Ni and Zn 1600mgl−1, Cr 3000mgl−1, Cd 3500mgl−1, and Pb >5000mgl−1. H2-producing sludge exhibited in general higher resistance to metal toxicity than methanogenic granular sludge."
