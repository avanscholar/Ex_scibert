0,Introduction,"Increasing energy demand and diminishing reserves of nonrenewable energy resources are enforcing the development of alternative energy resources. Due to rising cost and detrimental effect of fossil fuels on the environment, alternative sources of energy and environmentally friendly fuels are now being developed. Molecular hydrogen is regarded as the most promising energy source due to its highest energy content (142 kJ/g) [1]. Moreover, it is considered as a clean fuel as it does not emit CO2 during combustion and can be easily converted into electricity via fuel cells [2]. Many facultative and obligate anaerobes like those belonging to the genera Enterobacter [3], Bacillus [4], Escherichia [5], Citrobacter [6], and Clostridia [7] have been reported as potent natural hydrogen producers. Most facultative anaerobes follow dark fermentation pathway for hydrogen production through the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate [8]. The end metabolites thus produced by pyruvate breakdown, in turn, determine the hydrogen yield [8,9]. It is reported that fermentation of glucose to acetate produces 4 mol H2/mol glucose while formation of butyrate produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose [9]. Biological hydrogen production has been reported from different organic wastes such as distillery effluent [10], molasses and sugary wastewater [11], starch wastewater [12,13], municipal solid waste [14], food waste [4], rice winery wastewater [15], domestic wastewater [16], lignocellulose materials such as rice straw, coir and sugar bagasse [3], paper sludge [17], and corn syrup water [18]. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB, 2009–2010) has listed the distillery industry as one of the 17 most polluting industries in India. Distilleries generally discard about 8–15 L of effluent per liter of alcohol produced. Untreated distillery effluent can cause eutrophication in water bodies that leads to major environmental pollution. Further, the dark color of the effluent hinders photosynthesis which is deleterious to aquatic life [19] and therefore, adequate treatment becomes imperative before its disposal. Consequently, biological hydrogen production using distillery effluent is a promising way for economical and sustainable energy generation as well as bioremediation. Biological hydrogen production is a complex multistep process involving several enzymes, which require cofactors like Fe, Cu, Mg, Co, Zn, etc. Hydrogenase is one of the most important enzymes for hydrogen production which catalyzes the reduction of proton to H2. It is classified into [NiFe]-hydrogenase, [FeFe]-hydrogenase, and [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase, according to the metal content at its active site [20]. Therefore, both nickel and iron have important effects on fermentative hydrogen yields [21–23]. Most of the glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases and enolases require magnesium ion as a cofactor [24]. It also acts as an activator of several kinases and synthetases. Mg-chelated species of adenine nucleotides are the substrates for cellular phosphate transfer reactions. Other heavy metals such as Cu, Cr and Zn also influence the biological processes like acidogenesis and methanogenesis [25,26]. Inadequate amount of essential metal ions in wastewater may lead to low hydrogen yield and decreased production rate because of nutrient limitations and reduced biological activity. It can also cause metabolic pathway shift and impart inhibitory effect on the product formation. Therefore, optimization of essential nutrients becomes crucial for maximizing the biohydrogen production by dark fermentation. For most multivariable processes like biological hydrogen production, where several potentially influential factors are involved, it becomes essential to understand the interaction between factors (nutrient supplementation) and their mutual effect on response (hydrogen yield). This can be studied by using powerful statistical tools like central composite design, Box–Behnken design, etc. Industrial effluent (distillery wastewater) contains different type of carbohydrates. Therefore, it becomes important to use a microorganism which can utilize different types of carbohydrate. In the present paper, Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 was used for biohydrogen production. This strain is a potent hydrogen producer (2.3 mol H2/mol glucose) which can utilize a variety of carbon sources [40]. Suitability of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 for fermentative biohydrogen production has been compared to other reported microorganisms (Table 1 ). E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 has been reported to utilize cheese whey for hydrogen production [41]. Therefore, feasibility of biohydrogen production by E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 was checked using distillery effluent in the present study. Effect of individual nutritional supplement on hydrogen production was studied using distillery effluent. Further, their synergistic effect on the hydrogen production was investigated by using central composite design and response surface methodology."
1,Material and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture conditions,"2.1 Microorganism and culture conditions E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 (MTCC 5373), an established H2 producing bacterium was used in all the experiments. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacterium [42]. The strain was grown overnight aerobically at 37 °C in NB medium in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) at 180 rpm. The strain was routinely maintained aerobically on nutrient agar medium at 37 °C by monthly transfer."
3,Collection and characterization of distillery effluent,"2.2 Collection and characterization of distillery effluent Rice grain based distillery effluent, collected from IFB agro, West Bengal, was used in this investigation. Distillery effluent was characterized using the Standard Methods [43]."
4,Experimental set up,"2.3 Experimental set up All the experiments were performed in 100 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 80 mL. Initial pH of 7.5 and a mesophilic temperature of 37 °C were maintained in all the experiments. The batch study was carried out in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) for 48 h at 180 rpm. Distillery effluent was first centrifuged to remove huge amount of suspended solids which hamper proper agitation. Supernatant was collected and pH was maintained using NaOH/HCl. Media was autoclaved. Ten percent (v/v) overnight grown seed culture (cell density of 9.6 × 106–1.2 × 107 cells/mL) was used as inoculum [44]. Inoculum was first centrifuged and pellet was re-dissolved (in sterile condition) in equal amount of buffered saline to eliminate the effect of additional nutrient in the spent medium. Anaerobic condition was maintained by sparging the media contents with nitrogen gas. After 48 h, total gas produced in the serum bottle was allowed to pass through 40% (w/v) KOH solution for the selective absorption of CO2. The remaining gas (mostly H2) was collected by liquid displacement method in a gas collector filled with 10% (w/v) saline and 0.1 M K2Cr2O7 at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure. Purity of hydrogen was checked using gas chromatograph. Serum bottle containing water was kept as control to measure the error in liquid displacement due to pressure formed by nitrogen sparging. All experimental runs were performed in triplicates."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Gas chromatography Hydrogen content in the gas was determined in a gas chromatograph (GC; PerkinElmer LLC, MA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh) as described by Kumar and Das [40]. The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 80 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. 2.4.2 Physico-chemical characteristics Total solid (T.S), total suspended solid (T.S.S.), total volatile solid (T.V.S.), total dissolved solid (T.D.S.), biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D), etc. were determined by using the Standard Methods APHA, 1998 [42]. 2.4.3 Chemical oxygen demand and carbohydrate analysis Total sugar content of the medium was estimated spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS Spectrophotometer Perkin–Elmer, λ = 490 nm) using Phenol sulfuric method [45]. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured according to APHA Standard Methods [43] using a COD measurement instrument set (DRB200 & DR2800 Portable Spectrophotometer HACH®, USA). The pH value was monitored using a desktop pH meter (pH510, Cyberscan, Singapore). 2.4.4 Metal ion analysis Total iron and copper content in raw distillery effluent was measured by using atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin–Elmer). Mg was measured using ion exchange chromatograph equipped with METROSEP C 2-250 (6.1010.230) column."
6,Experimental design and statistical analysis,"2.5 Experimental design and statistical analysis 2.5.1 Preliminary experiments Initial set of experiments were performed to check the suitable concentration range of all the five supplements (yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4, MgSO4 and CuCl2) for improvement of hydrogen production individually. Concentration ranges of yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4·7H2O, CuCl2·2H2O and MgSO4·7H2O were varied from 0.5 g/L to 3.0 g/L, 0.5 to 3.0 g/L, 0.05 to 0.5 g/L, 2 to 5 mg/L and from 1 g/L to 10 g/L, respectively. 2.5.2 Five-factor central composite design The central composite design (CCD) is a special case of the class of composite design, in which the factorial design levels are centered and scaled to design units with ±1 being the factorial levels and ±α being the axial levels [46]. Five factor central composite design was used to check the interaction effect of independent variables on response. Yeast extract (x 1), malt extract (x 2), FeSO4 (x 3), MgSO4 (x 4) and CuCl2 (x 5) were taken as independent variables and hydrogen yield was kept as the response variable. In developing the regression equation, the independent test variables were coded according to the equation (1) Z i = ( X i − X i ∗ ) / Δ X i where, Z i is the coded value of the ith independent variable, X i is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable, X∗ is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable at the center point and ΔX i is the step change value. 2.5.3 Development of regression equation CCD was used to obtain data, to fit an empirical quadratic polynomial model, and, to develop quadratic model equation. For five independent factors, the model takes the following form: (2) Y ˆ i = b 0 + b 1 x 1 i + b 2 x 2 i + b 3 x 3 i + b 4 x 4 i + b 5 x 5 i + b 11 x 1 i 2 + b 22 x 2 i 2 + b 33 x 3 i 2 + b 44 x 4 i 2 + b 55 x 5 i 2 + b 12 x 1 i x 2 i + b 13 x 1 i x 3 i + b 14 x 1 i x 4 i + b 15 x 1 i x 5 i + b 23 x 2 i x 3 i + b 24 x 2 i x 4 i + b 25 x 2 i x 5 i + b 34 x 3 i x 4 i + b 35 x 3 i x 5 i + b 45 x 4 i x 5 i + r i where, Ŷ is the process response and coefficient b 0 is the free or offset term called intercept. The term r i allows for uncertainties or discrepancies between predicted and measured value for residual. The r's are not model parameters. This regression model (equation (2)) is said to be a rotatable design if this second order surface can be so fitted that the variance of the estimate of the response from any treatment combination is a function of the sums of squares of the levels of the factors in that treatment combination. This can be used to estimate the elliptical contours of constant surface. The Design Expert (Version 7.0.0, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) software package was used for regression and graphical analysis. 2.5.4 Response surface analysis Response surface methodology (RSM) explores the relationships between several independent variables and one or more response variables. The main idea of RSM is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response. Response surface analysis was done by analyzing RSM plots using Design Expert (Version 7.0.0, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of distillery effluent,"3.1 Characterization of distillery effluent The characterization of the distillery effluent is shown in Table 2 . Since this is a starch based distillery effluent, it contains higher total suspended solid (TSS) as compared to cane molasses based distillery effluent."
9,"Evaluation of the initial pH, substrate concentration and nutrient factors affecting hydrogen production","3.2 Evaluation of the initial pH, substrate concentration and nutrient factors affecting hydrogen production India is the fourth largest producer of ethanol in the world and produces about 2.75 billion liters of alcohol annually [47]. Distillery spent wash is the unwanted residual liquid waste generated during alcohol production. More than 10 L of spent wash is generated containing higher organic materials per liter of alcohol produced [48]. Operational pH plays an important role in determining the hydrogen yield, as it influences the activity of major enzymes involved in the biohydrogen production pathway [49]. Further, high organic load of distillery effluent inhibits the hydrogen production due to its substrate inhibition effect. Hence, preliminary studies were carried out to find out the suitable initial pH and substrate concentration for hydrogen production using E. cloacae IIT-BT 08. Hydrogen production was found to be proportional with initial soluble substrate concentration (when the substrate concentration varies from 10 g/L to 40 g/L of COD). The effect of initial pH on the hydrogen production was studied from 5.0 to 8.0. The maximum hydrogen yield was found to be 2.6 mol H2/kg CODreduced at initial pH of 7.5 and soluble substrate concentration of 40 g/L. Although hydrogen production through dark fermentation generally occurs in acidic range, but, it has been reported that biohydrogen production takes place near the pH 7–8 [50–52]. Hydrogen production from sucrose [50] and starch [51] has been reported in a pH range from 5.5 to 8.5. During alcohol production and distillation process, most of the important nutrients get utilized/denatured. Therefore, improvement of hydrogen yield requires supplementation of some essential micro- and macro-nutrients. E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 follows mixed acid fermentation pathway for hydrogen production [40]. This pathway involves various enzymes at several intermediate steps which require some cofactors for catalytic activity. Most of vitamins, viz., vitamin B, get consumed/denatured during alcohol production. Thus, yeast extract (0.5 g/L–3.0 g/L) and malt extract (0.5 g/L–3.0 g/L) were supplemented in the distillery effluent as nitrogen and vitamin sources (Fig. 1 ). An increased hydrogen yield of 5.85 mol H2/kg CODreduced and 4.48 mol H2/kg CODreduced was observed with yeast extract and malt extract at the concentration of 2.5 g/L (Fig. 1a) and 1.5 g/L (Fig. 1a) respectively. Further increase in the concentration of yeast extract and malt extract showed a decrease in the hydrogen yield possibly due to substrate inhibition. Maximum sugar conversion of 61% and 57% was observed with yeast extract and malt extract, respectively. Further, effect of iron was studied using FeSO4·7H2O in the range of 50 mg/L–300 mg/L. A maximum hydrogen yield of 4.2 mol H2/kg CODreduced and carbohydrate conversion of 47% were observed at 250 mg/L (Fig. 1c) of FeSO4·7H2O. It has been reported that the major enzyme involved in hydrogen production is [FeFe]-hydrogenase which has di-iron center and is composed of FeS clusters [53]. Hence, presence of iron plays a very crucial role in dark fermentative hydrogen production. Table 2 shows that the distillery effluent used in this study contained very less iron (1.41 ppm) and therefore, FeSO4 supplementation improved the hydrogen yield. Other major glycolytic enzymes viz., hexokinase, phosphofructokinases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases and enolases require Mg++ as cofactor [51]. So; supplementation of magnesium in distillery effluent was studied using MgSO4·7H2O in a range of 1 g/L–10 g/L. Supplementation of 3 g/L of MgSO4 resulted in maximum hydrogen production of 40.7 mmol H2 and carbohydrate conversion of 42% which gives hydrogen yield of 4.1 mol H2/kg CODreduced. Further increase in Mg concentration resulted in decreased hydrogen production (25 mmol H2) as well as carbohydrate conversion (Fig. 1d). This is possibly due to reduced enzyme activity because of excessive Mg++ accumulation. Although, high concentration of copper is lethal for the growth of microorganisms, but lower concentration of copper has been reported to be readily effective for anaerobic acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes [26]. Therefore, effect of copper was analyzed by supplementing CuCl2·2H2O in the range of 1 mg/L–5 mg/L. Supplementation of copper showed a drastic improvement in the hydrogen yield (6.02 mol H2/kg CODreduced) at 4 mg/L with carbohydrate conversion of 45% (Fig. 1e). Further increase in its concentration showed an inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. Supplementation of higher concentration of CuCl2 (above 10 mg/L) resulted in lower hydrogen production as compared to non-supplemented distillery effluent. This could be because of its lethal effect on growth of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 (drastic reduction in total cell biomass was observed). Supplementation of lower concentration of copper resulted in maximum hydrogen yield as compared to other supplements. Among different supplements added to distillery effluent (like, yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4, MgSO4 and CuCl2) yeast extract and showed comparatively higher hydrogen yield. In order to understand the effect of yeast extract and CuCl2 on hydrogen yield, biomass was estimated at the end of the fermentation in both the cases. Biomass was found higher in case of yeast extract as compared to copper chloride as shown in Fig. 2 . This is in correlation with higher carbohydrate conversion in yeast extract (61%) compared to copper chloride (47%). However, higher biomass formation with yeast extract was not correlated with increase in hydrogen production. This may be because of channeling of nitrogen (yeast extract contains mainly nitrogen) along with carbohydrate (higher carbohydrate conversion) towards growth of the microorganism. Hydrogen production is an acidogenesis process [54] and copper is reported to support acidogenesis process [25,26]. This may be the possible reason for comparatively higher hydrogen production with copper chloride (6.02 mol H2/kg CODreduced) as compared to yeast extract (5.85 mol H2/kg CODreduced)."
10,Optimization of nutritional conditions for maximization of hydrogen production,"3.3 Optimization of nutritional conditions for maximization of hydrogen production Full factorial central composite design with five independent variables, each at five levels (Table 3 ) was decided based on the results obtained from the individual effect of supplements (independent variable) on hydrogen production. The range selected for each factors are as follows: x 1 = 1.31 g/L–3.69 g/L, x 2 = 0.31 g/L–2.69 g/L, x 3 = 0.13 g/L–0.37 g/L, x 4 = 1.31 g/L–3.69 g/L and x 5 = 2.31 mg/L–4.69 mg/L keeping the central value at 2.5 g/L, 1.5 g/L, 0.25 g/L, 2.5 g/L and 3.5 mg/L, respectively (Table 3). This resulted in 50 experiments, with eight replicates at the center point. Experiments were performed to obtain the optimal concentration of the independent factors (yeast extract (x 1), malt extract (x 2), FeSO4 (x 3), MgSO4 (x 4) and CuCl2 (x 5)) and to study the effect of their interactions on the hydrogen production. The statistical treatment combinations of the test variables along with the measured response (hydrogen yield) corresponding to each combination are summarized in Table 4 . By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, the following quadratic polynomial equation was established to explain the hydrogen production: (3) Y = − 22.129 + 4.896 x 1 + 0.105 x 2 + 100.255 x 3 + 6.415 x 4 + 1.45 x 5 − 1.412 x 1 2 − 0.309 x 2 2 − 170.231 x 3 2 − 0.507 x 4 2 − 0.192 x 5 2 + 0.346 x 1 x 2 + 0.037 x 1 x 3 − 0.196 x 1 x 4 + 0.531 x 1 x 5 + 2.437 x 2 x 3 + 0.263 x 2 x 4 − 0.373 x 2 x 5 − 9.237 x 3 x 4 + 1.287 x 3 x 5 − 0.396 x 4 x 5 where, Y is the predicted hydrogen yield; x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 and x 5 are the actual values of yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4, MgSO4 and CuCl2, respectively. The summary of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) representing the results of the quadratic response surface model fitting is shown in Table 5 . ANOVA is essential to test the significance and the adequacy of the model. Higher F-value indicates an adequate explanation of the variation in the data about its mean [55]. Fisher variance ratio [F 0.05 (20, 29)] of 117.87 was large enough to signify a high degree of adequacy of the model. The smaller the magnitude of the P-value, the more significant is the corresponding coefficient. Values of p (Prob > F) less than 0.0500 indicates that the model terms are significant [56,57]. In the present study, yeast extract (p ≤ 0.0001), MgSO4 (p = 0.0038), and CuCl2 (p ≤ 0.0001) were observed as significant factors for improving the hydrogen yield. The “Lack of Fit F-value” in this case was found to be 2.87 which implies that it is insignificant and there is a 7.78% chance that such high value could occur due to noise. The squared regression statistic (R 2) which measures the goodness of fit of the model was much more significant at the level of 98.7%. The “Pred R-Squared” of 0.9601 is in reasonable agreement with the “Adj R-Squared” of 0.9795 which suggests a wonderful correlation between predicted and measured values (Fig. 3 ). “Adeq Precision” measures the signal to noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 is generally desirable [56]. In this study ratio of 40.892 indicates an adequate signal, therefore model can be used to navigate the design space. Variance inflation factor (VIF) was near to 1 which indicates that there is no multicollinearity among independent variables. Response surface analysis depicts the interactions between two variables by keeping the other variables at their zero levels for hydrogen production. A critical analysis of the response surface plots reveals significant interaction of copper chloride with yeast extract (x 1 x 5), malt extract (x 2 x 5), and magnesium sulfate (x 4 x 5). In case of interaction between copper chloride and yeast extract, it was observed that with increase in yeast extract concentration, hydrogen yield increased and reached to its maximum at 2.5 g/L, as shown in Fig. 4 a, while further increase showed a slight decrease in hydrogen yield probably due to substrate inhibition. However increasing the concentration of copper chloride didn't bring any much difference to hydrogen yield in the presence of yeast extract. In Fig. 4b and c where interaction of copper chloride with malt extract and magnesium sulfate is shown, an increase in hydrogen yield was found with an increase in malt extract as well as magnesium sulfate till a concentration of 1.28 g/L and 2.35 g/L, respectively, while further increase showed a decreasing trend in hydrogen production. In both cases, a little increase in hydrogen yield was observed with increasing concentration of copper chloride. Although inhibitory effects of Cu on the acidogenesis and methanogenesis have been reported in the literature [25,26], most studies were conducted to examine the effects on production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and further production of methane. Little information is available on the effect of lower concentration of copper on fermentative hydrogen production. Copper was found as a significant factor for the improvement of hydrogen yield both in individual as well as combined study. Although, an inhibitory effect on hydrogen production was observed at lower concentration of copper chloride in this study however, Zheng and Yu [57] have reported an enhanced hydrogen production by dosage of copper in the range of 50–100 ppm. Insignificant interaction was observed between yeast extract and ferrous sulfate (Fig. 4d) which shows that these two factors are independent of each other. That is the reason for getting maximum hydrogen yield at 2.5 g/L and 0.25 g/L which is similar to their individual effects. In the present study, the model predicted a maximum hydrogen yield of 7.4 mol H2/kg CODreduced, with the optimum yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4, MgSO4 and CuCl2 concentration of 2.46 g/L, 1.28 g/L, 0.26 g/L, 2.35 g/L and 3.94 mg/L, respectively, by keeping the other variables at their zero level."
11,Validation of the model,"3.4 Validation of the model Optimum media was prepared as per the theoretical maximum hydrogen yield predicted by the model. Distillery effluent was supplemented with yeast extract, malt extract, FeSO4, MgSO4 and CuCl2 at a concentration of 2.46 g/L, 1.28 g/L, 0.26 g/L, 2.35 g/L and 3.94 mg/L, respectively. The initial pH was 7.5 and the temperature was 37 °C. Under the above optimized condition, experiment was performed in a double jacketed reactor with a working volume of 400 mL (in triplicates). Hydrogen yield and average rate of hydrogen production was found to be 7.38 mol H2/kg CODreduced and 80 mL/L h, respectively. Maximum carbohydrate conversion of 65% and COD reduction of 30% were observed. A prominent biphasic pattern of hydrogen production was observed (Fig. 5 a). The cell biomass concentration profile also indicated diauxic growth pattern of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 (Fig. 5b). This diauxic growth pattern could be due to the presence of different sugars in the production media. The excellent correlation between predicted (7.4 mol H2/kg CODreduced) and measured (7.38 mol H2/kg CODreduced) values verifies the model validation and the existence of an optimal point. Optimization of distillery effluent showed 2.2 times (183.8%) higher hydrogen yield as compared to non-supplemented distillery effluent. Response surface design used in this study has been widely used in recent biotechnological research [58–61]. Hydrogen production obtained in the present study is promising as compared to other reported data on hydrogen production using distillery effluents (Table 6 ). Qiu et al. [66] have reported 246.2 mL of cumulative hydrogen in 3 days of batch operation which is very less in comparison to the present study (1.92 L H2). Most of the recent studies on hydrogen production using distillery effluent have been performed in continuous operation. Average hydrogen production rate obtained from this study (1.92 L H2/L d) is comparable to other reported studies with distillery effluent [62,63]. The maximum hydrogen yield obtained in this study (7.38 mol H2/kg CODreduced) is still lower to the theoretical hydrogen yield (20.8 mol H2/kg CODreduced). This indicates that there is much scope for improvement of the process which can be explored in future research work. However, this is an elementary study to investigate the suitability of distillery effluent and nutritional optimization for maximization of hydrogen production by E. cloacae IIT-BT 08."
12,Conclusion,"The response surface methodology based on a five factor–five level central composite design was demonstrated to be an effective method in order to determine the suitable nutritional supplementation to distillery effluent for maximization of dark fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae IIT-BT 08. The proposed model equation illustrated the quantitative effect of different nutritional supplements on hydrogen production. Multi-parameter optimization study to understand the mutual effect of supplements on hydrogen production revealed significant interaction of CuCl2 with yeast extract, malt extract and MgSO4 and the overall improvement in hydrogen yield significantly as compared to non-supplemented distillery effluent. Biphasic hydrogen production and diauxic growth of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 were observed with distillery effluent containing optimum nutritional supplements. Further research work is in progress to find out the substrates responsible for the biphasic production as well as growth patterns."
