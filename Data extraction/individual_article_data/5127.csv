0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a particular type of small-molecule reactive oxygen species (ROS), is ubiquitous in organisms and plays vital roles in various physiological and pathological processes [1]. H2O2 functions as a signaling molecule in the intracellular propagation of both physiological and oncogenic growth signals [2–5], stimulating cell proliferation [6], differentiation [7] and migration [8]. However, abnormal level of H2O2 leads to oxidative stress and inflammation events, related with aging and severe human diseases such as diabetes [9], Alzheimer's disease [10], and cancer [11]. Therefore, accurate and quantitative monitoring of the distributions and concentrations of H2O2 in cells is helpful to reveal the mechanism of H2O2-related diseases and provides a reliable method for early diagnosis and treatments of some diseases. Many analytical methods have been developed to detect H2O2, including electron spin resonance [12,13], mass spectrometry [14,15], chemoselective bioluminescent reporter [16] and electrochemical assay [17]. However, these methods suffer from some disadvantages such as requiring expensive instruments, complex sample preparations, rigorous manipulation procedures as well as invasive detection. In comparison, fluorescent probes provide an attractive approach due to the advantages of real-time imaging, non-invasiveness, high selectivity, excellent sensitivity, and unrivaled spatiotemporal sampling capability [18–23]. As a highly π-deficient unit, the quinoxaline structure, especially its fused cyclic derivatives, is among the most studied electron deficient aromatic units in donor–acceptor (D-A) molecules for organic photovoltaics [24–27]. And these D-A molecules were well-performed fluorescent materials due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) [28–31]. To the best of our knowledge, only a small number of quinoxalines were used as the skeletons in the fluorescent probes. In our previous work, the optical properties of a novel fused four-ring quinoxaline skeleton were studied and two novel fluorophores (QX8A and QX9A, Fig. 1 ) were designed [32,33]. QX8A and QX9A were typical “push-pull” electron conjugated structures with the ICT effects, possessing good fluorescence properties. The novel fluorophores were endowed with useful characteristics in real applications, such as easy synthetic procedure and excellent stability in air. In addition, the newly designed quinoxalinamines displayed higher fluorescence quantum yields than some frequently used fluorophores based probes, such as pyrimidine [34], BODIPY [23] and cyanine [35]. We hope to promote efforts for the further development of this skeleton with improved and advanced properties in future applications. As shown in Scheme 1 , two fluorescent probes, QX8A-H2O2 and QX9A-H2O2 , were obtained for hydrogen peroxide detection. In both probes, the boric acid ester group was chosen as the response unit, which could efficiently react with H2O2 to generate phenol group [22,23,36–38]. Furthermore, the negative charge on the oxygen atom of the phenol easily transferred to the carbamate, followed by the formation of unprotected amine [39–41]. After comparing the performances of two probes, QX9A-H2O2 was selected for further study (Fig. 2 ). Indeed, probe QX9A-H2O2 exhibited high sensitivity and high selectivity towards H2O2 over other species, and was successfully applied for the specific imaging of both exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in living cells. Hence, QX9A-H2O2 could be utilized as an efficient fluorescent tool to detect H2O2 in not only aqueous solutions but also living systems."

2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis QX8A and QX9A were synthesized according to our reported method [33]. The synthesis of two probes was shown in Scheme 1. Pinacol 4-(hydroxymethyl) phenylborate 1 (380 mg, 1.6 mmol) and triethylamine (338 μL, 2.48 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. Then triphosgene (240 mg, 0.8 mmol) was added to the solution at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. The white precipitate formed was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated to give crude compound 2. Crude 2 was used directly without purification. The fluorophore QX8A or QX9A (180 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to the solution of crude 2 in 10 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The solvent was concentrated and quenched with 50 mL water, then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic phase was washed with saturated brine and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The corresponding probes were obtained by column chromatography (petroleum ether: dichloromethane = 1:1, v/v). QX8A-H2O2 : 322 mg yellow solid, 54% yield.

3,Analytical procedure,"2.2 Analytical procedure Probe QX8A-H2O2 or QX9A-H2O2 was dissolved in DMSO to prepare 1 mM stock solutions for use. 3% H2O2 was dissolved in PBS solution (10 mM, pH 7.4) to prepare 2 mM stock solution for use. During the detection, the stock solutions of probes and H2O2 were diluted in DMSO-PBS (1: 9 v/v, 10 mM, pH 7.4) solutions, with the final concentrations as follows: probes 10 μM and H2O2 500 μM. After incubating at 37 °C for 40 min, the absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded. All the fluorescence spectra of QX9A-H2O2 were collected at the range of 460–700 nm when λex was 450 nm with excitation and emission slit set as 2 nm. In the sensitivity experiment, probe QX9A-H2O2 was incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 (0–500 μM) at 37 °C for 40 min. In time response experiments, the fluorescence spectra of QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) in the presence and absence of H2O2 (500 μM) were recorded at different time. In the selectivity experiments, the probe QX9A-H2O2 was incubated with other possible competitive species at 37 °C for 40 min: ROS (ClO−, OH, O2 −, t-BuO , TBHP, 500 μM), ions (−CN, HSO3 −, Cu2+, Na+, Zn2+, 1 mM) and amino acids (Cys, Hcy, GSH, 1 mM). The competitive ROS were prepared according to the literatures [22,42,43]. In the experiments of pH effects, QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) was incubated with H2O2 (500 μM) at 37 °C under different pH conditions for 40 min."
4,Theoretical calculations,"2.3 Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to gain further insights into the molecular conformation and photophysical properties of the probe and the fluorophores. All the computations were performed by the B3LYP density functional method with the D3GJ dispersion correction [44,45]. The 6–31 g(d) basis set was used for the geometry optimizations of the molecules in the PCM model with water as the solvent. Vibrational frequency analyses at the same level of theory were performed on the optimized structures to characterize stationary points as local minima. The CAM-B3LYP method with 6–31 g(d) was used for the excited states calculations. All these calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 [46]."
5,Cell culture and cytotoxicity analysis,"2.4 Cell culture and cytotoxicity analysis HeLa cells were cultured in the MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 80 U/mL penicillin and 0.08 mg/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. The cytotoxicity of QX9A-H2O2 was tested by MTT essay. HeLa cells in logarithmic phase were cultured in 96-well plates with a density of 1 × 104 per well and cultured in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. Different concentrations of QX9A-H2O2 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 μM) were added into the cells for 24 h, and then MTT (20 μM, 5 mg/mL) was added to the medium for further incubation for 4 h. Cells without probe QX9A-H2O2 was regarded as the control group. The medium was carefully removed and 150 μL DMSO was added to each well, and then shook evenly and slowly for 20 min on the shaker. Finally, the absorbance of each well at 490 nm was measured by multi-function enzyme labeling instrument. The formula for cell viability calculation was as follows: Viability (%) = (ODprobe –ODMEM) / (ODcontrol –ODMEM) × 100%"
6,Cell imaging,"2.5 Cell imaging HeLa cells were cultured in the confocal petri dishes. In the control group, only probe QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) was added into the dishes and incubated for 40 min. In the endogenous H2O2 group, HeLa cells were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 μg /mL) or rotenone (1 mg/mL), followed by incubating with probe QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) for 40 min. Similarly, in the exogenous H2O2 group, HeLa cells were pretreated with H2O2 (100 μM) for 40 min, followed by incubating with probe QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) for another 40 min. All dishes should be washed with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) for three times before incubating with the probe. Finally, the cells were imaged with the confocal laser scanning microscope (λex = 450 nm)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Design and synthesis,"3.1 Design and synthesis A strategy of designing a probe is to control the ICT effect along the skeletons of the molecules, which would lead to changes in molecules’ emission. Based on this strategy, the electron-donating 8(9)-amino donor on the quinoxaline skeleton was transformed into the electron-deficient 8(9)-carbamate acceptor, manipulating the probes as “pull–pull” structures. This electronic structures blocked the ICT, resulting in weak fluorescent emissions. When the 4-(pinacolboryl) benzyl carbamate group was specifically removed by H2O2, the probes were restored as “push–pull” systems and the fluorescences were enhanced, providing a switch for H2O2 detection [39–41]. The synthesis was simple and outlined in Scheme 1. Borylbenzyl alcohol 1 reacted with triphosgene to generate the borylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride 2 in situ, which in turn coupled with the corresponding fluorophores QX8A and QX9A, to offer probes QX8A-H2O2 and QX9A-H2O2 in 54% and 64% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). The structures of QX8A-H2O2 and QX9A-H2O2 were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS (Fig. S10–S15)."
9,Comparison of the two probes,"3.2 Comparison of the two probes Both of the probes were slightly soluble in water. Hence, a certain amount of DMSO was added to increase the solubility. The DMSO fraction increased from 10% to 50% in the DMSO-PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) mixtures, and the detection of H2O2 performed well in all of the mixed solutions. However, high DMSO fraction was toxic to human cells, therefore the DMSO fraction was chosen as 10% in subsequent experiments. As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2c, no significant change in the absorbance of QX8A-H2O2 or QX9A-H2O2 solutions was observed before and after reacting with H2O2 (500 μM). However, the fluorescence intensity of QX9A-H2O2 solutions increased 11-folds after detecting H2O2, while QX8A-H2O2 solutions increased only 3-folds (Fig. 2b and Fig. 2d). H2O2 rapidly triggered a remarkable color change of QX9A-H2O2 solutions under a 365 nm UV lamp, while triggered no color change of QX8A-H2O2 solutions (the inset of Fig. 2b and Fig. 2d). As shown in Fig. S1, both of the absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra of QX9A showed a distinct red shift when comparing with QX8A. The fluorescence quantum yields of QX8A-H2O2 and QX9A-H2O2 were determined to be 0.003 and 0.005, respectively. After reacting with H2O2 (500 μM), the quantum yield of probe QX8A-H2O2 increased to 0.033, while that of QX9A-H2O2 increased to 0.152. Hence, the fluorescence quantum yield of QX9A-H2O2 increased 30-folds in the presence of H2O2, while QX8A-H2O2 increased only 11-folds. After the detection of H2O2, the fluorescence quantum yield of QX9A-H2O2 was almost five times higher than that of QX8A-H2O2 . We inferred that the different positions of the amine group might cause the change of energy gap for QX9A relative to QX8A, which were responsible for the different quantum yields. To gain a clearer explanation, DFT calculations were conducted to verify the ICT mechanism and compare the two fluorophores. The optimized geometries of QX8A and QX9A were presented (Fig. S2, Fig. S3, Table S1 and Table S2 in Supporting Information), followed by calculation of the electron transitions to excited states (Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. S4, both the HOMO electrons were located on the whole molecules, while LUMO electrons mainly located on the quinoxalinamine moiety. The results clearly indicated that an active ICT process occurred in the fluorophores [47–50]. Moreover, the change of the substituting position caused a decreased energy gap for QX9A relative to QX8A and was in good agreement with the red shift in the spectra [47,51,52]. All these results revealed that the detection was a fluorescence turn-on process, and the performance of QX9A-H2O2 was superior to QX8A-H2O2 . Only probe QX9A-H2O2 was chosen as the research object in the following experiments."
10,Time response of probe QX9A-H2O2,"3.3 Time response of probe QX9A-H2O2 The response time in the absence or presence of H2O2 was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 , the probe itself displayed no emission changes in 120 min, demonstrating its high stability in a long time. Upon addition of H2O2, the fluorescence intensity at 540 nm increased gradually in a time-dependent manner. Within 40 min the fluorescence intensity reached its maximum value, indicating a rapid response to H2O2. When comparing with some reported H2O2 probes with phenylboronate as the sensing group, QX9A-H2O2 still showed eminent reactive performances (e.g. the response time for Py-VPB [53], PB1 [34] and HBTPB [54] was about 45, 180 and 70 min respectively. See more details in Table S4). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity at 540 nm reached about 87% of the peak value within 30 min, which was enough for the further applications in the biological samples (e.g. 30 min for living cell imaging). Thus, QX9A-H2O2 can be used to detect H2O2 in real time."
11,Sensitivity of probe QX9A-H2O2,"3.4 Sensitivity of probe QX9A-H2O2 In order to clarify the sensitivity in detail, the fluorescence spectra with different concentrations of H2O2 were recorded. With increasing the amount of H2O2, the emission centered 540 nm concomitantly increased and tended to be saturated when 30 equiv. of H2O2 was added (Fig. 4 ). Moreover, probe QX9A-H2O2 presented a good linear correlation in the concentration range of 0–70 μM with a regression equation of y = 11531 [H2O2] (μM) + 65270 (R2 = 0.9931), where y is the fluorescence intensity at 540 nm. According to the 3σ/k method (see details in section 1.3 in supporting information), the detection limit was calculated to be as low as 46 nM, which was enough for direct imaging intracellular H2O2 as its concentrations were usually in submicromolar range [2,22,55]. As a comparison, the performance of QX9A-H2O2 was superior to many reported probes, indicating its high sensitivity to H2O2 with a low detection limit (Table S4). All results proved that probe QX9A-H2O2 was sensitive enough to detect low concentrations of H2O2 effectively and quantitatively."
12,Effect of pH,"3.5 Effect of pH In terms of biological applications, the effect of pH on the detection behavior was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 , probe QX9A-H2O2 displayed negligible emission changes in a wide pH range of 1–14 in the absence of H2O2, indicating its excellent stability. When H2O2 was added, probe QX9A-H2O2 showed a dramatic fluorescence enhancement within a pH range from 7 to 9. Thus, probe QX9A-H2O2 had the potential suitability to detect H2O2 under neutral and weak alkaline conditions."
13,Selectivity and competition studies,"3.6 Selectivity and competition studies The QX9A-H2O2 solutions were treated with a wide variety of possible competitive analytes including ClO −, OH, O2 −, t-BuO , TBHP, −CN, HSO3 −, Cu2+, Na+, Zn2+, Cys, Hcy and GSH. The obtained results indicated that only H2O2 triggered a significant spectral variation, while other analytes hardly induced fluorescence changes (brown bars in Fig. 6 ). In addition, the competitive experiments confirmed that various co-existing analytes showed no interference to H2O2 detection (blue bars in Fig. 6). Therefore, it could be concluded that probe QX9A-H2O2 exhibited high selectivity toward H2O2 and possessed a strong anti-interference to other analytes."
14,Detection mechanism,"3.7 Detection mechanism The fluorescence turn-on process has been explained in the design strategy of the probes. The H2O2 sensing mechanism was attributed to the highly specific H2O2-triggered boronate oxidation reaction [36,37,56,57]. As shown in Scheme 2 , the boronate group on the 4-(pinacolboryl)benzyl carbamate unit was firstly oxidized into the hydroxyl to generate the phenol intermediate, followed by 1,6-rearrangement elimination and decarboxylation to release the fluorophore. During this process, the fluorescence of the resulting solutions was enhanced. To confirm this mechanism, the spectral properties of QX9A-H2O2 reacting with H2O2 were compared with that of fluorophore QX9A (Fig. S5). It was found that the solution of QX9A-H2O2 reacting H2O2 had a maximum absorption peak near 410 nm and obvious fluorescence emission centered 540 nm, which were quite similar to that of QX9A under the same conditions. This result initially revealed the fact that H2O2 induced the generation of QX9A. Furthermore, the presence of QX9A was verified by HRMS analysis, showing a peak at m/z 359.14761, which was quite close to the exact molecular weight of QX9A [M + H]+ (calcd. 359.14781) (Fig. S6). Finally, the isolated reaction product after detection was confirmed to be QX9A. As shown in Fig. 7 , the peaks of QX9A-H2O2 at 5.26 ppm and 1.35 ppm were attributed to the benzyl group (CH2) and borate pincinol ester group (CH3), respectively. However, both peaks disappeared in the 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated product, while a new peak attributed to amino group appeared at 3.91 ppm. Clearly, all results revealed that the reaction of QX9A-H2O2 with H2O2 resulted in the formation of QX9A, strongly supporting our proposed mechanism in Scheme 2."
15,Theoretical studies,"3.8 Theoretical studies To get insight into the sensing mechanism, theoretical computations were performed for both the probe and the reaction product. The optimized geometries and the HOMO and LUMO of the probe and the fluorophore were clearly presented in Fig. 8 (details shown in Fig. S3, Fig. S7, Table S2 and Table S3 in supporting information). For probe QX9A-H2O2 , the electron density in both HOMO and LUMO levels predominantly located on the whole fluorophore moiety, which blocked the ICT process and resulted in the weak fluorescence. However, in the case of QX9A, the electron density in HOMO level mainly located on the whole molecule, while in the LUMO level mainly concentrated on the quinoxalinamine moiety, which shows efficient ICT with enhanced fluorescence [47,49,58–62]. The energy gaps between HOMO and LUMO before and after detection were 3.691 eV and 3.446 eV, respectively. These above theoretical results were consistent with the experimental results, confirming the ICT process."
16,Cell imaging for exogenous and endogenous H2O2,"3.9 Cell imaging for exogenous and endogenous H2O2 Inspired by the excellent results, the ability of probe QX9A-H2O2 for cell imaging was investigated in HeLa cells. Before imaging, the MTT assay demonstrated the low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility of the probe (Fig. S8). Then, the functions of probe QX9A-H2O2 for living cell imaging were evaluated. In the control group, cells were only incubated with probe QX9A-H2O2 , and almost no fluorescence was observed (Fig. 9 a–c). However, when HeLa cells were pre-incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an inducer of endogenous H2O2, Fig. 9 d–f) or H2O2 (Fig. 9 g–i), followed by incubating with probe QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM), remarkable fluorescence signals could be observed from green channel. More experiments were performed to monitor the fluctuation of endogenous H2O2 in living cells. Rotenone, a ROS inducer, could induce the generation of intracellular H2O2 through an inflammation response [63,64]. Hence, when cells pre-treated with rotenone were incubated with QX9A-H2O2 (10 μM) for 40 min, a strong green fluorescence was recovered (Fig. S9a–c). NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), a frequently used ROS scavenger, could eliminate the generated H2O2 or inhibit its production in cells [65–67]. To our excitement, cells sequentially treated with rotenone, NAC and QX9A-H2O2 provided a weak fluorescence signal in the green channel (Fig. S9d–f). The bio-imaging results revealed that a useful probe with good cell permeability was successfully established, and was capable of detecting not only endogenous but also exogenous H2O2 in living systems."
17,Conclusion,"In summary, based on a novel quinoxaline skeleton, two “off–on” probes, QX8A-H2O2 and QX9A-H2O2 , were developed for visualizing H2O2. By comparing the optical properties of the two probes, QX9A-H2O2 with better detection performance was selected for further studies in vitro and in cells. QX9A-H2O2 exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity towards H2O2 over other competitive species such as examined ROS, biological thiols and anions. Moreover, the detection limit was determined to be as low as 46 nM, superior to many reported probes. The H2O2 detection process was based on the ICT mechanism, undergoing successive oxidative hydrolysis, elimination reaction and decarboxylation to release the fluorophore QX9A. In addition, preliminary biological experiments revealed this probe was of low toxicity and had the ability to sense both the exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in living HeLa cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example where a novel fused four-ring quinoxaline skeleton and 4-(pinacolboryl)benzyl group were integrated into one molecule for H2O2 detection in biological samples."
