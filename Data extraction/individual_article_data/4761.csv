0,Introduction,"Sulfuric acid is an essential catalyst for the production of industrially chemicals. However such liquid-acid catalyst requires special processing in the form of neutralization which involves costly and inefficient catalyst separation from product and result in an unrecyclable sulfate waste. According to the principal of the “green chemistry” production method should be refined so as to minimize adverse effect on the environment or human health [1]. The migration to strong acids, which are recyclable and nontoxic, from liquid-acids such as sulfuric acid is therefore a desirable goal [2,3]. Solid acids are conventional materials that have wide applications in chemical production, separation/purification, and polymer–electrolyte fuel-cell (PEFC) technologies, and the chemical industry is currently searching for a highly active and stable solid acid to improve the environmental safety of the production of chemicals and energy. An ideal solid material for the applications considered here should have high stability and numerous strong protonic acid sites [4,5]. Michikazu Hara and co-workers reported the synthesis of a carbon-based solid acid with a high density of sulfonic acid (SO3H). Such carbon-based solid acids can be readily prepared by heating aromatic compounds such as naphthalene in sulfuric acid at 473–573K. In this synthesis, the sulfonation of the aromatic compounds is the first stage of the reaction. The resulting sulfonated aromatic compounds are incompletely carbonized, which results in the formation of a solid with a nominal sample composition of CH0.35O0.35S0.14. The resulting black powder is insoluble in the solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, benzene, and hexane even at boiling temperatures [6–8]. Various reagent including high valent metal and nonmetal oxides or their mineral salts such as potassium permanganate, potassium bromate, organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide can be used to oxidize organic functionalities [9,10]. The usages of mineral oxidants are limited, because they demand rigorous control of the experimental conditions. Moreover the lack of selectivity in multistage organic synthesis and tedious work-up are the other important disadvantages of the mineral oxidants [11]. In this work the carbon-based solid acid as heterogeneous catalyst was used for oxidation of some organic compounds using H2O2 as oxidant."
1,Experimental,"Chemicals were purchased from Fluka, Merck and Aldrich chemicals companies. The products were characterized by comparison of their spectral (IR, 1H NMR), TLC and physical data with the authentic samples."
2,General experimental procedure,"2.1 General experimental procedure Carbon-based solid acid (0.2g), substrate (1mmol) and hydrogen peroxide (aq. 30%, 5mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (5ml) were prepared as a mixture and used at refluxing temperature. In the case of aldehyde oxidation, methanol was used as solvent and MgSO4 (1g) as water absorbing agent. The progress of reaction was monitored by TLC method. At the end of reaction the catalyst was removed by filtration and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The precipitated residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. Evaporation of the solvent can yield the oxidized product. The yields of the products and the reaction times for the oxidation of sulfides, tertiary amines, secondary alcohols and aldehydes are presented in Tables 1–4 . All products are characterized and their spectra and physical properties matched with those reported in the literature."
3,Results and discussion,"Carbon-based solid acid was prepared according to the reported procedure by Hara et al. [6]. The density of SO3 H group was measured using NaOH (0.01molL−1) as titrant by acid–base potentiometric titration. The SO3H amount of attached to polycyclic aromatic carbon was obtained 4.75mmolg−1. The composition of prepared catalyst was obtained CH0.4O0.3S0.12 from elementary analysis using Vario EL III of Elementar Company. The X-ray diffraction spectrum (Bruker, D8Advance) of carbon-based solid acid exhibits two broad and weak peaks (2θ =10–30°, 34–45°) attributed to amorphous carbon (Fig. 1 ). We have used the carbon-based solid acid as a heterogeneous catalyst in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent for oxidation of sulfides, tertiary amines, secondary alcohols and aldehydes. The oxidation results for a variety of sulfides are depicted in Table 1. All of the studied substrates were smoothly converted to the corresponding sulfones with excellent yields in short times. Among the various studied sulfides, dibenzothiophene as a hindered sulfide could be oxidized in a longer reaction time with yield of 75% (Table 1, entry 9). Whereas, aliphatic and aryl sulfides were more reactive and reactions of these compounds were completed in short times and excellent yields. The oxidation of several tertiary amines was carried out under similar reaction conditions and those results are presented in Table 2. As seen from Table 2 all of the employed tertiary amines were oxidized to the corresponding N-oxides in high yields. However aliphatic tertiary amines and pyridines containing electron-donating groups were found to be more reactive and required lesser reaction times. The oxidation of secondary alcohols to corresponding esters/lactones also has been studied in the same conditions, which are presented in Table 3. In general, among the various alcohols studied, alicyclic alcohols (Table 3, entries 1–4) were found to be more reactive as compared to the aromatic alcohols (Table 3, entries 5 and 6). The reaction involves the formation of carbonyl compounds followed by their Bayer–Villiger oxidation to corresponding esters. The oxidation of a variety of aldehydes were also studied using the protocol involving drop-wise addition of the hydrogen peroxide to the stirring mixture of the aldehyde and carbon-based solid acid in methanol at refluxing temperature in the presence of anhydrous MgSO4. All of the aldehydes used were selectively converted to methyl esters in excellent yields which are shown in Table 4. In general, substituted aldehydes were found to be more reactive as compared to the benzaldehyde. The presence of water absorbing agent (MgSO4) was found to be essential for this reaction, because the existence of water can covert aldehyde to corresponding carboxylic acid. Moreover catalytic activities of carbon-based solid acid, Nafion NR-50 and sulfuric acid were compared in Table 4. To investigate reusability and recyclability of the catalyst, the oxidation of dibutyl sulfide was performed four times. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration which can be used again for subsequent experiments after adding fresh substrate and oxidant (aq. 30% H2O2) under similar reaction conditions. It was found that the activity of catalyst has remained unchanged after four catalytic cycles. The reaction probably involves the in situ formation of persulfonic acid by the reaction of sulfonic acid group of the carbon-based solid acid with hydrogen peroxide, followed by the oxygen transfer to the organic substrate as shown in Scheme 1 ."
4,Conclusions,"In this work, we have reported a new and highly efficient methodology for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfones, tertiary amines to N-oxides, secondary alcohols to esters/lactones and aldehydes to methyl esters with aqueous hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalytic amounts of carbon-based solid acid under mild conditions. The cheapness and the availability of the reagents, easy and clean work-up, and good to high yields make this method attractive for the large-scale operations. We believe that the present methodology would be improvement existing methodologies."
