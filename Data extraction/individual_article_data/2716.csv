0,Introduction,"Petroleum, coal and natural gas are currently the main available sources of energy, fuels, chemicals and polymers. An alternative to the dependency on finite fossil fuels to meet energy and material requirements is represented by the use of renewable energy sources and biomass for both the production of bio-fuels and bio-products. The concept expressing the possibility to derive energy and commodities from organic materials is defined as biorefinery (Yang et al., 2015; Kamm and Kamm, 2004). Organic waste from municipalities, agro-industrial residues and food waste are ideal feedstocks to be used in a biorefinery processes, representing biodegradable materials containing a series of substances belonging to the three main groups of organic matter: carbohydrates (simple sugars and polysaccharides), proteins and lipids. A series of value-added bioproducts can be produced from these organics by means of biological or thermo-chemical processes, including biofuels, chemicals, commodities, biopolymers and bioplastics (Kiran et al., 2014; Pham et al., 2015; Tuck et al., 2012). Limits on landfill disposal of biodegradable organic materials and green house gas emission reduction targets established by the European Union may represent a incentive for a new challenge in the field of waste management: the use of industrial processes to simultaneously dispose waste and produce energy or commodities from no longer reusable or recyclable materials, in a scheme of circular economy (Cossu, 2012, 2009). The biorefinery concept fits well with this new perspective: wastes are not simply treated before final disposal but are used to produce bio-fuels, bulk chemicals, biopolymers or bioproducts for further industrial or commercial applications. Biological hydrogen production by dark fermentation may assume a central role in the use of organic waste in a biorefinery concept (Alibardi et al., 2014). Dark fermentation may be applied as an up-front treatment for organic waste, agro-industrial residues or food waste in view of its ability to: (i) hydrolyse biodegradable complex organic to short chain fatty acids and alcohols; (ii) produce gaseous biohydrogen and carbon dioxide; (iii) hydrolyse organic nitrogen to ammonium nitrogen. The benefits of this approach would be a biologically optimised hydrolytic pre-treatment producing at the same time hydrogen (to be used as a bio-fuel, stored for energy conservation/balance or used as reactant in different chemical processes) and other important bulk chemicals for further uses. The dark fermentation process is influenced by numerous parameters, including briefly: substrate types, substrates ratio in co-digestion processes, type and origin inocula, pre-treatments applied to substrates and inocula, temperature, pH, micro-nutrient availability, reactor configuration and management procedures. These factors produce a considerable effect on hydrogen fermentation yields from organic waste resulting in a large variability of data reported in scientific literature (De Gioannis et al., 2013; Wang and Wan, 2009; Ni et al., 2006). Waste composition is one of the fundamental characteristics to be taken into account in a proper comparison of hydrogen yields (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015). Carbohydrate-rich substances are reported to have higher hydrogen yields than protein- and lipid-rich substrates (De Gioannis et al., 2013; Kobayashi et al., 2012; Okamoto et al., 2000). The fermentation of lipids produces glycerol and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). LCFAs inhibit anaerobic bacteria as they adhere to the cell wall and decrease the efficiency of nutrient transportation (Dong et al., 2009). The degradation of proteins to organic acids occurs by means of three pathways: the Stickland reaction, oxidative deamination from sole amino acid and reductive deamination from sole amino acid. The first reaction controls almost 90% of degradation, the second, with hydrogen as one of the products, is thermodynamically unfavourable and requires extremely low values of hydrogen partial pressure, whereas the third one is favourable and is hydrogen consuming (Dong et al., 2009). Although the presence of proteins may enhance the fermentation process by providing necessary nutrients for cell growth (Bai et al., 2004), the degradation of amino acids involves hydrogen-consuming reactions. Varying chemical waste compositions may therefore result in inconstant hydrogen yields. Few studies to date have specifically evaluated the effects of chemical composition of substrates on dark fermentation process performances. Bai et al. (2004) focused on the effects of protein on hydrogen yields in batch conditions from mixtures of glucose or starch, as source of carbohydrate, and peptone as source of protein. The Authors reported highest hydrogen yields at glucose and peptone concentrations of 3000 and 2000mg/l as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), respectively, thus suggesting an optimal glucose to peptone ratio of 1.5gCOD/gCOD. When starch was used as source of carbohydrate, highest hydrogen yields were obtained at starch and peptone concentrations of 4000 and 1000mgCOD/l, respectively, thus resulting in a different optimal starch to peptone ratio of 4gCOD/gCOD. Other Authors observed the effect of a variable substrate chemical composition on hydrogen production during co-digestion studies. Kim et al. (2004) evaluated different mixtures of food waste, as source of carbohydrate, and sewage sludge, as source of protein, during co-digestion batch tests for hydrogen production. The highest hydrogen yields were obtained for mixtures made up of 81–87% of food waste and 19–13% of sewage sludge on volatile solids (VS) basis (food waste to sewage sludge ratio between 0.8 and 0.9gVS/gVS) at VS concentrations in the digestion liquid ranging from 0.5% to 5%. The Authors reported that the enhanced hydrogen yield was due to a balanced carbohydrate to protein ratio of 1.66g COD/gCOD. Boni et al., (2013) evaluated optimal co-digestion conditions of food waste with slaughterhouse waste, a protein- and lipid-rich substrate. The Authors reported improved hydrogen productions when the digestion mixture comprised 60–70% of slaughterhouse waste and 30–40% food waste (% of raw weight). This condition corresponds to a food to slaughterhouse waste ratio of 0.2 as gVS/gVS and a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) equal to 5.5gC/gN (both calculated from data reported in the article) while content of COD, carbohydrate, protein or lipid of the mixture was not reported. The reported results indicate therefore that optimal conditions are not univocal and more detailed information on the chemical composition of substrates is required for data comparison and definition of optimal process conditions. Waste composition and chemical characterisation of organic waste from municipalities are not constant over time and this variability greatly affects hydrogen yields (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015). Studies should therefore be undertaken to evaluate how the variable contents of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids present in organic waste are associated to hydrogen yields, and whether synergistic or antagonistic effects exist between these three main groups of organics. Moreover, within the concept of hydrogen biorefinery, where different fermentation products of commercial interest could be obtained in addition to hydrogen (Sarma et al., 2015), it is equally fundamental to assess how chemical composition of feeding substrates influences fermentation products. The aim of this research study was to evaluate the effects of the chemical composition of organic waste, in terms of carbohydrate, protein and lipid content (as percentage of total solids – %TS), on hydrogen potential productions from a dark fermentation process. The study also aimed at evaluating how chemical waste composition affects volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production and the fate of organic carbon."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Organic waste samples,"2.1 Organic waste samples Organic waste samples were prepared from food products with the aim of using reproducible substrates capable of simulating both organic waste and industrial food waste. Four different fractions of organic waste were defined: meat-fish-cheese (MFC), fruits (F), vegetable (V), bread-pasta (BP). The fraction MFC was composed of raw chicken breast, tuna chunks in brine and butter; the fraction F was composed of apple-banana mousse; the fraction V was composed of lyophilized minestrone soup; the fraction BP was composed of bread crumbs and raw pasta. Raw composition of the four fractions is reported in Table 1 . Eight different organic waste mixtures (Mix 1 to Mix 8) were prepared by mixing the four fractions MFC, F, V, and BP. Mix 1 to Mix 4 were prepared in order to obtain a growing lipid content, a constant protein content and a decreasing carbohydrate content. Mix 5 to Mix 8 were prepared in order to obtain a growing protein content, constant lipid content and decreasing carbohydrate content. Raw composition of the eight mixtures is reported in Table 1. After preparation all samples were shredded in a kitchen mill to create a homogeneous substrate. All samples were characterized for the following parameters: Total Solid (TS), Volatile Solid (VS), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). To provide for a detailed assessment of the type of organics present in any substrate and to confirm the predetermined composition of the eight mixtures, the following groups of organics were analysed: lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, hemicellulose, cellulose, non structural carbohydrates (NCS), starch, free sugars, sucrose, glucose. Data on the physical and chemical characterisation of all substrates are reported in Table 2 . The chemical compositions of the eight mixtures were chosen within ranges reported in literature (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015; Lund Hansen et al., 2007; Garcı́a et al., 2005; la Cour Jansen et al., 2004)."
3,Dark fermentation batch tests,"2.2 Dark fermentation batch tests To evaluate the effects of a variable chemical composition of organic waste on the dark fermentation process, laboratory scale batch tests were performed on the four fractions (MFC, F, V, BP) and eight mixtures (Mix 1 to Mix 8) previously described. Dark fermentation performances were evaluated in terms of biogas and hydrogen potential productions, final VFAs concentrations in the digestion liquid and fate of organic carbon. All tests were carried out in triplicate. Dark fermentation batch tests were carried out in 1-litre batch reactors under mesophilic conditions (35±1°C). Reactors were hermetically closed by means of a silicon plug enabling sampling of the gas and liquid produced during fermentation. The liquid volume in each reactor, consisting of the substrate, inoculum and tap water, was 500ml. Tests were performed at a substrate concentration of 5gVS/l. The ratio between the volatile solids of the substrate to be degraded and volatile solids of the inoculum biomass (Food/Microorganisms – F/M) was 0.3gVS/gVS. The pH was set to 5.5 using MES (2-N-Morpholino-EthaneSulfonic acid, Sigma), this value being considered as optimal on the basis of previous studies (Alibardi et al., 2012; Favaro et al., 2013). Anaerobic sludge (AS) was used as inoculum and was collected from a full-scale anaerobic digester of sewage sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Padova, Italy. AS was characterised by a TS concentration of 9gTS/l, a VS concentration of 45% of TS and a TKN concentration of 108mgN/gVS. AS was heat-treated in a rotary water bath incubator at a fixed temperature of 80°C for 15min in order to select only hydrogen producing bacteria and inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Li and Fang, 2007). After preparation, the reactors were flushed with N2 gas for 3min and incubated under static conditions in a thermostatic chamber. At the end of dark fermentation batch tests liquid samples were collected from each reactor, filtered at 0.2μm and analysed for the following parameters: Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH4 +) and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFAs) concentrations. Blank tests were also prepared as described above without addition of substrate. All results are expressed as net values (subtracting the blank)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods TS, VS, TKN and NH4 + concentrations were analysed using standard methods (APHA, 1999). Concentration of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, starch and free sugars were analysed according to official methods (AOAC, 2003). TOC values were obtained by difference between Total Carbon (TC) and Inorganic Carbon (IC). TC and IC were analysed by a TOC analyser (TOC-V CSN, Shimadzu). DOC concentrations were obtained by means of the same procedure for TOC after filtration of liquid samples at 0.2μm. The biogas volume produced during dark fermentation batch tests was measured by means of the water displacement method. By this method the biogas accumulated in reactors headspace was released in a second bottle filled with an acidified (pH<3) and saline (NaCl 25%) solution to avoid the dissolution of gas into the liquid. The biogas released into the second bottle moved an equivalent volume of liquid that was subsequently measured with a graduated cylinder. Biogas composition in the headspace of reactors, in terms of hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations, was analysed using a micro-GC (Varian 490-GC) equipped with a 10-meter MS5A column (to analyse H2 and CH4) and a 10-meter PPU column (to analyse CO2) and two Thermal Conductivity Detectors (TCDs). Argon was used as carrier gas at a pressure of 60kPa in columns. Injector and column temperatures were both set to 80°C. VFAs concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph (Varian 3900) equipped with a CP-WAX 58 WCOT fused silica column (Varian) and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow of 4ml/min in column. The oven temperature programme was initially set at 80°C for the first minute, then increased at a rate of 10°C/min to 180°C (remaining for 2min). Injector and detector temperatures were both set to 250°C."
5,Calculations and statistical methods,"2.4 Calculations and statistical methods Hydrogen and carbon dioxide volumes produced in the time interval between each measurement [t − (t−1)] during dark fermentation batch tests, were calculated using a model taking into consideration the hydrogen gas concentration at time t and time t−1, together with the total volume of biogas produced at time t, the concentration of the specific gas at times t and t−1, and the volume of the head space of reactors (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). The following equation was applied: (1) V C , t = C C , t · V G , t + V H · ( C C , t - C C , t - 1 ) where: VC,t : volume of hydrogen or carbon dioxide produced in the interval between t and t−1; CC,t , CC,t−1 : hydrogen or carbon dioxide concentrations measured at times t and t−1; VG,t : volume of biogas produced between time t and t−1; VH : volume of the headspace of reactors. Data on biogas, hydrogen and carbon dioxide productions are expressed at a temperature of 0°C and pressure of 1atm (Standard conditions). The fate of organic carbon was evaluated calculating the fraction emitted as CO2 and the fraction hydrolysed to DOC at the end of the dark fermentation tests. The following equations were applied: (2) Carbon emitted as CO 2 ( % ) = V CO 2 / V IG · C MM · VS TOC · 100 where: V CO 2 : carbon dioxide production (mlCO2/gVS); VIG : volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at standard conditions=22,414ml/mol; CMM : carbon molar mass=12gC/mol; VS: volatile solid concentration of the substrate (gVS/gTS); TOC: total organic carbon concentration of the substrate (gTOC/gTS). (3) Carbon hydrolysed to DOC ( % ) = V L · DOC V L · C VS · 1 / VS · TOC · 100 where: VL : liquid volume of the fermentation tests=0.5l; DOC: dissolved organic carbon concentration measured at the end of the fermentation (gDOC/l); CVS : concentration of substrate volatile solid in the digestion liquid=5gVS/l; VS: volatile solid concentration of the substrate (gVS/gTS); TOC: total organic carbon concentration of the substrate (gTOC/gTS). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Tukey’s test in pairwise comparisons and multiple linear regressions were performed using the software Past 3.05 for Macintosh (Hammer et al., 2001). A confidence level of 95% was selected for all statistical comparisons."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen potential productions of the organic waste samples,"3.1 Hydrogen potential productions of the organic waste samples The results of biogas and hydrogen potential productions obtained from the four fractions (MFC, F, V, BP) and the eight mixtures (Mix 1 to Mix 8) are reported in Table 3 . During all dark fermentation batch tests no methane was detected. Thermal pre-treatment of inoculum was therefore efficient in the inhibition of methanogenic bacteria. Observing the data of the four fractions, the highest hydrogen productions were obtained from F, V BP. These samples were characterised by a high content of readily biodegradable carbohydrate (>60% of TS, Table 2), either starch or simple sugars, representing the preferable substrate for dark fermentation process (De Gioannis et al., 2013; Hallenbeck, 2009). Data obtained from the fraction BP are in agreement with studies on hydrogen production from organic substrates rich in carbohydrates such as potato (Xie et al., 2008), rice (Dong et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2000), common and durum wheat bran (Giordano et al., 2011), and cheese whey (De Gioannis et al., 2014). The high hydrogen productions obtained in this study for the fractions F and V agree with studies in which whole fruits or vegetables were used as a substrate during fermentation tests (Kobayashi et al., 2012; Hwang et al., 2011; Mohanakrishna et al., 2010; Venkata Mohan et al., 2009; Vijayaraghavan et al., 2006). On the contrary, when these two fractions were sorted from household waste, rather low hydrogen yields were reported (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015; Lee et al., 2008). The variability of data for these fractions is due to the fact that fruit and vegetable residues present in the organic fraction of municipal solid waste are composed of peelings, roots and wasted parts rich in slowly degradable organics. On the contrary, wasted whole vegetables and fruits contain large quantities of readily biodegradable carbohydrates that can easily be converted into biohydrogen with high conversion yields (Table 3). The data obtained confirm how several food waste products generated from production, distribution and retailing stages of food supply chains may represent potential substrates to be used for hydrogen production by the dark fermentation process. However, not all food or organic wastes are suitable for hydrogen production. Very low hydrogen yields were in fact measured for the fraction MFC (Table 3). These results confirm data reported by Alibardi and Cossu (2015) on hydrogen productions from samples of meat, fish and cheese sorted from source segregated household organic waste and by Boni et al. (2013) on slaughterhouse waste. Organic substrates mainly composed of either protein or lipid are not suitable substrates for hydrogen production by dark fermentation process. Amino acids produced from the hydrolysis of protein are fermented by so-called Strickland reactions yielding no hydrogen, while LCFAs from lipid hydrolysis can be converted to acetate and hydrogen only at extremely low hydrogen partial pressure produced by its consumption by methanogenic or sulphate-reducing bacteria (Dong et al., 2009; Hallenbeck, 2009). Indeed, proteins provide nutrients for biological degradation processes, thus generating buffer capacity during anaerobic digestion. On the other hand inhibitory conditions may be caused by both high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +) released from protein or by high concentrations of LCFAs released from lipids (Ariunbaatar et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2014). The presence of these two groups of organics may therefore produce either beneficial or inhibitory conditions during fermentation for hydrogen production. Within the eight mixtures, the highest hydrogen productions were obtained from Mix 1 and Mix 5 while the lowest from Mix 4 and Mix 8. Mix 1 and Mix 5 were both characterised by a high presence of carbohydrate while Mix 4 and Mix 8 were characterised by either high protein or lipid contents and comparable carbohydrate contents. Hydrogen yields were almost doubled for samples with higher carbohydrate contents (Mix 1 and Mix 5) compared to those obtained from samples with low carbohydrate content (Mix 4 and Mix 8). Analysis of variance carried out on hydrogen productions from all samples indicated the finding of statistically different results (p <0.01). This confirms that changes in potential productions are only due to the different chemical compositions of samples. Moreover, these results confirm that variations in the chemical composition of organic waste produce significant effects on hydrogen production yields, thus supporting the preliminary results reported by Alibardi and Cossu (2015) obtained by mixing fractions of organic waste sorted at household level. The results may also explain the high variability in hydrogen potential yields from organic waste reported in literature (De Gioannis et al., 2013). The Tukey’s test in pairwise comparisons performed on hydrogen productions indicated a similarity only between results obtained from Mix 3 and Mix 7 (p >0.05). These two samples were characterised by similar chemical compositions with the exception that protein and lipid contents were the opposite. This finding suggests that a different protein and lipid content in the two mixtures had no effect on hydrogen yields. To confirm this hypothesis, statistical analysis of linear regression was performed on both biogas and hydrogen productions with carbohydrate, protein and lipid contents (% of TS) of all samples (four fractions and eight mixtures) as variables. Results of the analysis are reported in Table 4 . Biogas production obtained from fermentation batch tests resulted linearly correlated to organic waste chemical composition ( R adj 2 = 0.983 , p <0.01) mainly due to carbohydrate content (R 2 =0.983). Protein and lipid did not produce any statistically significant contribution (p >0.05) and a weak correlation to data was observed (R 2 ⩽0.6). Similar results were also obtained for hydrogen productions. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated a correlation of hydrogen production with carbohydrate, protein and lipid content ( R adj 2 = 0.965 , p <0.01), although protein and lipid alone failed to evidence any significant contributions. For both protein and lipid, a weak linear correlation was obtained (R 2 <0.6) and the high p values achieved in statistical analysis indicate that multiple linear regression coefficients are not statistically different from zero. Hydrogen production was therefore only related to carbohydrate content of the substrates (R 2 =0.965, p <0.01). This result is graphically presented in Fig. 1 . The results indicate that the only driving force for high biogas and hydrogen yields is a high concentration of biodegradable carbohydrates in the substrate. Hydrogen production yields were not correlated to carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) or to carbohydrate to protein ratio. As an example MFC and Mix 8 had similar C/N ratios – 6.6 and 5.8 respectively, but strongly different hydrogen productions. The opposite was also observed: F was characterised by a C/N ratio of 80, and BP a C/N ration of 19, although hydrogen productions were similar – 188 and 167mlH2/gVS, respectively. Contrasting results were reported by Lin and Lay (2004) indicating an optimal C/N ratio of 47 from batch tests using sucrose as carbon source. Nitrogen limitation was indicated as underlying the reduced hydrogen production obtained at higher C/N ratios. In the present research study, NH4 + concentrations measured at the end of fermentation tests were above minimum requirements for anaerobic processes and below ammonia inhibitory levels (data not shown) thus nitrogen limitation or ammonia inhibition were not taken as being implicated in hydrogen yield variability. Moreover, the optimal ratio between carbohydrates and proteins of 1.66g carbohydrate-COD/g protein-COD reported by Kim et al. (2004) was not confirmed by the findings of this study. These Authors used sewage sludge as source of protein in co-digestion tests with food waste for hydrogen production. The different nature and degradability of the organic materials used could possibly explain the diversity of the results. The findings of the present research work suggest that the variable presence of protein or lipid does not provide inhibitory or stimulating conditions for hydrogen production, but only affects hydrogen potential productions reducing the presence of carbohydrate per unit of VS fermented. To confirm this hypothesis, hydrogen productions obtained from the eight mixtures were calculated using the hydrogen yields of the single fractions (Table 3) and the material composition of the eight mixtures (Table 1). A comparison between the measured hydrogen productions from the eight mixtures and those calculated from material composition is reported in Fig. 2 . Calculated hydrogen productions of Mix 1 to Mix 4 were found to be overestimated by about 10–17% while those of Mix 5 to Mix 8 had been underestimated by less than 8%. These differences were ascribed to the sum of experimental errors during test preparation and gas measurements, rather than as a result of detrimental or improved fermentative conditions established by the different chemical compositions of tested substrates. Data showed in Fig. 2 confirm therefore the possibility of predicting the hydrogen production potentials from organic waste or food waste when using stable and replicable digestion conditions. Contrasting results were reported by Boni et al. (2013) with regards to co-digestion tests conducted using food waste and slaughterhouse waste for hydrogen production. Improved hydrogen productions were reported (approximately 1.5 - 2 fold higher than those obtained from food waste samples alone) were reported when these two substrates were mixed in ratios 40/60 or 30/70 (food waste/slaughterhouse waste as raw weight). Moreover, calculated hydrogen productions of tested mixtures were invariably underestimated compared to measured values. The improved digestion conditions were attributed to better buffer properties during fermentation process in the presence of higher slaughterhouse waste content in the digestion mixture. In view of the results obtained in the present study, it is presumable that the hydrogen yield reported by Boni et al. (2013) for the sample of food waste alone resulted low as an effect of less than ideal digestion conditions due to an unstable pH. To this regard, Cappai et al. (2014) demonstrated that different pH values exert a remarkable influence on hydrogen yields from food waste (simulated by using food products as in this study), clearly showing that an adequate pH control is one of the key factors in hydrogen production through dark fermentation."
8,Fermentation products and carbon-fate,"3.2 Fermentation products and carbon-fate Molar concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) measured at the end of the fermentation tests are reported in Table 5 . Acetic (HAc) and butyric (HBu) acids were the main VFAs produced during fermentation while propionic acid was present in low concentrations in all samples with the exception of MFC. Only butyric acid production was correlated with chemical composition of organic waste. Results of multiple linear regression between the concentration of butyric acid and the carbohydrate, protein and lipid contents are reported in Table 6 . Carbohydrate content was found to be the main factor influencing butyrate concentration, while lipid failed to show any significant effect (p >0.05). Protein on the contrary correlated positively with butyric acid concentration, although R 2 value was quite low (Table 6). Substrates with the highest content of carbohydrate (F, BP) produced a molar concentration of butyric acid close to that of acetic acid, with a butyric to acetic acid ratio (HBu/HAc) higher than 0.8. All other substrates featured an HBu/HAc ratio ranging between 0.5 and 0.7, while MFC alone had a value of 0.36. These results are similar to those reported by Cappai et al. (2014) on the evaluation of optimal pH for food waste fermentation. Optimal process conditions resulting in highest hydrogen production had as an outcome an HBu/HAc value of 0.84, whilst lower hydrogen yields were characterised by lower HBu/HAc ratios. Both the results obtained in the present study and those reported by Cappai et al. (2014) confirm that the nature and chemical composition of the organic waste used for hydrogen production not only define the optimum pH value to be used during dark fermentation process but also set the maximum obtainable hydrogen yields. Kim et al. (2006) found that HBu/HAc was directly proportional to H2 yields during operation of a continuously stirred tank reactor on sucrose and suggested that HBu/HAc ratio could be a quantitative indicator of substrate metabolism and H2 production. The linear correlation obtained by Kim et al. (2006) was not confirmed in this study likely due to the variable composition of the tested organic waste. Indeed, multiple linear regression of HBu/HAc with the composition of organic waste (Table 6) highlighted how all three main groups of organics provided a statistically significant contribution to the HBu/HAc ratio, although the linear model showed a moderate representation of data distribution ( R adj 2 = 0.691 ). Hydrogen partial pressure (pH2) likewise affects fermentation performances and final products composition. It is generally reported that high pH2 decreases hydrogenase enzyme activity and diverts metabolic pathways towards solvent production at low pH values (Hallenbeck, 2009; Khanal et al., 2004), while low pH2 reduces HBu/HAc ratio and increases hydrogen yields (Clark et al., 2012; Van Andel et al., 1985). The result of the linear correlation of pH2 measured in reactor headspace during fermentation tests and HBu/HAc ratios is reported in Table 6. The pH2 measured in reactor headspace ranged between 0.2 and 0.4atm for all samples with the exception of MFC. A pH2 of 0.05atm was measured at the end of fermentation tests due to the low biogas and hydrogen productions obtained from this substrate. HBu/HAc ratio was affected by pH2 in spite of a weak linear correlation (R 2 =0.641). It is presumable that the higher pH2 produced by carbohydrate rich substrates reduced the metabolic pathways associated to HAc production and stimulated those producing HBu as suggested by Van Andel et al. (1985). Accordingly, values of pH2 in batch tests are influenced by both total biogas production and reactor headspace volume, due to the reduction of pH2 as an effect of dilution by nitrogen gas initially used to establish anaerobic conditions. Hydrogen supersaturation in the digestion liquid also produces an effect on fermentation products as reported by Zheng et al. (2015). Different parameters therefore influence the final products of the dark fermentation process, although chemical composition seems to play a central role by establishing hydrogen potential productions and the optimal pH values. The findings relating to biogas and CO2 productions (Table 3) together with the measurements of DOC concentrations in the digestion liquid at the end of the fermentation tests, allowed to calculate how the initial organic carbon in any substrate was transformed at the end of the fermentation process (Eqs. (2) and (3)). The results are reported in Table 7 . Carbon emitted as CO2 varied between 3% and 22% of the initial organic carbon content of the substrates. The majority of the carbon therefore remains available in the liquid phase at the end of the dark fermentation process for further conversion. Both the carbon emitted as CO2 and the DOC measured at the end of the fermentation process in the digestion liquid were found to be variable for all substrates. Materials showing the lowest degradation percentages were those characterised by either a high protein or lipid content (MFC, Mix 4, Mix 8). Indeed, multiple regression analysis reported in Table 8 highlighted how only CO2 production was linearly correlated to carbohydrate content of substrates, as had been previously reported for biogas and hydrogen production. On the contrary, the hydrolysis of organic carbon to DOC was not significantly correlated to protein or lipid contents and the linear regression of data with carbohydrate content provided a rather weak correlation (R 2 =0.741). It can however be assumed that chemical composition affected hydrolysis rates during fermentation as protein and lipid are generally characterised by the slowest hydrolytic rates (Neves et al., 2008; Vavilin et al., 2008). These results highlight how the chemical composition of an organic waste influences the final products of the dark fermentation process. If dark fermentation process is included in a biorefinery chain where fermentation products are destined for use in other bio-processes, variability on chemical composition of organic waste fed into the fermentation reactor might also produce marked effects on final products of fermentation as demonstrated from this study, consequently potentially resulting in a negative effect on performance of the entire biorefinery chain. The findings obtained likewise suggest that the data routinely used to characterise organic waste (TS, VS, TOC, COD, etc.) might not be sufficient to predict fermentation performances and product variability. Appropriate parameters should be defined if food and agro-industrial wastes are to be used in a biorefinery concept. Food waste and agro-industrial wastes represent ideal candidates for use in a biorefinery process thanks to a more stable quality over time. Moreover, different types of food waste may be mixed to obtain the desired chemical composition allowing maximum hydrogen production and optimum final products. A better understanding of the effects of composition variability on the entire process performances (hydrogen yields and fermentation products) should be gained in order to allow the dark fermentation process to be indicated as the preferred up-front degradation process in a biorefinery chain (Ghimire et al., 2015; Alibardi et al., 2014)."
9,Conclusions,"The present research work investigated the effects of chemical composition of organic waste on the dark fermentation process, fermentation products and on carbon transformations. Biogas and hydrogen productions were found to be linearly correlated to carbohydrate content of substrates, while protein and lipid content produced no significant contributions. Biodegradable carbohydrate content therefore represents a key parameter in the identification of the most suitable organic waste (organic fraction of municipal solid waste, food waste or agro-industrial residues) for use in dark fermentation reactors. Chemical composition was also found to influence the final products of dark fermentation. In a biorefinery chain in which dark fermentation process is applied as an up-front bioprocess, waste composition variability should be controlled and adapted to maintain not only the desired hydrogen yields but also specific composition of the final fermentation products to be used in other bioprocesses. Detailed information on waste composition and chemical characterisation are therefore required to clearly identify the potential performances of the dark fermentation process. Dark fermentation is suited for use as an initial process in a biorefinery chain. Further research studies should be however be undertaken to clarify the potential of the process to produce not only biohydrogen, but also simple organics destined for further use as bioproducts, bulk chemicals or feeding substrates in other bio-processes."
