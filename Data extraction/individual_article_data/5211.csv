0,Introduction,"Halogenated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of toxic chemicals, which mainly consist of brominated, chlorinated and fluorinated compounds. Most of these compounds were formerly produced on an industrial scale to be used in agriculture, materials and other applications. The emission of these POPs into the environment will cause numerous health problems, including liver, kidney and thyroid toxicity as well as cancer, and thus the treatment of halogenated POPs has attracted great attention in the field of pollution control [1,2]. Recently, we have devoted ourselves to the reductive debromination of brominated POPs, and established a series of systems for the cleavage of C-Br bond [3–6]. As we all know, the C-Cl bond have the much larger bond dissociation energy (340.2 kJ mol−1) than that of C-Br (281.4 kJ mol−1) [7], thus the chlorinated organic pollutants attracted our attention due to its difficulties of the cleavage of C-Cl bond. Chlorobenzenes (C6HnCl6-n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5) are ubiquitous contaminants in groundwater and soil as a result of their extensive use as industrial solvents and reactants in the manufacturing of dyes and pesticides, and/or the release from some combustion processes of organic compounds containing any chlorine [8,9]. The toxicity and lipophilicity of chlorinated benzenes are believed to increase with increasing chlorination degree [10,11]. Pentachlorobenzene (PentaCB, n = 5) is a typical congener of chlorinated benzenes, which was chosen as a representative of halogenated POPs. Several strategies for the destruction of chlorinated aromatic compounds have been developed, which may be roughly grouped into oxidation and reduction processes. On the whole, highly-chlorinated benzenes are resistant to the oxidative degradation, which needs relative harsh reaction conditions [12–17]. For example, Li et al. reported that δ-MnO2 polymorphs could catalyze the oxidative degradation of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, but required reaction temperatures as high as 300 °C [12]. Xu et al. reported that the destruction of PentaCB [13] and hexachlorobenzene [14] on a commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst required temperatures higher than 350 °C. The similar reaction temperature was needed as used MnO2@GdOx as catalysts to accelerate the oxidation of chlorobenzene [17]. Another serious problem in the oxidative degradation of chlorinated aromatic compounds is that the oxidative methods may produce more hazardous by-products, such as polychlorinated debenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDD/Fs). Therefore, a lot of studies on the degradation of chlorobenzenes have focused on the reductive dechlorination by methods such as photocatalytic reduction [18–20], electrocatalytic hydrogenolysis [21,22], chemical reduction with zero valent metals [23,24], and so on. Tanaka et al. demonstrated that a complete dechlorination of chlorobenzene to benzene could be achieved on a core-shell Au@Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst after visible-light irradiation for 20 h, whereas Pd-free Au/TiO2 was invalid [18]. Fuku et al. loaded various metals on TiO2 for the photocatalytical reduction of chlorobenzene in 2-propanol and found that the extent of dechlorination increased in the order of loaded metals: Ag ≈ Cu < Pt < Ru ≪ Rh ≈ Pd [19]. Luo et al. electrochemically reduced chlorobenzene on nanoscale Pd/Fe coated glassy carbon at −0.1 V in 0.1 M H2SO4, achieving a removal of 90% within 120 min [21]. They observed that a Pd/Fe cathode produced atomic hydrogen, which chemisorbed on the surface of Pd to form adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) and rapidly reacted with chlorobenzenes, whereas the reduction of chlorobenzene only proceeded via the direct two-electron process on an Fe electrode. As for the zero-valent metal system, Shih et al. reported that the use of nano zero-valent Fe (particle size ~ 90 nm, load 133 g L−1) reduced 60% of hexachlorobenzene at pH 6.0 within 24 h, and the use of 0.02%Pd-Fe particles increased the degradation efficiency to 70% [24]. The above-mentioned processes suggest that the noble metals, especially Pd, are favorable to the dechlorination of chlorobenzenes, possibly due to their activity for catalytic hydrogenation [25]. Sorella et al. reported selective hydrogenations and dechlorinations in water mediated by anionic surfactant-stabilized Pd nanoparticles, and found that the hydrogenation of chlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene were achieved in this system with the presence of NaHCO3 at room temperature under H2, although the required reaction time was as long as 24 h [26]. Wiltschka et al. conducted the hydrodechlorination of hexachlorobenzene and all 11 further chlorobenzenes at environmentally relevant concentrations in miniaturized reaction systems containing Pd(0)-nanoparticles [27]. These authors found that specific catalytic activities of Pd(0)-nanoparticles differed depending on chlorination degree of chlorobenzenes and position of chlorine atoms, and an inductive effect is assumed to favor a removal of the vicinal chlorine atom [27]. Ukisu et al. reported 5%Pd/C induced efficient dechlorination of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to benzene in a 2-propanol solution containing NaOH, leading to a dechlorination efficiency of 100% within 180 min at 64 °C [7]. It seems that a high content of Pd (5% and even pure Pd) or elevated reaction temperature is required to achieve the relatively rapid and complete dechlorination of CBs as H2 or alcohols used as hydrogen donors. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to simultaneously reduce noble-metal load in catalysts and decrease reaction temperature for the chemical reduction of chlorobenzenes with the other hydrogen donors. Recently, we reported the complete debromination of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47) with Cu/TiO2 as a catalyst and hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent under mild conditions, in which the affinity of catalysts to Br atoms and H atoms played an important on the hydro-debromination process [4]. That is to say, a catalyst/reductant combination was promising to accelerate the dechlorination of PentaCB. However, our preliminary experiments confirmed that this system was useless to cause complete dechlorination of pentaCB, due to the much larger bond dissociation energy of C-Cl (340.2 kJ mol−1) than C-Br (281.4 kJ mol−1) [7]. Compared to Cu, Pd has stronger hydrogen affinity due to that the hydrogen adsorption energy over Cu is −2.45 eV, which is lower than that of Pd (-2.88 eV) [28]. Thus, Pd will exhibit high efficiency in both the generation and retainment of active hydrogen species (H*) through both H* adsorption on the Pd surface and H* absorption into the Pd crystal lattice by forming Pd hydride [29,30]. In addition, Pd is often used in coupling reactions for organic synthesis due to its unique interaction with halogenated compounds [31–33]. Our previous reports have confirmed that Pd has strong affinity interaction with Br atoms because Pd is an electron-rich d10 metal, which promotes the cleavage of C-Br bond of BDE47 [5,34]. Therefore, it is anticipated that integrating with the selection of the reducing agent, the use of Pd nanoparticles should yield complete reductive dechlorination of PentaCB through a catalytic transfer hydrogenation path. Compared with the reducant N2H4·H2O, NaBH4 is chemically stable and non-combustible, and the resultant NaBO2 relatively non-toxic and also be recycled to generate borohydride [35]. Thus, the complete reduction of PentaCB may be achieved by catalytic transfer hydrogenation process induced with Pd nanoparticles and NaBH4. As we know, a substantial part of halogenated organic pollutants existed in soils, deposits and/or other industrial solid wastes due to its poor solubility, and it is usually necessary to extract these pollutants from the solid substrates by using appropriate organic solvent. Therefore, we may use an organic solvent (such as methanol) instead of water, and we are more interesting at the treatment of dechlorination of PentaCB at high concentration levels. In the present work, therefore, we prepared a new catalyst by decorating Pd nanoparticles on g-C3N4 with an impregnation-chemical reduction method. This catalyst (Pd/g-C3N4) had a low noble-metal load (1%), and the combination of catalyst Pd/g-C3N4 and reductant NaBH4 yielded rapid and complete dechlorination of PentaCB at high concentration levels within 20 min at a temperature as low as 30 °C."
1,Experiment section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials PentaCB, 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene (1,2,3,4-TetraCB), 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene (1,2,3,5-TetraCB), 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (1,2,4,5-TetraCB), 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (1,2,3-TriCB), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TriCB), 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (1,3,5-TriCB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DiCB), 1,3-dichlorobenzene (1,3-DiCB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DiCB), and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd.. Stock solutions of chlorobenzenes (4 mmol L−1) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding chlorobenzene in methanol. PdCl2 was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), melamine, thiourea, were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All of the reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was used for all the experiments."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts g-C3N4 was prepared with melamine and thiourea as precursors according to the method as reported previously [5,36]. Typically, 2.52 g melamine and 3.81 g thiourea were added into 50 mL H2O with a molar ratio of melamine to thiourea of 2: 5. Then, the suspension was stirred in water bath at 60 °C for hours to evaporate water. Subsequently, the obtained melamine-thiourea mixture solid was heated to 600 °C in the muffle furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and held for 4 h in air atmosphere. Finally, the obtained products were ground into powders and collected as bulk g-C3N4. Pd/g-C3N4 composites were synthesized by a simple impregnation and chemical reduction technique. Typically, g-C3N4 powders (200 mg) were added into 48 mL H2O in a beaker and the catalysts was uniformly dispersed with the assistance of ultrasonic for 5 min. The dispersion in the beaker was then placed in a water bath (at 30 °C) integrated with a magnetic stirrer. 2 mL PdCl2 stock solution (1000 mg L−1 Pd2+) was dropwise added into the abovementioned dispersion with stirring at a rotation rate of 900 r/min. The resultant mixture in the beaker was moved into an ultrasonic bath and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, the beaker with the dispersion was transferred into the water bath (at 30 °C) once again. 2 mL of NaBH4 (2 g L−1) was dropped into the mixture under the magnetic stirring at a rotation rate of 900 r/min. Then, the suspension in the beaker was further stirred for another 60 min under the same condition after the addition of NaBH4 was finished. Finally, the suspension was filtered, and the solids (Pd/g-C3N4) were washed and dried at 60 °C in vacuum oven for 240 min."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts The surface morphology of catalysts was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 T20, Netherlands), which was operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was conducted on a diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and applied current were set as 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The surface chemical state was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a VG Multilad 2000 spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation) with Al Kα radiation as the exciting source (300 W). Binding energies were calibrated versus the C 2p signal at 284.6 eV. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was investigated under a reducing gas with containing 10% H2 and 90% Ar (Altamira AMI-300). The temperature was raised from 50 to 150 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded on a ESR spectrometer (Bruker EMXnano). The parameters are as following: center field, 3433.75 G; sweep width, 200 G; sweep time, 30 ms; receiver gain, 40 dB; modulation amplitude, 3G; microwave attenuation, 10 dB."
5,Degradation of PentaCB,"2.4 Degradation of PentaCB The degradation experiments were conducted in a headspace bottles sealed with a cover in a water bath, and the reaction solution was mildly stirred with a small magnetic stirrer at specified temperatures. Typically, 1 mL of PentaCB (4 mmol L−1) was diluted to 9 mL with methanol in a headspace bottle, followed by adding 10 mg Pd/g-C3N4. After the headspace bottle was sealed with cover, the mixture was well dispersed with ultrasonication and the reaction bottle was then moved into the water bath. Then 1 mL of NaBH4 (100 mmol L−1) was rapidly injected into the suspension to initiate the reaction. The initial concentration of PentaCB and NaBH4 in the reaction solution was 0.4 mmol L−1 and 10 mmol L−1, respectively. After the reaction was started, solution samples (0.3 mL) were taken out by using an injection syringe at given time intervals and immediately filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane filter to separate the solid catalysts to terminate the reaction. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were reproducible within errors being less than ± 5%."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The concentrations of PentaCB and its intermediates were analyzed by using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo scientific Ultimate 3000), equipped with a diode array detector and an SB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water (v/v, 70: 30) at 1.0 mL min−1, and the detector wavelength was set at 230 nm. The concentration of generated Cl− ions was monitored by ion chromatography (IC) (TOSOH, IC-2010), equipped with a conductivity detector and TSK gel SuperIC-AZ column. The solution of 1.7 mmol L − 1 Na2CO3 and 6.3 mmol L − 1 NaHCO3 were mixed as the eluent, and the flow rate was set at 0.8 mL min − 1. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) was used to identify the intermediates. Firstly, the liquid supernatant was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 as drying agent, subsequently analyzed on GC system (Thermo scientific TRACE 1300 GC Ultra) equipped with a TR-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) coupled to MS system with the electron ionization mode (Thermo scientific ISQ). The initial oven temperature was set at 40 °C and maintained for 1 min, then increased to 300 °C with a heating temperature of 10 °C min−1, and finally held for another 5 min. The injector, transfer line and ion source temperature were set as 260, 280 and 250 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were recorded in full scan mode (m/z 50–400). Total ion current (TIC) and selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode were used for the qualitative and quantization analysis, respectively."
7,DFT calculations,"2.6 DFT calculations DFT calculations concerning the geometrical optimization were performed by using Gaussian09 software package. Optimization of PentaCB were obtained from DFT calculations using the Becke’s parameters and the Lee-Yang-Parr’s nonlocal correlation functional (B3LYP). The basis sets for C, H and Cl were 6-31G(d). For palldium atom, the valence and core electrons were described by the pseudo-potential Lan L2DZ basis set."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts Pd/g-C3N4 composites were prepared by an impregnation-chemical reduction method with PdCl2 and as-prepared g-C3N4 as precursors. In this study, the obtained Pd/g-C3N4 catalysts were named as xPd/g-C3N4 for the sake of convenience, where × represented the nominative mass percentage of Pd to g-C3N4 in the preparation process. As shown in Fig. 1 a, pure g-C3N4 showed a thin sheet structure with a slight aggregation. The TEM image of 1%Pd/g-C3N4 was shown in Fig. 1b. This Pd/g-C3N4 composite consisted of two types of structures: spherical Pd nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nano-sheet. The presence of Pd nanoparticles was further evidenced by the HAADF-STEM observation in Fig. 1c, which clearly showed a large number of Pd nanoparticles. It suggested the abundant distribution of Pd on supports, which was also indicated by the EDS mapping for Pd element (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the EDS mapping results in Fig. 1e and 1f demonstrated the extensive signals of C and N, which corresponded to the existence of g-C3N4 structure. Therefore, the above results suggested the successful preparation of Pd/g-C3N4 composites. Fig. 2 a showed the XRD patterns of g-C3N4, 1%Pd/g-C3N4 and 2%Pd/g-C3N4. Two diffraction peaks at 12.7° and 27.8° were observed for g-C3N4, which was corresponding to the {100} interplanar packing of heptazine units and {002} π-π interlayer stacking structure [37,38]. This indicated that a typical graphite-like structure of C3N4 based material was prepared by the thermal treatment process. In the XRD patterns of 1%Pd/g-C3N4, no obvious peaks in connection with Pd species could be observed due to the low content of Pd nanoparticles, which was actually 0.87% as determined by digestion and subsequently detection on inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). It was worth noting that a distinct peak for Pd nanoparticles was appeared at 40.1° when the nominative Pd content was increased to 2% for 2%Pd/g-C3N4 (detected Pd content 1.82%), indicating the Pd/g-C3N4 composites were successfully prepared by impregnation-chemical reduction method [39]. In addition, no evident shift in the diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 was observed after loading Pd nanoparticles on g-C3N4, suggesting that the formation of Pd nanoparticles did not affect the crystal structure of g-C3N4 [40]. To better understand the chemical composition of Pd/g-C3N4 composites, the XPS spectra of Pd/g-C3N4 composites were recorded. Based on previous reports [41], Pd 3d envelop would present double peaks, corresponding to the spin-orbital splitting of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2. As shown in Fig. 2b, the peaks of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 at 335.7 and 340.9 eV could be assigned to metallic Pd0 [42], while the two peaks at 337.4 and 342.6 eV could be ascribed to Pd2+. These results indicated the formation of Pd-N bonds at the interface between Pd nanoparticles and g-C3N4, and further demonstrated that the amine groups in g-C3N4 could stabilize highly dispersed Pd0 species and prevent their oxidation partly, being consistent with our previous report [5]. In order to further confirm the conclusion, the structures of the g-C3N4 and 1%Pd/g-C3N4 were investigated by FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 2c, the FT-IR spectrum of g-C3N4 showed several bands in the range from 1650 to 1200 cm−1. The band at 1637 cm−1 was assigned to the C-N heterocycle stretching vibration, while the four bands at 1574, 1408, 1315 and 1238 cm−1 to aromatic C-N stretching vibration [42]. The band at 812 cm−1 corresponded to the characteristic breathing mode of the triazine cycle. The broad band in the range from 2800 to 3500 cm−1 could be ascribed to the stretching vibration of N–H bonds in the =NH or –NH2 groups [43]. There results suggested the existence of a typical graphite carbon structure. In the FT-IR spectrum of 1%Pd/g-C3N4, all the main characteristic bands of g-C3N4 appeared, showing that the Pd loading did not change the chemical structure of g-C3N4. However, the signal of band at 2800–3500 cm−1 was greatly decreased in intensity with the loading of Pd nanoparticles, which confirmed that the amino groups in g-C3N4 were used as anchoring sites for Pd nanoparticles [43]. Fig. 2d showed the H2-TPR profiles of g-C3N4 and 1%Pd/g-C3N4. In comparison to the profile of g-C3N4, a negative peak at 80 °C was observed in that of 1%Pd/g-C3N4. In the pretreated process of TPR measurement, the Pd2+ species on the surface of Pd nanoparticles could be reduced at ambient temperature. The zero-valent Pd atoms could then adsorb hydrogen molecules in the reducing gas, which dissociated into two activated hydrogen species to form β-PdHx species [44]. The β-PdHx species was very unstable and preferred to decompose to release molecules hydrogen at temperature of 60–100 °C. These results further confirmed the existence of Pd nanoparticles."
10,Rapid and complete dechlorination of PentaCB,"3.2 Rapid and complete dechlorination of PentaCB As a representative of chlorinated organic pollutants, PentaCB was dechlorinated in CH3OH solution at 30 °C as shown in Fig. 3 . In the blank experiments, the addition of either single NaBH4 or Pd/g-C3N4 could not lead to observable dechlorination of PentaCB. The simultaneous addition of g-C3N4 and NaBH4 yet yield no generation of Cl− ion. However, the combination of Pd/g-C3N4 and NaBH4 caused rapid dechlorination of PentaCB, leading to a dechlorination efficiencey of 100% within 20 min. This suggested that the loaded Pd nanoparticles induced the drastic reduction of PentaCB in the presence of NaBH4. The Cl− generation in the early stage approximately followed a zero-order reaction in kinetics, which may be expressed as c = kt, where c is Cl− concentration at time of t = t, k is the apparent rate constant and t is reaction time, respectively. The k value of Cl− production was evaluated as 0.27 mmol L−1 min−1 in the Pd/g-C3N4-NaBH4 system. As the reaction progressed, the production of Cl− deviated from the zero-order reaction, mainly due to a fast consumption of NaBH4. The influence of Pd content (the mass ratio of Pd to g-C3N4) in the catalyst (1 g L−1) and reaction temperature were investigated on the dechlorination of PentaCB (Fig. S1). As for the influence of Pd content in the catalyst, single g-C3N4 (x = 0) induced no dechlorination of PentaCB. The dechlorination efficiency within 20 min was increased from 0 to 100% with increasing the Pd content from 0 to 1% at 30 °C. When the Pd content (x) was further increased from 1% to 1.25%, the time required for the complete dechlorination of PentaCB was correspondingly shortened from 20 min to 15 min. These results could be ascribed as that more Pd nanoparticles provide more reaction sites for the dechlorination [43]. As for the effect of reaction temperature, it was observed that higher reaction temperatures were favorable to the dechlorination because that thermal vibrations in molecules tend to react much faster with increasing temperature [43]. For example, when the Pd content was 1%, the dechlorination efficiency of 46.3% within 20 min at 10 °C, and the dechlorination became much faster with a dechlorination efficiency of 100% at 40 °C. Fig. 4 a further illustrated the effects of reaction temperature and Pd content in terms of k value for the dechlorination with 10 mmol L−1 NaBH4 as the reducing agent. As the Pd content in the catalyst (x) was increased from 0 to 1.25%, the k value was found to be increased from 0 to 0.34 mol L−1 min−1. According to the experimental results, k = 0.25 mmol L−1 min−1 might be taken as a critical value (k critical), and once the experimental k value was more than k critical = 0.25 mmol L−1 min−1, the dechlorination of PentaCB would proceed very fast, easily leading to rapid and complete dechlorination of PentaCB. For example, in the case of the combination of x = 1% and 30 °C, we observed k = 0.27 mmol L−1 min−1. That is to say, in this case all the chlorine atoms could be removed from PentaCB within 20 min. When increased the Pd content to 1.25%, the k value could still retain more than 0.26 mmol L−1 min−1 with the temperature decreased to 20 °C. Constantly, if decreased the Pd content to 0.75%, the complete dechlorination of PentaCB could be achieved only the temperature was set to more than 40 °C. We tried to conduct the dechlorination of PentaCB on Pd/g-C3N4 with higher Pd content than 1% over 30 °C, and found that the dechlorination of PentaCB under these conditions was too fast to make a quantitative evaluation of k value. On the whole, increased Pd contents and higher temperatures are beneficial to the complete dechlorination of PentaCB. By considering both the required reaction time and possible economic costs, we selected a Pd content of 1% and temperature of 30 °C as a preferable one in the present work. The dechlorination of PentaCB was also influenced by NaBH4 addition amount (Fig. 4b and Fig. S2). It was observed that the dechlorination rate was increased with increasing the NaBH4 addition from 0 to 10 mmol L−1 (molar ratio of Cl atoms to NaBH4, 1:5) and then decreased with further increasing the NaBH4 addition. For example, the dechlorination efficiency (within 20 min) was increased from 26.6% to 100% at 30 °C when the molar ratio of Cl atoms in PentaCB to NaBH4 was changed from 1:1.25 to 1:5 mmol L−1. However, a further change of the molar ratio to 1:20 led to a decrease of the dechlorination efficiency to 61.7%. The tendency was similar as the dechlorination of PentaCB at 10 °C and 20 °C. These results could be explained as follows. The dechlorination rate is increased initially with increasing NaBH4 concentration because more NaBH4 molecules are available as hydrogen donors for the dechlorination of PentaCB. However, NaBH4 and PentaCB will compete for the catalytic sites on the surface of Pd nanoparticles [45]. The further increased addition of NaBH4 produces instantly a large amount of gaseous H2, which disturbs the adsorption of CBs on Pd nanoparticles. In addition, when reaction temperature was increased to 40 °C or 50 °C, the change tendency of k value with the molar ratio was still similar to that observed for the other temperatures, but the optimal molar ratio of Cl atoms in PentaCB to NaBH4 was reduced to 1: 2.5. By considering both the reaction time and energy consumption, we selected a NaBH4 concentration of 10 mmol L−1 (molar ratio, 1:5) and temperature of 30 °C as a preferable one in the present work. In order to evaluate the stability and reusability, the dechlorination of PentaCB was carried out in 6 successive cycles. After the added PentaCB was completely dechlorinated in the first run, the Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst was collected and then dispersed into methanol. Then, NaBH4 with the same concentration as the first run was added to initiate the second cycle. The dechlorination experiment was repeated for six runs. As illustrated in Fig. S3, the dechlorination of PentaCB produced almost the same high dechlorination efficiency values of about 100% within 20 min in each cycle. Therefore, the Pd/g-C3N4 composites have an excellent stability and reusability."
11,Dechlorination pathway,"3.3 Dechlorination pathway The generation, accumulation and further reduction of the intermediates of PentaCB were monitored by HPLC and GC–MS. For a better investigation of the degradation process, we decreased the dechlorination rate by using Pd/g-C3N4 with a Pd content of 1.25% as the catalyst and lowering reaction temperature to 10 °C. By comparing with the pure chemicals of CBs, the intermediates were identified as 1,2,3,4-TetraCB, 1,2,4,5-TetraCB, 1,3,4,5-TetraCB, 1,2,3-TriCB, 1,2,4-TriCB, 1,2-DiCB, 1,3-CB, CB, and benzene. The concentrations of PentaCB and its intermediates at different reaction stages were shown in Fig. 5 . If we tentatively neglected the generation of the minor intermediates, it was clearly observed that the initiation of the dechlorination of PentaCB produced rapidly 1,2,3,4-TetraCB, which was accumulated to a maximum at reaction time of 5 min and was then further degraded to a zero accumulation at reaction time of 25 min. Subsequently, the dechlorination of 1,2,3,4-TetraCB produced 1,2,3-TriCB, which was accumulated to a maximum at reaction time of 15 min and was then further degraded to a zero accumulation at reaction time of 40 min. Similarly, the successive dechorination of 1,2,3-TriCB produced 1,2-DiCB, which was accumulated to a maximum at reaction time of 20 min and was then further degraded to a zero accumulation at reaction time of about 60 min. Subsequently, the successive dechorination of 1,2-DiCB produced CB, which was accumulated to a maximum at reaction time of 45 min and was then further degraded to a zero accumulation at reaction time of 90 min. Finally, the dechorination of CB to benzene led to a roughly linear increase of the concentration of benzene to a recovery of about 100% at reaction time of 90 min. These time profiles clearly demonstrated that the dechlorination of PentaCB follows a step-by-step way. The time profiles also showed four envelops for the accumulation of 1,2,3,4-TetraCB, 1,2,3-TriCB, 1,2-DiCB, and CB, respectively. According to the concentration changes of PentaCB and its intermediates, the pathway of the reductive dechlorination of PentaCB in the above-mentioned system was proposed. As shown in Scheme 1 , the main intermediates formed in the step-by-step dechlorination of PentaCB are 1,2,3,4-TetraCB, 1,2,3-TriCB, 1,2-DiCB, CB and benzene in each of the five steps. The first three steps also produce 1,3,4,5-TetraCB and 1,2,4,5-TetraCB, 1,3,5-TriCB and 1,2,4-TriCB, 1,3-DiCB and 1,4-DiCB as very minor intermediates. The results were greatly different from the other chemical reductive systems with zero valent metals [46,47], in which the concentration of all kinds of chlorinated isomers were almost on the same order of magnitude. It suggested that the dechlorination of PentaCB showed distinct regioselectivity in the presently investigated system. In order to confirm the steric effect, we compared the degradation of ten CBs with 2–4 chlorine atoms in the Pd/g-C3N4-NaBH4 system. For convenience, PentaCB was used as the reference with k R = 1, the relative kinetic rate constant (k R) value of each CBs was obtained from the ratio of k R of the CB to that of PentaCB. As shown in Table 1 , while the number of Cl atoms was decreased from 5 to 2, the k R values of CBs were decreased in the order of PentaCB (1) > TetraCB (0.68, 0.51, 0.41) > TriCB (0.40, 0.35, 0.26) > DiCB (0.35, 0.33, 0.17). The obtained k R values of CBs with 2–5 chlorine atoms are on the same order of magnitude. These data apparently were not in accordance with the results in Fig. 5, where the dechlorination of CBs became very slower with decreasing the number of Cl atoms on the benzene ring. This difference came from the continuous consumption of NaBH4 during the dechlorination process: the CBs with less chlorine atoms were generated and dechlorinated at later reaction time, which corresponded to lower concentration of NaBH4 and a lower dechlorination rate. On the whole, the k R value of CBs was only a little dependent on the chlorine atoms in our study. More importantly, the chlorine atom with smaller steric hindrance was prior to be substituted by hydrogen atom. For example, the dechlorinated products of 1,2,3,5-TetraCB were in the order as 1,2,3-TriCB(61.3%) > 1,2,4-TriCB(38.7%) > 1,3,5-TriCB(0). Similarly, the main products of 1,2,4-TriCB was 1,2-DiCB, which accounted for 87.1% of the DiCBs. This further confirmed that there was an obvious correlation between the dechlorination position of PentaCB and steric hinderance of chlorine atoms."
12,Mechanism for the dechlorination of PentaCB on Pd/g-C3N4,"3.4 Mechanism for the dechlorination of PentaCB on Pd/g-C3N4 Pd has affinity interaction with halogen atom as previously demonstrated [5]. The DFT studies showed that the Pd-Cl interaction stretches the C-Cl bond of PentaCB. As shown in Table 2 , after bounding a Pd atom onto the Cl atom at ortho-position of PentaCB, the C-Cl bond length is elongated from 1.744 Å to 1.760 Å, and the values of increase was calculated to 0.016 Å. While the bond length was only stretched by 0.022 and 0.023 Å if putting a Pd atom on Cl atom at meta- and para-position, respectively. The calculated bond length of C-Cl showed that the Cl atom at ortho-position was much easier to adsorb on the Pd nanoparticles (Eq. (1) ). (1) C 6 HCl 5 → Pd [ C 6 HCl 5 ] ads The dechlorination of PentaCB may be initiated by the attack from either electron or active H atom species (H*), followed by the cleavage of the C-Cl bond. When getting one electron, PentaCB is transformed to anionic radical, and the follow up elimination process of chlorine will strongly depend on the bond energy of C-Cl bond [48]. According to the DFT calculations (Table 2, Fig. 6 ), the C-Cl bond on the para-position (2.648 Å) of anionic radical [C6HCl5]−• significantly lengthened in comparison with that (1.738 Å) in the neutral PentaCB and that (1.760 Å) of other C-Cl bonds of the anionic radical [C6HCl5]−•. This clearly shows that the chlorine atom at para-position will preferentially be released from the PentaCB, which is inconsistent with the observed dechlorination pathway in the tested system. Therefore, the dechlorination of PentaCB in the Pd/g-C3N4-NaBH4 system must be initiated by the attack from active H atom species rather than electron, i.e., the dechlorination mechanism of PentaCB here followed the hydrogenation route but not the electron transfer route from the viewpoint of the rate-determining step. Indeed, by using ESR technique, the generation of DMPO-H* adducts was observed after the addition of NaBH4 solution as shown in Fig. 7 . The ESR spectrum displayed characteristic nine peaks of the DMPO-H* adduct with an intensity ratio 1:1:2:1:2:1:2:1:1. The hyperfine splitting constants of αN = 16.6 G and α H β = 22.6 G for DMPO-H* are in good agreement with those reported on the literature [5,49,50], which suggested the H* was produced in the Pd/g-C3N4-NaBH4 system. Actually, both NaBH4 and the solvent CH3OH may provide hydrogen atoms for the reductive hydrogenation of PentaCB in the Pd/g-C3N4-NaBH4 system. In order to identify the source of hydrogen atoms, the reductive degradation of PentaCB was carried out by using deuterated methanol (CD3OD or CH3OD) to replace the solvent CH3OH (Fig. S4). Mass spectra analysis of the intermediates of the PentaCB reduction demonstrated that the isotope peaks were appeared as the solvents changed from CH3OH to CD3OD or CH3OD. Fig. 8 a showed the distributions of the D-CBs and H-CBs generated in the reductive degradation of PentaCB in the NaBH4-Pd/g-C3N4 by using CD3OD as a solvent. All of the intermediates would be D-substituted molecules if the hydrogen atoms came from the solvents CH3OH, while the number of D-substituted molecules would be zero with the NaBH4 as the only hydrogen donors. As shown in Fig. 8a, by a rough estimation, the D-CBs took up about 37.62%, 49.74%, 60.89%, 73.41% and 86.79% of the total molecules for Tetra-CB, Tri-CB, Di-CB, CB and benzene. This indicated that both NaBH4 and methanol could be functioned as hydrogen donors for the hydrogenation replacement of Cl atoms of PentaCB. It was worth noting that a similar distribution was observed by changing the solvent from CD3OD to CH3OD (Fig. 8b). This demonstrated that the hydrogen atoms from methanol were mainly provided by the hydrogen atoms in O–H. Therefore, the active hydrogen species for the dechlorination of PentaCB came from both NaBH4 and the O–H in CH3OH. When NaBH4 is added into the suspension of PentaCB and Pd/g-C3N4, borohydride ions contact the surface of Pd nanoparticles and transfer a surface hydrogen species to Pd, [51] as described by eq. (2), (2) NaBH 4 + 4 CH 3 OH → Pd 8 H ∗ + NaB OCH 3 4 According to the results of isotope labeling experiments, the hydrogen atoms may come from both methanol and NaBH4, which provided about 35.2% and 64.8% of hydrogen atoms for the dechlorination of PentaCB, respectively, being evaluated by measuring the contents of H and D in the final product of benzene. NaB H 4 may react with CH3OH firstly to produce H2, [52,53] as confirmed by the gas chromatography (Fig. S5). In order to further confirm this, isopropanol was chosen as the solvent to conduct the isotope labelling experiments. As shown in Fig. S6, no deuterated intermediates were generated when isopropanol-d8 was used to replace isopropanol, which suggested that the hydrogen atoms in isopropanol did not participate in the dechlorination of PentaCB. Moreover, the production of hydrogen gas was detected by gas chromatography, and no peaks which assigned to hydrogen gas could be observed in Fig. S5, which indicated that the reaction between isopropanol and NaBH4 did not occur to produce H2. These results further demonstrated that NaB H 4 may react with CH3OH firstly to produce H2, and the hydrogen atoms in H2 came from both NaBH4 and CH3OH. Finally, the generated H2 could be used as hydrogen donors for the dechlorination The generated H2 is activated by Pd nanoparticles to form active hydrogen atoms (Eqs. (3) and (4)). (3) NaBH4 + 4CH3OH → 4H2 + NaB(OCH3)4 (4) H 2 → Pd 2 H ∗ Therefore, the active hydrogen species may come from both borohydride ions and methanol. Subsequently, the adsorbed active hydrogen species continues to attack the adsorbed PentaCB ([C6HCl5]ads), resulting in the dechlorintion and hydrogenation of [C6HCl5]ads to generate C6H2Cl4 then to C6H6 finally (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [54]. (5) 2H* + [C6HCl5]ads → [C6H2Cl4]ads + Cl− + H+ (6) 8H* + [C6H2Cl4]ads → C6H6 + 4Cl− + 4H+ In summary, the mechanism for the chlorination of PentaCB on Pd nanoparticles as catalytically active sites in presence of NaBH4 contains three steps (Scheme 2 ). In step 1, the chlorine atoms at ortho-position of PentaCB is adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles to form [C6HCl5]ads. In step 2, active hydrogen atoms are generated on the surface of Pd nanoparticles, which came from both NaBH4 and CH3OH. In step 3, [C6HCl5]ads is attacked by the active hydrogen atoms (H*) to be converted to C6H2Cl4 and/or[C6H2Cl4]ads. Then, these steps are repeated successively until the byproducts are completely dechlorinated to generated C6H6."
13,Conclusions,"In the present work, with PentaCB as a representative of refractory halogenated pollutants due to the high strength of C-Cl bond, we developed a new reduction method for the rapid and complete dechlorination of chlorinated aromatic pollutants by using Pd/g-C3N4 and a common reductant NaBH4 under mild conditions. All the added PentaCB (0.4 mmol L−1) was completely dechlorinated within 20 min at 30 °C by using 1%Pd/g-C3N4 as a low Pd content catalyst, which permitted that the required molar ratio of NaBH4 to chlorine atoms was decreased to be only 5:1. The results in this study elucidated the fundamental mechanisms of active hydrogen atoms attacking C-Cl bond on Pd/g-C3N4 by taking advantage of the interaction between Pd and Cl and the strong hydrogen affinity of Pd. These findings suggested that a combination of Pd/g-C3N4 with reductant NaBH4 provided an alternative approach to the rapid cleavage of C-Cl with high concentration under mild conditions. Practically, a substantial part of the organic pollutants are halogenated aromatic compounds, and the cleavage of C-X bond of the halogenated organic compounds becomes more and more difficult as the halogen elements are changed from Br to Cl and F due to the much increased bond strength in the order of Br–C < Cl–C < F–C. Together with our recent work about the Cu/TiO2-N2H4·H2O system for the reductive debromination of brominated aromatic pollutants [4], the presently developed reductive dechlorination system for the complete dechlorination of chlorobenzenes will make an important contribution to the establishment of a whole set of reduction methods working under mild conditions for the rapid and complete dehalogenation of halogenated persistent organic pollutants at high concentrations."
