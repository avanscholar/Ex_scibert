0,Introduction,"In recent aspects of organic synthesis, the matter of primary interest is accelerating reaction rates as well as improving selectivities via more “green” or environmentally friendly chemical processes. Monoterpene alcohols such as (5), (8), (7)/(10) and (6) not only have been known to function as allelochemicals or secondary metabolites which are indispensable for life process (Wink, 1999), but also are valuable compounds for fragrant substance, anti-microbials, fungicide and insecticide in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and flavor manufacturing industries (Arctander, 2000). However, their practical production has suffered from the disadvantages of complex multistage processes leading to low yields, using environmentally damaging organic solvents and transition metal catalysts such as organotin compounds, problems associated with catalyst-product separation, and side reactions such as decomposition which would take place during the distillation after the reaction. As an environmentally benign alternative attempt, the use of heterogeneous catalysts has been limited so far, because of short catalyst life for industrial applications. As a result, there have been considerable efforts to design and prepare better solid catalysts. For the efficient production of (5), a one-step synthesis has been attempted to form C 10 unit from C 5 units such as isoprene and hemiterpene alcohol by use of excess strong acid according to the isoprene rule (Dull, 1934), but the one-step process so far employed has not given the (5) in satisfactory yield (Lebedeva and Scukobskaya, 1951; Bertrand et al., 1991). On the other hand, as shown in Scheme 1 , in a batchwise multistep operation in the presence of environmental damaging organotin compounds in organic solvents, the desired (5) was synthesized in a better yield of 44–54%, but long reaction times extending from 7 to 11h are required to go up to the reasonable yield (Fraunberg, 1977; Ueno et al., 1980). Supercritical water (scH 2 O) should be a useful replacement for organic solvents, because water is the most environmentally acceptable, naturally abundant, and inexpensive solvent, and its physicochemical properties can be changed widely with pressure and temperature (Shaw et al., 1991). However, the ion product ( K w ) for scH 2 O is much lower than liquid water under certain conditions (Marshall and Franck, 1981), and there have been few research works on the use of scH 2 O as catalyst for acid- or base-catalyzed organic syntheses. According to the K w concept, such reactions have been undertaken in hot water ranging from 473 to 573K (Kuhlmann et al., 1994; Raner et al., 1994; Katritzky and Allin, 1996; An et al., 1997; Katritzky et al., 2001), but the reaction rates are very slow; for example, quantitative pinacol rearrangement in hot water at 548K required a reaction time longer than 1h (Kuhlmann et al., 1994). Contrary to the conventional wisdom that acid- or base-catalyzed reactions will not take place in scH 2 O (Bröll et al., 1999; Dinjus and Kruse, 2003; Ikushima et al., 2000, 2001, 2002; Sato et al., 1998) demonstrated the possibility of scH 2 O participating in acid- or base-catalyzed organic synthesis at the same time as the catalyst as well as medium. This new concept originated from our finding on the significant reduction of the strength of hydrogen bonding in H 2 O peculiarly near the critical point base on in situ IR, Raman (Ikushima et al., 1998, 2002) measurements as well as an ab initio first principle dynamic study (Boero et al., 2000), leading to the activation of protons or H 3 O + or monomer. Hence, we have strongly expected that complicated chemical reaction processes so far comprised several acid- or base-catalyzed reaction steps would be efficiently effected in one step under a scH 2 O atmosphere even in the absence of any catalysts. In this report, we thus demonstrate that the new-generation one-step synthesis of (5) from 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol (MBO, 2) as shown in Scheme 2 , arising from the acid and base difunctionality of scH 2 O can be successfully created by our microreaction system (Ikushima et al., 2002, 2003) equipped with high-pressure and high-temperature FTIR."
1,Experimental section,"The scH 2 O microreaction ( μ -reaction) system equipped with high-pressure and high-temperature FTIR can heat up very quickly an ambient substrate solution to the supercritical state and then quench rapidly to sufficiently low temperatures after the reaction. That is, as shown in Fig. 1 , pressurized ambient water at relatively faster flow rates of 3.0–10.0mLmin - 1 was heated up to around 773K in a heating bath, and then the scH 2 O solution was sent to the entrance of a quick-heating part (union tee made of Hastelloy C-276) through a 1 16 in. Hastelloy C-276 tube. A stream of ambient substrate aqueous solution (0.15molkg - 1 ) passing through a 1 16 in. Hastelloy C-276 tube was struck against the high-speed flow of the scH 2 O in the union tee, and was realized to be raised up to the supercritical temperature of 648K within 0.05s, and the mixture was then introduced into a 500 μ L microreactor (300 μ m i.d.) made of Hastelloy C-276, in which the reaction times were adjusted to be shorter than several seconds in order to investigate the extent of ability drawn from the real acidity or basicity of scH 2 O itself at such short residence times. After the reaction, the solution was quenched rapidly to room temperature because of the prevention of pyrolysis and hydrolysis. As a result, the fluctuations in temperature were controlled to within ± 0.1K allowed for the experimental error. This scH 2 O μ -reaction system also permitted the observation of IR spectral changes in situ by high-pressure and high-temperature FTIR. Further detailed analysis of the reaction mixture at the end of reaction was performed by GC–MS. Each acquired mass spectra was confirmed at confidence level > 90 % by Wiley Database. The identified products were quantified by use of calibration curve of aqueous, methanol or ethanol solution in which known amounts of the compounds are dissolved."

3,The production of monoterpene alcohols from prenol(1),"3.1 The production of monoterpene alcohols from prenol(1) We first demonstrate that a one-step synthesis of monoterpene alcohols, such as (5), (8) (7)/(10) and (6) from hemiterpene alcohols, such as (1) proceeds efficiently in scH 2 O even without any catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the background corrected IR spectra for (1) solutions (1.5molkg - 1 ) treated with scH 2 O (648K) and hot water (573 and 523K) at a constant pressure of 30MPa, along with those for ordinary (1) and (2) aqueous solutions (293K, 0.1MPa). These measurements were performed by our real time, in situ FTIR for (1) in H 2 O introduced into a high-pressure, high-temperature microreactor at a constant residence time of 38.0s. The spectrum obtained in hot water at 423K and 30MPa, shows a new band at 1151cm - 1 (trace D). This band can be assigned to C–O stretching (v 1 ) of the (2) formed, and is not observed in the ordinary (1) aqueous (trace E) phase. Thus in the hot water region, (1) was confirmed to isomerize to the corresponding (2) even in the absence of acid catalyst. Our attention has been further focused on the chemical reactivities changing from hot water toward scH 2 O conditions because of the possibility of scH 2 O catalyzing acid- or base-catalyzed organic synthesis (Ikushima et al., 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002). We have thus analyzed the absorption bands (traces A and B) at higher temperatures in hot water and scH 2 O. A significant difference is seen in the spectrum obtained in hot water (trace B) and scH 2 O (trace A), in which new bands appeared at 905cm - 1 with a discernible shoulder at 940cm - 1 , and are not present in the ordinary (1) solution (trace E). The lower-frequency band can be unambiguously assigned to CH out-of-plane bending (v 2 ) of isoprene that is the expected dehydration product of (1) or (2), whereas the higher-frequency band might be assignable to C–O stretching (v 1 ) of monoterpene alcohol formed. To provide a definite evidence for characterization of monoterpene alcohol products, we attempted the GC–MS analysis of the reaction mixtures (corresponding to trace B in Fig. 2) obtained in hot water at 488K and 30MPa. As a result, as shown in Fig. 3 , the monoterpene alcohol mixture, including predominantly (5), (8), (6) and (7)/(10) wasconfirmed by a direct comparison with each authentic sample. Hence we have first demonstrated a new one-step dimerization process for the formation of monoterpene alcohols from hemiterpene alcohol such as (1) using only H 2 O in the absence of any catalyst. The monoterpene alcohols were formed in a high conversion around 90% at a higher temperature of 648K in scH 2 O, but in a low yield below 20%. This low yield seems to be due to the isomerization of (1) to (2) and the subsequent dehydration of (2) to (3) from the FTIR and GC–MS results. Moreover, the monoterpene alcohol formed by the dimerization would be further dehydrated to (3). That is, such unwanted side reactions easily occurred with the desired dimerization to the monoterpene alcohols from (1) during a relatively longer reaction time of 38s, leading to the low selectivity in monoterpene alcohol. The monoterpene alcohols were substantiated to be successfully synthesized peculiar to the scH 2 O state, but was thermally unstable at such higher temperatures, and in order to prevent the side reactions from occurring, shorter reaction (residence) times in scH 2 O were preferred for producing the monoterpene alcohols in a more satisfactory yield. We thus attempted the selective dimerization of monoterpene alcohols from (1) using the scH 2 O μ -reaction system ranging in shorter reaction times around several seconds at higher temperature above the critical temperature. The total yield of the monoterpene alcohol product was found to increase with increasing temperature at 40MPa in scH 2 O (Table 1 , entry 7–9). The monoterpene alcohol mixture was maximally obtained in 55% selectivity and in high conversion of 99% (entry 9) when the reaction was performed at a reaction time shorter than 5s at 723K and 40MPa in scH 2 O with the μ -reaction process, in which the composition of linalool(8), geraniol(7), nerol(10), and lavandulol(5) and α -terpineol(6) was 9%, 10%, 1%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Its yield was greatly superior to those promoted by p-toluene sulfonic acid or ZnCl 2 /dichloroethane catalyst (entry 1, 2). We obtained only 16% selectivity regardless of the high conversion above 90% achieved at a reaction time of 30s at 488K and 40MPa (entry 5), in which (3), as the dehydration product of (2) and/or monoterpene alcohols, was predominantly formed. When the (1), solution was heated up to hot water or scH 2 O region at a slower rate in a batchwise operation, one cannot see any reactivities below 473K, but the introduction of the μ -reaction system in the same region of hot water reaction led to an increase in the yield. Hence, the low yield would result from the side reaction such as dehydration occurring during a long elapse of time. One can also see an interesting solvent effect in Table 1. When the reaction was carried out under the same operating conditions with entry 7 in an equimolar solution of water and methanol used in the place of pure water solution, the formation of monoterpene alcohols was not confirmed at all, whereas the conversion of entry 7 went up to 82%. In the presence of methanol, diallyl ether (11 and 12) was found to be synthesized in a 69% yield by the dehydration between two (1) molecules. We thus recognize that its own acidic ability peculiar to scH 2 O state can promote the dimerization of prenol(1) to monoterpene alcohols, but the presence of methanol in the high-temperature water medium completely suppresses the scH 2 O acidic ability bringing about the desired dimerization, and thereby leading to profound repression of the subsequent protonation of (11) (12). The postulated mechanism will be described afterwards in more detail."
4,The production of monoterpene alcohols from 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol(MBO)(2),"3.2 The production of monoterpene alcohols from 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol(MBO)(2) The in situ IR observation has demonstrated the formation of (2) by allylic rearrangement as well as of monoterpene alcohols by dimerization from (1) even in the absence of acid catalyst in scH 2 O as shown in Fig. 2. It has further become apparent by GC–MS and IR measurements that the subsequent dehydration of (2) formed from (1) to (3) would be responsible for the low selectivity to monoterpene alcohols. Therefore, the application of (2) instead of (1) as starting material could be expected to contribute to the repression of side reactions including the dehydration, resulting in the improvement in selectivity. Table 2 compares the selectivity and yield for the monoterpene alcohol synthesis from (2) in hot water and scH 2 O using the μ -reaction system. The use of (2) substrate in hot water and scH 2 O has enabled the selective production of (5), especially in a high selectivity of 82% and a yield of 59% in scH 2 O, which is one component of the monoterpene alcohols, although (1) substrate led to the formation of a mixture of monoterpene alcohols in a remarkably lower selectivity under the same scH 2 O conditions as shown in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows the product distribution on (5) synthesis in scH 2 O, hot water, and by the conventional method. The one-step production of (5) was achieved in a 59% yield at a shorter reaction time of 7.7s in scH 2 O even without catalyst, whereas in the conventional method consisting of three main steps in the presence of environmental damaging organotin compounds in organic solvents (Scheme 1), a satisfactory yield of 54% was obtained; however, a long reaction time extending to several hours is required to reach it. It can also be seen in Fig. 4 that not only is (2) converted into scH 2 O more efficiently in hot water, but also the allylic rearrangement to (1) from (2) is depressed significantly in scH 2 O, leading to the increase in selectivity of (5). Hence, scH 2 O medium, though the reaction at a shorter reaction time around several seconds is a prerequisite, was found to be more favorable for the (5) production compared with hot water region."
5,The role of water and the postulated reaction mechanism,"3.3 The role of water and the postulated reaction mechanism As described elsewhere (Ikushima et al., 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003), pinacol and Beckmann rearrangements have been believed to be promoted by the acidic ability peculiar to scH 2 O state. Our IR (Ikushima et al., 2002) and Raman (Ikushima et al., 1998) measurements of the hydrogen bonding of hot water and scH 2 O suggest that the tetrahedral configurations disappear near the critical point, where the monomer or dimer or trimer structures are predominant. This result was further supported by a recent first-principle molecular dynamics study (Boero et al., 2000). The ion product ( K w ) monotonically decreases with increasing temperature above 573K at 40MPa (Marshall and Franck, 1981), and so the proton or hydroxide ion (OH - ) concentration anticipated from the K w concept is not so high near the critical temperature. However, in scH 2 O the OH - or proton adjacent to substrate molecules cannot migrate throughout the hydrogen-bond network near the critical point. At least ten water molecules are to be considered for appreciable interaction between the hydrogen bonding network and proton (Sun et al., 1992). Moreover, the local proton and OH - concentrations would be high when the transferring ions cannot escape. An increase in local proton or hydroxide ion concentration around substrate molecules might induce favorably the reaction. Hence the OH - or proton species could react spontaneously with substrate molecules to form a transient intermediate owing to the lower activation energies for bond breakage and formation. We thus proposed A1 mechanism (Isaacs, 1987) to account for the dimerization of hemiterpene alcohol to monoterpene alcohol in scH 2 O. That is, as shown in Scheme 3 , the supposition implicit in this ion mechanism is that ionic species such as proton H 3 O + , and hydroxide ion originated from scH 2 O molecules can be activated under the supercritical state. Firstly, the addition of proton to (11) (12) was promoted as the intermediate, followed by the rearrangement to transient ionic intermediate (15 or 16), and then the desired monoterpene alcohol was produced by the reaction of (15) or (16) with H 2 O (or hydroxide ion), in which the protonation of isoprene formed was not confirmed in scH 2 O, and therefore (11) (12) which originated from (1) or (2) was regarded as the intermediate. On the other hand, in hot water the hydrolysis to hemiterpene alcohols by A2 mechanism (Isaacs, 1987) is suggested to take place. In the hot water region substantial quantity of hydrogen-bond network still remains and the proton concentration anticipated from the K w concept as described above is relatively high, and the protonation and hydrolysis reactions would take place in the intermediate (11) (12) in Scheme 3 at the same time. One possibility is the direct participation of water molecules through a transition state involving one or two water molecules. Water molecules make a hydrogen-bond ring network with the (11) (12), and then play a role of a catalyst transferring a proton along the locally formed hydrogen-bond network. A similar mechanism has been proposed so far for the conversion of 2-nitroaniline to benzofurazan (Wang et al., 1995) and the decarboxylation of acetic acid derivatives (Belsky et al., 1999) in hot water. Moreover, the role of water in the intermolecular hydrogen transfer has been supported by quantum chemistry calculations. In general, water molecules make the geometry of the transition-state species less strained, thereby facilitating the formation and cleavage of bonds that lead to the products. Specifically, for the dehydrogenation reaction of ethanol to acetaldehyde, the inclusion of two water molecules in the transition state reduces the activation barrier by ∼ 34kcal/mol and increases the rate constant by nine orders of magnitude (Takahashi et al., 2002), compared to those in the absence of water. Water also facilitates the decomposition of formic acid (Akiya and Savage, 1998; Yagasaki et al., 2002). In the above postulated mechanism, the A1 mechanism proposes the participation of proton and water molecule independently in each step in scH 2 O, while the A2 mechanism means the occurrence of protonation and hydrolysis reactions at the same time in a certain step in hot water. Moreover, the dimerization to monoterpene alcohols from (1) and (2) has been demonstrated to be depressed in the presence of base such as NaOH, and so this type of dimerization has been believed to be promoted by acid catalyst. The protonation of the intermediate diallyl ether from (1) or (2) would first occur to hot water or scH 2 O state, followed by in scH 2 O the formation of the desired monoterpene alcohols by A1 mechanism along with the dehydration to (3), whereas in hot water the hydrolysis to hemiterpene alcohols by A2 mechanism. We are sure that this postulated mechanism can explain conveniently and reasonably not only the difference in product distribution between scH 2 O and hot water, but also the reason for the absence of sesquiterpene derivatives as products."
6,Concluding remarks,"The present results demonstrate that scH 2 O itself shows its real ability as an acid for remarkably accelerating the dimerization of hemiterpene alcohols such as (1) and (2) to monoterpene alcohols, especially (5), only if one can suppress side reactions like dehydration disturbing the formation of the desired monoterpene alcohols. We are sure that our new approach can not only realize the one-step manufacture of monoterpene alcohols in high yield and high selectivity, even without catalyst in scH 2 O, but also can be useful for a wide range of acid-catalyzed organic syntheses, thus rendering newly potential applications in environmentally friendly and economically favorable synthesis of various fine chemicals."
