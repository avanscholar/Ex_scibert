0,Introduction,
1,Background,"1.1 Background An article (Abboud and Hensley, 2003) in the Wall Street Journal observed that: ‘The pharmaceutical industry has a little secret: Even as it invents futuristic new drugs, its manufacturing techniques lag far behind those of potato chip and laundry-soap makers…’ The article also stated: ‘To the FDA, with its mission of protecting patient safety, it seemed more important to manufacture drugs precisely to specification, using tried-and-true systems, than to latch on to the latest in manufacturing trends.’ This then led to a note of optimism: ‘Now things are starting to change. The FDA has concluded that the industry needs to adopt innovation, partly to raise quality standards. The agency is overhauling its elaborate manufacturing regulations for the first time in 25 years.’ There are plenty of other examples in the literature, where a need to move from batch to innovative continuous processing is encouraged (Stitt, 2002; Betz et al., 2003; Watts and Haswell, 2003; Thomas, 2004; Plumb, 2005; Cybulski et al., 2006; Trout, 2007; Malhotra, 2009; Wheeler, 2009; Sedelmeier et al., 2009; Saaby et al., 2005; Baumann et al., 2008). This clearly indicates that there is an environment in which pharmaceutical companies can start to consider changes to their processes, but significant cultural change is also required. From discussions with pharmaceutical companies, there is clearly considerable interest in the introduction of continuous processing into their industry, but there are also challenges to be overcome. The motivation for such an initiative can vary; however, the following list is an example of such benefits that have been stated during private discussions with industry leaders: - The risks associated with process scale-up could be reduced—as the process is developed from laboratory bench top, to pilot scale, to plant scale. - Scale-up to plant production could be faster. - Significant savings could be achieved in plant capital and operating costs. - The environmental footprint could be reduced. - The reactor inventory could be reduced, and hence containment hazards reduced. - A faster response to market demand could be achieved, and product inventory reduced. Despite this motivation, it is not easy to change ‘custom and practice’ in the pharmaceutical industry, and the following are examples of reasons that have been given: - Once regulatory approval for the manufacture of a drug has been obtained (and this was for a batch/semi-batch process), then it is difficult to argue for change into a continuous process. This is understood, as if the design of the reactor is changed, then the side reactions may be different, and this in-turn could affect the purity of the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). - In a pharmaceutical plant there are many batch reactors, and as these become available, they can be used relatively easily for a new API production campaign, i.e. using existing assets and reducing new capital expenditure. - The development of new drugs is done by chemists, who use familiar ‘tried and tested’ equipment, and have a mind-set that focuses on batch processing. This is difficult to change, and any change would also require adjustments in the ways in which drugs are a formulated at the laboratory bench, to ensure a smooth transition to a continuous pathway. So the trick with the introduction of continuous processing into the pharmaceutical industry rests with: (i) The introduction of a methodology and apparatus that could be used at the laboratory bench scale, which could easily be scaled-up to pilot, and then plant scale. This methodology would then be used in the development of new drug molecules. (ii) The application of continuous processing technology to an established drug that may now be manufactured as a generic drug. The motivation for this would be more controlled product purity, better financial performance and reduced environmental impact. Regulatory approval would then need to be sought as part of the generic drug filing. The presence of any undesirable reaction intermediates could be assessed relatively easily and adjustments made to the process before the drug was tested in clinical trials. With these two approaches in mind, the use of alcohols as alternative alkylating agents for amines was selected as a reaction pathway for this study, as there are clear product benefits, as well as environmental incentives and more efficient processing. Typically the N-alkylation of amines is achieved through the use of alkyl halides. However, such reactions are hampered by over-alkylation and the toxic nature of the alkylating agents. Therefore N-alkylation reactions based on metal-catalysed hydrogen transfer have become attractive because: (i) It may enable safer drug products. (ii) The overall reaction is atom efficient consuming all of the starting material with the only other by-product being water, and (iii) Many alcohols are environmentally benign as well as being readily available compared with their alkyl halide counterparts, highlighting the potentially green credentials of such an approach. The N-alkylation of amines using alcohols could proceed via the cycle illustrated in Fig. 1 . Rather than trying to force a direct substitution between the amine and the weakly electrophilic alcohol, the ‘borrowing hydrogen’ approach involves the temporary removal of hydrogen from an alcohol to form an intermediate aldehyde (Fig. 1). The aldehyde readily undergoes reaction with an amine to form an imine, and the borrowed hydrogen is then returned to provide the amine with no net loss or gain of hydrogen. The first examples of homogenous catalysts for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols were published (Grigg et al., 1981; Watanabe et al., 1984, 1996) in the early 1980s. More recently several important contributions have been made in the area of N-alkylation using alcohols (Hamid et al., 2007, 2009; Hamid and Williams, 2007; Lamb and Williams, 2008; Lamb et al., 2009). The iridium complex [Cp*IrCl2]2, has been used for a range of N-alkylation reactions of amines using alcohols (Fujita et al., 2003, 2008; Fujita and Yamaguchi, 2005). This catalyst is able to catalyse a broad range of substrates achieving high conversions under relatively mild conditions including the selective mono-alkylation of primary amines such as aliphatic amines and anilines. The ability to mono-alkylate primary amines selectively enabled the development of a one pot sequential addition of two different alcohols resulting in the formation of a tertiary amine with three different substituents. Many ruthenium complexes have also been used successfully in the N-alkylation reaction of amines by alcohols. Del Zotto et al. (2004) examined many ruthenium cyclopentadienyl complexes and discovered that RuCl(Cp)(PPh3)2 was an efficient catalyst for these reactions, including the dimethylation of amines with methanol at 100°C. Similarly, Marsella (1991) has also used RuCl2(PPh3)3 to catalyse reactions of ethylene glycol with primary amines. Beller and co-workers (Tillack et al., 2006; Hollmann et al., 2007) have also made several important contributions to the field of borrowing hydrogen. Much of their work surrounding the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols focuses on the use of Ru3(CO)12 as the catalytic system. Use of this ruthenium carbonyl cluster has enabled the coupling of both primary and secondary alcohols with a range of amines including heterocyclic alcohols such as 1-(2-furyl)ethanol, 2-furylmethanol and 2-thienylmethanol affording the corresponding secondary N-hexylamines in moderate to good yields. Several groups have made use of this green approach to amine synthesis by incorporating the methodology into the preparation of pharmaceutical targets. For example, in recent publications (Cami-Kobeci et al., 2005; Hamid et al., 2009) [Ru(p-cymene)Cl]2 has been used in combination with bidentate phosphine ligands as the catalyst for amination reactions, with an interest in the synthesis of phenethylamine derivatives due to the range of neurotransmitters and their agonists and antagonists that possess this structure (Fig. 2 ). Following on from the preparation of phenethylamine derivatives, the benzylation of a range of heterocyclic and aliphatic amines was also investigated (Hamid and Williams, 2007) as well as preparing a series of N-substituted morpholines, culminating in the synthesis of Piribedil (Fig. 2). Piribedil is a dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and is one example of a larger class of pharmaceutically important N-arylpiperazines. Although there has been a considerable increase in interest over the past 5 years in the development of efficient catalytic systems for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols, with the exception of work (Valot et al., 1999) on a gas-phase reaction over a gamma-alumina system, evidence of the development of a continuous process is rare. There have however been several recent developments in the related area of transfer hydrogenation. The utilisation of immobilised catalysts in the solid and liquid phases for the purpose of transfer hydrogenation has been shown to provide a significant improvement over the homogeneous process (Bubert et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004a; Sun et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006). Several groups have also reported continuous flow systems incorporating silica and polymer-supported ligands for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones in isopropanol (Sandee et al., 2001; Del Zotto et al., 2007; Li et al., 2004b; Liu et al., 2010). In this paper we report the first example of a continuous flow system incorporating a polymer bound phosphine modified ruthenium catalyst to be used for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols."
2,Reaction studied,"1.2 Reaction studied The reaction of benzyl alcohol with morpholine (Fig. 3 ) was selected as a ‘model reaction’ to test the viability of the ‘borrowing hydrogen’ methodology due to its simplicity and proven success (Hamid and Williams, 2007). A molar ratio of 1:1 for alcohol to amine was chosen in order to highlight the atom efficiency of the reaction, working at the stoichiometric ratio. This mixture was then dissolved 16% by volume in a solution of toluene that acted as the solvent. The heat of reaction for the N-benzylation of morpholine was estimated to be mildly exothermic; approximately −2.4kJ/mol for a gas-phase reaction, and −4.4kJ/mol for a liquid phase reaction. Therefore, in the experiments it was relatively easy to approach isothermal conditions, as the mixture contained a large quantity of solvent (84vol%) and the outer wall of the reactor was maintained at a constant temperature."
3,Batch experiments,"In order to assess the viability of the planned approach, a series of small-scale experiments were first performed in a batch reactor. In some of the experiments, p-xylene was used instead of toluene as a solvent, as it had a higher boiling point."
4,Experimental apparatus and technique,"2.1 Experimental apparatus and technique The reactor assembly is illustrated in Fig. 4 . A 20mm i.d. (15mL) proprietary Pyrex glass vessel was used in a Radley's carousel, which was set upon a stirrer hot plate. The top of the vessel was sealed using a Young's tap allowing for vapor pressure to be maintained inside the vessel. This type of apparatus is considered relatively standard chemistry bench-top laboratory equipment for reaction studies. Under batch conditions the ruthenium dimer [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (2.5mol% dimer with respect to the amine, 5mol% Ru, 0.025mmol) and the polymer bound monodentate phosphine (10mol% phosphine, 0.1mmol) were added to the glass vessel containing a magnetic stirrer. The vessel was then purged with argon before adding benzyl alcohol (1mmol), morpholine (1mmol) and toluene (1mL). Once sealed, argon occupied the headspace above the liquid at approximately atmospheric pressure, 1.01bar. The triphenylphosphine bound polymers were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich with loadings of 1.6 and 3.2mmolg−1 of phosphine. As the reactor consists of a glass tube, it was possible to observe the rapid complexation of the ruthenium precursor with the polymer bound phosphine. Initially, upon stirring the solution turned red as the Ru dissolved in the toluene, then over the course of the next hour the solution became colourless with the polymer turning a deep red colour showing that the Ru was now supported on the polymer. In this type of reactor, as the liquid is heated and a vapor starts to be formed, the vapor condenses at the top of the reactor (in the condensation zone), and the liquid droplets then trickle back into the base of the reactor. An aliquot of each individual reaction was taken and analysed using 1H NMR to measure the overall conversion of the starting materials into the desired product. NMR spectra were run in CDCl3 on either a Bruker Avance 250 (250MHz) or a Bruker Avance 300 (300MHz). Structural assignments were achieved with comparisons from analogous literature compounds. The overall conversion into the desired product was calculated from the ratio of specific product to starting material 1H NMR signals with an expected margin of error of <5%."
5,Experimental results,"2.2 Experimental results Different forms of catalyst were tested, and these were compared with a homogeneous catalyst that had been prepared according to literature procedure (Hamid et al., 2009). The results of the key experiments are summarised in Fig. 5 . It is encouraging to observe that very high conversions could be achieved, indicating that the reaction had not been limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. Fig. 5 clearly shows that although slower in comparison to the homogeneous system of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2/PPh3 (Ru/PPh3), the polymer-supported systems are still highly active for the N-benzylation of morpholine with almost complete conversion being achieved within 24h (98%). Although very similar in composition the two phosphine bound polymers differ in activity. The lower loading polystyrene polymer containing 1% divinylbenzene (DVB) co-polymer and 1.6mmol of phosphine/g (Ru 1.6) was shown to be considerably more active than the higher loading polystyrene polymer containing 2% DVB and 3.2mmol of phosphine/g (Ru 3.2). For example, after a period of 6h the 1.6mmol/g polymer gave a high conversion of 77% in comparison to 38% when the high loading polymer was used. Although high conversions were achieved in the batch reactor, this may also have been aided by the vaporisation of water, which had condensed further up the vessel, and because of surface tension effects remained on the glass surface. Some of the formed water may therefore have been displaced from the liquid phase, allowing for the equilibrium of the reaction to be pushed further to the right (see Fig. 3) leading to a higher conversion. Other reactions run in the Radley's carousel using the 1.6mmolg−1 phosphine bound polymer include a short study into the stability of the supported catalyst. The same procedure as above was followed, however, after 24h the colourless liquor was extracted and replaced with a fresh aliquot. This was repeated over the course of 5 days. For the first 3 days (72h) the catalyst remained stable and active giving 3 consecutive results of 100% conversion. However, after 4 days (96h) the activity dropped off to 73%, and then on the fifth day, the conversion dropped further to 50%. The solution however remained colourless, even after the fifth day and the decline in catalytic activity, suggesting a very low level of catalyst leaching. However, the condition of the polymer itself was seen to deteriorate over the course of the experiment possibly due to the presence of the water being formed. By moving next to a continuous flow system, it was anticipated that this could lead to increased catalyst stability, as the water produced would be removed with the products, and not accumulate within the system. The SEM images in Fig. 6 show the subtle differences between the two types of polystyrene support. The image at the top left shows the polymer containing 1.6mmol/g of phosphine before being complexed with the ruthenium precursor, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2. The image shows smooth spherical beads with little surface detail (average particle size 120μm). On complexing with ruthenium (top right image), which involved stirring at 110°C in toluene for 3h under argon, the particles maintain their structural integrity with no clear difference between the two images. When looking at the uncomplexed polymer containing 3.2mmolg−1 of phosphine (bottom left) the beads, although spherical in nature, have many more surface abnormalities in comparison to the polymer with the lower phosphine loading. When these beads went through the same procedure in order to support the ruthenium precursor they seemed to disintegrate into much smaller pieces with highly defined jagged edges (average particle size 70μm, image bottom right). The abnormalities observed in the uncomplexed material containing 2% co-polymer, as opposed to 1% in the polymer with the lower phosphine loading, may ultimately have led to loss in structural integrity whilst complexing with ruthenium. This evidence of differences in the stability of these two polymer supports may also go some way to explaining the differences in the reactivity of the two supported catalysts in the batch reactor described above (Fig. 5)."
6,Continuous flow experiments,"Having shown the viability of the method in batch experiments, the technique was then adapted and applied in a continuous process."
7,Experimental apparatus and technique,"3.1 Experimental apparatus and technique The reactor assembly is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The catalytic bed forms the inside tube of a double tube assembly, where in the annular section of tube a heat transfer fluid (Julabo Thermal HC20S) is circulated using a Grant GP200 circulating oil bath and this ensures a constant temperature can be maintained. The inside tube is 7mm i.d. and this was packed to a depth of 250mm, and acted as the catalytic bed. The reactants were premixed with the solvent in a container, and then the solution was pumped into the reactor using a HPLC pump at the desired flow rate. Pressures were measured at the base and at the top of the reactor. At the outlet from the reactor a 16-turn needle valve was positioned, which could be used to adjust the backpressure on the reactor. After the valve, the line was not insulated, and this enabled the temperature of the fluid to decrease rapidly. This was then collected for analysis."
8,Catalyst preparation and characterisation,"3.2 Catalyst preparation and characterisation Two different approaches were tried in order to prepare the catalyst. 3.2.1 In situ catalyst preparation The catalyst bed was first packed with the polystyrene beads containing 1.6mmol of phosphine/g with an average particle size of ∼150μm. Then by maintaining the heat transfer fluid in the annular tube at 110°C a solution containing the ruthenium precursor, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (∼0.025M solution in toluene) was pumped through the reactor, in an endeavour to support the metal (via the polymer bound phosphine) on the polymer beads in the bed. Unfortunately, although this was an interesting approach, this technique was not successful, as the pressure-drop across the bed soon became 25bar. The resin had swelled and blocked the voidage between the particles in the bed. Therefore, this approach was abandoned, and an alternative approach was considered. 3.2.2 External catalyst preparation To a 50mL round bottom flask under an atmosphere of argon, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (500mg, 0.816mmol), polystyrene beads containing 1.6mmol of phosphine/g (2.04g, 3.264mmol phosphine) and 20mL of dry, degassed toluene were added. The solution was then heated to 110°C for 3h until the solution was colourless. The supported catalyst was then cooled and filtered. This was then loaded into the packed bed, whilst the filtered particles were still wet—this was to avoid any expansion due to swelling of the resin."
9,Experimental results at atmospheric pressure,"3.3 Experimental results at atmospheric pressure The continuous flow reactor was initially operated without any backpressure on the reactor, so as the pressure-drop across the catalytic bed was negligible, it was effectively operating at atmospheric pressure. The results of the key experiments are summarised in Figs. 8 and 9 . It is interesting to note that even in this relatively short catalytic bed (250mm) high conversions could be achieved. As expected the conversion into the desired product increases with increasing temperature and decreasing flow rate. For example, at 110°C and a flow rate of 0.25cm3 min−1 a low conversion of 15% to the desired product is achieved, whilst at 150°C and a flow rate of 0.1cm3 min−1 a conversion of 98% is obtained. In the earlier batch experiments, although the reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure, vaporised material would have been condensed and retained in the reactor. However, when the continuous flow reactor was operated at near atmospheric pressure, then it is likely that vaporised material would have created a two-phase gas–liquid mixture, which would have flowed through the bed. Using a proprietary package known as Aspen Plus, equilibrium flash calculations on the mixture were performed and the vapor pressure of the feed mixture was also estimated. This confirmed, that at 150°C, as the vapor pressure was 2.6bar (see top curve in Fig. 10 ) and hence greater than atmospheric then two-phase flow would occur."
10,Experimental results at 5bar(g) pressure,"3.4 Experimental results at 5bar(g) pressure In order to see what effect a back pressure would have, the reactor was run at 150°C, 0.1cm3 min−1 with ∼5bar(g). The backpressure was controlled using a needle valve positioned at the end of the reactor. Suppressing the vaporisation of the solvent, reactant and product mixture in this manner led to a slight decrease in activity whilst still achieving a high conversion of 88% to the desired tertiary amine. This decrease is believed to be as a direct result of the loss of Ru from the system. With the introduction of a backpressure, catalyst leaching was observed as the liquid from the outlet of the reactor turned from a clear colourless solution to dark red. In order to reduce the loss of Ru from the system, and yet maintain vapor suppression, a decision was made to use a higher boiling solvent, and p-xylene was used instead of toluene. When the reactor was then run at 150°C, 0.1cm3 min−1 under atmospheric pressure, high conversions (>98%) were again achieved with no visible catalyst leaching. With a boiling point of 138°C, p-xylene limited the degree to which vaporisation occurred in the reactor. Therefore it was not necessary to add a backpressure, as with a vapor pressure of 1.36bar (see lower curve in Fig. 10) it was only fractionally above atmospheric."
11,Catalytic stability,"3.5 Catalytic stability In any proposed industrial application of a new catalytic process, it is important to explore catalyst stability. In order to draw a comparison with the homogeneous catalytic process, the catalyst turnover number (TON) (van Leeuwen, 2005) for the continuous flow fixed bed catalytic reactor was calculated, and this was compared with the homogeneous system. The TON was defined as: TON = mol of limiting reactant mol of catalyst × fractional conversion The TON illustrates for how long the same catalyst system can be used, before it needs to be replaced (fixed bed application), or before it has to be recovered from the product solution (homogeneous catalytic system). It is worth emphasizing that although several homogeneous catalysts for the N-alkylation of amines using alcohols have been published, they have never been used in a commercial process. A disadvantage of the homogeneous system is the need to recover the homogeneous catalyst from the reactor effluent stream. This may be possible to reuse, however, it may not be practicable to do so. Comparisons should be made between the relative catalytic loading of the homogeneous and supported systems for this reaction. Even highly active homogeneous Ru systems, that have been previously published for this reaction, are ultimately limited by the size of the batch process, due to their inability to be recycled efficiently. However, if it is possible to support a catalyst with a continuous supply of fresh feed the TON is only limited by the lifetime of the catalyst. The fixed bed catalytic reactor was run at 150°C, 0.1cm3 min−1 with a feed solution of 16vol% of reactants in xylene. The reactor was run continuously for 72h processing nearly 500cm3 of feed. The TON was calculated to be 438. This compared very favourably with a typical homogeneous system for this reaction type, operating at 1mol% catalyst loading having a maximum TON of 100. It is clear that for the fixed bed reactor higher TONs are achievable with an increased run time, but at this stage in our work, enough has been done to show the viability of this approach. Catalyst stability, will also be examined more closely in further work, as: - different supports for the catalyst are considered, - support configuration is considered (e.g. particles, monolith), - influence of flow and support geometry on mass transfer coefficients is considered and its influence on reaction rates, - how to reduce residence time, and - other process design aspects are explored in more detail. As changes are made to the reacting environment, these may in turn impact on catalyst stability, and so this will need to be monitored as improvements are made to the process."
12,Concluding remarks,"The N-alkylation of morpholine with benzyl alcohol was selected as a model reaction and an immobilised ruthenium complex supported on a phosphine bound polymer acted as the catalyst. Operating at 150°C, with stoichiometric ratios of reactants, and using p-xylene as a solvent (84vol%), the conversion into the desired tertiary amine was shown to be as high as 98%. It was shown that a novel homogeneous catalytic process, based on the ‘borrowing hydrogen’ principle could be used to make a tertiary amine in a continuous process, with a fixed bed catalyst. This methodology is one, other researchers working in the area might build upon. For applications in the pharmaceutical industry, this approach is clearly very promising, as it provides a greener and more atom efficient route for the production of secondary and tertiary amines. However, it is recognized that further work is necessary to optimize the system, and quantify longer term catalyst stability."
