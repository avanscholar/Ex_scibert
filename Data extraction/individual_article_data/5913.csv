0,Introduction,"The citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) is one of the main components of the lemongrass oil. It is considered as an interesting model molecule, since it has three hydrogenation sites: a carbonyl group, a CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group and an isolated CC bond. Citral exists as cis and trans isomers and it can also be cyclized. The hydrogenation products have important uses in the synthesis of flavors and also in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [1,2]. The hydrogenation of the carbonyl group is thermodynamically less favored than the hydrogenation of double CC bonds, consequently, this work tries to selectively enhance the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to produce nerol and geraniol, the unsaturated alcohols (UA), and minimize the production of undesired minor products [3,4]. The hydrogenation of the carbonyl group gives nerol and geraniol (double unsaturated alcohols) and citronellol (single unsaturated alcohol) in a further step, whereas the hydrogenation of the conjugated double CC bond gives citronellal and through its cyclization, isopulegol. Other products such as 3,7 dimethyloctanol and menthol (saturated alcohols), can also be produced. The complete reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 1 . It has been reported that the nature of both the metallic phase and the support has an important influence on the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of unsaturated α-β aldehydes [1,5,6]. Thus, Ni supported on SiO2 leads to citronellal and citronellol, as the main products [4]. The addition of Os, Ru and Co to Ni enhances the production of nerol and geraniol [1,6]. It has also been shown that the use of bimetallic catalysts modifies the activity and improves the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [3,7]. Further results indicate that the metal particle size has a strong influence on the selectivity [8] and the proper selection of solvent helps to reduce the acetal formation as by-products [3]. The use of powder and felt of activated carbons as supports of PtSn prepared by conventional impregnation led to an improved selectivity to UA in the citral hydrogenation [9]. According to Didillon et al. [10], the controlled addition of Sn, Pb or Ge to Rh/SiO2 catalysts by using a surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method resulted in significant selectivity changes. Thus, at low surface coverages of Rh by Sn, Pb or Ge, the modified catalysts showed high selectivity to the hydrogenation of the conjugated CC bonds, but at high coverages the modified catalysts were highly selective to hydrogenate the carbonyl group. Consequently, as it has been mentioned above, additives such as tin have an important influence in controlling the activity, selectivity, and stability of various noble metals used to catalyze reactions, such as the hydrogenation of unsaturated α-β aldehydes. The Pt–Sn system supported on silica is quite complex: Pt, five intermetallic compounds are thermodynamically stable and different Sn(II) and Sn(IV) ion-containing species may also form. Thus, it is extremely challenging to determine the impact of these species on the overall catalyst performance, especially because the type of surface species present will depend on both the mode of preparation and the reaction conditions [11]. Methods of SOMC, such as controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between hydrogen adsorbed on transition metals and tin tetraalkyls are widely used to prepare tin modified supported bimetallic catalysts [11,12]. In contrast to co-impregnation methods, the organometallic approach employing CSRs ensures the exclusive formation of bimetallic moieties on the surface of the support and the introduction of tin into the support can completely be avoided [13]. Most of these studies were related to supported rhodium [14,15] and platinum catalysts [11–13]. We have developed a unique method to deposit tin into supported platinum catalysts [12,13]. The basis of this approach is the use of CSRs with the involvement of hydrogen adsorbed on supported metals (MHads) and tin tetraalkyls. The bimetallic catalysts obtained after modification with tin appeared to be highly active and selective in different reactions, such as selective hydrogenation [16,17], hydrogenolysis of fatty acid esters [18], conversion of hydrocarbons and n-alkane reforming [19], low temperature CO oxidation [20] and hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination [21]. In 1984, three research groups [18,22,23] simultaneously described new preparative routes for bimetallic catalysts by the reaction of tin organometallic compounds, such as SnR4 (R: CH3, C2H5, or C4H9) with the surface of supported metals M/oxide (where M=Pt, Rh, Ru or Ni). Surface chemistry involved in the two-step modification of supported and skeletal metal catalysts by tin tetraalkyls can be given by the following general equations [11,12,19]: (1) M H ads + Sn R 4 → M – Sn R ( 4 − x ) + ( PSC ) x RH (2) M – Sn R ( 4 − x ) + ( 4 − x ) 2 H 2 → Sn – M ( SBS ) + ( 4 − x ) RH Reaction (1) (step 1), proceeds via stepwise hydrogenolysis of the Sn–R bond with elimination of RH and formation of primary surface complexes (PSC), described as M–SnR(4−x). Catalyst modification based on this surface chemistry is known as “anchoring metals-to-metals” and it is usually monitored by GC for determining the amount of hydrocarbons formed. This reaction provided direct tin–platinum interaction which was maintained upon decomposition of the formed PSC in a hydrogen atmosphere to obtain supported bimetallic species (reaction (2)) [11,12,19]. This approach led to the monolayer coverage of platinum by tin organometallic species [11,12]. The temperature programmed decomposition (TPD) profile obtained in reaction (2) showed a definite difference between surface organometallic species formed. The “fingerprint” character of the TPD curves can also be used for catalyst characterization [12,19]. Upon using surface reactions (1) and (2), tin containing surface organometallic species can be anchored exclusively onto the supported metal depending on the conditions and the mode of surface modification. The versatility of catalysts obtained in this way is attributed to different forms and altered environment of tin. Recently, it has been demonstrated that upon modification of supported Pt catalysts with tin tetraalkyls, high Sn/Pts (Pts is the number of surface Pt atoms) ratios can also be obtained without introduction of tin into the support [13]. The new results indicated the formation of multilayer organometallic complexes (MLOC) at the Pt surface. In the formation of MLOC the following reactions are involved [12,19]: (1a) MHads +SnR4 →M–SnR3 +RH (1b) M–SnR3 + xHads →M–SnR(3−x) + xRH (1c) M – Sn R ( 3 − x ) + m Sn R 4 + m y H ads → M – { Sn R ( 3 − x ) – ( Sn R ( 4 − y ) ) m } ( MLOC ) + m y RH In reaction (1b) the key issue is to obtain coordinative unsaturation of surface organometallic species formed with general formula of M−SnR(3−x) . These surface species are considered as the new landing sites for tin tetraalkyl used in large excess (see reaction (1c)). Reaction (1c) provides the multilayer tin coverage on platinum. In the presence of an excess of both adsorbed hydrogen and SnR4 the formation of slab like MLOC was proposed. As emerges from FTIR data of adsorbed CO and Mössbauer measurements [13] on PtSn/SiO2 catalysts the platinum nanoclusters are strongly diluted by tin and the most abundant form of tin is Sn–Pt alloy (85–100%, depending on the Sn/Pts ratio). The Sn/Pts ratio was increased up to 2.5 resulting in at least two forms of supported bimetallic nanoclusters. Based on Mössbauer measurements depending on the Sn/Pts ratio either Pt-rich (Pt3Sn) or Sn-rich (Pt2Sn3 or PtSn2) alloy-type surface species were the most abundant alloy composition. The object of this paper is related to the study of the performance of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with different Sn/Pt atomic ratios prepared by CRS in the citral hydrogenation in order to see their effect on the activity and selectivity. Moreover, the metallic phase of the catalysts was characterized by CO chemisorption, Mössbauer spectroscopy, cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis, and then they were correlated with the structure of the catalysts."
1,Experimental,"Three monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalysts with metal loading of 0.45, 0.72 and 1.25wt% (Pt1, Pt2 and Pt3, respectively) were used for tin anchoring. Characteristic features of these catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . All three parent Pt/SiO2 catalysts have been used to obtain bimetallic PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with high Sn/Pt ratios. Prior to the tin anchoring step, the parent silica supported Pt catalysts were re-reduced under flowing hydrogen at 300°C for 1h. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled down up to room temperature in the H2 flow and then purged with argon for 30min to remove the physisorbed hydrogen. Next, the catalyst was transferred into a glass reactor without exposure to air. The first step of tin anchoring, i.e. the reaction between tin tetraethyl and hydrogen adsorbed on Pt (see reactions (1a)–(1c)), was investigated under argon atmosphere at 50°C in deoxygenated tiophene-free benzene as a solvent using a 123cm3 stirred glass reactor equipped with rubber septum to take samples both from gas and liquid phases. In the tin anchoring step, the solvent volume was 15cm3 and the amount of the parent supported Pt catalysts was 2g. Tin anchoring was started at 50°C by injection of tin tetraethyl into the slurry. The tin anchoring process was monitored in two ways: (i) by determination of hydrocarbons formed (ethane and ethylene) both during the tin anchoring step (surface reactions (1a)–(1c)) and the decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (surface reaction (2)), (ii) by analysis of the liquid phase for tin tetraethyl [24]. These results provided the sum of reacted and adsorbed tin tetraethyl. The amount of adsorbed tin tetraethyl was determined by analyzing the solution obtained after washing out the unreacted tin tetraalkyl from the catalyst particles. Surface reactions (1a)–(1c) and (2) were monitored by determining the amount of hydrocarbons formed by GC using a 3m long Al2O3 column at 100°C. A correction was done for the amount of hydrocarbons dissolved in the solvent used. The analysis of the liquid phase for tin tetraethyl during tin anchoring was accomplished by GC at 160°C using a 4m long Chromosorb WAW-DMCS column (inner diameter: 3mm) coated with 10wt% Silicone DC 410. These experimental conditions were used for the preparation of catalysts PtSn1-1, PtSn2-1 and PtSn3-1 with the lowest tin content. The PtSn1-2 and PtSn2-2 catalysts with medium tin contents were prepared in the presence of H2. In this case, in reaction (1a)–(1c), the inert atmosphere (Ar) was replaced by H2 to increase both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of Sn introduced [12,25]. For the preparation of the PtSn1-3, PtSn1-4 and PtSn3-3 catalysts, the Sn anchoring was started in H2; after 90min of tin anchoring, the hydrogen was replaced by Ar, and a small amount of O2 (20cm3 g cat − 1 ) was added to the reactor, and the tin anchoring was continued. Previous research has shown that the addition of oxygen substantially increases the amount of Sn anchored [12,25]. For the PtSn3-2 catalyst tin anchoring was started in argon atmosphere, followed by the addition of oxygen in the 90th minute of tin anchoring as discussed above. When reactions (1a)–(1c) reached completion, the catalyst was washed at 50°C four times with benzene and twice with n-hexane. Then the catalyst was dried in vacuum (5torr) for 1h at the same temperature. The second step of tin anchoring (see reaction (2)) is the temperature programmed decomposition of surface organometallic complexes formed in reactions (1a)–(1c) in a hydrogen atmosphere (experimental parameters: heating rate=5°Cmin−1, hydrogen flow rate=30cm3 min−1, amount of catalyst=0.4–0.6g) [12]. The amount of tin anchored onto platinum (see Table 1) was calculated using the overall material balance of tin anchoring reactions. These data and results of AAS measurements were in good agreement. Further details on the preparation and analysis can be found elsewhere [12,13,19,21,25]. The catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption measurements for determining the CO/Pt ratio, by using an ASDI RXM 100 equipment (Advanced Scientific Designs Inc.) as described elsewhere [19,24,26]. Mössbauer spectra of PtSn1-4 catalyst were recorded at −196°C with a constant acceleration spectrometer using a Ba119SnO3 source. All isomer shifts were referred to SnO2. This catalyst, contained the highest tin concentration (Sn/Pt=1.92), was prepared for the Mössbauer measurements as its activity, due to the high Sn/Pt ratio, was very low. All other catalysts due to the relatively low Sn content resulted in low quality of Mössbauer spectra. First the spectrum of “air stored” PtSn1-4 catalyst sample was measured, then it was “in situ” treated in hydrogen atmosphere at 320°C for 3h (10mlmin−1) in the Mössbauer cell [27]. For fitting purposes a Lorentzian line shape for each peak was assumed, and no isomer shift parameters were initially constrained. Successive iterations were applied to obtain a better fit to the experimental data. The estimated accuracy of the positional parameters was 0.03mms−1. In addition two model reactions of the metallic surface were used: cyclohexane dehydrogenation (CHD) and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis (CPH) in order to study the influence of tin addition on the surface properties of bimetallic Sn-Pt catalysts. CHD and CPH were carried out in a flow reactor at 320°C by using a H2/CH (CH: cyclohexane) molar ratio=26 and H2/CP (CP: cyclopentane)=29, respectively. Prior to the test reactions, catalysts were reduced “in situ” under flowing H2 at 320°C for 3h. The reaction products were benzene for CHD and n-pentane for CPH and they were analyzed by GC. The catalyst weight used in CHD experiments was such as to obtain a conversion lower than 5% (differential flow reactor). The catalyst weight used in the CPH experiments was such as to obtain a conversion lower than 7% (differential flow reactor). By using the reaction CH rates measured at 310, 320 and 330°C and the Arrhenius plot (ln r CH 0 versus 1/T (K−1)), the activation energy (E act) was calculated by linear regression. The errors corresponding to activation energies in CH dehydrogenation were about 8%. The citral hydrogenation was carried out in a batch type reactor equipped with a device for liquid product sampling. The reaction was performed at 70°C and atmospheric pressure. Experiments that show the influence of the reaction temperature over the activity and selectivity were also done at 30 and 50°C and it can be concluded that both the activity and the selectivity to the hydrogenation of the CO bond were very low, whereas the selectivity to the hydrogenation of the CC bonds was very high. These results agree with the ones reported by Singh and Vannice [1] with Pt/TiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts on the citral hydrogenation) and the ones reported by Malathi and Viswanath [28]. Hence, and considering these results at very low temperatures, we decided to carry out the comparison of the catalytic behavior in citral hydrogenation of the different catalysts at 70°C. Pure 2-propanol (from Merck), previously saturated with H2, was used as a solvent. The volume of solvent, the citral amount (Sigma, 61% cis- and 36% trans-) and the weight of catalyst used in the experiments were: 30, 0.30, and 0.30g, respectively. Prior to the reaction, catalysts were submitted to a thermal treatment with N2 at 120°C during 1h, then they were reduced “in situ” under flowing H2 at 320°C for 3h. The reaction mixture was stirred at 1400rpm. The reaction liquid products were periodically withdrawn from the reactor, along 10h of reaction time. The products were analyzed by GC using a Supelcowax 10M column and a FID as a detector. The main detected products were the ones given in Fig. 1. Some minor products (α-terpinol, 5-caranol, and 1,3,4-trimethyl-3-cyclohexene 1-carboxaldehyde) were also detected. From previous experiments [29], diffusional limitations were found to be absent under these conditions."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Catalyst modification and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst modification and characterization Characteristic features of silica supported mono- and bimetallic Sn-Pt catalysts are given in Table 1. In our earlier studies it had been demonstrated that the selectivity to carbonyl hydrogenation strongly depended on the Sn/Pt ratios and high SCO selectivities in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotylalcohol were obtained at relatively high content of modifier [25,30]. In order to achieve high Sn/Pt ratios and maintain the overall control of tin anchoring, i.e. to suppress the amount of tin introduced onto the support, the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring has been altered. In this new approach, the coordinative unsaturation provided by excess of hydrogen or the use of small amount of added oxygen lead to the formation of new anchoring sites. The larger part of tin anchored in this way is introduced in the form of a multilayer [12,19,25]. Further aim of this study is the extension of our approach to the modification of silica supported platinum catalysts with low platinum loading (0.45, 0.72 and 1.25wt%) as far as in our earlier studies Pt/SiO2 catalysts with 3wt% Pt were modified [12,13,20,25]. In our earlier study it has also been shown that the surface chemistry involved in the modification of supported platinum catalysts strongly depended on the Sno/Pts ratio (Sno is the initial amount of tin used in the tin anchoring step, Pts is the total number of surface Pt atoms) [12,25]. Results presented in Table 1 indicate that the Sn/Pt ratio can be substantially increased under the following experimental conditions of tin anchoring: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4 (Sno/Pts ratio); (ii) carrying out tin anchoring reaction in excess of hydrogen; (iii) addition of oxygen during Sn anchoring step [12,25]. The tin anchoring process is based on the surface reaction between hydrogen adsorbed on platinum or other noble metals and tin tetraethyl (see reactions (1a)–(1c)) [11,12,25]. Typical kinetic curves of tin anchoring under different experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 2A–C. Fig. 2A and B show the kinetic curves of tin anchoring obtained in the absence and presence of excess of gas-phase hydrogen, respectively. As emerges from Fig. 2A and B, the excess of hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring (Wo) and the amount of ethane formed. The influence of oxygen added to the reactor during surface reaction (1) started in hydrogen atmosphere is shown in Fig. 2C. In the absence of gas-phase hydrogen, parallel to the formation of ethane, ethylene was also formed in very small amount (Fig. 2A). The formation of ethylene was relatively more pronounced at high conversions, i.e. under condition of hydrogen deficiency. No ethylene has been formed in the presence of gas-phase hydrogen (Fig. 2B). Our earlier results indicated that the presence of either oxygen or unreduced forms of platinum strongly alters the character of surface reactions (1a)–(1c) [12,25]. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2C, the oxygen was introduced in the 90th minute after removal of gas-phase hydrogen. As emerges from Fig. 2C, the addition of oxygen resulted in an instantaneous formation of ethylene and a strong decrease in the rate of ethane formation. The ethylene formation indicates that the addition of oxygen has no significant negative influence on the overall rate of tin anchoring; however, the formation of ethylene indicates that the character of surface reaction has completely been altered. We prefer to add oxygen after the formation of PSC, i.e. after completion of the monolayer coverage of tin organic moieties [12,25]. The effect of the atmosphere of tin anchoring reaction (see reaction (1a)–(1c)) on the TPD pattern is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . In the preparation of these samples the initial concentration of tin tetraethyl was almost constant (see Sno/Pts ratios in Table 1). The TPD profile obtained in the presence of gas phase hydrogen showed significant changes compared with the tin anchoring reaction carried out in the absence of hydrogen (compare Fig. 3, samples A and B). This figure unambiguously shows that the presence of hydrogen in reaction (1) decreases the amount of ethane formed in reaction (2). In our earlier studies it has been demonstrated that in excess of gas-phase hydrogen, the hydrogenolysis of the SnC bond in anchored surface organometallic complexes is enhanced [12,25]. High extent of dealkylation in the first step of tin anchoring (see x values in Table 1) is in agreement with the decreased amount of hydrocarbons formed in the second step, as shown in Fig. 3 (sample B). In addition, the slight shift in the peak maximum might indicate the formation of MLOC, what is in accordance with increased Sn/Pt ratio (see Table 1). The addition of oxygen during tin anchoring reaction has significantly altered the TPD pattern (see Fig. 3, sample C), resulting in a new high temperature peak of ethane at 140°C. In our previous studies [12,25], the high temperature peaks above 100°C were attributed to the decomposition of MLOC. Consequently, as emerges from results given in Fig. 3 there are marked differences in the TPD patterns depending on the atmosphere used in surface reaction (1). When surface organometallic complexes are heated in hydrogen under condition of TPD the transformation of surface species depends on both the temperature and the reactivity of PSC and MLOC species. The lower the reactivity, the higher the temperature of TPD peak. Upon decreasing the reactivity of anchored surface organometallic species for the hydrogenolysis of the SnC bond, the temperature required for the decomposition increases. As it was shown in our earlier studies the differences in the shapes of the TPD pattern are attributed to the differences in the structure of surface species anchored [12,25]. As emerges from Fig. 3 the shape of TPD profiles of surface organometallic species containing PSC and multilayered surface complexes is completely different [12,25]. In our earlier studies it was also shown that organometallic species adsorbed into the support has the highest temperature TPD peak [12]. The maximum is located above 200°C, consequently the loss of control of surface reactions can easily be monitored by analysis of the TPD pattern of the decomposition of surface species formed. Results given in Fig. 3 unambiguously show that no tin has been introduced into the support. Further data related to the rates and material balance of tin anchoring using three different supported platinum catalysts are summarized in Table 1. As emerges from these results for each type of catalysts (Pt1, Pt2 and Pt3) both the rate of formation of PSC, the Sn/Pt ratios and the stoichiometry of surface reactions (1a)–(1c) (see x values in Table 1) strongly depended on the atmosphere of tin anchoring. Table 1 shows that for the Pt1 catalyst under similar initial tin concentration, the Sn/Pt ratios in the modified catalysts were 0.34, 0.58 and 1.03 in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen, in the presence of excess hydrogen and in the case of oxygen addition, respectively. The value of x shows the amount of alkyl groups lost in the first step of anchoring (see reaction (1)). The stoichiometry of tin anchoring depends also on the metal loading. The behavior of the two catalysts (Pt1 and Pt2) is almost identical. It is noteworthy that the Pt3 catalyst with the highest Pt loading showed higher value of x in the absence of gas phase hydrogen (compare samples PtSn1-1 and PtSn2-1 with PtSn3-1). The low value of x (x <1, see samples PtSn1-1 and PtSn2-1 in Table 1), indicates that surface species formed should contain both –Sn(C2H5)4 and –Sn(C2H5)3 type surface species [12,25]. The highest value of x (x =3.3 and 3.6 in experiments for PtSn1-2 and PtSn2-2, respectively) has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out using excess of gas-phase hydrogen. The results of modification of Pt/SiO2 catalysts by using CSRs resulted in bimetallic Sn-Pt catalysts with different tin content. The Sn/Pt atomic ratio varied in the range of 0–1. Consequently, the surface composition of these catalysts should be different. These differences are also reflected by CO chemisorption results. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the CO/Pt value as a function of the Sn/Pt atomic ratio for the three series of catalysts. Fig. 4 clearly shows that upon increasing tin loading, the chemisorption capacities of all modified catalysts decreases. This decrease is quite pronounced at low tin content, i.e. for Sn/Pt ≅0.0–0.3 atomic ratio. However, at higher Sn/Pt atomic ratios the decrease in the CO/Pt value is less distinct. The results of CO chemisorption can mainly be attributed to the geometric modifications of Pt caused by the dilution of Pt surface by anchored tin. However, electronic effects should not be discarded either. At higher Sn/Pt ratios, tin also appears in the subsurface layers resulting in only small changes in the CO/Pt ratios. It is quite remarkable that the trend in the decrease of the CO/Pt value as a function of Sn/Pt ratio is similar for all three series of catalysts. The 119Sn Mössbauer study was performed on the PtSn1-4 catalyst with Sn/Pt (at./at.) ratio 1.92. The changes in the composition of ionic Sn species and Pt–Sn alloys are summarized in Table 2 . It has to be emphasized that because the probability of the Mössbauer effect (recoilless fraction) is different for the various Sn species, the RI values do not strictly correspond to concentrations [31,32]. In general, recoilless fractions for inorganic ionic Sn species are less than those for Pt–Sn alloys [32,33]. Thus, the relative concentrations of ionic Sn species determined solely from the RI values would be underestimated, and those of Pt–Sn alloy species would be overestimated. The Mössbauer spectrum of the “air stored” sample consisted of a quadrupole doublet of Sn4+ (IS=0.02mms−1 and QS=0.64mms−1) and a singlet with an IS of 1.63mms−1. Based on literature data the latter value is close to that of the platinum-rich Pt3Sn alloy phase (1.50mms−1 [34]). In our recent studies it was shown that the Pt3Sn alloy is stable during storage in air, whereas the tin-rich Pt2Sn3 and PtSn4 alloy phases oxidizes into Sn4+ [20]. A characteristic feature of sample reduced in hydrogen atmosphere is the presence of broad bands in the range of 1–3mms−1 characteristic of Pt–Sn alloys and the absence of ionic Sn species (see Table 2). It has already mentioned in our earlier study [35], the usually observed broad band in this range indicates that the Pt-Sn catalysts contains several Pt–Sn alloy phases. The compositional changes in the Pt–Sn alloy species were estimated from the IS values with the assumption of proportionality between the IS and the Sn/Pt (at./at.) ratio [34]. However, because of the substantial overlap of the spectral lines, the parameters belonging to two extreme compositions were used in the fitting procedures. The Mössbauer spectrum of sample reduced at 320°C for 3h was fit under the assumption of a two-alloy component system: a Pt-rich alloy (Pt–Sn(a)) with an IS of 1.51mms−1 and a Sn-rich alloy (Pt–Sn(b)) with an IS of 2.58mms−1. The IS value of the Pt-rich phase may correspond to the Pt3Sn alloy, while the IS value for the Sn-rich alloy phase slightly exceeds that of PtSn4 (2.29mms−1) [34]. In our earlier studies the IS values for these two alloy phases were in the range of 1.4–1.5 and 2.2–2.4mms−1 [20,35]. The relative intensity of the bands for the Pt-rich and Sn-rich alloy phases were 80 and 20%, respectively. These results unambiguously demonstrated that even at this high Sn/Pt ratio the selectivity of tin anchoring reaction is close to 100%, i.e. no tin is introduced into the support. Table 3 shows the activation energies (E act) and the initial reaction rates ( r CH 0 ) in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation and the initial reaction rates in the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis ( r CP 0 ) for all catalysts investigated. The CHD is a structure-insensitive reaction [36]. Hence, the change in the activation energy when a second metal is added to the noble metal can be interpreted as a modification of the metallic phase nature. The results of cyclohexane dehydrogenation indicate that in all three series of catalysts upon increasing the Sn/Pt ratio, the activation energy increases and the reaction rate decreases significantly. The changes in the E act values indicate an electronic modification of Pt by introduction of Sn, what can be related to the alloy formation. The initial reaction rates of the three monometallic catalysts (Pt1, Pt2 and Pt3) are quite similar, this agrees well with CO/Pt values for these catalysts. For bimetallic catalysts, the increasing amounts of Sn added to Pt resulted in an important decrease in the reaction rate, probably due to both electronic and geometric effects. On the other hand, the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis (CPH) is a structure-sensitive reaction [37], and the decrease of its reaction rate when a second metal is added indicates that hydrogenolitic ensemble sites have been broken up. As Table 3 shows, the addition of Sn to Pt inhibits the hydrogenolytic reaction completely, thus confirming that Sn, placed near Pt, breaks the ensembles needed for this reaction."
4,Citral hydrogenation,"3.2 Citral hydrogenation Fig. 5 shows the citral conversion versus the reaction time for three series of parent and modified catalysts. In the case of monometallic catalysts, Pt1, Pt2 and Pt3, conversions of about 90–95% were achieved after 10h reaction time. In the same figure, the influence of addition of tin to Pt on the citral conversion is also shown. This figure indicates that the addition of tin to Pt altered the activity of the parent catalysts in a different way. Pt1 with the lowest Pt content showed a constant activity decrease in the whole interval of Sn/Pt ratios. Pt2 with medium Pt content displays a minor sensitivity to the addition of tin, however after 4h of reaction time the tin modified catalysts have slightly higher conversion values than the parent catalyst. Pt3 with the highest Pt content showed a complex behavior: at low tin content it resembles Pt2, while at high tin content it resembles the Pt1 catalyst. Figs. 6–8 show the evolution of the selectivity values to the different products: unsaturated alcohols (UA), citronellal (CAL), isopulegol (ISO), citronellol (COL), and menthol (MEN), for all the catalyst series, measured along the time. For the monometallic catalysts, the formation of UA was observed only over the Pt3 one. However, the most important issue is that over all tin modified Pt catalysts the selectivity of UA increases in time. At low conversion the selectivity is relatively low and shows a monotonic increase part prior it reaches its stable high value. It is an indirect evidence for the reaction-induced selectivity changes described by Ponec and co-workers [38–40]. Fig. 9 shows the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (nerol+geraniol, UA) after 10h reaction time as a function of Sn/Pt atomic ratio for all three series of catalysts. In all cases, upon introduction of tin, the selectivity to UA increases significantly. The higher the Pt content the smaller the amount of tin needed to get selectivity values of about 75–80%. In the case of the monometallic catalysts, the selectivity to UA is close to zero over Pt1 and Pt2 and it has a relatively low value (about 29%) over Pt3 having the maximum Pt loading. It has been evidenced earlier that Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts are highly selective in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotylalcohol [13,25,30]. The high selectivity was attributed to the “in situ” formation of “Sn n+−Pt ensemble” sites. This fact was evidenced by “in situ” FT-IR and Mössbauer measurements [13,25]. These results have confirmed the earlier suggestion that the ‘reaction-induced selectivity improvement’ observed over PtSn/SiO2 catalysts is related to the formation and stabilization of ionic forms of tin in the atomic closeness to Pt. The involvement of ionic species, such as Sn n+ or Fe n+, in carbonyl activation has also been suggested in other earlier studies [38–40]. These ionic forms formed “in situ” would polarize the carbonyl group of unsaturated aldehydes, leading to an increase of the selectivity to UA. Our main results, i.e. the remarkably high selectivity of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by using CSRs can be attributed to: (i) the presence of “in situ” formed ionic tin species in the neighborhood of Pt, which can activate the carbonyl group, and (ii) the dilution of Pt sites with metallic Sn and alloy particles, what suppresses the readsorption of the formed unsaturated alcohol [25]. The intimate contact between Pt and Sn was also supported by CPH results (see Table 3) that showed that Sn was located in the vicinity of Pt sites, breaking the ensembles needed for hydrogenolysis reaction. It seems to us that in citral hydrogenation, similar to earlier suggestions described above, the activation of the carbonyl group takes place on the ionic forms of tin formed “in situ”. The increase of the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols in time (see Figs. 6–8) strongly supports this idea. The results obtained over three Pt catalysts with different Pt content indicate that the lower the Pt content, the higher the Sn/Pt ratio required to get higher UA selectivities. Fig. 10 shows the selectivity to citronellal (CAL), isopulegol (ISO) and citronellol (COL) measured after 10h reaction time versus the Sn/Pt atomic ratio. It should be noted that the formation of isopulegol (see Fig. 1) takes place in a cyclization reaction catalyzed by acidic sites of the support [3]. Our results show that this reaction is inhibited by the neutral character of the support. The monometallic catalysts show high selectivity to CAL, specially Pt1 and Pt2, because they are highly selective to the CC bond hydrogenation. In Pt3 catalyst, the selectivity to CAL decreases with respect to Pt1 and Pt2 ones whereas the selectivity to COL increases, this fact indicates that when the concentration of Pt sites is high (such as in Pt3 sample), the CAL formed can be readsorbed in the neighboring sites for a further hydrogenation to COL. For bimetallic catalysts, the routes responsible for the formation of CAL and COL is hindered due to the activation of the carbonyl group by “Sn n+–Pt ensemble” sites."
5,Conclusions,"Different Pt/SiO2 catalysts were modified by tin tetraethyl using CSRs. The proper selection of the condition of tin anchoring resulted in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with broad Sn/Pt ratio. The results of tin anchoring, CO chemisorption, Mössbauer spectroscopy, CHD and CPH, unambiguously showed that tin has been introduced into Pt and alloy-type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts were prepared. In these alloy-type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts tin induces both geometric (site isolation) and electronic effects. Not only the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation, but the activation energies were altered by addition of tin. Results obtained in the hydrogenation of citral over Pt/SiO2 and Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts showed that the higher the Pt loading, the lower the Sn/Pt atomic ratio required to achieve higher selectivities to nerol and geraniol (UA). Both chemisorption, Mössbauer spectroscopy, CHD and CPH results indicated that upon using CSRs for the introduction of tin alloy type bimetallic Sn-Pt catalysts are formed. The introduction of tin reduced strongly the number of accessible Pt sites. Besides, geometric effects that produce the dilution of Pt atoms by Sn moieties in the atomic closeness of Pt and Sn are favorable for the formation of “Snn+–Pt ensemble” sites required for carbonyl activation."
