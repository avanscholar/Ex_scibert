0,Introduction,"Among alternative biomass resources, switchgrass (Panicum viragatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) are promising potential sources for production of value-added products. They are non-edible biomass materials with high total carbohydrate contents. These sources are C4 warm-season perennial grasses and both crops have a tolerance for cold weather and are highly adaptable to varying soil conditions [1,2]. Pretreatment is an essential prerequisite to make biomass accessible to deconstruction by altering structural features such as removing lignin and reducing cellulose crystallinity, thereby increasing porosity. Successful production of biofuels and other bioproducts from lignocellulosic biomass depends on the pretreatment and deconstruction methods applied as well as the physical and chemical properties of the biomass. An efficient pretreatment method followed by solubilization in aqueous media without using toxic and hazardous chemicals is necessary to obtain reduced molecular weight of carbohydrates from biomass to produce various biofuels and bioproducts. Microwaves are in the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared radiation and radio frequencies, in the 1 mm to 1 m wavelength range (300 MHz–300 GHz). This electromagnetic radiation is used to generate heat by the oscillation of molecules upon radiation absorption. Microwave-based pretreatment causes both thermal and non-thermal effects generated by an extensive intermolecular collision as a result of realignment of polar molecules with microwave oscillations [3]. Selectively heating polar parts of lignocellulosic biomass with microwave radiation can reduce the recalcitrance of complex biomass structure. On the other hand, disrupting the crystallinity and altering the compact and rigid biomass structure can be achieved in an electromagnetic field of microwaves [3]. Microwave treatment has enhanced the surface disruption and the breaking of lignin structures in switchgrass and improved enzymatic saccharification 53% more compared to conventional heating [4]. Microwave pretreatment was used for solubilization of lignocellulosic biomass in combination with acid and alkali treatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis [4–6]. Chimentão et al. (2014) investigated hydrolysis of dilute acid-pretreated cellulose in a conventional oven and under microwave heating [7]. Although the method was called “mild hydrothermal conditions”, the hydrolysis process was accelerated by using acids (sulfuric and oxalic acids). Thangavelu et al. (2014) used a one step process in hydrothermal conditions using a domestic microwave oven in which hydrolysis was accelerated by carbon dioxide, but it did not lead to complete solubilization of biomass [8]. On the other hand, use of subcritical water as hydrolysis medium under appropriate temperature and pressure conditions could be an effective method to solubilize microwave pretreated biomass without using any acid, base, enzyme or chemical catalysts. Applying microwave irradiation before hydrolysis in subcritical water could make the lignocellulosic biomass vulnerable to thermochemical solubilization. In previous studies, the maximum solubilization yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) biomass were 70–75% which was achieved in subcritical water medium at 250 °C and 27.58 MPa carbon dioxide pressure conditions [9,10]. However, the hydrolysates obtained in this process contained high molecular weight polysaccharides that were difficult to utilize for producing value-added products such as hydrogen. The diversity in the chemical composition and molecular weight distribution of lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates considerably affect the method employed for biofuel or useful chemicals production. The more degraded organics containing biomass hydrolysate showed better selectivity for hydrogen production by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) [11]. Using microwave pretreatment with subcritical water as a hydrolysis medium could be an effective method to solubilize biomass in an environmentally friendly way without use of any acid, base, enzyme or chemical catalysts. Subcritical water process that combined with innovative microwave irradiation pretreatment can be defined as ‘green treatment’ since it utilizes renewable biomass materials as feeds, uses water as solvent and eliminates the use and generation of hazardous substances in the treatment process [12,13]. Although many studies have been reported on microwave pretreatment for enhancing the enzymatic hydrolysis [14–17], there are no reports of solubilization of the microwave treated biomass samples in subcritical water and evaluation of the hydrolysates for gasification. The objectives of the present study are to 1) develop an effective solubilization method for lignocellulosic biomass using microwave pretreatment and subcritical water solubilization technologies, 2) evaluate solubilization performances of two non-edible biomass feedstocks, switchgrass and miscanthus, and 3) investigate the utilization of the hydrolysates for hydrogen biofuel production by APR. APR is compatible with water-soluble feedstocks such as hydrolysates produced in the present study and it produces less CO by-product due to facilitated water-gas shift reaction. This process has several advantages compared with steam reforming, such as gasification occurring at considerably lower temperatures (∼225 °C) [10]."
1,Experimental,
2,Biomass materials,"2.1 Biomass materials Switchgrass and miscanthus biomass materials used in this study were provided by USDA-ARS, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The Kanlow N1 switchgrass was harvested at anthesis and Miscanthus x giganteus was harvested after a killing frost. Harvested samples were dried in a forced-air oven at 50 °C to a constant weight and dhj ry weight determined. Biomass samples were ground through a 2-mm screen with a Wiley Mill (Thomas-Wiley Mill Co., Philadelphia, PA) then a subsample was ground through a UDY cyclone mill (UDY Corp., Ft. Collins, CO) with a 1-mm screen for analyses. The ground switchgrass and miscanthus contained 7.56 ± 0.68% and 3.24 ± 0.64% moisture, respectively. Biomass samples were analyzed by the USDA-ARS Forage Research Laboratory at Lincoln, NE. All ground samples were scanned on NIRSystems Model 6500 near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometer (NIRS; Foss NIRSystems Inc, Laurel, MD). The compositions of the biomass samples were predicted using the warm-season perennial grass equation with a global H value of 1.06. Hemicellulose, cellulose, and acid detergent lignin are reported on a dry matter (DM) basis and were corrected for ash (Table 1 ). All chemicals used in this study were either analytical or reagent grade."
3,Microwave pretreatment,"2.2 Microwave pretreatment MarsXpress microwave system (CEM Corporation) was used for microwave pretreatment of biomass. The system consisted of two magnetrons that can control the temperature of samples up to 300 °C. The system has no sensor for pressure. Ground biomass weighing 0.5 g and 12 cm3 distilled water were placed in a closed-teflon vessel. A total of 10 vessels were used in a turning carousel for each run. The pretreatment was applied for a range of temperatures (60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 210 °C) at 800 W. The 10 min ramp time was used to reach the target temperature and heating rate changed accordingly. The microwave system was held at constant temperature for 35 min. Some pretreatments were performed at 1600 W for comparison. After pretreatments were completed, the samples were cooled to room temperature and the liquid and solid fractions were separated by filtration. Microwave treated samples were examined by Hitachi S4700 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX-I infrared spectroscopy for morphological changes in the biomass structures."
4,Hydrolysis in subcritical water,"2.3 Hydrolysis in subcritical water Microwave pretreated dry solid biomass samples were subjected to subcritical water treatment for solubilization. The experiments were performed using 5 g ground biomass material and 350 cm3 water in a 500 cm3 stainless steel high pressure reactor (Parr Model 4575 HP/HT, Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL, USA) equipped with magnetic drive stirrer and temperature controller system. The mixture was heated with a rate of 4.7 °C min−1 until it reached desired temperature, 220 °C. Then, the reactor was pressurized with CO2 using ISCO 260D pump (Isco Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) to 25.51 MPa. The contents of the reactor were mixed at 500 rpm via the magne-drive for 120 min. In the next step, the reactor was taken out of the heating system and quenched in ice-cold water. The hydrolysate solution was collected and filtered through 0.2 μm nylon filter and clear solution was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) using a Tekmar Dohrmann Apollo 9000 instrument. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by Microsoft excel by applying one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at significance level of 5% (P = 0.05), and significant differences among means were defined by using the Student t-test."
5,Hydrogen production from hydrolysates,"2.4 Hydrogen production from hydrolysates The biomass hydrolysates were evaluated for hydrogen production by APR gasification technique using carbon supported Pt catalyst (Alfa Aesar GmbH &Co KG, Karlsruhe, Germany). The 50 cm3 of switchgrass or miscanthus hydrolysate was gasified in presence of 0.12 g catalyst (5% Pt on activated carbon) in a Parr 4590 model 100 cm3 stainless steel micro bench reactor equipped with magnetic drive stirrer and a temperature controller system (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). Duration of the gasification process was 2 h at 250 °C. Gaseous products were collected into a gas buret filled with water and volume of the gas mixture measured by water displacement. Gas products were characterized using a dual-channel gas chromatograph (GC) system equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (Varian-450 GC, Varian Inc., Netherlands). One channel was used with argon carrier to analyze hydrogen in good sensitivity and the second one with helium carrier for detection of other gases (CO, CO2, alkanes etc). The 250 mm3 gas sample was injected into GC through helium carrier gas channel (1:3 split injection). The detailed information about gasification experiments and gas analysis has been described elsewhere [10]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of microwave pretreatment on the morphological structure of biomass,"3.1 Effect of microwave pretreatment on the morphological structure of biomass The changes in the morphological structures of miscanthus and switchgrass biomass were examined by scanning electron microscope and infrared spectroscopy. As can be seen in the SEM images in Fig. 1 , at a pretreatment temperature of 60 °C at 800 W for miscanthus, waxy agglomerated topographical surface, which is common for lignocellulosic materials, still existed; however, it was removed after treatment power was increased to 1600 W. The removal of the smooth surface indicates the beginning of disintegration. Although they are both perennial grasses, switchgrass was more resistant to disintegration than miscanthus. Miscanthus started to decompose thermally after 120 °C under 800 W, but the waxy surface of switchgrass was not removed even at 120 °C/800 W. However, the smooth surface of switchgrass was partially removed at 120 °C when higher power microwave treatment was applied (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the effect of temperature on switchgrass morphology. Microwave interaction with biomass at higher microwave processing temperature accelerated reducing the recalcitrance of the lignocellulosic materials. After the waxy layer was removed from the rigid surface, the compacted layer was partially deconstructed at 150 °C and porosity of the surface increased at higher temperature (180 °C). When pretreatment temperature was 210 °C, lignin degradation was observed. A range of discrete droplets seen in Fig. 2 indicates formation of lignin deposits on the biomass surface [9]. Infrared spectra of the biomass samples showed some changes in the intensity and appearance of certain bands after microwave treatment that indicates the delignification of the biomass structures (Fig. 3 ). The band at 3300-3400 cm−1 is attributed to the hydrogen bonded O-H stretching absorption. The C-H stretching absorption is around 2900 cm−1. The band at 1735 cm−1 is related to carbonyl stretching in hemicellulose structure [18]. The changes in this band indicate cleavage of ester bonds from hemicelluloses [18,19]. The C-O stretching can be seen around 1000 cm−1. The increased C-O stretching after microwave treatment suggests formation of new -OH and ester containing structures by cleavage of the rigid biomass structure."
8,Solubilization of microwave treated biomass materials in subcritical water,"3.2 Solubilization of microwave treated biomass materials in subcritical water The hydrolysis percentage and total organic carbon released into solution after solubilization of microwave treated biomass samples in subcritical water are given in Table 2 . The hydrolysis and TOC values of both biomass materials were significantly different from each other. It is clear that microwave treatment enhanced the breakdown processes of these two biomass materials in subcritical water. Hydrolysis efficiency increased as the microwave processing temperature was increased. Since microwave selectively heats more polar parts of the structures [3], it was very effective to reduce recalcitrant structures of lignocellulose which are rich in oxygenated polar functional groups. The ester linkage between polysaccharides and lignin were cleaved by microwave [20], leading to partial degradation of rigid biomass structure (Fig. 3). This caused easy access for subcritical water molecules and enhanced the solubilization of biomass materials by breaking intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in their structures. Since miscanthus biomass decomposed after 120 °C microwave treatment, solubilization in subcritical water was applied only for lower temperature microwave treated samples (60 and 80 °C). On the other hand, switchgrass had more rigid structure than miscanthus; therefore, effective solubilization for switchgrass in subcritical water was achieved after higher temperatures (120 and 150 °C) microwave pretreatment was applied."
9,Microwave energy consumed by biomass samples during the pretreatment,"3.3 Microwave energy consumed by biomass samples during the pretreatment The microwave energy consumed by biomass sample can be estimated from the temperature increase of the sample during microwave heating. The specific heat capacity (Cp) of miscanthus and switchgrass were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and did not change considerably during the measurement temperature range of 20–150 °C. The average specific heat capacity of miscanthus and switchgrass were 2.71 and 3.44 kJ kg−1 K−1, respectively. The microwave energy consumed by biomass was calculated using following equation: (1) Q = m ∗ C p ∗ Δ T where m is the mass of biomass used in the microwave system. The ΔT is the change in temperature when sample heated from room temperature to microwave pretreatment temperature. The energy in joules was divided by the time period t in seconds (s) to convert to power in watt (W). Microwave energy introduced into system (800 W) was consumed by biomass and water mixture and the remaining was reflected in the system. Although most of microwave energy consumed by water, it was not possible to calculate that portion of energy because the amount of water evaporated during the microwave heating was not known. The energy absorbed by miscanthus and switchgrass were calculated as described above and the results were given in Table 3 . The results showed that switchgrass biomass consumed more microwave energy during the pretreatment compared to miscanthus. Only 0.03% of the total microwave energy was absorbed by miscanthus biomass during the 60 °C pretreatment that resulted in 57% hydrolysis in subcritical water. On the other hand, switchgrass absorbed 0.10% of initial microwave energy during the 120 °C pretreatment process to achieve same hydrolysis yield in subcritical water."
10,Hydrogen production from hydrolysates,"3.4 Hydrogen production from hydrolysates Microwave pretreated miscanthus and switchgrass biomass was hydrolyzed in subcritical water and the hydrolysates were used to produce hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming in presence of Pt on carbon catalyst. The gas mixtures produced were composed of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 with minor amount of C2H4 and C2H6 gases for both types of biomass hydrolysates (Table 4 ). However, the gas volume and percentage of the gases in the mixtures were different. Miscanthus was better suited for the APR process than switchgrass. Gasification of untreated miscanthus produced the highest gas volume with high hydrogen selectivity (Table 4). Although destruction of lignin fraction is important to release the carbohydrate into solution, this fraction of the lignocellulosic biomass was not reactive in APR to produce hydrogen rich gas mixture [21]. Carbohydrate content is the most important trait for gasification of biomass to produce gaseous products. Miscanthus having higher TOC produced more gaseous products in APR process that indicated TOC content of the hydrolysate mostly belong to carbohydrates rather than lignin compounds. In addition, as mentioned above miscanthus was more vulnerable to destruction, therefore; the carbohydrates in these biomass hydrolysates were easily breakdown into lower molecular weight oxygenated compounds followed by conversion to gaseous products compared to switchgrass. Microwave pretreatment negatively affected the gasification of both biomass materials, likely due to the formation of some water insoluble structures during the gasification process which were unable to gasify. These insoluble particles can be easily seen in the solution after APR process but quantification could not be performed since the solution contained catalyst at the same time. Cleavage of C-C and C-O bonds during liquid-phase reforming process led to a decrease in TOC value of hydrolysates [21]. Therefore, comparison of TOC content of the hydrolysates before and after gasification process would be an indication for consumption and conversion of feeds into gaseous products. The TOC analysis of the feeds that were not gasified after APR showed significant decreases in TOC values. Formations of carbon containing gaseous products such as CO, CO2, CH4 etc. and solid carbon residues that were unable to gasify during the process caused decreases in TOC. The amounts of carbons consumed in the process and left in solid carbon residue can be calculated as given below: Initial total organic carbon in 50 cm3 hydrolysate (for untreated miscanthus): (2) 1350 mg 1000 cm 3 ∗ 50 cm 3 = 67.5 mg C Total organic carbon in 50 cm3 hydrolysate after gasification: (3) 0.050 ∗ 852 = 42.6 mg C Carbon consumed in gasification process: (4) 67.5 − 42.6 = 24.9 mg C The mole of total gas produced: (5) n = PV RT = ( 101.325 ) ( 94 x 10 − 6 ) ( 8.314 ) * ( 300 ) = 0.0038 mol Total gas mixture was composed of 24.7% CO2, 0.3%CO, 5.4% CH4, 0.1% C2H6 and 0.1% C2H4 (Table 4): (6) 0 . 0038 ∗ 24.7 100 = 9 . 4 x 10 - 4 mol CO 2 (7) 9 . 4 x 10 - 4 mol CO 2 ∗ 1 mol C 1 mol CO 2 ∗ 12 g 1 mol C * 1000 g 1 g = 11 . 26 mg C ( in CO 2 ) The amounts of carbons in CO, CH4, C2H6 and C2H4 were calculated in same way and found to be 0.14 mg, 2.46 mg, 0.09 and 0.09 mg, respectively. The amount of CO2 dissolved in water (during gas volume measurement by water displacement technique using a buret) was found to be 34.01 mg L−1 [21]. Therefore, amount of carbon in CO2 dissolved in water can be calculated as follows: (8) 94 ∗ 34.01 1000 = 3.20 mg CO 2 ( amount of CO 2 dissolved in water ) (9) 4.13 ∗ 12 44 = 0.87 mg C amount of carbon in CO 2 dissolved in water Thus, total amount of carbons in gaseous products (amount of carbons gasified in the APR process) is: 11.26 + 0.14 + 11.26 + 2.46 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 14.91 mg C Therefore; (10) 24.9 - 14.91 = 9.99 mg C residue left without being gasified . Table 5 shows all values calculated in same way for untreated and microwave pretreated biomass samples. The results showed that when initial biomass hydrolysate was more concentrated in TOC, the solid carbon residue left after APR was higher (Tables 2 and 5). Microwave pretreatment caused significant increases in the formation of ungasified solid carbon residue in APR process. Untreated miscanthus biomass produced highest amount of carbon containing gaseous products and left small amount of carbon residue (Table 5). This study is a preliminary step toward using microwave treated biomass hydrolysates in gasification. Our current research focuses on increasing gasification performance of microwave treated feedstocks by using a catalyst containing metal(s) that has strong C-C bond breaking ability along with Pt metal which activates the formation of hydrogen gas during APR. The new metal(s) deposited on the support could lead to a breakdown of the oxygenated biomass (insoluble polysaccharides or agglomerated structures) compounds into smaller components. This could also prevent the formation of insoluble structures while gasification takes place in the same media. However, organic carbon rich hydrolysates prepared in this study can be still promising for producing a wide range of value-added products, including biofuels (ethanol), industrially important chemicals (e.g., furfural, solvents and carbonous materials, etc.), and food products (sugar and sugar alcohols, etc.). It is also possible to optimize the microwave pretreatment combined subcritical water process on a pilot scale to produce large amount of hydrolysates which are rich in biomass-derived oxygenated compounds to be used for production of value-added products. The pilot scale studies can prove the feasibility and potential value of the process in industrial applications [22]."
11,Conclusion,"The results demonstrate that microwave pretreatment is an effective method to reduce the recalcitrance of miscanthus and switchgrass lignocellulosic biomass. Higher microwave processing temperature and power accelerated the destruction. The microwave pretreatment allowed easy access for subcritical water molecules and enhanced the solubilization of biomass. Miscanthus was more sensitive to destruction by microwave treatment; therefore, its recalcitrance was easily reduced at lower microwave pretreatment temperatures. Miscanthus started to decompose thermally after 120 °C and higher temperatures microwave treatment. Microwave pretreatment negatively affected the gasification of both switchgrass and miscanthus, and needs to be further investigated. However, because of the high hydrolysis yield and high TOC content, the hydrolysates prepared in this study can be used more efficiently production of biofuels or other bioproducts."
