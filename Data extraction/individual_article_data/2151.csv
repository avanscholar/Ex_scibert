0,Introduction,"Vesicles are self-assembled nanostructures formed by dilute mixtures of surfactants in water. They are usually spherical and can experience either monolayer or multilayer architectures and they can be of spontaneous [1–3] or non-spontaneously formation [4]. The advantage of using such nanocompartments in several applications is their elegant ability of compartmentalizing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. Modern directions of green chemistry include the use of sugar-based surfactants as the main constituent of nanocompartments such as vesicles. Sorbitan esters (Spans) are one of the main classes of sugar-based surfactants [5]. These non-ionic surfactants possess both the common environmental characteristics of other sugar-based surfactants - in particular their high biodegradability, bioavailability and non-toxicity - and unique advantages as emulsifier agents [6,7]. These properties have increased the application of Spans in different industrial fields such as foods. Spans are molecules with high lipophilic character showing hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values between 1 and 9 [8]. Their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character is directly influenced by the Span's esterification degree: high esterification degrees lead to low HLB values and poor water solubility. Therefore, Spans can be insoluble or slightly soluble in water, depending on their HLB value, and can be used as emulsifiers both in W/O (water/oil) emulsions and (as co-surfactants) in some O/W emulsions [8–13]. However, the architecture of most Spans renders the formation of vesicles difficult, mostly because of their frequently high critical packing parameter. Since vesicles are desired for many controlled release applications, different methods of preparation have been tested and implemented. One of the most intriguing technique described in the literature is the ethanol injection method, developed in 1973 by Batzri and Korn, who produced, for the first time and without sonication, liposomes using the ethanol injection method [14]. In this method, surfactant molecules are solubilized in ethanol and the mixture is then quickly injected in water, leading to the mixture of both phases and the spontaneous self-assembly of the surfactant molecules, with formation of bilayers [14,15]. The alcohol injection method (AIM) is nowadays one of the most used methods to prepare vesicles, as it is a rapid and simple process, facilitating the formation of small vesicles simply by injecting an alcoholic solution in water, followed by the evaporation of the alcohol. It is a reproducible process, inexpensive, nontoxic, and it does not involve forces that can break the vesicles or encapsulated molecules [4,16–21]. The vesicle size depends on the variables considered when applying the injection method, such as injection velocity, alcohol and surfactant concentrations, stirring rate, and temperature at the injection moment [4,17]. The alcohol injection method is not restricted to ethanol, but instead other alcohols can be used. Alcohols are known modulators of the vesicle bilayer properties and induce structural effects on vesicle membranes [17,22,23]. Although the AIM is well accepted among researchers, some open questions are, to the best of our knowledge, still unanswered in the literature. In this paper we aim to understand the role of the AIM in the formation of vesicles composed of water insoluble surfactants, as well as to understand if the role of the alcohol is merely of a “catalyst” of the vesicle formation or if it actively integrates the final structure. These open considerations are investigated by applying the AIM to produce vesicles of various Spans, using methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol as test alcohols. NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the presence of the alcohol molecules in the bilayer as well as the influence of the alcohol's alkyl chain length on its structure."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sorbitan esters 20, 40, 60, 65, 80 and 85, shown in Fig. 1 , were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, Brazil) and used without any further purification. For the injection method, methanol (purity 99,8%), ethanol (purity 95,0%) and 2-propanol (purity 99,5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Portugal), and water of Millipore® quality was used."
3,Production of span vesicles by the AIM,"2.2 Production of span vesicles by the AIM The AIM was used for the preparation of Span vesicles following the general procedure reported in the literature [14]. Span 20, 40, 60, 65, 80 and 85 vesicles were produced in the concentration range of 10 mM and diluted to concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 mM. Three alcohols with different chain lengths - methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol - were used as solubilization media for the Spans. The Span methanolic, ethanolic and propanolic solutions were injected into ultrapure water above the boiling temperatures of the alcohols (67 °C, 80 °C and 85 °C for the methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol solutions, respectively). The solutions were stirred at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The pH of all solutions obtained by alcohol injection method was measured and verified to be neutral."
4,1H NMR,"2.3 1H NMR 1H NMR spectra were obtained in a Bruker Avance III spectrometer, operating at 400 MHz. Deuterated water (D2O) was added to the vesicles solutions, in a percentage ratio of 10%:90%, respectively, with 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) as reference. 1H NMR chemical shift changes of ethanol were evaluated after 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min of stirring at 75 °C."
5,Aggregate size measurements,"2.4 Aggregate size measurements Vesicle size was evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a Malvern Zetasizer from Malvern Instruments Ltd., equipped with a 633 nm laser as light source. The detector angle relative to the laser was 173°, and all the measurements were taken in triplicate at 25 °C. The vesicles size distribution (in nm) was determined and the mean and standard deviation of the 3 measurements were calculated for all the dispersions obtained by the AIM, after 5 min of stirring. The solutions obtained by the alcohol injection method were analyzed after 240 min of stirring (above the boiling temperature of each alcohol) to monitor the dependence of the vesicle size on the stirring time."
6,Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM),"2.5 Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) Vesicles images of selected systems were obtained in a transmission electronic microscopic TEM Hitachi HT – 7700, with a tungsten filament with acceleration voltage of 100 kV, in high resolution, equipped with a dispersive energy spectrometer XFLASH detector, 5030 model from Bruker with 133 eV resolution. Sample drops were added to a form-coated copper grid and allowed to dry at room temperature before analyzed in the microscope."
7,Results and discussion,The evaluation of the presence of alcohol molecules in the Span vesicle formed by the injection method is described in this section. The results obtained by DLS and 1H NMR show interesting features that allow one to understand the role of the alcohols in vesicle preparation.
8,Vesicle micrographs by TEM,"3.1 Vesicle micrographs by TEM Selected Span systems (a 1 chain Span - Span 40 – and a 3 chains Span - Span 65) were chosen among all the Span molecules due to their representative architecture regarding the length and the number of chains. TEM images of the two systems, at 1 mM, either obtained by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol injection method, are illustrated in Fig. 2 . From the analysis of the Fig. 2, we conclude that AIM stabilizes vesicular structures, even with water-insoluble surfactants such as Span 40 and Span 65. Sugar based vesicles are present and show diameters within the range of 100–700 μm. The samples show moderate polydispersity, nonetheless the sizes of the vesicles measured by TEM are in agreement with the sizes obtained by DLS, as shown in the next section."
9,Vesicle size by DLS,"3.2 Vesicle size by DLS Fig. 3 shows the effects of Span concentration on the size of the Span vesicles, obtained by the methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol injection methods. Through the analysis of Fig. 3, the influence of the different types of alcohols in vesicles size is clear: alcohols with longer chains lead to larger aggregates, while alcohols with shorter chains lead to smaller aggregates. Dalton et al., and Huang et al., proved that the addition of ethanol deteriorates the molecular order of the bilayers, although a small amount (6–7%) will induce their interdigitation and help the process of vesicle formation [17,23]. The relation between the alcohol chain length and the size of the formed vesicles may be related to the fact that some non-negligible amount of alcohol remains in the mixtures after the standard evaporation procedure. Alcohol stabilizes the vesicle dispersion and there should be a greater penetration of the shorter alcohols in the surfactant polar group, causing a more pronounced increment of the hydrophilic segment of the Span, and a decrease of the critical packing parameter and, therefore, yielding a higher curvature and a smaller aggregate size. The concentration of Span slightly affects the vesicle size. Even though there is no linear dependence at low concentrations, the aggregate size increases upon the addition of higher amounts of surfactant. This could be explained by the formation of larger multilamellar vesicles (MLV). This is supported, for instance, by Huang et al. and Lasic [4,17] who reported that the use of injection methods generates MLV. The dependence of the size of the AIM vesicles on the stirring time at 75 °C is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 shows that, after stirring for 240 min (6 h) at 75 °C, the size of the Span vesicles decreases slightly. This can be explained by the higher solubility of sorbitan in water than in ethanol. The Span headgroups (sorbitan) loses their direct contact with ethanol molecules, while the ethanol present in the layer adjacent to the vesicles is progressively evaporated at 75 °C. The higher solubility of the sorbitan in water leads to a larger volume occupied by the Span headgroup in the absence of ethanol. Therefore, the critical packing parameter of the Span increases and lower sizes may be observed. There should be, however, a fraction of ethanol molecules that resists to the evaporation and are still present inside the bilayer, due to their higher boiling point. Alcohols with short chain lengths, like methanol or ethanol should display less ability to disturb the vesicle bilayers, as supported by other authors [22,23]. Alcohols have their hydroxyl group in the interfacial region of the bilayer, while their hydrophobic groups are located inside the hydrophobic nucleus of the bilayer, thus affecting the packaging of the surfactant chains, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5 . Each additional CH2 group in the alcohol chain increases the partition coefficient of the alcohol inside the bilayer, as described elsewhere [22]. Patra et al. used computational simulations to clarify the behavior of selected alcohols in bilayers. They concluded that, besides the tendency of the alcohols to be located inside the bilayer, short chain alcohols such as ethanol are located near the oxygen of the ester bond of the surfactants and that most of the alcohol molecules participate in hydrogen bonds with the surfactants [24]. This model is of crucial relevance to understand the behavior of the present surfactant system. Alcohols with a longer chain possess higher affinity to the surfactants hydrophobic segments and thus will be preferentially located inside the bilayer. This aspect has a tremendous impact on vesicle architecture. Although the AIM involves an evaporation step, the complete solubilization of the Span molecules in water supports the idea that the alcohols are integrating the vesicle structure, with ethanol and 2-propanol having greater tendency to be located within the bilayer, when compared to methanol. The increase of the vesicle sizes with the chain length of the alcohol molecules is then explained by a more pronounced penetration degree of the larger chains in the bilayer."
10,1H NMR studies of span vesicles obtained by the ethanol injection method,"3.3 1H NMR studies of span vesicles obtained by the ethanol injection method The formation of the Span vesicles upon using the alcohol injection method (even their stabilization after the alcohol evaporation step), could be explained by the presence of some alcohol molecules around the surfactant headgroups. To verify this hypothesis, the presence of alcohol molecules was evaluated by the changes in the chemical shifts of the ethanol signals in 1H NMR results Fig. 6 shows the influence of the stirring time, at 75 °C, on the 1H NMR spectra of the Span nanostructures, obtained by ethanol injection method. Based on the analysis of Fig. 6, it can be verified that the intensity of the ethanol peaks in solution clearly decreases with the stirring time. The data shows that after stirring for 5 min at 75 °C, a large amount of ethanol still remains in the dispersions. Major evaporation of ethanol requires a minimum of 180 min stirring at 75 °C. However, ethanol is still detected even after 240 min (4 h). This is in agreement with the hypothesis that predicts the alcohol molecule as a vesicle stabilizer. For a clear visualization of the changes in the intensity of the NMR peaks of ethanol with stirring time, we plotted the intensity values of each peak of the observed multiplet of the ethanol spectra in D2O, for each Span molecule, as shown in Fig. 7 . The representation of the chemical shifts from each peak of the triplet from ethanol spectra, is shown in the supporting information, Fig. A. Based on the results depicted in Fig. 7, it can be observed that the multiplet chemical shifts characteristic of ethanol molecules are sensitive to the stirring time at 75 °C (the same effect was verified for the triplet, see Supporting information). After stirring for 5 min at 75 °C, the chemical shifts of ethanol for all the Span dispersions are the same the chemical shifts pure ethanol. This supports the role of the alcohol in the Span vesicle formation when using AIM. Ethanol molecules are still present in the dispersion after the 5 min stirring timepoint. The peaks corresponding to the surfactant molecules can be detected at a higher resolution of the 1H NMR spectrum, as shown in Fig. 8 . By increasing the stirring time, and maintaining the temperature at 75 °C, the ethanol molecules start to evaporate, and their concentration in the solution gradually decreases. Within the time range of 180–240 min of continuous stirring it can be concluded that most of the ethanol in the dispersions is evaporated. Chemical shifts of the peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the ethanol multiplet are 3.685, 3.668, 3.650 and 3.632 ppm, respectively. They are in line with the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the ethanol-Span-water dispersions, after stirring for 5 min at 75 °C, as reported above. However, longer stirring times lead to visible changes in the chemical shifts. As the ethanol present in the bulk evaporates, the signal of the ethanol present in the vicinity of the surfactant headgroups becomes more visible and thus the ethanol peaks appear at slightly higher chemical shifts. The hydroxyl group from ethanol that solvates the surfactant molecules might couple with the hydroxyl group of the surfactant through hydrogen bonds affecting the methylene protons and thus explaining their higher chemical shifts. On the other hand, the protons from the triplet signal (see Supporting information) corresponding to the methyl group of ethanol are not substantially affected by the neighboring atoms as they are only sensitive to the presence of the methylene protons. This study allowed one to understand Span vesicle formation via AIM. The hydroxyl groups of the alcohols are interacting with the hydroxyl groups of the surfactant headgroups, through hydrogen bonds. Additionally, it was shown that the vesicle size can be controlled by the alcohol chain length; i.e., depending on the alcohol chain length, the alcohol can be located either inside or outside the bilayer which, in turn, has a crucial impact on the vesicle curvature, size and stability."
11,Conclusions,"Span molecules are one of the most important class of sugar-based surfactants which have been used mainly in W/O emulsions. Due to their water insolubility the use of this class of sugar surfactants has been very limited in aqueous systems. To overcome this limitation, the AIM was applied to easily produce aqueous dispersions of Span vesicles. The AIM is one of the most used methods to produce vesicles. One of the most important advantage of this method is the production of vesicles from water insoluble amphiphiles, once these molecules are previously solubilized in an organic solvent. Span 20, 40, 60, 65, 80 and 85, were solubilized in three different alcohols (methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol), to evaluate the influence of the alcohol chain length on the vesicle size. DLS analysis allowed to conclude that the alcohol chain length clearly affects the vesicle size. Alcohols with longer chain lengths lead to the formation of larger aggregates as they can penetrate deeper in the layer thus creating a larger space between the tail of the Spans which would otherwise be more tightly packed. This evidence was supported by 1H NMR studies of the Span vesicles dispersions, obtained by the ethanol injection method, demonstrating that ethanol molecules are still present after the stirring process at 75 °C, although at low amounts, as the heated stirring step evaporates mainly the ethanol molecules in the aqueous bulk, but not the alcohol molecules already present in the vesicle structure. The chemical shifts in the ethanol spectra suggest that the non-evaporated ethanol molecules are interacting with the hydroxyl groups of the surfactant's polar groups. The results show that the size of the sugar based biodegradable Span vesicles can be easily controlled by using appropriate alcohol chain lengths in the AIM. This could give room to a wider use of such encapsulators in aqueous applications that require green surfactants, as foods, pharmaceutical or cleaning agents."
