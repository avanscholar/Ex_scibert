0,Introduction,"Supported Pd-based composite membranes possess many attractive properties such as high and exclusive hydrogen permeability, high thermal stability, moderate chemical resistance and mechanical strength, making them one of the most applicable candidates for the selective removal of hydrogen [1,2]. This offers unique opportunities to achieve dehydrogenative (oxidative) organic transformations which are otherwise impossible under the conventional reaction conditions. For example, we have previously demonstrated an environmentally friendly method of producing ethyl acetate from ethanol in a quantitative conversion and yield using an ultrathin Pd-Ag/ceramic membrane reactor. Since such a reaction can only be carried out at a reaction temperature higher than the boiling point of the reactant (ethanol 78°C) and therefore, the produced hydrogen needs to be removed from the reaction system to overcome chemical equilibrium and also to avoid pressure build-up. The selective removal of hydrogen by an ultrathin Pd-Ag membrane reactor was demonstrated to be a viable solution [3]. From the previous studies we also noticed that the reaction rate of dehydrogenative reactions is typically slow, presumably because of the relatively low reaction temperature. Therefore, a relatively long reaction time (typically in several hours) is required in order to achieve high conversion rate, but this also imposes a high requirement in membrane selectivity since otherwise the material loss during the reaction will be substantial. A membrane selectivity over 2000 for H2/N2 was used in our previous studies as a good indicator of membrane quality [3]. Such a high selectivity requirement can be easily achieved by Pd-Ag membranes fabricated through a silver concentration-controlled co-plating method, but it is very challenging for other hydrogen selective membranes, such as polymer, silica, zeolite or carbon molecular sieve membranes [4]. The main disadvantage of the Pd-Ag membrane is its high material cost, but this can be well justified by the high value-added products. Herein, we report the efficient synthesis of amides via catalytic dehydrogenative coupling of volatile alcohols and amines, and ureas using methanol as a non-toxic carbonyl source in an ultrathin Pd-Ag ceramic membrane reactor. The amide linkage is a common and very important functional group which contributes to the special properties of peptides, proteins, beta-lactam antibiotics, and numerous synthetic polymers [5]. Traditional methods of preparing amides mainly involve the use of activated acid derivatives (including acid chlorides and anhydrides). These processes usually require a stoichiometric amount of activating reagents, produce large amounts of chemical waste, and involve tedious procedures for separation [6]. The development of atom economic reactions is an important aspect of green chemistry, which aims in the elimination or minimization of pollution caused by unwanted side-products. The direct synthesis of amides from alcohols with amines by extrusion of hydrogen to construct amide bonds has recently been reported [7–17]. This environmentally friendly approach does not require the use of stoichiometric amounts of oxidants, and hydrogen is produced as an additional value-generating product. The Milstein catalyst, carbonylhydrido [6-(di-t-butylphosphinomethylene)−`2-(N,N-diethyl- aminomethyl) 1,6-dihydropyridine] ruthenium ( Fig. 1, complex II), via aromatization- dearomatization of the central pyridine ring, has shown significant catalytic activities towards the direct synthesis of amides from alcohols and amines [7]. In the presence of the Milstein catalyst, a wide range of amides have been obtained through the dehydrogenative acylation of amines with alcohols, with the extension of the application for the synthesis of bis-amides and polyamides. However, high reaction temperatures are normally required in order to achieve good chemical yields. The utilization of these reactions to alcohols and amines with lower boiling points, such as methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol, still remains a challenge. Urea derivatives are important biologically active compounds, which are frequently used in a variety of areas such as pharmaceuticals, chemical dyes, and agricultural pesticides [18]. These compounds are commonly synthesized using highly toxic phosgene or phosgene derivatives, such as carbodiimidazole (CDI), tri-phosgene or S, S-dimethyl dithiocarbonate (DMDTC) [19]. Amines can also be oxidatively carbonylated with carbon monoxide in the presence of transition metal catalysts [20–24]. However, aside from the toxicity of CO, there exists the risk of explosions due to the usage of high pressures of CO. An alternative route of synthesizing urea derivatives is the direct reaction of amines with carbon dioxide [25,26], but in general this method requires harsh reaction conditions (around 200°C, PCO2>6MPa), or the presence of stoichiometric amounts of bases such as NEt3, or DBU [27]. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an environmentally benign and mild reaction for the construction of ureas. Methanol, the simplest alcohol with an annual output of more than 40 million tons, has found widespread applications [28,29]. It processes a high hydrogen to carbon ratio and carries 12.5wt% of hydrogen. The production of hydrogen from methanol has received attention due to several advantages as compared to other fuels. For example, methanol is biodegradable and is liquid at atmospheric conditions, which makes it easy to manipulate. In addition, the reforming temperatures is low (200–300°C) [30], which is much lower than that of other common fuels such as methane (>500°C) and ethanol (ca. 400°C) [25,31]. For the dehydrogenation of methanol, there is a parallel side-reaction of the decomposition of methanol to CO. At 200°C the equilibrium constant for the formation of formaldehyde is 3.4×10−2, while the equilibrium constant for the decomposition of methanol to CO is 2.6×10 [32]. While the complete dehydrogenation of methanol is favoured at equilibrium, formaldehyde may combine with one molecule of amine to form a formamide, with the liberation of one molecule of H2. The formyl carbonyl will provide another position for the combination of one more amine. This will allow the direct synthesis of ureas from methanol and amines with a suitable catalytic system, utilizing methanol as a carbonyl source."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Silver nitrate (AgNO3), palladium chloride (PdCl2), palladium sulfate (PdSO4), and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (Na2EDTA), ammonia (NH4OH, 28–30% NH3), [2-(Di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)−6 (diethylaminomethyl) pyridine] carbonyl chlorohydrido ruthenium (II) (Milstein catalyst I, precursor of Melstain Catalyst II), potassium tert-butoxide (KO t Bu), methanol (MOH), 1-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2), butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2), hexylamine (CH3(CH2)5NH2), benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2), ethylenediamine (NH2CH2CH2NH2), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) were all received from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The purity of N2, H2 and NH3 is 99.999%. The water used in all reactions was obtained by filtering through a Millipore system. Asymmetric porous alumina tubular supports were supplied by Inopor Co. The inner and outer diameters and the length of the tubes are 7, 10 and 35mm, respectively, and the nominal pore size of the surface layer is ~100nm."
3,Preparation of Pd-Ag/ceramic membrane,"2.2 Preparation of Pd-Ag/ceramic membrane The Pd-Ag/ceramic membranes were prepared by the Ag-controlled electroless co-plating of Pd and Ag [3,33]. Before plating the supports were cleaned sequentially by ethanol, 4% aqueous KOH solution and deionized water and well Pd seeding activated [34]. In a typical process, 60mLPd bath was loaded into a glass container and 15mL Ag bath in a syringe. The Pd bath contain 3.9mmol/L PdCl2, 5.0mol/L NH4OH and 0.12mol/L Na2EDTA dissolved in deionized water, and the Ag bath contain 5.1mmol/L AgNO3, 5.0mol/L NH4OH, and 0.12mol/L Na2EDTA mixed in deionized water. To achieve a defect-free membrane, the plating process was conducted twice. After the first plating, the membrane was washed, dried and then annealed 10h at 500°C in H2. Then the membrane was seeded again before the second co-plating. The final Pd-Ag membrane was heat-treated at 500°C in H2 for 36h before used for reaction."
4,Reactions in the membrane reactor,"2.3 Reactions in the membrane reactor The design of the membrane reactor was previously described [3]. The tubular membrane was mounted in a custom-designed cylinder cell and sealed by graphite gasket O-rings at both ends. The space between the shell side of the membrane and the cylinder cell, which is about 2mL, is used as the reaction chamber. The membrane surface area is approximately 6cm2. The cylinder cell was placed inside a vertical furnace with programmable temperature controller. The reaction temperature was fixed on 140–180°C for different reactions. In a typical reaction, methanol (1.25–5mmol), amine (5mmol), Milstein catalyst I (0.005mmol), KO t Bu (0.005mmol) and solvent (1mL, toluene/NMP/dioxane) mixture was loaded into the chamber of reactor under an argon atmosphere. The reaction was then monitored until completion. The actual feed side pressure was monitored and recorded every 20s with a pressure sensor on real-time at the retentate exit of the reactor. The liberated hydrogen in the permeance side of membrane was swept by constant flow rate Argon and the gas mixture was sequenced analyzed by an on-line GC (Agilent 7890A with PLOT/Q column) per 4min. The Pd-Ag membrane was washed with acetone and methanol several times and then dried at 100°C after each reaction. The leakage of membrane with 8bar N2 was checked by soap bubble meter (range 0–10mL) before each reaction. For comparison purpose, the above reaction was also conducted in a closed autoclave. The maximum pressure that might generate from the released hydrogen is about 35bar."
5,Product analysis,2.4 Product analysis NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker AVIII 400 or AVIII 500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts in 1H NMR were reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane. GC–MS spectra of final product were obtained on an Agilent 5975C with an HP-5 MS column.
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pd-Ag membrane properties and quality test,"3.1 Pd-Ag membrane properties and quality test The Pd-Ag membrane contains about 25wt% silver uniformly distributed along the entire membrane. It is reported that the Pd-Ag membrane at this composition has the best chemical and mechanical stability [35]. The membrane thickness is about 5µm. the H2 flux of the fresh membrane under ΔP=100kPa were 0.28 and 0.47mol/m2 s at 150°C and 350°C, respectively. Because the total amount of reaction solution loaded into the membrane reactor is about 2mL and the reaction lasts typically for more than 5h, so the membrane must be very compact to avoid notable material loss during the reaction. Nitrogen leakage test was used to monitor the membrane quality. The nitrogen leakage rate under 8bar less than 1mL/min measured by a soap bubble meter, which is equivalent to a H2/N2 selectivity of 2000, was used as a guideline for a direct-free membrane. The membrane reactor can be easily changed to a gas permeation cell without taking the membrane out. So this leakage test can be performed conveniently before each batch of reaction."
8,Acylation of amines with alcohols,"3.2 Acylation of amines with alcohols The H2 permeability of the membrane in our design ensures the capability of the Pd-Ag membrane in fully removing the produced hydrogen during the course of the reaction. Initial experiments were conducted using ethanol and 1-butylamine as the substrate under a variety of reaction conditions. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 1. The reaction proceeds smoothly in the presence of a base. Toluene was found to be the best solvent compared to 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, affording the N-butylacetamide in 61% yield at 160°C in 5h (Table 1, entry 3). Increasing the reaction temperature to 180°C did not improve the yield, leading to a messy reaction, presumably due to the decomposition of the catalyst at high temperatures (Table 1, entry 4). Prolonging the reaction time to 24h led to no observable improvement to the reaction outcome (Table 1, entry 5), while lowering the reaction temperature to 140°C gave a cleaner reaction with a slightly higher yield of 70% (Table 1, entry 6). As a comparison, all the reactions in Table 1 have less than 10% yield when carried out in a closed autoclave under the same reaction conditions. Fig. 2 shows the rate of H2 release and the total pressure of the chamber at time intervals of 20s, when the reaction was carried out at 160°C (Table 1, entry 5). The possible reactions in the case of ethanol and 1-butylamine are listed in Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + H2 (2) CH3CH2OH → CH3COOCH2CH3 + 2H2 (3) CH3CH2OH + CH3(CH2)3NH2 → CH3CONH(CH2)3CH3 + 2H2 The maximum amount of H2, 244.5mL, will be generated if all the ethanol is fully dehydrogenated. The total volume of H2 was calculated to be 178.3mL, as seen in Fig. 2, indicating that the conversion of ethanol in the reaction was approx. 73%. The H2 release rate approached to zero after 3.5h of reaction time (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the negligible increase in chemical yield when the reaction time was extended to 24h (Entry 5, Table 1). The inner pressure of the reaction camber can be used to monitor whether non-permeable gases were generated and retained in the system. It was observed that there was a sharp increase in the inner pressure curve in the first 85min of the reaction as the reaction chamber was heated to the target temperature (160°C) during this period. Thereafter, the inner pressure synchronously decreased with the H2 release rate. The net inner pressure decreased to zero when the system was cooled down to room temperature, indicating that no non-permeable gases such as CO were residual and the Pd-Ag membrane can remove hydrogen from the system very efficiently. With the optimized conditions in hand, we subsequently investigated the substrate scope of the direct synthesis of amides by catalytic dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines in the Pd-Ag/ceramic membrane reactor. Several reactions either containing low boiling point alcohols (ethanol) or low boiling point amines (propylamine, n-butylamine) were tested, and moderate to good yields could be obtained ( Table 2). Acylation of different amines with ethanol afforded the products in 65–72% yields, while higher yields were obtained with longer chain amines (Table 2, entry 1–3). This reaction also worked well with 1-butanol (60–74% yields) and 1-hexanol (61–68% yields)."
9,Ureas synthesis from methanol and amines,"3.3 Ureas synthesis from methanol and amines Inspired by these results, we examined the dehydrogenation reactions of methanol in the Pd-Ag membrane reactor with the Milstein catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the H2 release rate and inner pressure of reaction chamber for the dehydrogenation of 1mL methanol with 0.5mol% catalyst at 160°C. After 18h, the H2 collected in the lumen side of the membrane was only 51mL. This suggested that the conversion of methanol was between 4.2–8.5% depending on whether it was dehydrogenated to CO, formate of carbonate. During the reaction, the inner pressure (ca. 23bar) was much higher than the saturated vapour pressure of methanol at 160°C (17.1bar) and the inner pressure remained 3.7bar when the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. These observations showed that some impermeable gases were generated in this reaction. Further analysis of the gas phase proved that the impermeable gas was CO with trace amounts of methyl formate detected from the liquid mixture, indicating that methanol was catalytically dehydrogenated to form CO by the catalyst, consistent with its thermodynamic properties [32]. From the amide synthesis, we rationalized that the dehydrogenation of methanol may be facilitated in the presence of an amine. To investigate the possibility, initial experiments were conducted using methanol and 1-butylamine as the substrates in a variety of reaction conditions. When a toluene solution of Milstein catalyst (0.5mol%) with methanol and butylamine (1:1 ratio) was heated in the Pd-Ag membrane reactor at 180°C for 12h, 38% yield of 1, 3-dibutylurea was observed (Entry 1, Table 3). The yield of N,N′-dibutylurea was increased to 65% when the methanol to butylamine ratio was changed to 1:2 (Entry 2, Table 3). The effect of temperature on the yield of dibutylurea was tested and the yield slightly increased to 67% when the reaction temperature was lowered to 140°C (Entry 5, Table 3). The H2 release rate on the lumen side of membrane and pressure inside the reaction camber were monitored in real time. Fig. 4 shows the H2 flux and inner pressure of reaction Entry 5 of Table 3. The total H2 volume was 164mL by the integration of H2 release rate curve. For each of the urea molecule formed, three hydrogen molecules are generated for one molecule of methanol and 2 molecules of amine. In the case of Table 3 Entry 5, the conversion of methanol was approx. 90%. The H2 release rate was close to zero after a reaction time of 7.5h. After the reaction, the net inner pressure decreased to zero when cooling the system to room temperature as shown in Fig. 5, again indicating that there was no impermeable gases in the residual. The observations show that the dehydrogenative coupling of the amine with methanol was more efficient than the dehydrogenative homocoupling of methanol). The scope of the reaction was examined using various amines. Heating a toluene solution containing methanol (2.5mmol), propylamine (5mmol) and Milstein catalyst in the Pd-Ag membrane reactor at 140°C for 12h resulted in ca. 95% conversion of methanol as observed by on-line H2 collection, with the exclusive formation of N,N′-dipropylurea in 70% and 78% isolated yield, respectively (Entry 7 and 8, Table 3). Similarly, heating a toluene solution containing methanol and hexylamine or benzylamine resulted in ca. 94% conversion of methanol, with the yield of the corresponding ureas 65% and 62%, respectively. The generated H2 was in-situ removed by the Pd-Ag membrane from the reaction system."
10,Cyclic ureas synthesis from methanol and diamines,"3.4 Cyclic ureas synthesis from methanol and diamines To explore the synthetic utility of this reaction, various diamines instead of n-amines, and methanol were introduced to the reaction system to form cyclic ureas. When a NMP solution of Milstein catalyst (0.5mol%) with methanol and propanediamine (1:1 ratio) was heated in the Pd-Ag membrane reactor at 140°C for 12h, 46% yield of N,N′-trimethyleneurea was observed (Entry 1, Table 4). The yield of cyclic urea increased to 59% when the methanol to propanediamine ratio was changed to 3.7:5 (Entry 2, Table 4). The yield slightly decreased to 54% when the reaction was carried out with the same subtracts and the temperature up to 180°C (Entry 3, Table 4). Doubling the catalyst amount led to an increase in the yield to 67% after 12h reaction at 140°C (Entry 4, Table 4). The net inner pressure of the reactor decreased to zero when the system was cooled down to room temperature. Similar to the case of noncyclic urea synthesis, it indicated that no non-permeable gases were formed. Ethanediamine and butanediamine can be used to prepare 2-imidazolidone and N,N′-tetramethyleneurea in 46% and 40% yields (Entries 5 and 6, Table 4)."
11,Membrane stability,"3.5 Membrane stability During the reactions the membrane exhibited exceptional mechanical/thermal stability. The membrane maintained defect-free over more than 600h of the dehydrogenative acrylation reactions and more than 30 times heating/cooling processes between room temperature and the reaction temperature (140–180°C), even the reaction solution contained corrosive amines, amides, ureas, alcohol and homogenous Ru catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the SEM image of the Pd-Ag membrane at fresh and after 600h reaction. No apparent change was observed."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we reported the highly efficient synthesis of amides directly from volatile alcohols and amines using an ultrathin Pd-Ag membrane reactor. This environmentally benign reaction is homogeneously catalyzed by the Milstein catalyst, a dearomatized PNN-Ru complex. A series of amides and ureas could be obtained in moderate to good yields. Compared with conventional condensation methods, our catalytic system avoids the requirement of stoichiometric pre-activation or in situ activation reagents and provides a much cleaner process with high atomic economy. A defect-free Pd-Ag membrane is employed to remove the liberated hydrogen in-situ, which allows the reaction to operate at an elevated temperature and high pressure. Liberated H2 fluxes and the inner pressure of reactor can be used to accurately monitor the reaction progress in real-time. The Pd-Ag membrane showed excellent mechanical/thermal stability during the reactions."
