0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has long been used as a raw feedstock for chemical industry, while the rapidly developing fuel cell industry in recent years has further driven the interest in production of hydrogen [1–3]. At present, hydrogen is mainly produced in large scale from fossil fuels, while fossil fuels are nonrenewable and their use is associated with greenhouse gas emissions [4]. Hence, steam reforming of the organics having the renewability and carbon neutrality has attracted great attention in these years, such as ethanol [5–7], acetic acid [3,8,9], ethylene glycol [10,11] and glycerin [12,13]. Hu et al. [4] studied the impacts of the molecular structures of the reaction substrates such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, propylene glycol and glycerol on their catalytic behaviors during steam reforming. They found that long carbon chains promote coke deposition, and an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups inhibits CH4 and promotes CO production. Ma et al. [5] utilized ordered mesoporous materials to support Ni to improve the catalytic performance of ethanol steam reforming. The results showed that the added La element could increase the alkalinity of the catalyst for inhibiting coke deposition. Yu et al. [9] and Wu et al. [12] investigated the effects of precursors of Ni catalyst on the catalytic performances in steam reforming of acetic acid and glycerol, respectively. Their results showed that Cl element can poison Ni catalyst, thereby decreasing the catalytic performances. Organic compounds such as alcohols and acids have various molecular structures that could have a great impact on steam reforming in terms of distribution of the products and the properties of the coke formed [4,14–17]. For example, hydroxyl group is the functionality of alcohols. The location of hydroxyl group in alcohols with three or more carbon chains affects the abundance of the oxygen-containing intermediates formed and their reactivities towards dehydration reactions [17–20]. The acid-basic sites on the surface of the catalysts affect the dehydration of alcohols [21,22], the deposition of coke [21–24] and the gasification of coke [21,25–27]. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effects of the acid-basic sites on surface of reforming catalysts on the tendency of the coking as well as the properties of the coke formed from steam reforming of alcohols with varied molecular structure. Further to this, the understanding of the correlation of molecular structures of alcohols with their tendency to coking also helps to optimize the reforming process parameters to minimize coking and to design the effective catalyst to tackle the coking issue. In this study, Al2O3 and SiO2 carriers were used as the support of nickel species for the reforming of 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol. The two different carriers contain different abundance/strength of acid-basic sites, which were analyzed by CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, and pyridine-DRIFTS study. 1-Propanol, 2-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol are the alcohols with three carbon atoms but have varied number of hydroxyl group or the location of the hydroxyl groups. Understanding their reaction behaviors, especially the tendencies towards coke formation, would be of importance for probing the coking mechanism in steam reforming of alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness method. A certain amount of nickel nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in double distilled water to achieve the Ni loading of 15 wt% to the carrier. The gamma alumina (ShangHai Hushi, surface area: 163.7 m2/g) and silica gel (ShangHai Hushi, surface area: 470.0 m2/g) carriers were calcined for 4 h at 600 °C before the impregnation. The impregnated samples were aged overnight at room temperature for 24 h and transferred to an oven set at 100 °C for further drying. Finally, the samples were placed in a muffle furnace and calcined for 4 h at 600 °C in static air."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The BET tests were carried out on the SSA-6000 apparatus at 77 K using N2 (assuming a cross-sectional area of N2 of 16.2 Å2) as the absorption gas. Prior to the test, the samples were degassed for 4 h at 200 °C to remove moisture from the porous structures of the samples. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method was used to measure the pore distributions, pore volumes and specific surface areas of the reduced catalysts or carriers. The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to measure diffraction patterns of the calcined, reduced (The sample was pre-reduced under a mixed atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h in a mixed gases of N2/H2 with the flow rate of 60 mL/min) and spent catalysts to determine the characteristic and grain size of the catalysts. The fully ground samples were measured using a UItima IV diffractometer with a Cu K α irradiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA with a step size of 0.02° and in the 2θ range from 10 to 90°. Temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen (H2-TPR) was used to determine the reduction behaviors of nickel oxides of the calcined catalysts. Approximately 40 mg (precisely weighed) of the catalysts were placed in a nitrogen stream at 150 °C for 1 h to remove the physically adsorbed moisture and other gas molecules for the pretreatment. After cooling, the H2-TPR tests were performed on Biaode PCA-1200 instrument. The measurements were carried out by using a 5% H2/Ar mixed gas with a flow rate of 20 mL/min and the heating from room temperature to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. The signal changes were recorded by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) with NH3 or CO2 as the absorption gas was used to measure the acid-basic sites of the catalysts. The NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD tests were performed on the Biaode PCA-1200 instrument. Accurately weighed 100.0 mg of the reduced catalysts were placed in a NH3 (CO2) atmosphere at a flow rate of 30 mL/min, and purged at 150 °C for 30 min to remove the gases or moisture adsorbed on the catalysts surface. After cooling to room temperature, the catalysts were further purged for 30 min to adsorb NH3 (CO2) gas. The catalysts were then continuously purged with helium gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/min, and the temperature were raised from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and the signal changes were measured by TCD. In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to detect the desorption of pyridine versus the increasing temperature (Pyridine-DRIFTS) to study the acidic sites of the catalysts. The tests were performed on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with a liquid–nitrogen–cooled MCT detector and a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. The reduced catalysts were thoroughly ground and placed in the DRIFT cell for the characterization. After background collection was carried out, pyridine was introduced into the DRIFT cell by N2 bubbling (20 mL/min, 60 °C) for 30 min to complete the adsorption. The catalysts were further purged with N2 at room temperature for 20 min, after which the catalysts were heated at a rate of 10 °C/min to 500 °C to desorb pyridine from surface of the catalyst. DRIFTS was used to measure the functionalities of the reactive intermediates during steam reforming of the alcohols by using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer. The reduced and ground catalysts were placed in a DRIFTS cell and flattened. The 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol reaction solution with a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 5 was heated at 87 °C, 72 °C, 80 °C and 80 °C in an oil bath and was introduced into the DRIFTS cell by bubbling N2 at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The tests were performed via heating the sample to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphology of coke in the spent catalysts. The tests were performed on the JEOL2010 instrument. The ground spent catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed into ethanol, and the supernatant was taken for the analysis. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were used to determine the stability of the coke in the spent catalysts. The tests were performed in the TG8121 Riguku Corp instrument. The spent catalysts were thoroughly ground, weighed about 10 mg (precisely weighed), and heated from room temperature to 750 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in an air flow of 40 mL/min. The temperature was kept at 150 °C for 5 min to remove the moisture contained in the catalysts. After the TG tests, the spent catalysts were reduced by introducing a H2/He (5%) mixed gas having a flow rate of 40 mL/min to balance the quality of the spent catalysts due to oxidation. The thermogravimetric analyses associated with mass spectra measurement (TG-MS) was used to determine the composition of the gaseous products produced during pyrolysis of the coke in the spent catalysts. The tests were performed on a TG8121 Riguku Corp instrument with an exhaust port connected to the in-situ mass spectrometer apparatus (Pfeiffer, MS GSD 320). Around 4 mg (precisely weighed) thoroughly ground spent catalysts were heated to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a N2 flow of 20 mL/min. The temperature programmed oxidation and in-situ mass spectra measurement (TPO-MS) was used to determine the oxidation behaviors of the coke in the spent catalysts. The tests were performed on a Biaode PCA-1200 instrument. Approximately 10 mg (precisely weighed) spent catalysts were heated from room temperature to 850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. A 5% O2/He mixed gas with a flow rate of 20 mL/min was introduced, and the exhaust gas was measured with an in-situ mass spectrometer apparatus (Pfeiffer, MS GSD 320). Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to determine the functionalities in the coke of the spent catalysts. The tests were performed on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer. The spent catalysts were mixed with KBr (the weight ratio was 1 : 200) and thoroughly ground, and then dried in an oven at 120 °C. The dried sample was pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa into a transparent tablet with a thickness of ca. 0.8 mm for the test. Raman spectra were used to detect the aromatic ring structure of coke in the spent catalysts. The tests were performed on the Horiba LabRam HR Evolution apparatus. Scanning in the range of 100-3000 cm−1 was performed using a 532 nm laser."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Catalytic experiments were performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor connecting to a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with TCD for analysis of the gases. Approximately 0.5 g of the calcined catalyst was reduced at 600 °C for 1 h by using a H2/N2 mixed gas (N2 = 60 mL/min, H2 = 60 mL/min). After cooling down to room temperature, the reactor was heated from 300 to 600 °C with a step of 50 °C, and kept at each temperature for 30 min to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalysts. N2 was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 60 mL/min, and the reaction liquid (The ratio of water to carbon (S/C) = 5) of 0.12 mL/min was used for the experiments. To further evaluate the catalytic performance, the test was carried out under severe conditions (T = 600 °C, S/C = 1.5, liquid flow rate = 0.12 mL/min) in a time-on-stream of 240 min. The liquid products were collected using a condenser for further analysis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the amount of the remaining reactants after steam reforming to calculate the conversion of the reactants. The tests were performed in a SHIMADZU LC-20A liquid chromatograph equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-20A). The liquid collected after the reaction was carried into the column by a 0.01 mol/L H2SO4 mobile phase (600 μL/min) for the detection. The organic products were also analyzed by using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Shimadzu GCMS–QP2020). The sample was diluted with acetone, and the injection volume was 0.5 μL, and the carrier gas was helium. The temperature was increased from 35 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min, and the retention time at 250 °C was 17 min. The components were identified by standard spectra of the NIST 2014 library. The reaction formula for steam reforming of the alcohols were shown below [4]: (R1) C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 OH + 5 H 2 O → 3C O 2 + 9 H 2 , Δ H 298 = 285 .2 kJ/mol (R2) C H 3 CHOHC H 3 + 5 H 2 O → 3C O 2 + 9 H 2 , Δ H 298 = 301 .2 kJ/mol (R3) C H 3 CHOHC H 2 OH + 4 H 2 O → 3C O 2 + 8 H 2 , Δ H 298 = 2 11.0 kJ/mol (R4) C H 2 OHCHOHC H 2 OH + 3 H 2 O → 3C O 2 + 7 H 2 , Δ H 298 = 1 30.3 kJ/mol Conversion of the alcohol was calculated by the following formula: C C 3 H 8 O 1/2/3 = C 3 H 8 O 1/2/3 in the feedstock - C 3 H 8 O 1/2/3 in the residual C 3 H 8 O 1/2/3 in the feedstock × 100 % The gas yields were calculated by the following formula: Y C O 2 /CO/C H 4 = moles of C O 2 /CO/C H 4 produced 3 × moles of C 3 H 8 O 1/2/3 × 100 % Y H 2 = moles of H 2 produced 9 × moles of C 3 H 8 O or 8 × moles of C 3 H 8 O 2 or 7 × moles of C 3 H 8 O 3 × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization 3.1.1 BET analysis The BET results of the catalysts and carriers were shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. The results in Table 1 indicated that the loading of nickel could reduce the pore volumes and the specific surface areas, and increase the mean pore diameter of the carriers. The reduction in pore volumes may be due to the filling of the pores by the Ni grains. The reduction of pore volumes of Al2O3 support was smaller than that of SiO2, which was likely due to the preferable deposition of some nickel species outside the pores of Al2O3 surface. Fig. 1a showed, the Ni grains mainly filled the mesopores of the SiO2 support with the diameters of 2–5 nm. Over alumina, nickel could fill the pores in the carrier in the whole range. Table 1 showed that the specific surface areas of SiO2 was about 2.9 times higher than that of Al2O3. After supporting Ni, the percentage decrease in specific surface area value is almost the same for Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 (Ni-Al2O3 was 25%, Ni-SiO2 was 22%). As shown in Fig. 1b, the relative height of the adsorption-desorption isotherms demonstrates the varied specific surface areas. The isotherms of Al2O3 and SiO2 were type IV, and the hysteresis loop of SiO2 belonged to H2 type and Al2O3 belonged to H4 type [28,29]. There was a saturated adsorption platform on the SiO2 isotherm, indicating that the pore size distribution was relatively uniform (Fig. 1a). In comparison, the pore size distribution of Al2O3 or Ni-Al2O3 was irregular. 3.1.2 H2-TPR characterization Fig. 1c showed the TPR patterns for the calcined catalysts. After subtracting the background, the TPR patterns were further processed using a Gaussian function. The Ni-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a broad reduction peak at 450–900 °C. The fitting condition of the reduction peak indicated that NiO may be reduced stepwisely on the surface of Al2O3 [30]. The reduction temperature in the varied region of temperature indicated the distinct degree of interaction between NiO and Al2O3. The nickel oxides in Ni-SiO2 catalyst were mainly reduced at the lower temperatures [31,32]. The reduction peak was sharp and concentrated at ca. 400 °C. The reduction temperature of the nickel oxide in Ni-SiO2 catalyst was similar to that of unsupported NiO, indicating the relatively mild interaction between NiO and SiO2. Although the interactions between NiO and the carriers were different, the degree of reduction was similar (60%, Table 1). The unreduced nickel oxides might be those distributed in the inner pores of the carriers. In addition to the characterisation of nickel species, the distribution of the acid-basic sites on the surface of the catalysts were further investigated. 3.1.3 XRD characterization The XRD patterns of the catalysts after calcination or reduction were shown in Fig. 1d. The grain sizes of metallic nickel calculated by the Scherrer formula were shown in Table 2 . The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 37.7°, 45.9° and 66.9° were assigned to the Al2O3 phase [JCPD 77-0403], and that at 22.2° was assigned to the SiO2 phase [JCPD 82-1554]. The diffraction peaks at the 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.8°, 75.3° and 79.3° were assigned to the cubic NiO phase [JCPD 73-1523], which belonged to the Fm-3 m (225) space group. The diffraction peaks of NiO on SiO2 were sharper than that of NiO on Al2O3. As shown in Table 2, the grain size of the NiO supported on the Al2O3 carrier was slightly smaller, even though the specific area of SiO2 was remarkably higher than that of Al2O3. This might be due to the stronger interaction between NiO and Al2O3, as evidenced by the characterization of H2-TPR (Fig. 1c). After the reduction at 600 °C under H2/N2 mixed gas (H2 = 60 mL/min, N2 = 60 mL/min) for 1 h, the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° were indexed to cubic Ni phase [JCPD 87-0712], and also belonged to Fm-3 m (225) space group. As shown in Table 2, it was interesting to note that after the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni species, the grain size of nickel increased, and the extent of the increase over Al2O3 and SiO2 was similar. This may be due to the fact that the small-sized NiO grains migrated and aggregated during the reduction to Ni species [33]. 3.1.4 TPD analysis 3.1.4.1 CO2-TPD characterization The basic sites of the catalysts surface were measured using CO2 as a probe molecule [34]. As shown in Fig. 2 a, at 250–600 °C the CO2 desorption peaks could be observed over both the Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts. The Ni-SiO2 showed a sharp desorption peak at 350 °C, while the desorption peak for the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst was much broader. The position the CO2 desorption peak were related to the strength of the basic sites across the surface of the catalysts [34]. The CO2-TPD curves were processed by Gaussian function, and the desorption peaks were classified as weak, medium and strong basic sites, depending on their desorption temperature [34,35]. The relative abundance of the basic sites calculated in Table 3 indicated that the total amount of basic sites on the surface of the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst was about twice times more than that of Ni-SiO2, whether for the weak or the strong basic sites. 3.1.4.2 NH3-TPD characterization NH3 has basicity and a small molecular size, which was reported to be an excellent probe molecule for testing the acidic sites on the surface of the catalysts [36]. The NH3-TPD curves of the reduced catalysts were shown in Fig. 2b. The acidic sites were mainly distributed in two temperature zones. The NH3 desorption peaks of the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst appeared at a medium to high temperature regions, and even a desorption peak appeared at near 745 °C, indicating that the catalyst mainly contained the medium and strong acidic sites. The desorption peaks of the Ni-SiO2 catalyst was sharp and distributed in the relatively lower temperature regions. The NH3-TPD curves of the Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts were further processed via Gaussian function to obtain a profiles for the detailed desorption peaks. The sub-desorption peaks were assigned, and their relative abundance were calculated and shown in in Table 3 [36,37]. As shown in Table 3, the total acid numbers over the two catalysts were similar, but the surface of the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst contained more abundant medium and strong acidic sites. The surface of the Ni-SiO2 catalyst contained more weak acidic sites, which exceeded half of the total acid number. In addition, the relative abundance of the Lewis acidic sites and the Brønsted acidic sites on surface of the catalysts were further investigated with pyridine-DRIFTS study, which would be discussed further below. 3.1.4.3 Pyridine-DRIFTS characterization According to the bands exhibited by the adsorbed pyridine at different wavenumbers, the Lewis (Lw) and Brønsted (Br) acidic sites on the catalysts surface could be distinguished, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. It was generally considered that the absorption bands of the Lw acidic sites distributed at 1612 cm−1 [38–41], 1590 cm−1 [38,41], 1575 cm−1 [38,42], 1448 and 1444 cm−1 [38–46]. The bands the Br acidic sites appeared at 1560 and 1545 cm−1 [38–46]. The bands near 1490 cm−1 were produced by the pyridine adsorbed by both the Br and Lw acidic sites [41,43,45–47]. Ni-Al2O3 catalyst contained both Br acidic sites and the Lw acidic sites. As the temperature rose, the intensity of the bands at the Lw acidic sites decreased, mainly due to the desorption of the pyridine adsorbed at the acidic sites during the heating process. The bands around 1575, 1490 and 1448 cm−1 disappeared at around 250 °C. In contrast, the band at 1590 cm−1 weakened above 400 °C, while the band at 1612 cm−1 weakened at 500 °C. This may be due to the different bonding modes of pyridine to acidic sites. Jankovič et al. reported that the 1575 cm−1 band was due to the physically adsorbed pyridine, and the 1590, 1490 and 1448 cm−1 bands were assigned to Lewis-bonded pyridine, and the 1590 cm−1 band also contained hydrogen-bonded pyridine. The 1612 cm−1 band was assigned to aromatic π-electrons coordinated pyridine [40]. The adsorbed pyridine at the Br acidic sites had not been completely desorbed yet at 500 °C (1560 and 1545 cm−1), which indicated that the Br acidic sites had strong acidity. The bands near 1444 and 1486 cm−1 showed a blue shift during the heating process, indicating that the pyridine adsorbed at this acidic sites tended to bond in the Lewis-bound form, and the adsorbed pyridine molecules were relatively unstable. The pyridine-DRIFTS of the Ni-SiO2 catalyst was shown in Fig. 2d. The 1595 and 1444 cm−1 bands representing the Lw acidic sites were observed [38–46], while the characteristic bands representing the Br acidic sites were not present, indicating that the Ni-SiO2 catalyst contained mainly the Lw acidic sites. During the heating process, the Lw bands disappeared at 200 °C, which also proved the fact that Lewis-bonded pyridine was unstable. Compared with that of the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the band at 1444 cm−1 over Ni-SiO2 did not undergo a blue shift, indicating that the Lw acidic sites on the two catalysts may be different. It should be noted that both catalysts had relatively strong absorption bands around 1595 and 1444 cm−1, indicating that Lewis-bound pyridine was the predominant adsorption form of pyridine on the catalysts. The distinct distribution of the acidic and basic sites, associated with other properties of the catalysts, would significantly impact the catalytic activities, which will be further investigated."
7,Catalysts tests,"3.2 Catalysts tests 3.2.1 Evaluation of activities of the catalysts The steam reforming of alcohols involves a complex reaction network, including the cracking of the CH, CC, and/or CO, HO bonds to produce the radicals that can be further transformed into the gaseous products [4,16,21,48]. In addition, dehydrogenation and dehydration of alcohols could also be included in the reaction network, occurrence of which depends on the synergistic catalysis of the Ni metal sites and the acid-basic sites [49]. These reactions all could significantly affect the distribution of the products and the tendency for the formation of coke on surface of the catalysts. The distribution of the main gaseous products in steam reforming of the alcohols over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst were shown in Fig. 3 a,c,e and g, respectively. The yields of H2 and CO2 and conversion of the alcohols increased with the increasing temperature, and the trend for the increase was similar. The increase in terms of the yields of the gaseous products was not significant before 350 °C but then increased rapidly above 400 °C. With the increase of the number of hydroxyl groups, steam reforming of the alcohols tended to be more difficult, as could be seen from the conversion and the yields of H2 and CO2. Steam reforming of the alcohols with multiple hydroxyl groups involved probably more dehydration reactions, which seemed not to be a favorable factor for the reforming reactions. The yield of CH4 underwent a maximum in the middle range of the temperature over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, which was mainly due to the occurrence of the methanation reactions [50]. Interestingly, with the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols, the yield of CH4 decreased, and the temperature corresponding to the maximum yields also increased: from about 450 °C of 1-propanol and 2-propanol to 500 °C of 1,2-propanediol and 550 °C of glycerol. Over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups was advantageous for suppressing the formation of CH4. In addition to methanation, the cracking of the alcohols could also produce the reaction intermediates such as CHx*. The integration of this radical with H* would also produce methane. The alcohols with multiple hydroxyl groups probably tended to form more COH* species, while less CHx* via cracking over nickel sites, which might be responsible for the less methane formation in steam reforming of the alcohols with multiple hydroxyl group. In addition, the CO yields versus the reaction temperature in steam reforming of 1-propanol and glycerol showed the different patterns with that in steam reforming of 2-propanol and 1,2-propanediol, indicating the varied mechanism for the formation of CO in reforming of the alcohols with the varied structures. The results of steam reforming of the alcohols over Ni-SiO2 catalyst were shown in Fig. 3b,d, and h. The conversion of the alcohols increased approximately linearly with increasing temperature. Similar to that over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the formation of methane also decreased in steam reforming of the alcohols with multiple hydroxyl groups. Unfortunately, as the number of hydroxyl groups increased in the alcohols, the yield of CO increased significantly, which was disadvantageous for the use of the gases in fuel cells [51,52]. The cracking of the alcohols with the multiple hydroxyl groups possibly formed more CO* species, the ineffective gasification of which with the hydroxyl group would form more CO in the gaseous products. The results herein also indicated the pathways for the formation of CO over Ni-Al2O3 or Ni-SiO2 catalyst were different. The organic products formed during the steam reforming reactions were further characterized. The organic by-products formed in steam reforming of the alcohols at 400 °C were tested by using GC–MS. The organic by-products in steam reforming of 1-propanol or 2-propanol were not detected. The alcohols with one hydroxyl groups did not form much organic by-products. This was understandable as the cracking of them mainly form carbonaceous species. In steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol, hydroxyacetone was formed via dehydrogenation reactions as the main organic by-products over both Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 (Fig. S1a). Hydroxyacetone contains the ketone functionality and could react with each other via the intermolecular Aldol condensation reactions, formation of which might contribute to coking in steam reforming. This will be discussed later. The organic by-products in steam reforming of glycerol were more complicated. As shown in Fig. S1b, the by-products included 1,3-propanediol, phenol, ethylene glycol, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde, which were marked by the numbers inside the figure. The production of 1,3-propanediol (1) indicated the occurrence of the removal of hydroxyl groups via the hydrogenlysis reactions or the dehydration reactions followed by the hydrogenations. The Br acidic sites on the surface of Ni-Al2O3 probably facilitated the dehydration reactions. Since the surface of Ni-SiO2 did not contain the Br acidic sites, it did not promote the formation of 1,3-propanediol (1), but promoted the production of dihydroxyacetone (4) via the dehydrogenation reactions. Phenol was a product from the aromatization of the aliphatic structures, formation of which over the Ni-Al2O3 indicated that phenol was probably an important reaction intermediates for the formation of coke over the catalysts. In addition, the cracking of the CC bond of glycerol over the Ni metal sites also took place, forming ethylene glycol. Further dehydrogenation of ethylene glycol (3) could be form glycolaldehyde (6), which was mainly formed over Ni-SiO2 catalysts. The reaction pathway of glycerol steam reforming was shown in Scheme 1 . The formation of these varied organic by-products indicated the different reaction network with the different feedstock and over the different catalysts, which were further investigated with in situ DRIFTS of steam reforming of the alcohols. 3.2.2 In-situ DRIFTS of steam reforming of the alcohols The results for the in-situ DRIFTS studies of steam reforming over Ni-Al2O3 or Ni-SiO2 catalysts were shown in Fig. 4 . Over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the infrared spectra during the steam reforming reaction of 1-propanol were similar to that of 2-propanol, and those of 1,2-propanediol were similar to that of glycerol. And a similar phenomenon was observed over the Ni-SiO2 catalyst. This indicated that the position of the hydroxyl group had a smaller effect on the formation of the reaction intermediates. Over the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, the absorption band at 2960 cm−1 was attributed to the CH bond. The CO2 adsorbed on surface of the catalyst showed the absorption bands at 2373 and 2314 cm−1, which appeared at around 400 °C. The catalyst showed appreciable activity for the production of CO2 from steam reforming at this temperature, as indicated in Fig. 3a. The absorbed CO2 could come from the gasification of the carbonaceous species, especially at the high temperatures [26]. The CO bond at 1740 cm−1 was mainly attributed to the carbonyl functionalities, formed probably by the dehydrogenation of 1-propanol. The CC bond had three absorption bands at 1582, 1491 and 979 cm−1, indicating the formation of the CC bond from different reaction intermediates. The formation of the CC bond was related to the dehydration of 1-propanol, over the acidic sites of the catalysts. In addition, the recombination of the reaction radicals could also lead to the formation of CC bond. The absorption bands in the range of 1440–1310 cm−1 could be assigned to hydroxyl groups. The absorption bands in the range of 1275-1000 cm−1 could be classified as a CO bond, wherein the band at the 1168 cm−1 disappeared at 300 °C, which might be derived from the absorption of 1-propanol. The absorption bands at 1243 cm−1 produced in the higher temperature ranges may come from ethers. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4c, the intensity of the absorption band of the CC bond at 1491 cm−1 was stronger when 2-propanol was used as a reactant. This was possibly due to that the hydroxyl group in 2-propanol could dehydrate easier to form the CC bond. The number of absorption bands of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol was less than that of the alcohol containing one hydroxyl group, which seemed to be contrary to expectations. As shown in Fig. 4e and g, the absorption intensity of the bands corresponding to the OH bond (1440 cm−1) and the CO bond (1020 cm−1) was remarkably enhanced, which may be related to an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohol that led to a high viscosity of the alcohols. This is because the higher viscosity would make it more difficult for bubbling the reactants into the cell for the characterization. The reasons for the disappearance of some absorption bands are for further study. Compared to Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, Ni-SiO2 catalyst seemed to have little activity in catalyzing the formation of olefins from the alcohols. As shown in Fig. 4b, the absorption band representing the CC bond at 1582 cm−1 was weaker, and the absorption band at the 979 cm−1 was completely submerged by the CO absorption band. However, the absorption band representing the CO bond at 1266 cm−1 was sharper, indicating that the dehydration of alcohols was not favored over the Ni-SiO2, which might be related to the absence of the Br acidic sites on surface of this catalyst. In addition, it was found that the CC functionality could be found over all the catalysts at the temperature as low as 100 °C, indicating the occurrence of the dissociative absorption of the alcohols. At such a low temperature, the steam reforming had not initiated yet. The accumulation of the species containing the unsaturated functionalities might become the precursor of coke. Coking of the catalysts were subsequently investigated in reforming tests with prolonged reaction time."
8,Evaluation of the catalysts versus prolonged reaction time,"3.3 Evaluation of the catalysts versus prolonged reaction time 3.3.1 Catalytic performance As shown in Fig. 5 a, for steam reforming of 1-propanol over Ni-Al2O3, although its conversion reached almost 100%, while the yields of H2 and CO2 were only 40 and 30%, respectively. This was due to the formation of significant amount of CH4 and CO under the decreased ratio of S/C. The catalysts did not show the sign of deactivation for steam reforming of 1-propanol (Fig. 5a), 2-propanol (Fig. 5c) or 1,2-propanediol (Fig. 5e). However, the conversion of 1,2-propanediol and the yields of H2, CO2 and CH4 decreased significantly compared with the catalytic 1-propanol and 2-propanol, indicating that Ni-Al2O3 had limited capability for catalyzing the conversion of the alcohols with multiple hydroxyl groups. In addition, the conversion of glycerol and the yields of H2, CO2 and CO decreased significantly, indicating that the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst underwent a certain degree of deactivation. The reason for the deactivation might be due to the mask of the active sites with coke, which would be investigated later. As for Ni-SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 5b), the yields of H2, CO2 and CO were significantly improved as CH4 formation was suppressed in steam reforming of 1-propanol, which was probably due to the presence of less basic sites or the absence of Br acidic sites over Ni-SiO2 catalyst. This requires further research to prove. Furthermore, the yields of the gaseous products were similar to that at S/C = 5 (Fig. 3b), which indicated that the decrease in S/C ratio had little effect on the catalytic performance over Ni-SiO2. Ni-SiO2 were more active than Ni-Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, Ni-SiO2 catalyst did not deactivate in steam reforming of 1-propanol and 2-propanol but showed a clear sign of deactivation in steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol or glycerin. The number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols clearly impacted the stability of the catalysts via such as formation of varied amount of coke, which was further investigated via characterization of the spent catalysts. 3.3.2 Characterization of the spent catalysts 3.3.2.1 TEM characterizations The morphologies of the spent catalysts were investigated by TEM and the results were shown in Fig. 6 . Both the Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts contained amorphous coke and carbon nanotubes, but the contents of the two types of cokes were different. When steam reforming alcohol containing 1 hydroxyl group, the spent catalysts of Ni-Al2O3 contained more amorphous coke, and Ni-SiO2 was the opposite. The diameter and length of the carbon nanotubes of the Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts were higher or longer than that of the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts. This may be affected by the acid-basic sites of the catalysts surface, and the Ni-SiO2 catalysts were more favorable for promoting the formation of carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts mainly contained hollow carbon nanotubes (Fig. 6c, S3c,d, S5c and d), and the Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts contained not only nanotubes but also nanofibers (Fig. 6b,d, S4b and S6b). For the Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts, the finer carbon nanotubes were mostly hollow, while the thicker ones were mainly solid. This might be due to the different growth mechanisms of carbon nanotubes at different growth stages: in the early growth stage, coke was deposited from the inside until the filling was complete; in the later stages of growth, the coke was deposited from the outside to increase the diameter of the carbon nanotubes. The wall of the carbon nanotubes obtained by Ni-SiO2 catalyzing 1-propanol was smoother than that in the reforming of 2-propanol (Fig. 6b and d). This may be because the coke of from the steam reforming of 2-propanol was more likely to deposit on the Ni grains, which resulted in a rougher surface of the carbon nanotubes. However, no Ni grains were observed on the wall of carbon nanotubes in the spent catalyst obtained by Ni-SiO2 in steam reforming of 1-propanol, which also suggested the difference in the growth mechanism of the two carbon nanotubes in Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts. When steam reforming alcohol containing 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups, the content of fibrous coke in the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts was significantly increased (Fig. 6e and g), while Ni-SiO2 contained more amorphous coke instead of carbon nanotubes (Fig. 6f and h). For the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts, some Ni grains were encapsulated by amorphous coke (Figs. S7c, S9a, c and d). Compared with fibrous coke, encapsulated amorphous coke hindered the contact of Ni active sites with reactants, which was the main cause of catalyst deactivation, while fibrous coke had little effect on catalytic activity [53]. The encapsulation effect of amorphous coke provided evidence for the deactivation of Ni-Al2O3 steam reforming glycerol (Fig. 5g). In the Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts, the amorphous coke seemed to be composed of carbon nanofibers (Fig. S8b, d). Moreover, amorphous coke appeared to have a certain orientation, which was particularly evident in the spent catalysts obtained by Ni-SiO2 in steam reforming of glycerol (Fig. S10). The reason for the deactivation of Ni-SiO2 catalyst in steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol may be related to the high tendency of the catalyst for forming amorphous coke. 3.3.2.2 TG characterizations The amount of coke formed in the short-term stability tests were characterized with TG, and the results were shown in Fig. 7 . The weight loss of the spent catalysts occurred mainly in the range of 480–580 °C, including two DTG peaks. The DTG peak at the lower temperature might be due to the combustion of amorphous coke, while higher temperature peak might be related to filamentous coke [54]. The results of TEM characterization demonstrated the existence of these two types of coke (Fig. 6). For the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, as the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols increased, the DTG peaks appeared to move toward the higher temperatures (Fig. 7a,c,e and g). The coke formed in steam reforming of the alcohols with multiple hydroxyl group was probably more stable, which was related to an increase in the content of fibrous coke. Nevertheless, for steam reforming of the alcohols over the Ni-SiO2 catalyst, an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups did not seem to promote the shift of the DTG peaks to a higher temperature region, which may be due to an increase in the amorphous coke content in the spent catalyst (Fig. 6f and h). The weight loss of the spent catalysts was shown in Table 4 . The weight loss of Ni-Al2O3 catalysts in steam reforming of 1-propanol and 2-propanol reached 60% and 41%, respectively, although the catalyst showed no clear sign of deactivation (Fig. 5a and c). This may be due to that the coke did not mask or partially masked Ni metal sites and acid-basic sites (Fig. 6a and c). In the steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol, there were only 27% of coke formed, which might be due to the low yield of CH4 (Fig. 5e), as CH4 was an important source of coke via decomposition. In steam reforming of glycerol, the amount of coke was lower than that over in steam reforming of 1-propanol, while led to a higher extent deactivation of the catalyst, which clearly was related to the effect of amorphous coke on Ni grain encapsulation (Fig. S9). The degree of coking of the Ni-SiO2 catalysts appeared to be positively correlated with the number of hydroxyl groups. The position of hydroxyl group in the alcohols did not affect much the coking, as the amounts of coke formed in steam reforming of 1-propanol and 2-propanol were basically the same. Nevertheless, with the increase of the number of the hydroxyl group in the alcohols, the amounts of coke increased substantially, which was related to an increase in the amorphous carbon content. Molecular structures clearly affected the tendency of coking. In fact, molecular structures also affected the properties of the coke, which was further investigated. 3.3.2.3 TG-MS characterizations Thermal stability of the coke was measured with TG-MS in nitrogen atmosphere, the results of which were shown in Fig. 8 . The gaseous products formed during the coke pyrolysis were mainly H2 and CO2. Dehydrogenation of the aliphatic structures in the coke produced H2, which initiated from around 600 °C. The pyrolysis of the spent Ni-Al2O3 catalyst that catalyzed the steam reforming of glycerol showed two H2 peaks at 450–750 °C (Fig. 8g), indicating that H2 may be derived from at least two different types of aliphatic structures in coke. The H2 peak of the Ni-SiO2 spent catalyst for steam reforming of glycerol appeared near 670 °C (Fig. 8h), and the peak area was much smaller, indicating clearly the different aliphatic structures formed over Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2. The CO2 might come from two pathways: one was the CO2 adsorbed from the basic sites on the catalysts, corresponding to the peaks near 270 °C; the other was the dissociation of the carbonyl or carboxylic functionalities in the coke, corresponding to the formation of CO2 near 600 °C. In Fig. 8h, there was no CO2 peak near 270 °C. which may be related to the properties of the reaction substrates and the structure of the coke species (Fig. S10). The ratio of the weight loss of the spent catalysts in the TG-MS tests (N2) to that in the TG tests (Air) was shown in Table 4. The weight loss ratio directly related to the thermal stability of the coke. Over the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts, it was clear that the weight loss ratio was affected by the location of the hydroxyl group and the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols. Similarly, the thermal stability of the coke formed over Ni-SiO2 catalyst were also significantly affected by the molecular structures of the coke. The coke formed in steam reforming of glycerol over the Ni-SiO2 catalyst showed the lowest thermal stability. Generally, for steam reforming of the same alcohols, the thermal stability of the coke was very different over Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts. The properties of the coke were further analyzed. 3.3.2.4 TPO-MS characterizations The results of TPO-MS tests of the spent catalysts were shown in Fig. 9 . The oxidation peaks of the spent Ni-Al2O3 catalysts after the steam reforming of 1-propanol and 2-propanol appeared at 680 °C, while that of 1,2-propanediol appeared between 680 and 710 °C, and that of glycerol appeared at 710 °C. This indicated that the coke properties tended to be stable, which was consistent with the conclusions in the TG characterization. As shown in Fig. 9b, 1-propanol and 2-propanol had two peaks, while 1,2-propanediol and glycerol had only one, which might be related to the presence of the different coke species over the spent catalysts [55]. The elution of the gases measured with MS were shown in Fig. 9c-j. The gases produced from the spent catalysts were mainly CO2 and CO. The production of CO indicated that coke might not be completely oxidized, which could be related to the deficiency of oxygen during the characterization. There were some shoulder peaks formed over the spent Ni-SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 9d and f), suggesting the presence of the different types of coke species. The structure of coke was further investigated with FT-IR, Raman and XRD techniques. 3.3.2.5 FT-IR characterizations The FT-IR results of the spent catalysts were shown in Fig. 10 a and b. The spent Ni-Al2O3 catalysts contained the functional groups such as CH, CO, CC, OH and CO, which was consistent with the functional groups detected in the DRIFTS studies (Fig. 4a). These functionalities were, in fact, belonged to the coke deposits or the precursors of coke. The distribution of the functionalities of the coke over Ni-Al2O3 or Ni-SiO2 catalysts did not differ much, which was mainly determined by the structures of the alcohols. 3.3.2.6 Raman characterizations The results for Raman characterization of the spent catalysts were shown in Fig. 10c and d. The D band representing the carbon defect located at 1340 cm−1, and the G band representing the graphitization of carbon located at 1580 cm−1 [56]. An increase in the degree of disorder of carbon led to an increase in the intensity of the D band and also in the width of the D band and G band [57,58]. There was a difference in the total area of Raman curves of different spent catalysts, which might be related to the degree of aromaticity of coke and the number of oxygen-containing functional groups. It had been reported that oxygen-containing functional groups promoted the scattering ability and thereby increasing the intensity of the Raman signal, while the aromatic ring structure promoted the absorption of strong light by the sample and reduce the Raman signal [59]. The Raman curves of the spent catalysts were also further processed by Gaussian function, and the results were shown in Fig. S11. The S band might be associated with aliphatic ethers and CC functional groups, and the GR band might be associated with aromatic rings and amorphous carbon structures [60,61]. The relative areas of the fitted peaks were shown in Table 5 . When catalyzing the reforming of the same alcohol, the total area of the Raman curves of the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts were larger than that of Ni-SiO2, and a similar phenomenon was observed in the S band. This indicated that the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts may contain more oxygen-containing functional groups [62,63]. When catalyzing the steam reforming of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and glycerol, the area of the GR band of Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts was similar. However, in the spent catalysts obtained by catalyzing 1,2-propanediol, the GR band area of Ni-Al2O3 was about three times that of Ni-SiO2. This may be due to the fact that the coke obtained by Ni-Al2O3 catalyzing 1,2-propanediol contained less aromatic rings. The ratio of the D band to the G band of the spent Ni-Al2O3 for catalyzing the steam reforming of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and 1,2-propanediol was almost the same, which indicated that the degree of disorder of carbon in these spent catalysts was similar. This phenomenon could also be observed from the Ni-SiO2 spent catalysts. The ratio of D/G of the spent catalysts obtained in the steam reforming of glycerol was 1.57 and 1.56, respectively, indicating that the degree of graphitization of carbon was higher. For Ni-Al2O3, this may be related to an increase in the content of fibrous coke (Fig. S9); for Ni-SiO2, this may be related to the ordering of amorphous coke (Fig. S10). In order to study the degree of crystallization of carbon and the grain sizes, the spent catalysts were further tested with XRD. 3.3.2.7 XRD characterizations The diffraction patterns of the spent catalysts were shown in Fig. 10e and f, the 2θ diffraction peak of 25.9° was directed to the graphitized carbon species [JCPD 75-0444]. It was worth noting that the 2θ diffraction peak of the carbon species corresponding to the PDF card should be at 26.3°, which may be originated from the formation of more defects in the graphitized carbon, shifting the angle of 2θ to a small angle. The grain sizes of C and Ni were calculated by the Scherrer formula, and the results were shown in Table 2. When catalyzing the reforming of the same alcohol, the grain sizes of C in the Ni-Al2O3 spent catalysts were larger than that of Ni-SiO2, especially in the spent catalysts obtained by catalyzing the steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol. In the spent Ni-Al2O3 after catalyzing the steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol, the obtained C species showed the largest average grain size of 9.6 nm. In addition, the average grain sizes of Ni also changed. When Ni-Al2O3 catalyzed the steam reforming of 1-propanol and 2-propanol, the grain sizes of Ni decreased to 13.2 and 13.0 nm, respectively. In comparison, the grain size increased to 13.9 and 14.5 nm in catalyzing the steam reforming of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol. A similar phenomenon was observed in Ni-SiO2. The size reduction of Ni grains may be related to carbon nanotubes, which resulted in separation of Ni grains from the catalyst support and even grain splitting [53]. The grain sizes growth of Ni might be affected by the coverage of coke formed in steam reforming of the alcohols, such as the encapsulation of Ni grains by amorphous coke. 3.3.3 Discussion on the characterization results of spent catalysts The number of hydroxyl groups and the acid-basic sites affected the type of coke, which further affected the stability of the catalysts. As the number of hydroxyl groups increased, the content of fibrous coke in Ni-Al2O3 increased, so that the tendency of catalysts deactivation was slowed down. In addition, the increase in fibrous coke content promoted the stability of coke and the degree of graphitization (Raman characterization), shifting the maximum weight loss peaks of TG and the oxidation peaks of TPO-MS to a higher temperature. At the same time, the increase in fibrous coke content also reduced the total weight loss of the spent catalysts in the TG test. However, an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups promoted the encapsulation of some Ni grains in Ni-Al2O3 by amorphous coke, which directly led to the deactivation of the catalysts, and the encapsulation may also lead to the growth of Ni grains (XRD characterization). The increase in the number of hydroxyl groups increased the amount of amorphous coke in Ni-SiO2 and accelerated the deactivation of the catalysts. The increase in amorphous coke content resulted in an increase in the total weight loss of the spent catalysts in the TG tests. The orientation of coke made the degree of graphitization of coke higher (Raman characterization)."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, the characteristics of steam reforming of alcohols were affected by both the structural configuration of the alcohol feedstock and the acidity/alkalinity of the catalysts. With the increase of the number of hydroxyl groups (from 1-propanol to glycerol), the formation of CH4 was suppressed, while the production of CO was promoted. The increase of hydroxyl groups probably facilitated the formation of the reaction intermediates containing more oxygen, while suppressed the formation of CHx species that were the precursor of CH4. Further to this, the organic by-products in steam reforming of 1-propanol were very simple, while that from glycerol with multiple hydroxyl groups were much more complicated. The dehydration, dehydrogenation, hydrogenlysis, or aromatization reactions all could take place, producing a complicated mixture of organic by-products such as 1,3-propanediol, glycolaldehyde, hydroxyl acetone, phenol, etc. The distribution of the Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites over the Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts significantly impacted not only the formation of the organic by-products, but also the tendency to coking. Coking in steam reforming was more serious in reforming of the alcohols with less hydroxyl group (i.e. 1-propanol) over Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, while was more serious in reforming of the alcohols with more hydroxyl group (i.e. glycerol) over Ni-SiO2 catalyst. The Ni-Al2O3 catalyst contained both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites, while Ni-SiO2 catalyst contained mainly Lewis acidic sites. The Brønsted acidic sites over Ni-Al2O3 promoted the dehydration reactions, which was probably responsible for the serious coking in the reforming of 1-propanpol. The Lewis acidic sites promoted the dehydrogenation reactions, forming more aldehydes/ketones, which was probably responsible for the formation of serious coking in steam reforming of glycerol over Ni-SiO2 catalyst. In addition, coke formed over both Ni-Al2O3 or Ni-SiO2 catalysts showed amorphous or nanotube forms, but the contents of the two types of cokes were different. When catalyzing propanol, coke mainly exhibited an amorphous state on Ni-Al2O3, and a nanotube state in Ni-SiO2. When catalyzing 1,2-propanediol and glycerol, the content of fibrous coke in Ni-Al2O3 increased, while Ni-SiO2 mainly contained amorphous coke. The in-situ DRIFTS studies of steam reforming of 1-propanol or 2-propanol confirmed that Ni-Al2O3 catalyst catalyzed the formation of olefins via dehydration at the temperature even as low as 100 °C, while Ni-SiO2 catalyst tended to catalyzed the formation of ketones and ethers. The distinct reaction intermediates formed led to the formation of the different form of coke species. The detailed mechanism for the acid types over the heterogeneous catalysts on distribution of the products in steam reforming needs further investigation."
