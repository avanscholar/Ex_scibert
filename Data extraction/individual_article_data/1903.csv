0,Introduction,"The world is craving for the alternative energy resources due to the increasing energy crisis. Moreover, the existing energy resources are non-environment friendly not only due to the emission of greenhouse gases but also unaffordable because of their increasing cost. Therefore, intensive research is going on throughout the world to develop an environmental-friendly technology that could be affordable and accessible. Gaseous form of energy (fuel) has several advantages over solid and liquid fuels viz. high heat content, easy transportation, controlled combustion (oxidizing or reducing atmosphere, length of flame, temperature, etc.), clean (burn without any shoot or smoke and ashes) and free from impurities found in solid and liquid fuels. Among different gaseous fuels, molecular hydrogen is regarded as the most promising future energy source because of its highest energy content (143kJ/g) and environmental friendly nature (no CO2 emission) (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). The advantage of biological hydrogen production is to use a wide variety of waste products as substrate for gaseous energy generation at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Organic waste/wastewater has very high COD which is detrimental for the environment, but can act as a source for energy generation. It has been reported that 5.2 million tons of solid waste is generated daily worldwide, of which 3.8 million tons comes from developing countries (Modak, 2011). Therefore, utilization of wastes can serve the dual purpose of energy generation and bioremediation. Production of hydrogen has been reported from various organic wastewaters viz. confectionary effluent Ueno et al. (1996), paper mill wastewater (Kádár et al., 2004), starchy wastewater (Wu and Lin, 2004), food wastes (Kotay and Das, 2007), corn syrup wastewater (Hafez et al., 2009), distillery effluent (Kamalaskar et al., 2010) etc. which are potent sources of water pollution due to higher COD. Distillery industry has been listed among top 17 most polluting industries in India by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB, 2009–2010). It generates 8–15L of effluent per liter of alcohol produced with a high COD (60–200g/L) and BOD (25–75g/L) (Chauhan and Dikshit, 2012). Organic wastewater can be used as a potential feedstock for the biohydrogen production process. Mixed consortium harbors a variety of microorganisms (Roy et al., 2012). Hydrolytic enzymes produced by different microbes may help in the efficient utilization of various complex substrates present in wastewater. Biohydrogen production has been reported using mixed consortium (Mohan et al., 2008; Roy et al., 2012), various co-cultures and pure cultures using DE. The DE used in this study is derived from starch based feedstock (Mishra and Das, 2014). Most of the reports regarding hydrogen production are based on cane molasses derived DE (Vatsala et al., 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, no report is available for comparing the biohydrogen production potential of mixed consortium, synthetic co-culture and pure culture using starch based DE. The present study deals with a comparative analysis of hydrogen production potential of enriched acidogenic mixed consortium (AMC), synthetic co-culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 and Citrobacter freundii IIT-BT L139) and pure culture (K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08) using DE. It also throws light on the gaseous energy recovery (as hydrogen) of the process."
1,Methods,
2,Collection and characterization of distillery effluent,"2.1 Collection and characterization of distillery effluent Rice based DE was collected from IFB Agro Industries Ltd., West Bengal and used in the present investigation. Characteristics of DE was determined using the standard methods (APHA, 1998) as reported by Mishra and Das (2014). The carbohydrate composition of DE was analyzed by using HPLC and starch content was estimated by iodine test."
3,Enrichment of acidogenic mixed consortium,"2.2 Enrichment of acidogenic mixed consortium Anaerobic sludge collected from IFB Agro Industries Ltd., Kolkata has been used as seed culture in the present study. For enrichment, 20mL of the collected slurry has been inoculated into 60mL of anaerobic media (glucose: 10g/L; yeast extract: 0.34g/L; NH4Cl: 0.84g/L; K2HPO4: 0.234g/L; KH2PO4: 0.136g/L; MgCl2·6H2O: 0.084g/L; FeCl3: 0.05g/L, Na2SO4: 0.5g/L, cysteine HCl (1g/L), 6.5 pH, 40mM of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and vitamins solution (DSMZ medium No. 141, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in 100mL serum bottle for 24h. Anaerobic conditions has been maintained by sparging the media with nitrogen gas for 30min (Roy et al., 2012). 2.2.1 Single parameter optimization for hydrogen production using acidogenic mixed consortium Initial pH, operational temperature and suitable substrate concentration do play an important role towards hydrogen production (Ginkel et al., 2001). In the present study, above mentioned process parameters were studied for the improvement of hydrogen production. The experiments were performed in 100mL serum bottles (working volume of 80mL) under strict anaerobic conditions. Hydrogen production by AMC was studied in media containing glucose (10g/L), yeast extract (2g/L) and tryptone (10g/L). 2.2.2 Development of acclimatized acidogenic mixed consortium using DE To develop acclimatized AMC, glucose media was fortified with DE at varying concentration viz. 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% (v/v). Culture was transferred from lower to higher concentration of DE after every 12–14h."
4,Microorganism and culture conditions for pure strains,"2.3 Microorganism and culture conditions for pure strains The isolates used in the present study were K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08, C. freundii IIT-BT L139 and Bacillus coagulans IIT-BT S1 (Kumar and Das, 2000). These strains were grown overnight aerobically at 37°C in NB medium (Himedia) in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) at 180rpm. Malt extract (10g/L), yeast extract (4g/L) and glucose (10g/L) was used for hydrogen production. The CFU count technique was used to estimate the number of active cells present in the inoculum."
5,Experimental conditions,"2.4 Experimental conditions The batch fermentation was performed in 500mL double jacketed reactors (working volume of 400mL) at 37°C for 12–14h at 180rpm. DE was centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10min to remove the suspended solids. The supernatant was collected, autoclaved and used for fermentation studies. Nitrogen gas was sparged to create an anaerobic environment. The gas produced during batch fermentation was passed through 40% (w/v) KOH solution for selective absorption of CO2. The remaining gas was collected in a gas collector by displacement of 10% (w/v) saline at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure. The fermentation broth was analyzed to find out the biomass concentration, substrate consumption, and the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production. The batch experiment was continued until hydrogen production ceased. Composition of the gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were done by Gas chromatography. All the samples for VFA analysis were drawn during the maximum hydrogen production phase."
6,"Hydrogen production study with pure culture, synthetic co-culture and mixed culture using distillery effluent","2.5 Hydrogen production study with pure culture, synthetic co-culture and mixed culture using distillery effluent Batch fermentation for hydrogen production by AMC, synthetic co-culture and pure cultures (K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08, C. freundii IIT-BT L139) under optimized parameters were performed in a controlled fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) with working volume of 2L. The modified Gompertz equation was used to fit cumulative hydrogen production in the batch process performed under optimum conditions. (1) H ( t ) = P exp - exp R m × e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H(t) is the cumulative hydrogen volume at time t (h), P (mLH2) represents hydrogen potential obtained during stationary phase, R m (mLH2/h) represents maximum hydrogen production rate obtained during exponential phase, and λ (h) represents lag time. The typical cumulative hydrogen production curve in all cases was nonlinearly modeled using Eq. (1). Parameters (P, R m and λ) were estimated using the solver function in Matlab (Curve fitting tool box ver. 1.1.7.) (Datar et al., 2007)."
7,"PCR–DGGE, DNA cloning and sequencing","2.6 PCR–DGGE, DNA cloning and sequencing The enriched AMC grown under optimized condition was considered for microbial community analysis. Total genomic DNA was extracted using Ultra Clean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio). The extracted DNA was stored in 30mL TE (TrisHCl EDTA) solution of pH 8.0 at −20°C. PCR was performed by amplifying a region of 170bp of 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA using eubacteria primer pairs 357F with GC clamp (5′GC-clamp-CCAAGGAAGGCAGCAGGC-3′) and 534R (5′ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) (Roy et al., 2012). The PCR was performed using following program: denaturation at 95°C for 3min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 1min, 55°C for 1min, 72°C for 3min, and final extension step at 72°C, 10min using Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, USA). The structure of the bacterial community was analyzed by DGGE using a D-Code system (BIORAD Laboratories, USA). The samples for PCR were loaded onto 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (pH 7.5). Polyacrylamide gels with 20–50% gradient of denaturant (7M urea and 40% deionized formamide) were prepared. The electrophoresis run was conducted at 60°C, for 20h at 200V. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained in EtBr for 45min and observed under UV light. The DNA fragments were excised from the gel and placed in sterilized vials. DNA was eluted by adding 20μL of sterile water and kept at 4°C overnight. Elute volume of 10μL was used as the template DNA in PCR, using the primers without GC clamp. PCR products were sequenced in a commercial facility (SciGenom, Kochi, India)."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods 2.7.1 Gas chromatography The hydrogen produced during batch fermentation has been analyzed by Gas chromatograph (GC Agilent Technology 7890A, U.S.A.). The GC is equipped with a stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 80°C, 150°C and 200°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20mL/min. Flame ionization detector (FID) was used for the estimation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols. The FID operational temperatures of the injection port, the detector, and programmed column were 220°C, 240°C, and 130–175°C, respectively. For flame generation, a mixture of hydrogen and air was used at a flow rate of 30mL/min (Khanna et al., 2011). 2.7.2 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis Carbohydrate composition of the DE was analyzed by HPLC. An Agilent 1200 HPLC series (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a multi wavelength detector was used together with Agilent Eclipse-XDB C18 analytical column (5μm, 250×4.6mm internal diameter) as stationary phase to perform the experiments. Two mobile solvents were employed (A, acetonitrile; B, isopropanol) following the gradient elution (1min, 85% A; 19min, 50% A; 21min, 85% A) at the flow rate of 1.4mL/min. Left and right column temperature were controlled at 30°C. Samples were injected using a manual injection port (20μL injection volume). Calibration curves for 10 different sugars viz., glucose (R 2 =0.97), maltose (R 2 =0.97), sucrose (R 2 =0.96), xylose (R 2 =0.97), lactose (R 2 =0.97), ribose (R 2 =0.97), mannose (R 2 =0.99), fructose (R 2 =0.95), galactose (R 2 =0.97) and arabinose (R 2 =0.99) were prepared using their standard (Sigma). Retention time for glucose, maltose, sucrose, xylose, lactose, ribose, mannose, fructose, galactose and arabinose were identified at 5.13, 9.18, 7.2, 3.64, 10.65, 3.26, 4.88, 4.42, 5.44 and 4.08min, respectively. 2.7.3 COD, carbohydrate and biomass analysis Total carbohydrate content was estimated spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS Spectrophotometer Perkin–Elmer, λ =490nm) using phenol–sulfuric acid assay (Ginkel et al., 2001). The COD was estimated based on the APHA standard protocols using a COD measurement instrument (DRB200 & DR2800 Portable Spectrophotometer HACH®, USA). The pH was monitored using a desktop pH meter (pH 510, Cyberscan, Singapore). Biomass was measured turbidimetrically at 600nm using UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer LLC, MA, USA). Sample (5mL) was drawn aseptically, centrifuged and washed three times with phosphate buffer; thereafter it was dried in pre-weighed aluminum boats at 95°C till three consecutive constant readings were obtained."
9,Staining protocol for scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.8 Staining protocol for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Scanning electron microscopic images were employed to study the morphology of the developed mixed consortium using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM 5800). The culture was fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 4h. The fixed cells were then dehydrated by successive passages through 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% ethanol each for 10min. Gram staining was also performed to understand the morphological characteristics (Gram negative or Gram positive) of the bacterial population in the mixed consortium."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Performance of acidogenic mixed consortium for hydrogen production,"3.1 Performance of acidogenic mixed consortium for hydrogen production The biogas produced by AMC showed absence of methane, thereby indicating a successful suppression of methanogens. The use of BES which is an inhibitor of methyl CoM reductase has helped in development of a stable AMC. Similar strategy has been reported for methanogen suppression (Gunsalus et al., 1978). Major constituents of the gas were H2 (65±5%), and CO2 (34±5%). Gram staining and SEM images showed the dominance of rod-shaped Gram positive bacteria in the developed AMC. Microscopic image is shown in Fig. S1. Wastewater contains different carbon sources. The hydrogen production potential of the AMC was studied using different carbon sources (Fig. 1 ). Among various types of carbon sources, glucose (1145±32mL/L), sucrose (1080±20mL/L) and xylose (950±22mL/L) showed significantly higher hydrogen production as compared to maltose (400±20mL/L) and lactose (300±30mL/L). The above observation indicates that the enriched AMC has a broad spectrum of enzymatic machineries that help in utilizing both pentose (xylose) and hexoses (sucrose, maltose, glucose, and lactose) for hydrogen production. Thus, such type of mixed culture can be used for utilization of complex organic residues such as DE, starchy wastewater etc. 3.1.1 Biohydrogen production under optimized process parameters The effect of initial glucose concentration was studied from 6 to 16g/L (Fig. 2 a). Initial substrate concentration of 10g/L showed maximum cumulative hydrogen production, glucose conversion efficiency and biomass production of 49±0.38mmol/L, 55±0.03% and 1.81±0.04g/L, respectively. A subsequent decrease in hydrogen production was observed with the increase in substrate concentration beyond 10g/L. This may be due to substrate inhibition (Akutsu et al., 2009; Staniszewski, 2009). The effect of initial pH (ranging from 5 to 8) was studied using 10g/L glucose. Initial pH of 6.5 was found to be most suitable for cumulative hydrogen production, glucose conversion and biomass production of 51±0.02mmol/L, 52.7±2.3% and 1.84±0.03g/L, respectively (Fig. 2b). Operational pH plays a critical role in determining the hydrogen yield as they influence the fermentation end product formation and the activity of key enzyme hydrogenase (Xiao et al., 2013). The operational temperature was varied from 31°C to 39°C at an interval of 2°C using optimum glucose concentration (10g/L) and initial pH (6.5). Maximum hydrogen production was observed at 37°C with cumulative hydrogen production and glucose conversion of 57.2±1.2mmol/L and 57±1.2%, respectively (Fig. 2c). Further increase in the temperature resulted in decreased hydrogen production. The enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways for the optimum growth and H2 production are dependent on the temperature (Peterson et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015). Temperature greater than 37°C might have led to deactivation of vital enzyme responsible for H2 production. Under optimized process parameters, the maximum hydrogen yield and cumulative H2 production of 1.8mol/mol glucose converted and 1280mL/L, respectively were observed. 3.1.2 Microbial community analysis Microbial community profile under the optimized parameters was studied by DGGE and the phylogenetic tree was plotted by using MEGA4 program (Fig. 3 ). Seven prominent bands were observed in the DGGE gel. Sequence of each band was matched with NCBI-database which eventually helped in identifying respective taxonomic affiliations. The sequences of bands Nos. 2, 3 and 4 showed similarity with Clostridium sp. and Eubacterium sp. However, bands 1, 5, 6 and 7 showed similarity with non-hydrogen producing microorganisms. Therefore, the mixed consortium developed in this study showed dominance of microorganisms which are widely reported as hydrogen producers. Similar studies are reported where BES and pH was used for enrichment of acidogenic mixed culture showed dominance of Clostridium species (Beckers et al., 2015; Mei et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006). 3.1.3 Performance of acidogenic mixed consortium for hydrogen production using distillery effluent H2 production was studied using distillery effluent under optimized process parameters. Distillery effluent used in this study contains 38,000±300mg/L soluble COD and total carbohydrate content of 7.5±0.5g/L. Carbohydrate composition of the DE (soluble part) comprised of mainly starch (6.1±0.4g/L), glucose (3.2±0.2g/L) and maltose (0.9±0.01g/L). AMC showed cumulative H2 production, COD reduction and carbohydrate conversion of 87.5±1.5mmol/L, 29±0.1 and 42±1.2%, respectively. Production started after 90min of inoculation and only 40% of the theoretical yield was achieved. DE comprised of a high concentration of ethanol (>1000ppm) which could be one of the reasons for increased lag phase during microbial growth. Therefore, for the further studies, the AMC was acclimatized in DE fortified media. The acclimatized consortium showed 1.6 folds increase in cumulative hydrogen production (142±2.1mmol/L) with improved carbohydrate reduction and COD reduction of 62±4.0 and 40±2.5%, respectively. Start up time for H2 production was reduced to 15min and maximum hydrogen was produced during 3rd to 7th h. Moreover, maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield of 480±20mL/Lh and 9.17±0.04mol/kgCODreduced were also observed on acclimatized AMC (Fig. 4 ). A comparative study related to use of distillery effluent for hydrogen production is shown in Table 1 . The hydrogen yield observed in the present study was comparable with other reported literatures. Moreover, the average hydrogen production rate (267±20mL/Lh) was higher as compared to other batch studies reported using distillery effluent."
12,Comparison of synthetic co-culture with enriched acidogenic mixed culture for hydrogen production,"3.2 Comparison of synthetic co-culture with enriched acidogenic mixed culture for hydrogen production 3.2.1 Study of hydrogen production potential of selected strains Three microbial strains viz. K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 (Kumar and Das, 2000), B. coagulans IIT-BT S1 (Kotay and Das, 2007) and C. freundii IIT-BT L139 (Gunasekaran et al., 2006) isolate ed previously were compared for hydrogen production using MYG media and raw DE. In case of MYG, maximum hydrogen production of 73.9±2.6mmol/L was shown by C. freundii followed by K. pneumoniae (58.9±3.5mmol/L) and B. coagulans (32.5±2.1mmol/L) (Fig. 5 ). COD reduction of 79.5±2.9%, 67.2±3.0% and 48.9±2.1% were observed with C. freundii, K. pneumoniae and B. coagulans, respectively. The maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 55±0.9mmol/L was observed by using DE by C. freundii. The maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 48.7±0.7mmol/L and 31.5±0.6mmol/L were observed with K. pneumoniae and B. coagulans, respectively (Fig. 5). COD reduction of 45.3±2.9%, 32.0±1.5% and 27.3±3.2% were observed with C. freundii, K. pneumoniae and B. coagulans, respectively. During dark fermentative hydrogen production, one mol of glucose produces 4mol hydrogen by acetate pathway. However, two mol of hydrogen is formed by butyrate pathway (Das and Veziroglu, 2008). It has been observed that a higher A/B ratio leads to increase in hydrogen production (Khanna et al., 2011). Volatile fatty acid analysis showed higher A/B ratio in the case of C. freundii as compared to other two strains that might be the reason for the higher hydrogen production. 3.2.2 Performance of synthetic co-culture for hydrogen production From the above observations, K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 and C. freundii IIT-BT L139 were found promising for H2 production. So, development of synthetic co-culture using these two organisms was studied. Co-culture of K. pneumonia and C. freundii (K/C) in 1:1 ratio (1.6±0.1*109 CFU/mL each) improved the hydrogen production by 1.7 folds (103.8±1.8mmol/L) as compared to K. pneumoniae (58±0.9mmol/L) or 1.4 folds as compared to C. freundii (75.9±1.2mmol/L) (Fig. 6 a). Glucose conversion was also found to be higher in case of co-culture (90.0±1.2%) as compared to the K. pneumoniae (82±0.8%) and C. freundii (86±0.6%). Increased hydrogen yield of 1.99±0.06mol/mol glucose consumed with co-culture was observed which is comparable to the other reported studies (Cheng and Zhu, 2013; Patel and Kalia, 2013). A higher A/B ratio (1.58±0.05) was observed with co-culture as compared to K. pneumoniae (1.04±0.01) and C. freundii (1.30±0.04). Acetate formation rate was found maximum between early and mid-exponential phase. However, butyrate production rate was increased after late exponential phase and stationary phase. Therefore, A/B ratio was found above 1 at the time of maximum H2 production rate (at mid log phase). However, at stationary phase, when H2 production ceased, the ratio was decreased below 1 (range of 0.2–0.5). Propionate was found minimum in co-culture (55±3.6ppm) as compared to K. pneumoniae (240±3.6ppm) and C. freundii (231±3.1ppm) at the mid log phase. So, a syntrophic association was predicted between K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 and C. freundii IIT-BT L139 which could be responsible for the improved hydrogen production. 3.2.3 Optimization of the microbial ratio in synthetic co-culture for the improvement of H2 production It was observed that co-culture of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii improved the hydrogen production as compared to their individual fermentation. Effect of the different ratio (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1) of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii on hydrogen production was studied with glucose concentration as a substrate. The maximum hydrogen yield of 2.07±0.09mol/mol glucose consumed was observed with K/C ratio of 1:1 (103.8±2.4mmol/L). K/C ratio of 1:2 and 2:1 showed hydrogen yield of 1.82±0.04mol/mol glucose (89.2±0.8mmol/L) and 1.76±0.06mol/mol glucose (84.4±1.2mmol/L), respectively. Substrate conversion efficiency of 90±1.1% was observed with 1:1 co-culture ratio. On using K/C ratio of 1:2 and 2:1, the substrate conversion efficiency of 88.4±1.5% and 87±0.9%, were observed, respectively. A/B ratio was found slightly higher in the case of 1:1K/C ratio (1.50±0.06) as compared to 1:2 ratio (1.30±0.04) and 2:1 ratio (1.17±0.02). Biomass production of 2.76±0.08g/L, 2.69±0.09g/L, and 2.51±0.01g/L were observed with the co-culture ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 respectively (Fig. 6b). Co-culture ratio of 1:1 was observed as most suitable for biohydrogen production. Variation in the K/C ratio (1:2 and 2:1) led to non-significant improvement in the hydrogen production. Growth kinetics of K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08, C. freundii IIT-BT L139 and co-culture were studied using Lineweaver–Burk plot. Maximum specific growth rate (μ max) of C. freundii IIT-BT L139 (0.42h−1) was found higher as compared to K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 (0.36h−1). Saturation constant (K s) of C. freundii IIT-BT L139 and K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 were found to be 6.84 and 3.64g/L, respectively. 3.2.4 Hydrogen production by synthetic co-culture using distillery effluent From the above study, K/C ratio of 1:1 was found optimum for hydrogen production. The co-culture of this ratio was further used to study its potentiality for hydrogen production using DE. Hydrogen production was studied at different initial pH (5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5) using DE. Cumulative hydrogen production of 48.1±1.1mmol/L, 61.5±1.2mmol/L, 69.7±0.7mmol/L and 67.3±1.1mmol/L was observed with initial pH of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. The initial pH of 7.0 was found suitable for hydrogen production (Fig. 6c). Hydrogen production pattern indicates that the cumulative hydrogen produced in 10–12h at pH 6.5 and 7.0 was equivalent to the hydrogen produced in 18h at pH 7.5. A/B ratio was also found higher at pH 7.5 as compared to the 6.5 and 7.0. This indicates that the increase in initial pH (beyond 7.0) leads to decrease hydrogen production rate with prolonged production time probably due to the metabolic shift from the acetate pathway to butyrate pathway leading to lower hydrogen yield. Further, hydrogen production by co-culture was studied in the fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) under optimum conditions using DE. Cumulative hydrogen production of 117.4±1.1mmol/L was observed. The organic load was reduced by 37.3±0.15% with hydrogen yield of 8.76±0.04mol/kgCODreduced. Hydrogen production is compared with the reported data using distillery effluent (Table 1)."
13,"Comparison of hydrogen production by pure culture, co-culture and mixed consortium using distillery effluent in a controlled fermenter","3.3 Comparison of hydrogen production by pure culture, co-culture and mixed consortium using distillery effluent in a controlled fermenter Hydrogen production by co-culture (K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 and C. freundii IIT-BT L139) and AMC was compared with the pure cultures using DE. Experiments were carried out in a fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA), at optimized conditions, in a working volume of 2L. The cumulative hydrogen production by AMC (156±1.9mmol/L) was found 33.3% and 58.8% higher as compared to the co-culture (117.4±1.1mmol/L) and K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 (98.2±1.4mmol/L), respectively using DE. Hydrogen production by AMC, co-culture and K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 was analyzed by modified Gompertz equation using glucose and distillery effluent as substrate (Table 2 ). Hydrogen production potentials (P) of AMC (2698mL/L) and co-culture (2694mL/L) were higher as compared to K. pneumoniae (1498mL/L). Maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) was found higher in AMC as compared to co-culture and pure strain with glucose as a substrate. Similar trend was observed using distillery effluent. Hydrogen production potential (P) and maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) were found highest in AMC (3729mL/L, 507mL/Lh) followed by co-culture (2694mL/L, 426.5mL/Lh) and K. pneumoniae (1816mL/L, 347.9mL/Lh). Lag time of AMC was also found less as compared to co-culture and pure culture. Clostridium sp. has been reported to contain Fe–Fe hydrogenase which can produce 4mol of hydrogen from 1mol of glucose. However, the facultative anaerobes like Citrobacter and Klebsiella sp. contains formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) complex for hydrogen production with theoretical hydrogen yield of 2mol of hydrogen per mol of glucose (Sinha and Pandey, 2011). Therefore, this could be the possible reason for the higher rate of hydrogen production by the developed consortium which contained bacteria related to Clostridium sp. as compared to the synthetic co-culture and pure culture."
14,Gaseous energy analysis,"3.4 Gaseous energy analysis Gaseous energy recovery (in terms of hydrogen produced) was calculated based on Eq. (2) (2) Gaseous energy recovery = Gaseous energy produced ( as hydrogen ) Total energy in the substrate Gaseous energy (as hydrogen) of 7.98 and 9.71kcal/L were generated from AMC by using glucose and DE, respectively. This was found higher compared to the co-culture and K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08. The maximum gaseous energy of 21.4% and 42.3% were recovered in case of glucose and DE, respectively using AMC. Co-culture and pure culture (K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08) showed energy recovery of 19.3% and 11.1% with glucose and 34.7% and 29.1% with DE, respectively. The amount of gaseous energy recovered from DE by fermentation on using AMC, co-culture and pure culture was analyzed. Gaseous energy recovery was maximum in case of AMC mediated fermentation of DE as compared to co-culture and pure culture (Table 3 )."
15,Conclusion,"A syntrophic association is predicted between K. pneumoniae IIT-BT 08 and C. freundii IIT-BT L139 and their co-culture showed improvement in hydrogen production. AMC was found suitable as compared to co-culture and pure culture for hydrogen production using DE. DGGE analysis showed dominance of Clostridium sp. in the AMC which could be a major contributing species for high hydrogen production rate. However, further investigations are in progress to understand the population dynamics of the co-culture, the mechanism of the shift of metabolic electron flow from butyrate/propionate to acetate pathways and microbial interaction and stability of the AMC during hydrogen production."
