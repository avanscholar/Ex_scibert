0,Introduction,"Electrospinning is a popular technique for fabricating the nanoscale fibers due to its simplicity, versatility, and low cost. Over the past decade, electrospinning has been an alternative to the conventional phase inversion technique for the preparation of highly porous structure of nanofibers (Lim, 2017; Pillay et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2020). These nanofibers have a wide range of applications in various fields, for instance, healthcare, biomedical engineering, water treatment, energy generation and environmental remediation (Agarwal, Wendorff, & Greiner, 2008; Lim, 2017; Qiu et al., 2020; Schneiderman, Zhang, Fong, & Menkhaus, 2011; Yoo, Kim, & Park, 2009). Functionalization of nanofiber membrane can be accomplished either through surface modification or by adding flexible polymer solution prior to electrospinning (Çay, Miraftab, & Kumbasar, 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Conventionally, the surface modification of the nanofiber membrane can be achieved by physical adsorption or multi-step chemical grafting reactions (Yoo et al., 2009). Although the surface modification of nanofibers is easily achievable at lab scale, the mass production of these functionalized nanofibers is often restricted by the difficulty in scaling up the setup used in the step of surface modification (Ahmed, Lalia, & Hashaikeh, 2015). On the other hand, the incorporation of functional additives (e.g., flexible polymer solution) into the electrospinning solution is relatively straightforward (Deng et al., 2011, 2012; Tijing et al., 2012) and this approach is also more feasible for the large-scale production. Nonetheless, the challenge remains in determining the optimal operating conditions for the preparation of functionalized nanofibers with additives. Recently, natural biopolymers have been widely used as nanofiber materials because of their unique biological characteristics such as non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility (Kulkarni Vishakha, Butte Kishor, & Rathod Sudha, 2012). Chitosan (CS), a natural cationic polysaccharide, possesses high antibacterial activity (Cooper, Oldinski, Ma, Bryers, & Zhang, 2013; Kong, Chen, Xing, & Park, 2010; Verlee, Mincke, & Stevens, 2017). Furthermore, CS can be easily functionalized by additives in a flexible polymer solution, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) (Gholipour-Kanani, Bahrami, & Nouri, 2009; Kohsari, Shariatinia, & Pourmortazavi, 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Nonetheless, CS exhibits poor water solubility and a low antibacterial efficacy at high pH. Hence, its application is only limited to acidic condition (i.e., pH < 6.5) (Alipour, Nouri, Mokhtari, & Bahrami, 2009; Mi, Vijayaragavan, & Heldt, 2014). The antibacterial efficacy and water solubility of HTCC are higher than that of CS. The antibacterial action of HTCC was postulated to be driven by the interaction of its positively charged quaternized amino group with the negatively charged microbial cell membrane, resulting in the loss of membrane permeability, leakage of microbial proteins and other intracellular components, which eventually cause the cell death (Hu & Wang, 2016). Despite that, a pure HTCC aqueous solution is not electrospinnable due to its low viscosity (Deng et al., 2012). Therefore, PVA has been commonly added to the HTCC solution for promoting its electrospinnability (Alipour et al., 2009; Mi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). PVA and HTCC are fully compatible and miscible due to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups of HTCC and PVA. However, the high hydrophilicity of PVA/HTCC nanofiber causes the dissolution of the nanofiber in aqueous medium and hinder its application of PVA/HTCC nanofiber in any hydrophilic medium. To overcome this challenge, the PVA/HTCC nanofibers have been synthesized using the photo-mediated crosslinking method (Ignatova, Starbova, Markova, Manolova, & Rashkov, 2006). To improve the mechanical and physical properties of the composite membranes made from CS, HTCC and/or PVA mixture, various reagents have been incorporated in the membrane formulation as crosslinkers. These crosslinkers include glutaraldehyde (GA) vapor (Khalaji, Ebrahimi, & Hosseinkhani, 2020; Mi & Heldt, 2014; Mi et al., 2014), GA solution (Wang, Fang, Yoon, Hsiao, & Chu, 2006; Yu, Song, Shi, Xu, & Bin, 2011), epoxy (Jawad, Mamat, Hameed, & Ismail, 2019), and diisocyanates (Choudhari, Kittur, Kulkarni, & Kariduraganavar, 2007; Jones, 2008; Nirmala, Lee, Navamathavan, Yang, & Kim, 2011; Lee et al., 2010). Among them, the GA vapor diffusion technique is commonly adopted in the crosslinking of CS derivatives and PVA membranes (Khalaji et al., 2020; Mi & Heldt, 2014; Mi et al., 2014). However, manipulating the content of crosslinker in the membrane is challenging due to the formation of heterogeneous phases between the GA vapor and the membrane. Moreover, the specific properties (e.g., porosity, and pore size of crosslinked membrane) are difficult to be controlled via this crosslinking technique. Although GA has been widely used as a chemical crosslinker (Khalaji et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2014; Wang, Chen et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2011), its application may lead to the cell toxicity and biohazard problems. As noted in the previous studies (Huang-Lee, Cheung, & Nimni, 1990; Powell & Boyce, 2006; van Luyn et al., 1992), the cytotoxic effects exerted by GA on the cells reduced the cellular growth both in vitro and in vivo; thereby, the application of GA in biomedical products is limited (Oryan, Kamali, Moshiri, Baharvand, & Daemi, 2018). The water-soluble blocked diisocyanate (BI) can potentially overcome the above-mentioned limitations and act as an alternative crosslinker. The advantages and disadvantages of BI (water soluble) and GA (vapor) employed in the preparation of water-insoluble nanofiber membranes are presented in Table S1 (Supporting information) (Choudhari et al., 2007; Jones, 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Nirmala et al., 2011). From the perspectives of safety, reactivity, and scalability, BI is superior to GA as a crosslinker. BI possesses high reactivity towards amine as well as hydroxyl groups (e.g., CS, PVA and HTCC) (Choudhari et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010). Furthermore, the preparation time is much shorter and the properties of crosslinked membrane (e.g., porosity and pore size) can be controlled easily by adjusting the amount of BI added to react with the PVA and/or HTCC. Lee et al. (2010) have successfully crosslinked PVA nanofibers with BI. It was also found that the use of isopropyl alcohol could improve the miscibility of solution and the uniformity of nanofibers. In addition, the water resistance of the PVA/BI nanofibers could be enhanced by a post heat treatment process. It was reported that the morphology of the crosslinked nanofibers remained unchanged after the nanofibers were immersed in water (Choudhari et al., 2007; Gao, Takizawa, & Kimura, 2013; Nirmala et al., 2011; Welsh, Schauer, Qadri, & Price, 2002). To our best knowledge, there is no study reporting the preparation of composite nanofiber by incorporating water-soluble BI into PVA/HTCC polymer solution for electrospinning. Therefore, in this work, antimicrobial nanofiber membrane was synthesized by electrospinning a mixture of PVA/HTCC/BI, wherein the addition of PVA and BI in the formulation of electrospinning solution improved the electrospinnability and water resistance of nanofiber membranes. One of the highlights in this work is the higher efficiency of crosslinking of the PVA/HTCC/BI composite membranes as compared to crosslinking performances of GA vapor, epoxy derivatives (Vakili et al., 2018), and maleic anhydride (Qin & Wang, 2008) reported so far. The characterization of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes was performed using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The mechanical properties, swelling behaviour, and water resistance were also investigated. Moreover, the antibacterial efficacy of the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane against Escherichia coli (E. coli) were investigated. E. coli was used as the model bacteria in this study because of the ease of culture in lab setting and the minimal health hazards caused by the bacteria (Azizi, Ahmad, Mahdavi, & Abdolmohammadi, 2013; Hu, Wang, & Wang, 2016; Kim & Choi, 2002; Yuan & Cranston, 2008). Finally, the biocompatibility of as-synthesized PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane was investigated via the cytotoxicity test. The cell viability of mouse fibroblasts L929 was qualitatively confirmed using Live/Dead cell fluorescent imaging and the cytotoxicity of the membranes was further quantitatively measured by extract and direct methods using CCK-8 assay."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) spunbond fabric (basis mass: 15 g.m−2, thickness: 90 μm, fibre diameter: 300–500 μm) acting as a supporting layer was provided by Freudenberg Far Eastern Spunweb Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). PVA (molecular weight = 75,000–180,000 g/mol, degree of polymerization = ∼1,700, degree of hydrolysis = 98.5–99.2 %) was obtained from Changchun Group Co., Ltd.. CS with deacetylation degree, DD = 90–95 %, was obtained from Charming & Beauty Co., Ltd. (Taiwan), and the molecular weight of CS was in the ranges of 40,000–60,000, 200,000–220,000, 330,000–350,000 g/mol. Glycidyl-trimethyl-ammonium chloride (GTMAC), Mouse fibroblasts L929, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Triton X-100, Calcein AM, and ethidium homodimer-1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). BI was acquired from Fong Development Co., Ltd. (Taiwan) and its properties are presented in Table S2 (Supporting information). All other unlisted chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)."
3,Preparation of HTCC,"2.2 Preparation of HTCC CS was coupled with quaternary amines such as glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (GTMAC) to produce N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] CS chloride (HTCC) as shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting information) (Cheah et al., 2019). In brief, 1 g of CS with an average viscosity molecular weight of 340,000 g/mol was first dispersed in acetic acid solution (1 %, 100 mL) and the mixture was transferred to a 3-neck round bottom flask (250 mL). After addition of 2.5 g of GTMAC, the mixture was subjected to stirring at 200 rpm and 80 °C for 24 h. Next, the solution was dialyzed to remove any unreacted GTMAC. The clear solution was concentrated under vacuum at 70 °C using a rotary evaporator. For induction of precipitate formation, the concentrated solution was subsequent treated by cold acetone (400 mL) in an ice bath. The precipitates were collected and rinsed with cold acetone twice prior to drying at 105 °C for 12 h to obtain HTCC as the final product. The degree of quaternization (DQ) of HTCC was determined using a titration method as described elsewhere (Bai, Mi, Xiang, Heiden, & Heldt, 2013; Wu, Su, & Ma, 2006; Yu et al., 2011). A defined amount of HTCC was dissolved in deionized water, and Cl− in solution was titrated with silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution using potassium chromate as the indicator. DQ of the quaternary ammonium salt groups was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) D Q % = V × C M V × C M + W H T C C - V × C M × 314 / 161 × 100 where WHTCC is the weight of HTCC (g), the volume (V, mL) and concentration (CM , mol/L) of AgNO3 solution used for titration, respectively. The numbers 314 and 161 corresponded to the Mw of the repeat structural unit of HTCC and CS, respectively. Hydrogen atoms of –NH2 group on CS molecule can be substituted by the quaternary ammonium salt group, and the proportion of hydrogen atom being substituted was expressed by DQ. In this case, the measured DQ of HTCC was approximately 76.4 ± 4.3 %, confirming that quaternary ammonium salt groups had substituted the amino groups on CS."
4,Preparation of PVA/HTCC/BI spinning solution,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/HTCC/BI spinning solution HTCC (3 %, w/w) and PVA (10 %, w/w) solutions were prepared separately by dissolving HTCC and PVA in distilled water at 25 °C and 80 °C, respectively, under stirring at 200 rpm for 24 h. The electrospinning solution was prepared by mixing HTCC, PVA and BI thoroughly at 25 °C for 24 h until a homogeneous viscous solution was obtained. The PVA-to-HTCC mass ratio was set as 9:1, while the mass percentage of BI in the mixture was varied in the range of 0 %–3 %. For example, at 2 % BI, the mass ratio of PVA to HTCC is 88.2:9.8. The mixture was stirred. In this work, a two-step hot pressing treatment of PVA/THCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane was performed at different crosslinking temperatures. During the first step of the hot-pressing treatment, the process was carried out at 100 °C for 1 h. In the second step, the PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane was treated by hot pressing at 125−150 °C for 5 min, where the PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane was crosslinked with BI."
5,Electrospinning of PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane,"2.4 Electrospinning of PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane The electrospinning device was procured from Falco Tech Enterprise Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). The assembly of apparatus and the electrospinning procedures mentioned were based on a previous study (Cheah et al., 2019). The setup of the electrospinning device is illustrated in Fig. S2 (Supporting information). Electrospinning of the polymer solution was carried out at 25 °C. The needle gauge size, volume dispersion rate of the polymer solution, distance between the nozzle tip and the collector, and the rotation rate of the collector were fixed at 21-gauge, 1.2 mL/h, 15.8 cm, 15 kV, respectively. The composite nanofiber mat was collected on PET fabric and wound on a ground steel drum. The resulted nanofiber membrane is designated as PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane, and it contained a layer of PET sandwiched by nanofiber layers. Lastly, the membrane was subjected to a heat-pressing process at 100 °C for 1 h to compress the fiber layers. A heat-pressing process not only improves the adhesion of the nanofiber layer onto the PET supporting matrix, but also results in a better pore size distribution and a smaller pore sizes (Chiu, Lin, Cheng, & Chou, 2011; Li & Liu, 2013; Woo et al., 2017; Yao, Woo, Tijing, Cesarini, & Shon, 2017)."
6,Physical and mechanical properties of composite nanofiber membranes,"2.5 Physical and mechanical properties of composite nanofiber membranes The morphology of nanofiber membrane was assessed using a SEM (Hitachi, Model S-2600 H/EDX, Japan). All samples were sputter-coated with platinum before SEM imaging. FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Model Spectrum One, USA) was applied in the determination of FTIR spectra at a resolution of 1 cm−1 in a wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1. TGA was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Mettle Toledo, Model Q600, USA) at a heating rate of 20 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Viscosity average molecular weight was determined by using an Ubbelohde viscometer following the methodology as reported elsewhere (Wang, Chen et al., 2006). The molecular weights of the main components in the nanofiber membranes were determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS, Agilent 6400 Series Triple Quadruple LC/MS system, Agilent Technologies, Inc., CA) adopting the positive/negative electrospray method. To confirm the chemical structure of nanofiber membrane, the 1H NMR spectrum (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) was obtained from an NMR spectrometer (600 MHz, Bruker, Germany). The mechanical properties of the PVA, PVA/HTCC, and PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes were measured using a universal test machine (Tinius Olsen H1KS, SDL ATLAS, USA) with an extension rate of 10 mm/min at room temperature. All samples were tested, and the averages of ultimate tensile strength (TS, MPa) Young’s modulus (YM, MPa), and elongation at break (EB, %) were determined from the stress-strain curves (Khalaji et al., 2020; Koosha & Mirzadeh, 2015; Lee et al., 2010). The data are presented as the average ± standard error."
7,Determination of PVA concentration,"2.6 Determination of PVA concentration The determination of PVA concentration was performed based on the following procedures: 0.4 mL of sample, 1.5 mL of boric acid solution (40 g/L) and 0.3 mL of iodine solution (0.025 g KI and 0.0127 g I2 in 1 mL of solution) were placed into the test tube and mixed. Absorbance was measured at 630 nm after 20 min of color development (Procházková, Rodríguez-Muñoz, & Procházka, 2014)."
8,Determination of isocyanate (NCO) content,"2.7 Determination of isocyanate (NCO) content The percentage weight of NCO was determined by reacting with an excess of di-n-butylamine (DBA) to form a urea derivative. The unreacted DBA was then titrated with standard hydrochloric acid concentration. The weight percentage of NCO can be calculated based on the amount of HCl used in the titration. The determination of NCO was performed by back titration. A standard solution of DBA was not required because the blank experiment reduced the error in the experiment. The weight percentage of NCO can be calculated as follows (Yuan et al., 2003): (2) N C O % , w / w = V o - V 1 1000 × W H B × C H C l × 42.03 × 100 where V o and V 1 are the volumes of HCl (0.1 M) titrated to the blank (mL) and sample, respectively; W HB is the mass of blocking agent sample (g). The extent of the crosslinking reaction was estimated by the percentage weight of NCO (%, w/w) released from the composite nanofiber membrane after the water solubility test: (3) N C O c r o s s l i n k i n g % = ( W N C O , a d d e d - W N C O , r e l e a s e d W N C O , a d d e d ) × 100 where W NCO,added is the initial amount of BI added into the electrospinning solution (g), W NCO,released refers to the amount of BI dissolved after the water solubility test (g)."
9,Water solubility and swelling tests,"2.8 Water solubility and swelling tests The nanofibers membranes were first cut into circles of 4.91 cm2 (i.d. = 2.5 mm) and subjected to drying at 60 °C for 24 h using a vacuum oven before use. Next, the dried nanofiber membranes (∼0.03 g) were immersed into 10 mL of water at 25 °C for 2 h. After the incubation, the sample was removed and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The weight loss of the composite nanofiber membrane sample (W, %) was determined using Eq. (4). (4) W ( % ) = W i - W f W i × 100 where W i and W f are the initial and final weights of the samples, respectively. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average values were reported. The swelling degree (S, %) of nanofiber mats was calculated using Eq. (5): (5) S ( % ) = D s w e l l i n g - D d r y D d r y × 100 where D swelling and D dry are the diameters of nanofiber after immersion time of 2 h at 25 °C in distilled water and in the dry state, respectively."
10,Antibacterial analysis,"2.9 Antibacterial analysis The AATCC 100 test method (Ali, Rajendran, & Joshi, 2011) was adopted to determine antibacterial property of the nanofiber membranes. The details of analysis have been described previously (Ng et al., 2020). The nanofiber membranes (4.91 cm2) were first incubated in 200 μL of E. coli cell suspension (∼2 × 106 cells/mL) for 24 h. Next, 20 mL of saline solution (0.85 %) was used to wash the nanofiber membranes. The antibacterial efficacy (AE) was calculated using Eq. (6) as shown below: (6) A E = A − B A × 100 % where A is the number of colony-forming unit isolated from the culture broth without any contact with the nanofiber membrane, while B refers to the number of colony-forming unit isolated from the culture broth in which the treated nanofiber membranes were submerged for 24 h. Each assessment was performed at least twice to ensure the repeatability of results. Experiments were performed in duplicate and the readings were taken in triplicate, whereby the average values were reported. The regenerated nanofiber membranes were also evaluated for their antimicrobial effect against E. coli. The nanofiber membranes were subjected to the repeated uses, and the AE of nanofiber membrane was reported. After one batch of antibacterial testing, the nanofiber membranes were immersed in distilled water for 30 min prior to the next round of testing."
11,Cytotoxicity and cell viability,"2.10 Cytotoxicity and cell viability 2.10.1 Extract test The sample extracts were prepared by reference to ISO 10993-12:2012 (Dorival-García, Larsson, & Bones, 2017). To prepare the sample extract solution, a sheet of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane (diameter: 25 mm, surface area: 4.9 cm2) was firstly soaked in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (volume =1 mL) for 24 h of treatment. Simultaneously, L929 cells were seeded in the wells of a 96-well plate and were incubated in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the extract solution (100 μL) was applied to the wells containing L929 cells at concentration = 1 × 104 cells/well. After 3 days of incubation, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, and the 96-well plate was continuously incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the measurement of OD value at wavelength 450 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay was repeated three times, and the cell viability was determined thereafter. 2.10.2 Direct contact test L929 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were first seeded into the 24-well plate containing the fabricated membranes (diameter: 25 mm, surface area: 4.9 cm2). The seeded well plate was then cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for 3 days. After the removal of culture medium, 500 μL of DMEM containing 50 μL of CCK-8 reagent was added to the wells followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, 100 μL of each sample was transferred onto a well of a 96-well plate (Corning, NY, USA), and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm (625 nm as a reference) using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells in the well without the PVA/HTCC/BI membrane were used as a negative control and the absorbance was taken as 100 %. Cells in the well with 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min were adopted as a positive control (Rabinovich et al., 2019). The absorbance values obtained from both experimental and positive groups were normalized with the negative control. All the samples were prepared in triplicate, and data were presented as mean ± SD. The cell viability was calculated by Eq. (7) (Zhao, Hu, & Xue, 2018): (7) C e l l v i a b i l i t y ( % ) = A s - A b A c - A b × 100 where A s is the absorbance of well containing cell, culture medium, CCK-8 solution, and membrane sample; A c is the absorbance of well containing cell, culture medium, and CCK-8 solution; A b is the absorbance of well without cell, culture medium, CCK-8 solution, and membrane sample. 2.10.3 Cell staining and fluorescence imaging To qualitatively evaluate the cell viability, the cells were first staining by fluorescent dye using the Live/Dead Cell Staining Kit as described previously (Rabinovich et al., 2019). In brief, L929 cells were first cultivated in the wells for 72 h. Based on the manual instruction, the dye solution was prepared by adding 4 μM of Calcein AM (live cell-green fluorescence) and 2 μM of ethidium homodimer-1 (dead cell-red fluorescence) into phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Prior to use, the dye mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Lastly, the images of live and dead cells were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM2500, with LED light source)."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Characterization of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane,"3.1 Characterization of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane The reaction pathways of the preparation of the BI and PVA/HTCC/BI crosslinked nanofiber are shown in Eqs. (8) and (9). A simplified reaction scheme for the crosslinking process (Jones, 2008; Lee et al., 2010) is also illustrated in Fig. 1 . (8) R − N C O ( I s o c y a n a t e ) + H B ( B l o c k i n g a g e n t ) ↔R − NHCO − B ( B I ) (9) R − N H C O − B ( B I ) + A ( P V A / H T C C ) → Δ R − N H C O − A ( P V A / H T C C / B I ) + B According to the stoichiometry, NCO groups on the BI molecule react with the OH groups on the PVA molecule at a molar ratio of 1:1. The percentage weight of NCO in BI solution was approximately 11.32 %, as estimated by Eq. (5). In this work, one sheet of the membrane (i.d. = 25 mm, area = 4.91 cm2) was ∼0.03 g, wherein the mass ratio of PVA, HTCC, and BI was 88.2:9.8:2.0 (at 2 % BI) or 87.3:9.7:3.0 (at 3 % BI). To maximize the crosslinking efficiency, an excess amount of BI solution was used. In the case, the total amounts of OH and NCO groups on PVA molecule were 0.174 μmol and 0.786 μmol (2 % BI)–1.179 μmol (3 % BI), respectively, and the molar ratio of NCO and OH was equivalent to 4.5–6.78. The experimental results showed that the percentage of crosslinking of PVA was about 97.7 %. The other 2 %–3 % of crosslinking activity might be contributed by the residual amine and OH groups in HTCC molecules. The residual amount of NCO after crosslinking reaction was determined to be approximately 77.85 % (2 % BI)–85.24 % (3 % BI). Firstly, CS samples with different Mw (50,000, 210,000, and 340,000 g/mol) were employed in a preliminary study of antibacterial efficacy (data not shown). Among them, CS with Mw of 50,000 g/mol was water soluble and others were water insoluble. The preliminary results showed that the AE of PVA/CS nanofiber membrane (9:1) increased with an increasing Mw of CS, corresponding to 46.73 % (CS 50,000 g/mol), 50.67 % (CS 210,000 g/mol), and 53.82 % (CS 340,000 g/mol), Hence, in this work, CS with an average viscosity molecular weight of 340,000 g/mol was chosen. The FTIR spectra of PVA, CS, and PVA/CS nanofiber membrane are shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(c). For the PVA spectrum, the broad band observed from 3100 to 3600 cm−1 was assigned to -O-H stretching due to the strong hydrogen bonding of intramolecular and intermolecular type. The stretching band at 2850−2950 cm−1 was attributed to the alkyl stretching mode. The absorption band from 1700 to 1750 cm−1 arises due to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl from the acetate group present in the partially hydrolyzed PVA polymer (Jeun, Jeon, Nho, & Kang, 2009; Wu et al., 2010). The results showed that the FTIR spectra of PVA and PVA/CS nanofiber membranes were almost identical, except for the missing absorption peak at 1260 cm−1 (OH) for PVA/CS nanofiber membranes. The bands appeared at 1650 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1 were attributed to the presence of amino group in CS (Yoo et al., 2009). For PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane, a resonance peak at 3429 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of HTCC indicated the NH stretching of the primary amino group in CS, thereby confirming the successful synthesis of PVA/HTCC solution as shown in Fig. 2(d) (Alipour et al., 2009). Moreover, there are other significant absorption bands in the FTIR spectrum of HTCC, namely the OH and NH stretching vibration (3300 cm−1 and 3200 cm−1, respectively), N+ H stretching vibration (3037 cm−1) and CH2 vibration (2993 cm−1 and 2845 cm−1). The CH bending of the methyl substituent of the quaternary ammonium groups was also indicated by a strong peak at 1481 cm−1. The absorption bands at 1646 cm−1 and 1357 cm−1 corresponded to the CO and CO stretching of the amide groups, respectively. The saccharide skeleton was associated to the COC antisymmetric stretching (1167 cm−1), skeletal vibration involving CO stretching (∼1020 cm−1) and skeletal vibration involving CC stretching (970–850 cm−1) (Zhang, Geng, Jiang, Li, & Huang, 2012). For PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane, the quaternary ammonium salt groups were successfully introduced to the backbone of CS, as indicated by the new absorption band appeared at 1484 cm−1, representing the CH bending of the trimethylammonium group as shown in Fig. 2(e). In FTIR spectrum of PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane, the significant adsorption bands were observed at 3700−3000 cm−1 (OH and NH2 groups), 2933 cm−1 (CH asymmetric vibration), 1733 cm−1 (CO bond), 1640 cm−1 (CO bond in NHCO) and 851 cm−1 (CC stretching vibration) (Choudhari et al., 2007). The band in the FTIR spectrum of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane at 1640−1690 cm−1 was ascribed to the presence of a carbonyl group in the isocyanate group (Lee et al., 2010). From the FTIR spectrum of BI shown in Fig. S3 (Supporting information), the characteristic bands are at 2927 cm−1 (CH bonding), 1200 and 1024 cm−1 (OSO stretching of the sulfonate group) (Fourest & Volesky, 1996; Pereira & Yarwood, 1996), and 1470−1570 cm−1 (Amide II) (Ji et al., 2020; Kong & Yu, 2007). Hence, the SO3 functional groups may be present in the chemical structure of BI. Similarly, the SO3 group can also be found in the composite structure of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane, as indicated by the characteristic band at 1227 cm−1 (Fig. S3). The 1H NMR spectra analysis was conducted in this study to determine the chemical structure of the synthesized nanofiber membrane. The 1H NMR spectrum of BI dissolved in D2O solvent is shown in Fig. S4 (Supporting information). The signal observed at a chemical shift of ∼1.5 ppm is attributed to the protons in the CH2 methylene group (Gottlieb, Kotlyar, & Nudelman, 1997). Hence, the presence of CH2 group in the BI structure is confirmed. Besides, there are many unrecognizable signals in the NMR spectrum, hinting that the presence of other ingredients in the BI solution. In an attempt to calculate the number of carbon bonds (represented by n value) in the BI structure, LC–MS analysis was conducted to determine the molecular weight of the main component in BI sample. The LC–MS spectrum is shown in Fig. S5 (Supporting information). However, after analyzing and calculating the molecular weight of each absorption peak, the n value cannot be derived exactly. Based on the spectra of FTIR, NMR and LC–MS, it is speculated that the BI sample may contain various ingredients. It is impossible to calculate the n value of the carbon bond with a reasonable integer value because of those unrecognizable signals appeared in the NMR and the LC–MS spectra. Therefore, the chemical structure of BI could not be accurately analyzed, and its structure may be an aliphatic modified diisocyanate (hexamethylene diisocyanate, HDI, n = 6) as shown in Fig. S6 (Supporting information). On the basis of the chemical structure of BI, the chemical structure of blocking agent is determined as NaHSO3 (see Fig. S7) (Supporting information). The thermal stability of the composite PVA/HTCC nanofiber membranes was previously investigated by Wang et al. (2019). The TGA curve shows that the presence of HTCC has significantly improved the thermal stability of synthesized nanofiber membrane. This is because HTCC has a better thermal conductivity, making the composite nanofiber membrane to possess better thermal stability (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis indicated that the PVA nanofibers would decompose at a lower temperature (∼315.52 °C) than that of PVA/HTCC nanofibers (∼360.72 °C). This is attirbuted to the structure of PVA/HTCC that has more intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds; hence, the nanofiber is relatively more stable. In this work, the combined TGA and DTG profiles given in Fig. 3 show the thermal degradation characteristics of PVA/HTCC/BI at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The pyrolysis process of PVA/HTCC/BI can be divided into three main stages: removal of moisture and very light volatiles (<100 °C); degradation of the composite membrane at 200−300 °C; decomposition of the composition membrane at 300−500 °C. As shown in Fig. 3, the moisture loss and removal of very light volatiles components were more prominent in the second (300−400 °C) and third (400−500 °C) zones of temperature for weight loss due to the thermal breaking of weak bonds in the composite polymeric structure at a higher temperature. In DTG curves, the temperatures at which the maximum rate of weight loss occurred are described by the position of the peaks in the curve. The DTG curve of composite membrane during the degradation and decomposition stages shows two distinct peaks as represented by a noticeable change in slope of the TG curve. The first and second DTG peaks of the composite membrane are assigned at 364.23 °C (PVA/HTCC) and 431.82 °C (PVA/HTCC/BI), respectively. Hence, the thermal stability of PVA/HTCC nanofiber crosslinked with BI was significantly higher than that PVA/HTCC nanofiber. This is because the chemical structure of PVAHTCC crosslinked by BI would be more stable. The mechanical properties (tensile, ultimate strengths, Young's modulus, & elongation) of the nanofiber mats including PVA, PVA/HTCC, and PVA/HTCC/BI (developed in this work) have been investigated. The obtained results were compared to the PVA/HTCC/GA nanofiber reported by Khalaji et al. (2020). The mechanical properties of the PVA, PVA/HTCC, and PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes were measured using a universal test machine (Tinius Olsen H1KS, SDL ATLAS, USA) with an extension rate of 10 mm/min at room temperature. All samples were tested, and the averages of TS, YM, and EB were evaluated from the stress-strain curves (Khalaji et al., 2020; Koosha & Mirzadeh, 2015; Lee et al., 2010). The mechanical properties of various nanofiber membranes (e.g., TS, YM, and EB) are shown in Fig. 4 (a)–(c). As the BI content of the crosslinked PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers increased from 0 % to 3 %, TS, YM, and EB increased from 2.17 MPa to 6.32 MPa, from 75.19 MPa to 139.87 MPa, and from 11.23 MPa to 16.57 MPa, respectively. As the content of BI in PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers increased, the TS, YM, and EB of the nanofibers increased correspondingly due to the good deformability and flexibility of BI (Khalaji et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2010; Yang, Li, & Nie, 2007). Besides, a higher degree of entanglements and the strong physical interactions among the PVA/HTCC/BI polymer chains would occur upon addition of BI, thereby improving the mechanical properties of nanofiber membranes. In this work, the results showed that the mechanical properties of PVA/THCC/BI nanofiber were better than that of PVA/HTCC/GA nanofiber."
14,Morphology of PVA/HTCC/BIP nanofiber membrane,"3.2 Morphology of PVA/HTCC/BIP nanofiber membrane To improve the water resistance of the hydrophilic nanofiber membrane, the PVA/HTCC solution was crosslinked with BI at different concentrations (2 %–3 %). The crosslinking between PVA/HTCC and BI was carried out at an isothermal pressing temperature of 125 °C for 5 min. The SEM images of the crosslinked PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers prior to water immersion are illustrated in Fig. 5 (a), (c) and (e). The results showed that structures of PVA/HTCC nanofiber [see Fig. 5(a)] and PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber [see Fig. 5(c) and (e)] were comparable, indicating that electrospinning of the polymer solution was not affected by the presence of BI. Overall, it was found that the average diameter of crosslinked nanofibers at different concentrations of BI was around 216 nm. The reduction in diameter of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers was mainly attributed to the lower viscosity of polymer solution upon the addition of BI. A three-dimensional network was produced due to the merging of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers junction points (Strawhecker & Manias, 2000). The SEM images of the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers after 1 h of water immersion are shown in Fig. 5(b), (d), and (f). A large portion of the hydrophilic HTCC/PVA nanofibers was dissolved in water, as shown in Fig. 5(b). On the other hand, the fibrous network structure of the nanofibers crosslinked with 2 % of BI was partially dissolved upon contacting with water, as indicated by the formation of the film due to the dissolution of the PVA molecules in water. Nevertheless, the nanofiber membrane crosslinked with 3 % of BI was found to have a better water resistance as only a small film area was observed under SEM. Similar observations were also noted for the nanofibers crosslinked with BI at different isothermal pressing temperatures (100 °C, 125 °C, and 150 °C) for 5 min (see Figs. 6 and 7 ). When the concentration of BI increased from 2 % to 3 % and the isothermal pressing temperature increased from 125 °C to 150 °C, the fibrous structure of the electrospun nanofibers remained unchanged upon contacting with water. This phenomenon indicated that the water resistance of the nanofiber membrane was enhanced by crosslinking the hydroxyl groups of PVA with the isocyanate groups of BI."
15,Water solubility of PVA/HTCC/BIP nanofiber membrane,"3.3 Water solubility of PVA/HTCC/BIP nanofiber membrane Fig. 8 (a) shows the water solubility of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes. After 2 h of water immersion at 25 °C, it was found that the weight losses experienced by the nanofiber membranes crosslinked with 2 % and 3 % of BI were 14.3 % and 10.5 %, respectively. As compared to the weight loss of PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane (i.e., 33.2 %), the addition of BI in PVA/HTCC solution effectively enhanced the water resistance of electrospun nanofiber membranes. The water solubility tests were also conducted for the nanofibers crosslinked with BI at different isothermal pressing temperatures (100 °C, 125 °C, and 150 °C) as shown in Fig. 8(b). Overall, the weight loss experienced by the PVA/HTCC/BI (for both BI concentrations investigated) nanofiber membranes decreased when the isothermal pressing temperature increased. Hence, it can be concluded that the water resistance of nanofiber membrane can be improved by crosslinking the membrane with a higher concentration of BI, as well as at higher isothermal pressing temperature. It was found that the swelling degree of the nanofiber membrane in water reached 200 %–300 % after 2 h of water immersion. This indicates that the BI crosslinker has satisfactorily improved the mechanical properties of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane. A higher BI content in the nanofiber membrane could strengthen the polymer chain by creating a more compact network structure, resulting in lower water solubility. Based on the results, it is speculated that the enhancement of membrane stability in water was a result of the reduction in hydroxyl and/or amino groups on the surface of the crosslinked PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers."
16,Antibacterial performances of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane,"3.4 Antibacterial performances of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane The AE of nanofiber membranes prepared using different concentrations of BI and at different temperatures of heat treatment (100 °C – 150 °C) was investigated in dry and wet states. The results are shown in Fig. 9 (a). In the dry state, the AE of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane could reach up to 99 % regardless of the temperature used in the thermal pressing. After 1 h of water immersion, the AE of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane (2 % BI and 100 °C of thermal pressing) decreased significantly to 88.2 %. As the temperature of thermal pressing increased to 150 °C, the AE of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane (3 % of BI) in both dry and wet states reached 99.96 %. Based on these experimental results, the water resistance of the composite nanofiber membrane was confirmed to be an important criterion for an effective antibacterial action. Our results demonstrated that the AE of PVA/HTCC nanofiber membranes could be improved by crosslinking the PVA backbone with a high concentration of hydrophobic BI. Aside from the highly positive charged groups, the hydrophobic alkyl chains on the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber are important for the antibacterial action against E. coli. The similar results were also reported by Kim, Choi, Chun, & Choi (1997) and Sajomsang, Gonil, & Tantayanon (2009), who showed that the alkyl substituent with an increasing chain length on the quaternary ammonium CS salts showed a higher AE. Additionally, Bai et al. (2013) revealed that the hydrophobicity of graphene and the positive charge of HTCC increased the virus removal rates. They suggested that the hydrophobicity and cationic charge of the introduced substituent strongly influenced the AE of the quaternary ammonium CS derivative. The enhancement of the AE by addition of BI in PVA nanofiber membranes was also observed by many investigators (Choudhari et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010; Nirmala et al., 2011). The reusability of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes was tested for 5 times. It was found that the AE of PVA/HTCC nanofiber membranes after repeated uses remained at 99.9 %, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The results confirmed the chemical stability of the composite nanofibers for multiple cycles of antibacterial applications."
17,Cytotoxicity and cell viability,"3.5 Cytotoxicity and cell viability CCK-8 assay was adopted in this study because it has a better sensitivity than MTT assay under the same conditions, and it has a higher accuracy in assessing the cell survival and growth rate than MTT assay (Cai et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2015). The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the synthesized PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber were investigated using mouse fibroblasts L929 cells. In this study, cell viability (i.e., cell survival rate) was qualitatively confirmed using Live/Dead cell fluorescent imaging. The cell images obtained from negative and positive controls are shown in Fig. 10 A(a)–(d). The negative control (i.e., cell culture without nanofiber membrane) had the 100 % of cell survival rate, as indicated by the green fluorescence signal emitted from the live cell culture. On the other hand, the positive control (i.e., cell culture with 1 % Triton X-100) gave 0 % of cell survival rate and the red fluorescence signal indicates the presence of dead cells. From Fig. 10A(e) and (f), it is apparent that the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane did not show cytotoxic effect on L929 cells. The cytotoxicity of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane was further quantitatively measured by extract and direct methods using CCK-8 assay. The cell viability as analyzed using CCK-8 assay is shown in Fig. 10(B). For both extract and direct methods, the results proved the non-cytotoxicity of PVA/BHCC/BI nanofiber membrane. In other words, the cell viability was 100 %. Overall, this study demonstrated that the PVA/HTCC/BI membrane has good cell biocompatibility and no cytotoxicity. Hence, it can be potentially utilized in biomedical applications."
18,Remarks on PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane,"3.6 Remarks on PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane The crosslinking between PVA/HTCC and BI before the electrospinning process does not occur at room temperature because the crosslinking reaction would only take place at elevated temperatures (T > 120 °C) (Lee et al., 2010; Jones, 2008). BI is stable at room temperature even when it is mixed with PVA/HTCC; and it only becomes reactive once heat is applied. As the temperature rises, the NCO groups in BI are then free to react with PVA/HTCC to form the polyurethane. In this work, a two-step heat pressing was performed with PVA/THCC/BI nanofiber membrane at different temperatures of crosslinking. In the first step, a heat-pressing process was carried out at 100 °C for 1 h to improve its structural integrity and mechanical strength of the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber layer onto the PET supporting matrix (Chiu et al., 2011). After the first hot-pressing treatment, PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane was subsequently hot pressed at 125−150 °C for 5 min. In the second thermal treatment, the PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane was crosslinked with BI. In this case, exposing the nanofiber membrane to heat pressing resulted in a narrow pore size distribution and a smaller pore size. The improvement in the mechanical and physical properties of the nanofiber membranes make them more attractive for long-term and repetitive operations (Yao et al., 2017). As implied by the SEM images and TGA profiles, the stability of the crosslinked PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers in water was significantly enhanced. As compared to the PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane, the PVA/HTCC/BI composite nanofiber membrane containing 2–3 % BI reduced the water solubility and increased the heterogeneity as well as crosslinking density. Hence, PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane has a higher potential to be used in the antibacterial and biomedical fields. In our study, the PVA/HTCC nanofiber membrane crosslinked with BI exhibited a higher steric hindrance of the nanofiber structure. It may be expected that PVA/HTCC/BI membrane showed less cytotoxicity than the PVA/HTCC membrane. However, the results from our cytotoxicity test indicated that the composite PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane developed in this work has a good biocompatibility. Hence, this desirable property unlocks its potential in biomedical applications."
19,Conclusion,"This work describes the preparation, characterization and mechanical properties of the composite PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes. The results indicated that the increase in BI content improved the water resistance and mechanical properties of the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers significantly. Moreover, TGA results also suggested that the chemical crosslinking between PVA and BI increased the thermal stability of the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofibers. The approach presented in this work offered an innovative route for the synthesis of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane. By crosslinking with BI, the synthesized nanofiber membrane was stable against water dissolution. Moreover, the PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membranes demonstrated ∼100 % of antibacterial action against E. coli. This study also proved the excellent biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity of PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane. With its superior antibacterial properties and cell biocompatibility, PVA/HTCC/BI nanofiber membrane can serve as a promising material in applications such as food packaging, biomedical engineering as well as air filtration."
