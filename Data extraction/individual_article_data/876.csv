0,Introduction,"The conversion of natural gas and introducing an efficient method to produce more valuable chemicals are the most pressing issues in the petrochemical industries [1–3]. The main challenge is overcoming the rather strong C–H bond activation barrier of methane as the main constituent of natural gas [4]. In addition, the initial products of the methane activation are generally more reactive than methane itself [5]. Consequently, almost all efforts have been centered on the indirect conversion of methane through synthesis gas (CO and H2) [6–11]. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction (FT) is a polymerization process, which converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons with a broad range of carbon chain lengths. Among several metal-based catalysts accepted to be used in the FT synthesis, iron and cobalt catalysts are considered to be suitable metals with great catalytic activity and also from an economical point of view [12–14]. Besides, some progressive works have been reported on the methane conversion to valuable chemicals and products [15–17]. For instance, iron and cobalt catalysts can activate CH4 to form C2 hydrocarbons [18–20], alcohol [21,22], and carboxylic acid [23] products. In the catalyzed conversion of methane, various metals such as molybdenum [24], gallium [15], platinum [25], nickel [26], zinc [27], chromium [28], and copper [29] have been examined. In this regard, Bao [30,31], Zhang [32], and Chen [33] published review articles about the conversion of CH4 to high-value-added products. Yamanaka et al. [34] investigated the methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons over a nickel phosphide catalyst supported on silica. The catalyst produced ethylene, ethane, acetylene, benzene, naphthalene, and toluene at a methane conversion between 10 and 15%. The direct conversion of methane to aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons (ethylene, ethane, and acetylene) on the silica-supported iron catalysts was investigated by Kim and co-workers [35]. They discovered that the silica-based Fe-catalyst is more reactive than the pure support or other Fe catalysts. A single-atom Pt embedded nano-ceria was chosen for the methane conversion by Wang's group [36]. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated an adequate conversion of methane (14.4%) with high selectivity toward C2 hydrocarbons (74.6%). Bao et al. [18] reported that the synthesis of Fe/SiO2 composite enables the direct conversion of methane, exclusively to ethylene and aromatics. The conversion of methane to ethylene over gallium nitride catalysts was studied by Kopyscinski et al. [15]. The catalytic conversion of methane to methanol on nickel catalyst embedded graphene was also investigated by Nematollahi and co-worker [26]. Alternatively, among a variety of methane conversion routes, methane carbonylation is a notably way to produce clean fuels and value-added feedstocks. In this regard, Stepanov et al. [37] investigated the methane carbonylation reaction on the sulfated zirconia for the selective formation of acetic acid. Shan and Li [38] synthesized an effective catalyst (Rh-ZSM-5) for the carbonylation of methane to methanol and acetic acid in the presence of CO and O2 at 150 °C. The CO-assisted direct conversion of methane to C1 and C2 oxygenated compound over transition metal catalysts supported on ZSM-5 was reported by Moteki [39]. The carbonylation reaction of ethane with CO to produce a carboxylic acid was also studied by Deng's research group [40]. Notwithstanding the aforementioned works, there is still room for further research. The morphology and porosity of support are two key factors in catalyst designing. Mesoporous silica with a wide range of particle morphologies and pore geometries (MCM 48, MCM 41, SBA 16, SBA 15, etc.) have been synthesized and employed as exceptional support in a number of industrial applications [41]. In the late 1990s, mesoporous alumina was prepared by Vaudry et al. [42] using long-chain carboxylic acids. These mesoporous materials have attracted notable recognition due to their high surface area, excellent thermal stability, and narrow pore size distribution [42]. The ordered mesoporous carbons are unique due to their uniform pore size [43], simple functionalization, and directly introduced carbide intermediate phases [44–46]. Interestingly, certain metal-free mesoporous carbon nanomaterials such as nitrogen and sulfur doped mesoporous carbons are supreme candidates for energy storage/conversion applications and metal free catalysts. Hao et al. [47] highlighted recent progresses in expansion of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons as metal-free reduction catalysts and energy storage materials. In addition, N-doped mesoporous carbons were investigated for the selective catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide by Liu and co-workers [48]. Sulfur-doped mesoporous carbon was also fabricated and investigated for Acetylene hydrochlorination to vinyl chloride by Li et al. [49]. Herein, we report the synthesis of carbon-based iron– ([Fe]) and cobalt–oxide ([Co]) nanoparticles catalysts with large pore sizes (>10.0 nm), high surface areas (~500 m2/g), high pore volumes (>1.0 cm3/g), and highly dispersed Fe2O3 and Co3O4 nanoparticles. The catalysts were employed for CH4 carbonylation and Fischer-Tropsch reactions."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Formalin (35 wt.%), hydrochloric acid (36 wt.%), resorcinol, Fe(NO3)3•9H2O, acetylacetone, diglyme, Co(NO3)2•6H2O, and ethanol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Copolymer Pluronic F127 (poly(ethylene oxide)–b–poly(propylene oxide)–b–poly– (ethylene oxide), Mw = 12,600) was purchased from Acros Chemical Inc. Instruments and measurements are available in the Supplementary Material."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation 2.00 g resorcinol was dissolved into 10 g of 1:1 wt ratio of water/ethanol mixture. After obtaining a bright solution, the formalin solution (1.85 g, 35 wt.%) was added by stirring to yield a pale yellow solution; to which 0.15 g of 37% HCl was added, and the reaction was stirred at 40 °C. The solution mixture was separated into two layers after 30 min, including the mixture of water and ethanol (the upper layer) and the polymer–rich solution (the lower layer mainly). The upper layer phase was discarded. Then, 2.00 g Pluronic F127 was dissolved in 10 g of absolute diglyme and added to polymer–rich phase stirring for an hour. Simultaneously, 1 mmol of Fe(NO3)3•9H2O (0.4 g) or Co(NO3)2•6H2O (0.3 g) and 0.2 g of acetylacetone were added to the solution. After mixing for 1 h at 40 °C, the mixture was poured into multiple dishes for the diglyme to evaporate. The petri dishes were situated in an oven at 160 °C for 24 h. The as–made composite films were scraped from the dishes and grounded into soft powders. The composite was calcinated under an N2 atmosphere (95% purity) at 600 °C for 5 h (ramping rate was 1 °C/min)."
4,CH4 carbonylation and FTS reaction,"2.3 CH4 carbonylation and FTS reaction A fixed-bed reactor (25 cm length and 6 mm internal diameter) was used for the CH4 carbonylation reaction. The reactor was loaded with 0.4 g of the catalyst sample along with 0.2 g SiC powder. Prior to the catalytic process, the catalysts were reduced in situ in 15% H2/N2 (30 mL/min) for 16 h at 400 °C under 1 bar pressure (ramping rate: 2 °C/min). The CH4 carbonylation reaction was conducted for 24 h. The catalytic processes were performed according to Table 1 . To make the methane carbonylation reaction analogous for both catalysts, the same weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was conducted for each catalyst. The amount of products was analyzed online by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 A). The Fischer–Tropsch reactions were also conducted in a fixed-bed reactor and the catalysts reduced under the same conditions. The CO/H2 ratio and reaction condition for both catalysts are also assembled in Table 1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis of the catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis of the catalysts The synthesis strategy of Fe2O3 or Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on carbon is demonstrated in Scheme 1. The carbon support polymer composites were prepared by the tri–constituent co-assembly of resol–type resorcinolic resin, diglyme, and triblock copolymer F127 as the carbon source, the swallowing agent, and the template, respectively. The metal–containing carbon composites were obtained by coordination of the hydroxyl groups of the resol with the Fe(III) or Co(II) acetylacetonate complexes followed by thermo–polymerization at 160 °C. Further pyrolysis (to remove the copolymer F127 template and to carbonize the resol resin at 600 °C in the atmosphere of impure N2) resulted in the carbon support accompanied by the in situ growth of the Fe2O3@C and Co3O4@C nanoparticles."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area, pore size, and pore volumes of the primary and spent catalysts are listed in Table 2 . Before the catalytic reactions, the [Fe] catalyst represented a high surface area (490 m2/g) and large pore volume (1.4 cm3/g). In comparison, the [Co] catalyst demonstrated a lower surface area and pore volume (426 m2/g and 1.1 cm3/g). The pore sizes of the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts were ascertained to be 9.9 and 10.8 nm from the BJH model, respectively. The pore volume and surface area as well as pore size indicated negligible changes in the catalysts texture after the catalytic activities (Table 2). Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the [Fe] (Fe2O3@C) and [Co] (Co3O4@C) catalysts. The XRD pattern of the [Fe] catalyst exhibits the diffraction peaks (2θ) at 24.39, 33.45, 36.02, 41.15, 49.80, 54.36, 57.33, and 64.37°, which can be assigned to the 012, 104, 110, 113, 024, 116, 122, 214, and 300 reflections of α–Fe2O3 (Hematite phase) as the major part with a low content of iron carbide. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1 (top)) demonstrates resolved diffraction peaks, which can be imputed to mixed phases of α–Fe2O3 (00–089–0596), Fe3C (00–076–1877), Fe2C (00–026–0782), and Fe7C3 (00–017–0333). The XRD pattern result for the [Co] catalyst shows the presence of diffraction peaks according to the Co3O4 (00–078–1969) as the main phase accompanying cobalt carbide (Co3C, 00–026–0450; Co2C, 00–003–1200) as the minor phase (Fig. 1 (bottom)). Table 2 summarizes the crystal size of Fe2O3 and Co3O4 nanoparticles in the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts obtained from wide-angle XRD patterns. The TPR profile for the reduction behavior of the [Fe] catalyst is displayed in Fig. 2 (top). The reduction of α–Fe2O3 (Hematite phase) was formed as the following: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe0 [50]. The low–temperature peak between 180 and 280 °C was attributed to the reduction of α–Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. The broad peak between 290 and 420 °C was ascribed to the reduction of Fe3O4 → FeO. The third peak between 400 and 450 °C can be assigned to the gasification of the carbon support [51]. Fig. 2 (bottom) displays the TPR experiment for the reduction process of the [Co] catalyst. Generally, the reduction of Co3O4 (cobalt oxide) is divided into several steps: Co3O4 → CoO → Co0. The reduction peak between 200 and 450 °C is attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co0 [52]. The second broad hydrogen consumption zone appears in the temperature range of 450–550 °C in the TPR profile, which is assigned to the formation of methane through the gasification of the carbon support due to the catalytic influence of the metallic cobalt [53,54]. SEM images of the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts show interconnected and sponge–like macroporosity of the surface (Fig. 3 ). The EDX elemental mapping analyses exhibit that iron and cobalt are finely distributed in the samples, and the distribution of carbon and oxygen coincide with metal oxides. The SEM images of the used catalysts are displayed in Fig. S1. Nevertheless, no notable changes were distinguished in the SEM images, BET, and BJH for the used catalysts. The corresponding TEM images of the catalysts are indicated in Fig. 4 . The TEM images of the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts show that well-dispersed Fe– and Co–oxide nanoparticles are encapsulated within the carbon support together with an average size of 6 and 26 nm, respectively. In addition, according to XRD and TEM results of the catalysts, both carbide metals (Fe2C and Co2C) were identified. Insets in Figs. 4e and f are the relative electron diffraction patterns of the metal oxide catalysts. The bright rings and spots are a result of the presence of polycrystals of Fe2O3@C and Co3O4@C nanoparticles. The presence of both reduced and oxidized cobalt or iron species in the catalysts inhibits identification of the carbon support components. Although, the TPR experiments, TEM, XRD, and elemental analyses (from EDX) illustrate a small amount of carbon with additional contributions from cobalt and iron carbide nanoparticles."
8,CH4 carbonylation over the catalysts,"3.3 CH4 carbonylation over the catalysts As mentioned before, iron catalysts immobilized on the various supports such as silica, graphene, and zeolite have been investigated for catalyzing CH4 conversion to form ethylene [18], methanol [21], and acetic acid [22]. In this regard, Srinivasan's research group [55] demonstrated that iron carbide can facilitate conversion of methane to methyl radical and hydrogen on FeC3@SiO2 under different conditions. Dehydrogenation of methane to produce value-added chemicals is also facilitated by the dissociative CO adsorption on the metal carbide clusters [56,57]. In addition, the reactivity of the cobalt carbide catalysts was studied for the methane conversion to produce dihydrogen [58] and C2 hydrocarbons [19]. The partial oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde at low temperature over Co/ZSM-5 in the presence of air was also investigated by Bitter et al. [19]. Inspired by the evidence that iron and cobalt catalysts can convert methane to value-added products, we synthesized iron and cobalt carbide nanoparticles and studied the methane carbonylation reaction in a fixed-bed reactor. The reactivity of the [Fe] catalyst toward CH4 carbonylation was applied under similar conditions as the [Co] catalyst and the CH4/CO ratio was appointed to be 1:1. Hydrocarbon and alcohol products as well as a minor content of CO2 were produced over the catalysts (Table 3 ). The conversion of methane on the [Fe] catalyst was greater than the [Co] catalyst at 220 °C. The [Fe] catalyst displayed a great conversion of methane (40.53%) with high selectivity toward the C2 C4 hydrocarbons and C1 C4 alcohols. The alcohol and hydrocarbon distributions for the [Fe] catalyst are listed in Table 4 . As for the hydrocarbon (HC) product distribution, the total C2−C4 hydrocarbon selectivity stretched to 48% for the [Fe] catalyst. The C2−C4 hydrocarbons themselves were predominantly short-chain olefins containing selectivity values of 87.29%. The [Fe] catalyst indicated an exceptionally high selectivity to ethylene (>78% from total C2−C4). The molar ratio of olefin/paraffin (C =/Cn) with C2−C4 was 6.86. Table 4 also displays the alcohols distribution over the [Fe] catalyst. The primary alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol with distributions of 59.64, 20.20, 15.80, and 4.36%, respectively. In addition, there are no aromatic compounds such as toluene, benzene, or naphthalene in the final products. The representative distribution diagram of the CH4 carbonylation reaction over the [Fe] catalyst is displayed in Fig. S2. In comparison, the [Co] catalyst demonstrated less activity than the [Fe] catalyst (the CH4 and CO conversions are 15.40% and 31.83%, respectively, Table 3), although the selectivity of alcohols (~76%) stretched beyond the [Fe] catalyst. Considering that initial catalytic activity and stability, it seems that the catalysts based on the Fe- and Co-carbides are similar. For the production of hydrocarbon products, the [Fe] catalyst has the capability to produce much higher products. Although, it is regarded as only the iron catalyst would be useful for production of C2−C4 hydrocarbons. In addition, CO2 selectivity of cobalt catalyst is 10.49%, about two times that of iron catalyst (5.3%) at the same reaction conditions. The distribution of total alcohols over the [Co] catalyst is presented in Table 4. The product distributions from C1−C4 alcohols were 57.21, 20.74, 6.52, and 15.53, respectively. Besides alcohol, a small amount of acetic acid and ethanal (acetaldehyde) was formed by the [Co] catalyst. Fig. S3 displays the product distributions of the methane carbonylation over the [Co] catalyst. The overall carbon mass balance of the methane carbonylation reactions for the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts were 71 and 87%, respectively. The rest of carbon may be attributed to formation of unmeasurable amount of either cock and carbide or some heavy products which could not recognized by chromatography analyses. As a consequence, the general concept is that the iron catalyst is more active that the cobalt catalyst. Furthermore, a series of different experiments with various metal catalysts, reaction times, and temperatures are collected in Table 5 . In comparison to other catalysts, the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts display an adequate catalytic methane conversion of 40 and 15.4%, respectively. Fe/SiO2 (entry 6, Table 5) also indicates a great conversion of methane (48.1%) and ethylene selectivity above 48% excluding additives or oxidants, although the reaction was conducted under harsh conditions. The catalysts based on Rh element (entries 2, 4, and 5, Table 5) are active and able to effectively catalyze CH4 conversion to alcohols and a carboxylic acid, however, the methane conversion is below 10%. The other efficient catalysts are bifunctional catalysts such as Fe-Cu/ZSM-5 and Pd/CeO2 (entries 8 and 9, Table 5). It should be noted that batch reactors (BR) have some problems such as complexities in scale-up, excessive costs of products, and discarding of entire batches if the all products are off-spec [59,60]. To evaluate the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after the methane carbonylation reactions, EDX analyses were conducted for the fresh and used catalysts. The elemental analysis (from EDX) was utilized to evaluate the changes in accounts of carbon in the fresh and used catalysts. After 24 h of the reaction, the weight percentage of carbon was increased (Table S1). Prior to the reaction, the respective percent weight of oxygen, iron, and carbon on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles embedded on carbon was found to be 28.81, 69.12, and 2.07%, respectively. The elemental analysis indicated that carbon accounts for more than 3.32% of the chemical composition of the used catalyst. Table S1 summarizes the elemental analysis of both catalysts before and after the reactions."
9,Reaction behavior of the catalysts,"3.4 Reaction behavior of the catalysts According to the TPR analysis (Fig. 2), it appears that during the reduction step prior to the reaction (see Section 2.3 .), the oxide phases of the iron and cobalt samples (Fe2O3 and Co3O4) were reduced to their corresponding lower oxidation states (Fe0 and Fe–O, Co0 and Co–O). The possible reaction mechanisms of the catalytic conversion of methane over the [Fe] catalyst are depicted in Scheme S1. In the case of the [Fe] catalyst, CH4 is initially activated into Fe–CH3 and Fe–H species via C–H bond cleavage on the iron sites [21, 63–66]. The dissociation of CO (carbon monoxide) on the Fe surface leads to the formation of the [O*] (oxygen species), which can be inserted into Fe–CH3 to generate Fe–OCH3 [64]. The Fe–OCH3 reacts with [H*] to produce methanol (pathway 1). Concurrently, methane can generate methylene radicals (Fe–CH2) in the absence of oxidants, which are desorbed from the iron surface and then undergo a sequence of gas-phase processes to yield ethylene (pathway 2) [18]. In addition, the carbon species on the surface can be followed at least in two reaction routes. Hence, these carbon species can react with additional carbon atoms to construct an unreactive carbon (coke), or undergo polymerization to create larger hydrocarbons (n(CH2) → CnH2n, pathway 3) [67]. Subsequently, the oxygen atom ([O*]) formed in previous steps, can be inserted into the Fe–C species to produce longer chain alcohols (such as ethanol, propanol, and butanol). Methane can also be activated by the [Co] catalyst into Co–CH3 and Co–H over the cobalt surfaces [68]. According to Shan and Li paper [38], the formation of Co–OCH3 [68], Co–OCCH3 [69], and Co–CO2CH3 [40] species are related to the insertion of [O*], CO, and CO2 into the Co–CH3, which can generate methanol, ethanal, and acetic acid, respectively. Scheme S2 demonstrates the potential reaction pathways of the methane conversion over the [Co] catalyst in the presence of methane and carbon monoxide."
10,FTS reaction over the catalysts,"3.5 FTS reaction over the catalysts The results of the Fischer–Tropsch reactions are listed in Table 6 . The [Fe] catalyst produced C2–C4 and C5+ hydrocarbons with selectivities of ~%55 and ~31%, respectively. The catalyst further produced low methane and a minuscule amount of CO2 with CO conversions of 84.6%. For the [Co] catalyst, the CO conversion reached ~82%, and the selectivity values of methane, C2 C4, and C5+ were 10%, 40%, and >47%, respectively. The Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution α–value of the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts lead to 0.49 and 0.71 models which are consistent with the range predicted for the selectivity toward C2–C4 and C5+ hydrocarbons, respectively [70,71]. The hydrocarbon distributions over the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts were in agreement with the ASF distribution [72,73]. The molar ratio of olefin/paraffin (C =/Cn) with C2−C4 of the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts were 1.27 and 1.22, respectively, which are lower than carbonylation reaction. The products distributions of the metal-oxide catalysts in FT reaction are depicted in Fig. S4. The carbon mass balances in the Fischer-Tropsch experiments were almost 100%. Consequently, the [Fe] catalyst presented greater activity than the [Co] catalyst. Considering, the [Fe] catalyst has smaller nanoparticles than the [Co] catalyst, providing more active sites, as a result increasing the catalytic activity."
11,Conclusions,"Methane carbonylation into hydrocarbons and alcohols by iron–and cobalt –oxide catalysts supported on carbon was investigated in this research. The catalysts were synthesized using the co-assembly method and characterized by XRD, SEM, TPR, and TEM characterization techniques. The carbonylation of methane was investigated at 220 °C and 20 bar with an essential conversion. The iron catalyst displayed significant catalytic performance for the CH4 carbonylation with remarkable selectivity toward light olefins and alcohols. The results demonstrated that the ethylene together with methanol as the main products can be directly synthesized from methane carbonylation over the [Fe] catalyst. The carbonylation of methane over the [Co] catalyst has important consequences, since it generated higher alcohol production. Furthermore, the catalytic activities were performed on the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis using the [Fe] and [Co] catalysts. The CO conversion, methane selectivity, C2 C4, and C5+ selectivities were adequate for the iron and cobalt catalysts."
