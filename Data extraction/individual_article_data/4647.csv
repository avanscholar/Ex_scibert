0,Introduction,"2-Substituted cyclobutanones are useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry that have been comprehensively employed for the synthesis of a series of drug and pesticide intermediates such as lactones, cyclopentanones, benzodiquinanes, naphthalenes, 9,10-dihydrobenzocycloocten-7(8H)-ones, etc [1–4]. They are also key intermediates in the total synthesis of many natural products such as α-Bisabolol, (-)-Debromofiliformin, (-)-Filiformin, (±)-Scirpene, (±)-a-Cuparenone, (±)-Herbertene, etc [5–9]. Generally, 2-substituted cyclobutanones are synthesized via the ring-expansion reactions of cyclopropyl-contained compounds [5–17]. Among reported works, the oxidative ring expansion of methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs, Scheme 1 , Eq. (1)) may be one of the most practical methods because of the concise preparation procedures of the starting materials from commercially available reagents [13–24]. The reactions once employed large amount of chemical oxidants such as m-chlorobenzoperoxoic acid (MCPBA), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD), diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or cerium (IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN), which might generate solid wastes in large-scale production (Eq. (1)) [13–16]. Recently, during our continuous investigations on organoselenium catalysis [25–30], we developed a novel method for the synthesis of 2-substituted cyclobutanones via the organoselenium-catalyzed oxidative ring expansion reaction of MCPs [17]. The method employed H2O2 as the clean oxidant, but its substrate scope was limited to disubstituted MCPs to produce 2,2′-bis-substituted cyclobutanones, while the reactions with mono-substituted MCPs only led to a mixture of decomposed by-products. Moreover, because MCPs were prepared via the Wittig-reactions of cyclopropylidene ylid with carbonyls [18–20], the protocol inevitably generated the high molecular weight by-product triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3P(O)) that might lead to a lot of solid wastes in practical applications. Therefore, developing more atom-economic procedures for 2-substituted cyclobutanone synthesis is still crucial in the field. (1) On the other hand, since cyclobutanone is a commercially available chemical that can be purchased at an acceptable price [31], it may serve as a good building block in organic synthesis for introducing four-membered carbocycles into the molecules. In 2014, we reported that, by using a simple condensation of cyclobutanone with aldehydes, once hardly obtained 2-methylenecyclobutanones (2-MCBones) could be directly synthesized (Scheme 1, Eq. (2)) [32]. In the reaction, cheap, low-loading (10 mol%) and removable Ca(OH)2 was employed as catalyst and no waste was generated other than the water [33–35]. Recently, we were surprised to find that the molecules were so reactive that their catalytic hydrogenation reaction could be performed at atmospheric pressure and under room temperature. Different from the hydrogen transfer reactions [36–38], the reaction employed H2 (just in a balloon) as an efficient reductant. It did not require expensive metal complexes [39], while the simple, commercial available and recyclable Pd/C was the preferable catalyst. In regardless of the multiple reaction sites in 2-MCBones as well as the possible cyclobutyl ring opening side-reactions, the reaction occurred at the exocyclic CC bond regio-specifically. Herein, we wish to report our findings. (2)"
1,Experimental,
2,General methods,2.1 General methods Solvents were of analytical purity (AR) and were purchased from reagent merchant. 2-MCBones were synthesized via the literature method [40]. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance instruments (600 or 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 or 100 MHz for 13C NMR) using CDCl3 as solvent and Me4Si as internal standard. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR were relative to internal Me4Si (0 ppm) and J-values were shown in Hz. Theoretical calculations were conducted by GaussView 5 software (Gaussian09 package) using semi-empirical molecular orbital method (PM6). Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar Vario EL cube instrument.
3,General procedure for the hydrogenation reaction of 2-MCBones,"2.2 General procedure for the hydrogenation reaction of 2-MCBones 25 mg of Pd/C (containing 0.0235 mmol of Pd) and a magnetic bar were added into a reaction tube charged with N2. A solution of 1.0 mmol of 2-MCBone 1 (synthesized via the method in ref. [40] in 10 ml of anhydrous THF/EtOH (volume ratio = 4:1) was injected into the reaction tube, which was then equipped with a balloon charged with H2. The mixture was magnetically stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 6 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was separated by flash column chromatogram (eluent: petroleum ether-EtOAc 20:1) to give the 2-substituted cyclobutanones 2 in related yields (vide infra)."
4,Method for the determination and calculation of C-mass balance,"2.3 Method for the determination and calculation of C-mass balance C-mass balance was calculated by the following equation: C-mass balance = (carbon weight in the product + carbon weight in the by-products)/carbon weight in the reactant Carbon weight in the by-products was determined by elemental analysis. For example, in the reaction of 1a (Table 3, entry 1), after getting the desired product 2a by flash column chromatogram, acetone-methanol 1:1 was used as high-polar solvent to wash out the rest by-products on silica gel chromatographic column. Solvent of the combined solution of the by-products was removed under vacuum and the residue was weight and sent to elemental analysis to determine the carbon content. For the reaction of 1a (Table 3, entry 1), 133.0 mg of product 2a (containing 82.46% of C) and 30.4 mg of by-products was obtained. Elemental analysis indicated the by-products contained 72.51% of C. Therefore, the C-mass balance could be calculated as: C-mass balance = (133.0 mg × 82.46% +30.4 mg × 72.51%)/ [11 mmol (each molecular of 1a contained 11 C)×12.01 mg/mmol (atom weight of C)] = 99.7%"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst screenings,"3.1 Catalyst screenings Catalyst screenings were initially performed and for a 1 mmol-scale reaction, 5 mg of catalyst was employed (Table 1 ). The 2-MCB reactant dissolved well in THF, while alcohols, such as EtOH, were good solvents for catalytic hydrogenation reaction [37]. Therefore, THF/EtOH (4:1) was employed as the reaction solvent. We first tested the Raney Ni-catalyzed hydrogenation of 2-MCBone 1a with atmospheric pressure H2 in a balloon under room temperature (rt =25 °C), but almost no reaction occurred (Table 1, entry 1). Other commercially available regular catalysts, such as Pt/C, Ru/C and Pd/C (catalytic metal weight contents were all 10%) were then examined, and Pd/C was screened out to be the most active one, affording 2a in 21% yield (Table 1, entries 4 vs. 1–3). Pd@PANI [40–44], Ru@PANI [45], Cu@PANI [46], Pd@Al [47], Pd&Cu@Al [48] and Cu&Fe@Al [49], which were novel catalysts developed by our group recently, were employed but failed to optimize the reaction any more (Table 1, entries 5–10). Homogeneous Pd catalysts, such as PdCl2, Pd(OAc)2 and Pd(PPh3)4 were tested, but resulted in poor 2a yield and a series of unidentified by-products were observed in thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The above results demonstrated that only Pd catalysts worked for the reaction (Table 1, entries 4,5,8,9,11–13 vs. 1–3,6,7,10), and Pd/C was preferable not only for the higher product yield, but also for the good availability. Moreover, it was found that the product yield could be enhanced by increasing the Pd/C catalyst amount, and 25 mg of Pd/C for 1 mmol scale reaction was the inflection point of the curve, where 2a was obtained in 81% yield (Fig. 1 ). Further increasing Pd/C amount could not improve the reaction (Fig. 1), which was probably because of the limitation of the contact of the two-phase reactants of 1a with H2."
7,Solvent screenings,"3.2 Solvent screenings Solvent screenings for the reaction were performed and the results were summarized in Table 2 . The reaction did not occur in non-polar solvents such as toluene and cyclohexane, or chloro-contained solvents such as CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 (Table 2, entries 1–4), while polar solvents such as THF, 1,4-dioxane, MeCN, DMSO or DMF also led to very poor 2a yields (Table 2, entries 5–9). Alcohol solvents, such as MeOH and EtOH, were more preferable, affording 2a in 29–30% yields (Table 2, entries 1011). Interestingly, stirring 1a in EtOH could produce 2a in 8% yield even without using H2 balloon as the hydrogen source, showing that alcohol might participate the reaction as H-donor in the presence of Pd catalyst and the generated acetaldehyde might be reduced to EtOH again by H2. This process could accelerate the hydrogen process because it occurred in a homogeneous solution, other than the hydrogenation with H2 occurred between two-phase reactants [37]. Based on this finding, EtOH was added in THF (which could dissolve 2-MCBone well) to improve the reaction solvent and parallel experimental results demonstrated that THF/EtOH = 4:1 was the best volume ratio, giving 2a in 81% yield (Fig. 2 )."
8,Investigations on the effects of reaction temperature and time,"3.3 Investigations on the effects of reaction temperature and time Owing to the high reactivity of the 2-MCBone reactant, the hydrogenation reaction occurred at room temperature smoothly in high yield and turnover frequency. As shown in Fig. 3 , the product yield of the hydrogenation reaction was almost constant in the range of 25–100 °C, but for energy saving consideration, room temperature reaction condition, as we initially used, should be preferable. The reaction afforded 2a in 43% yield within 1 h. The yield gradually increased and reached its peak at 6 h, which should be the most favorable reaction time (Fig. 4 ). Moreover, after heating 2a at 100 °C under the standard reaction conditions (1 mmol of 2a, 25 mg of Pd/C, 10 ml of THF/EtOH, 6 h, H2), more than 94% of the chemical could be recovered again by flash column chromatography separation, showing that the produced 2-substituted cyclobutanones was stable under the reaction conditions and it did not decompose at the temperature below 100 °C. Thus, the slight decrease in yields upon increasing the reaction temperature (Fig. 3) may be rather attributed to catalyst deactivation or to the occurrence of other side-effects other than the product decomposition. This is supported by the fact that reactions do not come to completion even for very long reaction times (Fig. 4)."
9,Substrate extensions,"3.4 Substrate extensions A series of 2-substituted cyclobutones were then synthesized via this hydrogenation reaction under the optimized reaction conditions (Table 3). The product yield did not decrease in a 10 times scale-up reaction (Table 3, entries 2 vs. 1), and 1.28 g (in 80% yield) of 2-benzylcyclobutan-1-one (2a) was synthesized smoothly. The catalyst could be recovered by centrifugal separation and was reusable for at least three times without deactivation (Table 3, entry 2). Both electron-enriched and -deficient 2-MCBones were favorable substrates for the reaction (Table 3, entries 3–9), and the electron-enriched substrates were generally more preferable than the electron-deficient ones (Table 3, entries 3, 5–7 vs. 8,9). Interestingly, 2-(2-methoxybenzyl)cyclobutan-1-one (2f) could be synthesized in even higher yield than that of 2d, in regardless of the higher steric hindrance in substrate caused by the ortho-substituent on aryl (Table 3, entries 7 vs. 5). Similarly, (E)-2-(naphthalen-1-ylmethylene)cyclobutan-1-one (1i), as an example of substrate bearing bulky group, was also smoothly converted into the related product 2i in good yield (Table 3, entry 10). It was notable that the reaction was tolerant to sulfur-contained group, which might cause the Pd catalyst poisoning in many reactions, and the reaction of substrate 1j led to product 2j in excellent yield (Table 3, entry 11). The reaction was also applicable for aliphatic substrate, such as 1k, and produced the desired 2-substituted cyclobutanone 2k in moderate yield (Table 3, entry 12). C-mass balance of the reaction was calculated and it was generally high (>99%) in all of the examples (Table 3, entries 1,3–12)."
10,Mechanism study,"3.5 Mechanism study A series of methylene-substituted cyclic ketones 1a and 3a-c were employed in the hydrogenation reaction for comparison to judge the effect of substrate ring sizes on the reaction (Scheme 1). Using (E)-2-benzylidenecyclopentan-1-one (3a) or (E)-2-benzylidenecyclohexan-1-one (3b) as substrate resulted in decreased product yield (Scheme 1, runs 2,3 vs. 1). Bearing a very large eight-membered ring in substrate, the hydrogenation reaction of 2-benzylcyclooctan-1-one (3c) was difficult to occur and only traces of the desired product were observed on thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) plate (Scheme 1, run 4). To reveal the reasons for the above experimental results, quantitative calculations were performed with GaussView 5 software using semi-empirical molecular orbital method (PM6). It was found that the reaction of 1a to 2a released ca 110 kJ/mol of energy (Scheme 1, run 1). With the increasing of the substrate ring sizes, the released energies of the reactions of 3a to 4a and 3b to 4b decreased to 96 and 92 kJ/mol respectively (Scheme 1, runs 2–3). In the reaction of the eight-membered ring-contained substrate 3c to 4c, only 6 kJ/mol of energy was released (Scheme 1, run 4). The reduced reaction energy releasing might be the reason of the decreased product yields, in good accordance with the results of parallel experiments. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the hydrogenation reaction of the CC bond of 2-MCBones could partially release the high intramolecular ring strain caused by the combined effect of the small ring and exocyclic CC bond of the substrate and provide additional driving forces to facilitate the reaction processes under mild conditions. Chemo-selective hydrogenation reactions of CC versus CO bonds over noble metals may attribute to the grater affinity of the metals for CC [50–52]. Moreover, the quantitative calculation results have also indicated that, the hydrogenations of carbonyls in 2a, 4a and 4b to produce alcohols 5 released less energy than the related CC bond hydrogenation (Scheme 1, runs 5 vs. 1, 6 vs. 2, 7 vs. 3), and these results could well explain the reason of the high regio-selectivities of the reactions."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, an unexpected Pd/C-catalyzed room temperature and atmospheric pressure hydrogenation reaction of 2-methylenecyclobutanones was found to be an efficient method for the synthesis of 2-substituted cyclobutanones, which were useful synthetic intermediates for many drug and pesticide intermediates as well as the total synthesis of natural products. The method employed commercially available terminal starting materials such as cyclobutanone and aldehydes and could be performed under mild reaction conditions using atmospheric pressure H2 in balloon as the cheap, clean and safe reductant. Quantitative calculations demonstrated that the release of the intramolecular ring strain caused by the combined effect of the four-membered ring and exocyclic CC bond in the intermediate 2-MCBones provided additional dynamic driving forces for the reaction and the high regio-selectivity of the reaction was caused by the higher hydrogenation energy releasing of CC than CO. These new findings have broadened the understandings on the catalytic hydrogenation reactions of strained organic molecules."
