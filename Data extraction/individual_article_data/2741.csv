0,Introduction,"In recent years, clean energy, especially higher alcohols, has attracted considerable attention from both academic and industrial fields. Higher alcohols possess high octane number, and they can be burned completely with less emission of harmful substances, thereby making them excellent additives to gasoline [1]. Various catalysts, including noble Rh-based catalyst [2], antisulfur Mo-based catalyst [3], modified methanol catalyst [4], and Cu-modified Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis catalysts [2–6], have been developed for the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas. Among them, Rh, a precious metal, is expensive, which limits its application on large scale. Modified methanol catalysts produce methanol as the main reaction product with low C2+–OH selectivity [S(C2+–OH)] [7]. Compared with the Cu-modified F–T synthesis catalysts, the Mo-based catalysts need relatively severe reaction conditions. Thus, Cu-modified F–T synthesis catalysts are the most promising for the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas. In this process, Cu–Co bimetallic catalyst has received remarkable interest [8–12]. In addition, Cu–Fe catalyst is another good alternative because of its excellent activity in converting syngas to higher alcohols [13]. Xiao et al. found that unsupported Cu–Fe bimetallic catalyst could provide a kind of active center likely Cu–FeCx, which favored the formation of alcohols; consequently, this catalyst showed good selectivity to alcohols, in particular high selectivity to C6+–OH [14]. Sun et al. explored the influence of preparation method on the performance of Cu–Fe/SiO2 catalyst [15]. They reported that the Cu–Fe/SiO2 catalyst prepared by ultrasound-assisted impregnation exhibited the highest CO conversion and space time yield of total alcohols compared with those catalysts obtained by other methods. Although considerable works have been conducted to improve the selectivity of higher alcohols, it is still difficult to reduce the formation of hydrocarbon. Several studies have reported that the support can provide surface acidity or basicity active sites and change the interaction between the metal species and the carrier. Thus, the reactant adsorption, reducibility of the catalysts, and dispersion of the active species are influenced to some extent [8,16–18]. Among these carriers, carbon nanotube (CNT) is distinguished, and it has attracted extensive research interest for various applications because of its advantageous thermal and electrical properties, high surface area, and functionalized surfaces, especially their excellent performance in adsorption and spillover of hydrogen [19–21]. Heteroatom doping is an attractive approach for improving the properties of carbon materials for various applications. For example, N-doped CNT (N-CNT) can have the surface basicity and electronic structure which are different from the pristine CNT [16,22–24]. The basicity of N-CNT is beneficial for the chemisorption of CO, which can promote alcohol generation [25]. Moreover, N-CNT could stabilize the active Rh species through an electronic effect to form highly dispersed metal nanoparticles and obtain an improved catalytic performance [26]. Nevertheless, no comparison regarding the performance–structure correlation of N-CNT-supported Cu–Fe and N-free catalysts for the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas has been published. In this work, we prepared a N-CNT-supported Cu–Fe catalyst for the first time, aiming to enhance catalytic performance for the synthesis of higher alcohols. A series of characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to elucidate the interactions between support and metals. The detailed structural and kinetic studies addressing the effects of N doping were also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation CNT (95%; 20–40nm, diameter) was purchased from Shenzhen Nanotechnologies Port Co. Melamine was supplied by Alfa Aesar Ltd. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pristine CNT was purified and functionalized in concentrated HNO3 (68wt%) at 100°C for 16h under refluxing conditions to remove amorphous carbon and the catalyst residues. The treated CNT was filtered, extensively washed with deionized water until the pH of the rinsing water became 7.0, and dried at 110°C overnight. N-CNT was prepared by the same approach as in our previous report [22]. The supported Cu–Fe catalysts were prepared through a coimpregnation method with the aqueous solutions containing cupric nitrate and ferric nitrate. Quantitative amounts of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in deionized water. Subsequently, the support was added in the solution. After 12h of agitation at room temperature, the precursor was dried at 60°C overnight and calcined at 350°C for 4h in N2 atmosphere. The prepared catalysts were denoted as xCu n –Fe m /yN-CNT, where x and y represent the weight percentage of the metal and nitrogen in the corresponding catalyst, and n and m represent the atomic ratio of Cu and Fe, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was measured at −196°C using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 porosimetry analyzer. The samples were degassed at 200°C for 3h prior to measurements. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, where the isotherm data in a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.35 were adopted. The total pore volume was obtained from the absorbed N2 volume at a relative pressure of approximately 0.99. The XRD patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained on a PANalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418nm) with scanning angle (2θ) ranging from 10° to 90°. The step size was 0.0167° with a counting rate of 10 step s−1. The tube voltage was 40kV, and the current was 30mA. Each XRD pattern was identified by matching the results with the reference patterns included in the JCPDS database. XPS of the catalysts were performed using a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe instrument (Physical Electronics) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν=1486.6eV). Binding energy was calibrated on the base of C 1s (284.6eV). TEM images were obtained on a Tecnai F30 TEM operated at an acceleration voltage of 300kV. The powdered catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol at room temperature for 30min. The as-obtained solution was subsequently dropped in the carbon-coated copper grids. H2-TPR of the calcined catalyst samples were performed with Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. The sample (70mg) was loaded in a quartz U-tube and dried in an argon stream at 150°C for 1h to drive off physically adsorbed impurities. After cooling the catalysts to room temperature under argon atmosphere, 5% H2–95% Ar was introduced at a flow-rate of 30mLmin−1. The temperature was increased linearly from ambient temperature to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The CO2-TPD measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. The CNT or N-CNT supports were pretreated in a He flow at 150°C for 1h to remove the water and impurities. Afterward, the CO2 was absorbed for 1h after the furnace was gradually cooled to room temperature. He was purged to remove the residual CO2 for another 1h until the baseline was stable. Finally, the CO2-TPD curve was recorded from the ambient temperature to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 by MS (m/z 44 for CO2)."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The catalytic performance during CO hydrogenation was evaluated using a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor–gas chromatograph combination system. Typically, 200mg of the catalyst was mixed with 1mL quartz sand to maintain isothermal condition and placed in the reactor. Prior to the catalytic activity evaluation, the catalyst was reduced in a 5% H2−95% N2 flow at 400°C for 3h. When the furnace was cooled down to 220°C, the gas flow was switched to a syngas atmosphere (volume ratio of H2/CO=2) at 2.0MPa. All the products were detected online by a TDX-01 column with thermal conductivity detector and aKB-PONA column with flame ionization detector after 24h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural and textural properties,"3.1 Structural and textural properties In the wide scan XPS profiles of the catalysts with different N contents (Fig. 1 A), the binding energies (B. E.) approximately at 284–285, 532–533, 710–711, and 934–935eV were assigned to the contributions of C, O, Fe, and Cu, respectively. In addition, the signals approximately at 399–401eV (Fig. 1A, insert) were ascribed to the contributions of N species, which indicating that N species were successfully introduced onto the CNT surface. The TEM image in Fig. 1B showed that the CNT used in this work was a type of parallel multiwalled CNT, which was synthesized from catalytic decomposition of CO [27]. The structure and morphology of the CNT showed no noticeable changes, implying that doping N element exerted no influence on the CNT character. When the active metals were introduced on the above carbon materials, Cu and Fe species were dispersed at the inner or/and outer parts of CNT and N-CNT (Fig. 1C and D). The metal particle size distributions of 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT catalysts after reduction in H2 were 4.5–46.6nm and 4.7–31.5nm with corresponding average sizes at 18.8 and 15.9nm, successively. The textural properties of the CNT and the Cu–Fe catalysts before and after N doping are assessed and summarized in Table 1 . The results showed that the BET surface area (S BET) and pore diameter decreased after N doping. On the contrary, the pore volume showed no evident change, which might be due to the N deposition. Relative to the pure CNT, the BET surface area of the 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT catalyst and the 15Cu1–Fe1/N-CNT catalyst with different N contents decreased because of the blockage of narrow pores by the impregnation of Cu and Fe. Fig. 2 shows the XRD profiles of the 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT catalysts (as-calcined, as-reduced and as-used). The as-calcined samples of 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT exhibited no distinct differences in their characteristic diffraction peaks. The peaks appeared at 2θ of 35.6°, 38.7°, 48.9°, and 53.8° were ascribed to the diffraction lines of CuO. Nevertheless, no typical Fe oxide reflection peaks were detected, thereby suggesting the amorphous nature or small crystallite size of Fe oxides. After reduction in H2, the CuO and Fe oxides were reduced to metallic or lower valent Cu and Fe species for both as-reduced 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT catalysts. These XRD features, including partial Fe3O4 species (2θ =53.8°), were observed at 2θ of 43.5°, 50.6°, and 74.3° and 44.8°, 65.2°, and 82.4°, respectively. The average crystallite sizes of Cu0 and Fe0 calculated by Scherrer equation were approximately 16.8 and 21.0nm on the as-reduced 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT, while those on 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT were about 17.0 and 24.9nm, respectively. The results indicated the average size of Cu0 particles was similar in the catalysts with and without N dopant, while the average size of Fe0 particles was slightly small on the as-reduced 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT compared with 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT. The finding was in agreement with the TEM observation. After the reaction, the diffraction peak at 43.5° ascribed to the metallic Cu stayed exactly as it was, and no CuO peaks were detected. The peak of metallic Fe disappeared and the new diffraction peaks ascribed to Fe3O4 species at 30.0°, 35.3°, 53.8°, 56.5°, and 62.5° appeared obviously over the as-used 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT catalysts. That is to say, Cu species still mainly existed in the form of Cu0, although some surface Cu species might be oxidized as characterized by XPS investigations (Fig. S1). However, Fe species underwent a phase transition from metallic Fe to Fe3O4 during the reaction."
7,H2-TPR,"3.2 H2-TPR The H2-TPR characterization can provide useful information on the reducibility of catalyst. The corresponding TPR profiles of as-calcined samples, namely, 15Cu/1.3N-CNT, 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT, and 15Fe/1.3N-CNT, were compared to determine whether synergistic effects existed between Cu and Fe (Fig. 3 ). Two reduction peaks centered at approximately 150–250°C and 250–500°C existed in the H2-TPR profiles of as-calcined 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT in contrast to those of monometallic Cu and Fe samples. Peaks α and β at low temperature were the reduction of highly dispersed CuO particles and bulk-like CuO, respectively; the H2 consumption at high temperature (peaks γ and δ) was attributed to the stepwise reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 to Fe, respectively [2,7]. Notably, the reduction peak of CuO evidently splitted and the reduction peak of Fe2O3 strongly shifted toward higher temperature compared with that of the monometallic samples. This result indicated that synergism existed between Cu and Fe species. The as-calcined 15Cu1−Fe1/N-CNT sample gave peaks β and δ at lower temperatures compared with those of 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT, indicating the CuO and Fe-oxide species were reduced more easily. The result can be attributed to the enhanced interactions between N-CNT and active metal species through an electronic effect of N doping [28,29]."
8,CO2-TPD,"3.3 CO2-TPD CO2-TPD can effectively evaluate the surface basicity of the supports. The CO2-TPD results of the CNT before and after N doping are shown in Fig. 4 . Three CO2-desorption peaks with CNT support were centered at 330, 460, and 763°C, where peaks at 330 and 460°C, named as peaks α and β, respectively, were attributed to the desorption of absorbed CO2, and the peak at 763°C was due to the decomposition of surface oxygen-containing groups [30]. Doping of an appropriate amount of N to the CNT support significantly strengthened the CO2 adsorption and consequently increased the CO2 desorption temperature with all the N-doped supports. For example, the CO2-TPD peak increased to 543, 658, and 773°C for 1.3N-CNT. This result implied that the surface basicity of the N-CNT support was remarkably enhanced. Minimal differences existed in the CO2-TPD curve shapes of N-CNT supports with different N contents and all peaks appeared at almost the same temperature, indicating that the amount of basic sites did not change much for the supports with different N contents. In addition, the desorption amount of CO2, which is corresponded to the amount of surface basic sites calculated by integrating the peak area of the corresponding CO2 desorption peaks α and β, is listed in Table 2 . The amount of CO2 desorption showed a slight increase in the case of N-CNT, indicating a slight increase of the amount of basic sites. Among the N-CNT supports with different N contents, the amount of CO2 desorption displayed a slight increase with increase of N content and reached a maximum of 562µmolCO2 gcat −1 on 1.3N-CNT. Further increase of N content, however, the amount of basic sites did not change significantly. Previous reports have shown that the basicity and the amount of basic sites are favorable factors for the production of higher alcohols, because they are beneficial for CO chemisorption and thereby suppressing H2 adsorption [16,25,31]."
9,XPS,"3.4 XPS XPS measurement was performed to further distinguish the chemical valence of metal on the surface of the catalysts and N bonding configuration in N-CNT. The analysis of Cu 2p and Fe 2p signals for the catalysts with and without N dopant are demonstrated in Fig. 5 A and B, respectively. As for as-calcined 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT and 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT samples, the Cu 2p spectra showed typical B. E. ascribed to Cu2+. However, the Cu 2p B. E. of as-reduced catalysts shifted down to about 0.2–0.4eV accompanying with the disappearance of satellite peaks ascribed to Cu2+, indicating the complete reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0. The B. E. of Cu 2p in N-doped catalyst had a subtle shift to a lower value compared with N-free counterpart. However, Fe 2p in N-doped catalyst showed an approximately 0.4–0.5eV lower B. E. value than compared with N-free counterpart. Furthermore, N doping could promote the reduction of Cu and Fe species, which was verified by the formation of Fe0 (B. E.=707.2eV) and higher Cu0 concentration in as-reduced N-doped catalyst (Fig. 5B and C). Specifically, the Cu LMM XAES spectra in Fig. 5C revealed that the as-reduced 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT gave a higher ratio of Cu0/(Cu0 +Cu+) compared with the 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT. The above results indicated that there exists a strong electronic interaction between the active metals and N-CNT support assumably through the electron transfer from N atoms to Cu/Fe species [2,32]; this interaction is considerably significant for CO dissociation [13]. As shown in Fig. 5D, the N 1s profiles of three as-reduced 15Cu1−Fe1/N-CNT catalysts with different N contents presented four kinds of N species, namely, pyridinic nitrogen (NP), amine nitrogen (NA), pyrrolic nitrogen (NPYR), and quaternary nitrogen (NQ); these N species were located at B. E. of 398.7, 399.5, 400.2, and 400.9eV, respectively. According to the curve fittings, the relative content of the N species is given in Table 3 . Evidently, the percentage of NP on the surface of 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT was the highest (21.7%), while that on 0.6N-CNT and 2.4N-CNT was 19.8% and 18.0%, respectively. Density functional theoretical calculations indicated that introduction of NP into carbon nanostructures could provide basic sites through electron pair donation [18,34,35]. Therefore, the 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT catalyst might possess the most abundant basic sites, which was in good agreement with the CO2-TPD results and consistent with the catalytic performance. The Cu 2p and Fe 2p XPS profiles of as-reduced and as-used catalysts are depicted in Fig. S1. It is clear that a part of Cu0 species was oxidized to Cu2+ {probably Cu(OH)2} in the as-used 15Cu–Fe/1.3N-CNT catalyst, although the bulk Cu was maintained at Cu0 as evidenced by XRD (Fig. 2). The XAES spectra further illustrated the structural changes of surface Cu species in as-reduced and as-used 15Cu–Fe/1.3N-CNT catalyst. The spectra are displayed in Fig. S2. Asymmetry and overlapping Auger peaks were observed in the XAES spectra of Cu LMM [33]. The Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) area ratio was slightly increased from 29.6% to 31.9% after the reaction. Further, only Fe3O4 species were observed on the surface of as-used 15Cu–Fe/1.3N-CNT catalyst. Taking the results of XPS and XRD into account, we concluded that the Fe species in bimetallic Cu–Fe particles were essentially composed of Fe3O4 entity in the working catalyst."
10,Higher alcohol synthesis performance of the catalysts,"3.5 Higher alcohol synthesis performance of the catalysts 3.5.1 Effects of support, Cu/Fe ratio and metal loading The synthesis of higher alcohols was initially evaluated over the Cu–Fe catalysts supported on different carbon materials (Table S1). Of all carbon materials used, CNT was the optimal support. We then investigated the effects of Cu/Fe ratio and metal loading on the performance of Cu–Fe/N-CNT catalysts. The results are listed in Tables S2 and S3. The catalyst displayed insignificant differences in S(ROH) but showed remarkable changes in CO conversion and alcohol distribution when the Cu/Fe ratio was varied. When the Cu/Fe ratio decreased from 5:1 to 1:1, the CO conversion increased from 13.8% to 20.9% and the methanol selectivity [S(MeOH)] in the total alcohols decreased to a minimum value of 31.2%. As for the effect of metal loading, when the metal loading was increased from 5% to 15%, the catalyst presented increases in CO conversion and S(ROH) from 11.6% to 20.9% and 22.9% to 27.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the S(MeOH) was restrained from 36.5% to 31.2%. When the metal loading was further increased to 20%, the CO conversion and S(ROH) showed a slight decreased, while the S(MeOH) reached a maximum of 39.5%. Based on the above results, we prepared the catalyst with 1:1 Cu/Fe atomic ratio and 15% metal loading for the study afterwards. 3.5.2 Effect of N content The effect of N content on the catalytic performance of Cu–Fe/N-CNT catalysts is listed in Table 4 . All the catalysts showed an approximation of CO conversion, which may be due to the similar particle size of active Cu and Fe species (Fig. 1) [1,7], but the S(ROH) and distribution were quite different. The CNT-supported catalyst gave a S(ROH) of 20.2%, while the N-doped catalyst with 1.3% N content presented an evident increase in S(ROH) and its value reached a maximum value of 27.2%. Nevertheless, the 15Cu1−Fe1/2.4N-CNT catalyst with 2.4% N content displayed a negligible enhancement in S(ROH) (21.4%), indicating that a suitable incorporation of N dopant is inevitable to obtain an enhanced catalytic performance. The S(ROH) increased with a trend following to the basicity strength by CO2-TPD and XPS results. The above results suggested that surface basicity on the support would influence the total alcohol selectivity in the reaction product through increasing the CO chemisorption on the catalyst. Table 4 further shows that the S(MeOH) in the total alcohol decreased evidently and the S(C2+−OH) increased significantly over the Cu–Fe/N-CNT catalysts; the S(MeOH) decreased from 69.8% to 28.5% with the increase of N content from 0 to 2.4%. The result indicated that increasing N content suppressed the production of methanol and sequentially facilitated the generation of C2+−OH. Over the N-doped catalysts with different N contents, the S(C2+−OH) increased slightly from 64.5% to 71.5% when the N content was increased from 0.6% to 2.4%, presumably indicating that the strength of basic sites rather than the amount would be more important for the formation of C2+−OH. For the transition metals like Cu and Fe, their 3d orbital would be possible to accept the electrons transferred from N element, resulting in an increase in electron density around the Cu/Fe species. When the CO absorbed on the surfaces of the catalysts, the CO dissociation became easier on N-CNT-supported catalysts than that on CNT-supported catalyst by strengthening the Cu/Fe–C bond, thereby weakening the C–O bond through electron effect [16,36]. According to the H2-TPR (Fig. 3), N doping on the supports easily reduced the CuO species through strengthening the metal–support interactions, thereby leading to a high C2+−OH productivity [4]. 3.5.3 Long-term stability of the catalysts We used the 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT to further investigate the stability of the catalyst for CO hydrogenation under 220°C, 2.0MPa, and 6000mL g−1 h−1 and demonstrate the superior long-term stability of 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT. For comparison, the 15Cu1−Fe1/CNT catalyst was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6 , both catalysts exhibited excellent stability at 300h, except for the slow decrease of CO conversion during the first 40h. In addition, introducing N element could retard the decrease of CO conversion and obtain a higher CO conversion than that of the catalyst without N doping."
11,Promotional effects of N doping,"3.6 Promotional effects of N doping Many mechanisms have been proposed for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. As for the Cu-modified F–T synthesis catalysts like Cu−Co, it is widely considered that Cu serves as the active sites for alcohol formation, but Co enhances the carbon chain growth for Cu–Co dual catalyst [9–12,37]. Bao et al. proposed that ethanol is produced by hydrogenation of the tilt-adsorbed CO, subsequent CH2 insertion into the surface CH2–O species, and succeeding hydrogenation step over Rh-based catalysts [38]. In terms of the Cu−Fe bimetallic catalysts, Fe, as the chain growth active site, can largely promote the dissociation of CO and hydrogenation, and Cu serves as a CO insertion center through facilitating the associative adsorption of CO and hydrogenation [5,7,39]. Consequently, the synthesis of C2+ oxygenates from syngas probably includes three key active sites: (1) CO adsorption and/or non-dissociative sites, (2) carbon-chain growth through C–O dissociation and C–C coupling, and (3) CO insertion to form alcohols [40,41]. As for our system, we speculate that Cu species may function the associative adsorption of CO to form CO∗ (the symbol ∗ stands for adsorbed species, the same below), whereas Fe species activate C–O bond and generat ∗CnHx by C–C coupling; afterward, CO∗ is inserted and hydrogenated to alcohols [11,42]. In the present work, the excellent CO hydrogenation, especially enhanced C2+–OH selectivity, is obtained over the Cu−Fe/N-CNT catalysts. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, N-CNT support plays an important role for the enhanced performance of catalysts. N-CNT may provide helps in adsorption and/or dissociation of reactant molecules by modifying the electronic structure of CNT with delocalization effects at the N-site, inducing charge accumulation, and transporting and/or spillover to the active metal [22]. The electron transfers from p-orbitals of nitrogen to the 3d orbital of Fe and Cu [43]. Consequently, the electron density of the metal can be improved, which can strengthen the Fe/Cu–C bond and weaken the C–O bond. Thus, the CO adsorption and dissociation are enhanced, which favor the further hydrogenation of CO to alcohols. Moreover, the basicity of CNT is apparently enhanced by N addition, which is also beneficial to the chemisorption of CO [25,31,44] and prolongs the retention time of CO molecular. Hence, the chance of intimate contact of ∗CnHx and ∗CO is increased, and the chain growth to C2+–OH alcohols is favored. The above two factors are responsible for the enhancement effect of N introduction."
12,Conclusions,"N-CNT-supported Cu–Fe catalyst exhibited excellent performance in the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas. In particular, the selectivity toward methanol markedly decreased, and the formation of C2+–OH alcohols increased considerably. The optimized catalyst 15Cu1−Fe1/1.3N-CNT afforded 68.8% selectivity to C2+–OH and 31.2% selectivity to methanol. The catalyst without N doping (15Cu1−Fe1/CNT) presented 30.2% selectivity to C2+–OH and 69.8% selectivity to methanol under the reaction conditions of P =2.0MPa, T =220°C, GHSV=6000mLg−1 h−1, and n(H2)/n(CO)=2. The catalyst 15Cu1–Fe1/1.3N-CNT also exhibited excellent stability and sustained higher CO conversion at 300h than that with 15Cu1–Fe1/CNT, although they both showed a slow decrease in CO conversion during the first 40h. The performance–structure correlation suggested that electron effect and basicity were remarkably strengthened due to the incorporation of N into CNT. Consequently, the CO dissociative adsorption, C–C coupling, and CO insertion were favored, thereby significantly improving C2+–OH selectivity and simultaneously suppressing methanol formation. Therefore, N doping is an effective approach to improve the catalytic performance of CNT-based catalyst for CO hydrogenation."
