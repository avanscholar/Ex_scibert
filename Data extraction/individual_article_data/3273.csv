0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is an alternative clean energy that does not affect climate change and prevents air pollution caused by fossil fuel-based energy systems currently used in industry. Amongst the various hydrogen sources NaBH4 attracts great attention due to its hydrogen storage capacity, nonflammability, nontoxicity, economical availability, and so on [1–3]. Various parameters such as the catalyst type and its concentration, the amount of NaBH4, the presence of cocatalyst, and the temperature of reaction play crucial roles in the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4 [4]. As a catalyst system, bare metal particles or metal particles with support have been used till now [5,6]. These designed materials were created to enhance catalytic performance of the system. In order to create better templates and cocatalyst systems, polymeric materials and ionic liquids have been extensively studied. In this study, we will try to merge these two materials, and make new materials to serve as a novel catalyst system. Ionic liquids (ILs) basically consist of cation and anion similar to metal salts; however, they are organic molten salts with intriguing properties, such as low melting point, nonflammability, nonvolatility, low viscosity, no measurable vapor pressure, high ion concentration and conductivity, etc. [7–9]. Due to these appealing properties, they possess great potential in a variety of application areas ranging from synthesis media, catalysis, separation, and energy. Amongst all application fields, ILs are most likely to have viable use in energy production or storage [10]. There are many investigations of the use of ILs for conversion of solar energy to electricity and fossil resources to biofuel, therefore ILs could be a key for greener energy [7–11]. Another important application of ILs in energy and environmental studies is their use as a solvent for producing biodiesel through a transesterification process [11]. If ionic liquids are compared with common organic solvents, it could be said that they are greener and better solvents due to low vapor pressure and their highly ionic and hydrophobic nature at room temperature. In addition, they can be efficiently used for organic pollution controls e.g., elimination of phenolic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dyes from wastewater [12]. The physical properties of ILs can be tuned by choice of cation and anion [13]. Different organic cations have been reported for electrolytic applications of ILs [14,15]. Charged polymers could be good candidates for generation of new IL materials which possess unique features that belong to both polymer and counter intrinsic properties of anion/cation. So far, ILs were mostly used as a medium for polymerization reactions. Polymeric gels that contain polymerizable ionic liquids showed high conductivity, good thermal properties, etc. [16–20]. Therefore, the combination of polymer and ILs could provide new unique features. Hydrogels are one of the most versatile classes of polymer due to their biocompatibility and ability to absorb a large amount of water and to sense changes in their environment [21,22]. Hydrogels are also “smart” or “intelligent” in the sense that they can perceive stimuli and respond by exhibiting changes in phases, shapes, colors, volume, surface energies, reaction rates, and dimension [23]. They are sensitive to changes in pressure, pH, light, temperature, and solvent. Functional groups within the hydrogel structure are the moieties responsible for all these behaviors [24,25]. For instance, cationic hydrogels have gained significant attention for DNA condensation and delivery in medicinal studies as due to the negative charge of DNA they can easily bind to it [26,27]. In this work, cationic polymeric particles were prepared and IL particles were used as templates for in situ metal nanoparticle preparation. Although there are reports on ionic liquid microgel preparation in the literature, there is no report of ionic liquid colloid for in situ metal nanoparticle preparation and catalysis [28,29]. The aim was to produce different metal nanoparticles such as Co, Ni, Cu, and Fe within cationic microgels, and investigate their catalytic properties for hydrogen production from NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis. We report for the first time that cationic microgels can be used to absorb metal salts from alcohol media via electrostatic interaction between metal chloride salts dissolved in molecular form and cationic hydrogels and later reduced to their corresponding metal nanoparticle. These metal nanoparticle-embedded IL colloids can also be used as catalyst media for various reactions. It is suggested that metal halogens (MXn, n: 2 or 3 more) are dissolved molecularly (MXm a−) in ethanol (m ≥ 2), and these negatively charged metal halogens serve as anions of the polymeric ionic liquids."
1,Materials and Method,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents The monomer used for the hydrogel synthesis was (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride (APTMACl) (75 wt% solution in water). N,N’-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) was used as the crosslinker, ammonium persulfate (APS) as redox initiator, and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) as an accelerator for the polymerization reaction. NaBH4 (98%, Merck) was used as reagent for hydrolysis. Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99% Sigma–Aldrich), nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 97%, Riedel-de Haën), copper(II) chloride (CuCl2, 99% Aldrich), iron(II) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl2, 98%, and 99%, FeCl3, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as metal sources. Commercial gasoline (from Shell) was used as the organic solvent for the formulation of the water in oil inverse suspension polymerization system, and the surfactant was sorbitane monooleate (SPAN® 80, Fluka). Sodium dicyanamide (SDCA) and sodium tetrafluoroborate (STFB) were used as anion sources. Ethanol and dimethyl formamide (DMF) (Merck) of reagent grade were used as solvents. Distilled water (Millipore Direct-Q3 UV) was used throughout the experiments. All chemicals were used without purification."
3,Synthesis of microgels and metal nanoparticle preparation in microgels,"2.2 Synthesis of microgels and metal nanoparticle preparation in microgels The microparticles of cationic p(APTMACl) were synthesized in an inverse suspension polymerization technique in gasoline using SPAN80 as an inverse suspension stabilizing agent. The emulsifier/solvent molar ratio was varied to achieve different crosslinking densities for the microgel samples. The highest yield was obtained by the ratio 1.6/10 (v/v), in which the emulsifier concentration was 20% of the monomer molar concentration. The aqueous phase contained the monomer, crosslinker (1% with respect to APTMACl mole number), and the initiator (1% of APTMACl molar concentration). The aqueous phase was added to the 10 ml gasoline phase (oil phase) containing 1.6 ml SPAN 80, and the mixture was stirred at 800 rpm. After 20 min stirring, TEMED was added to the mixture. The reaction completed within 2 h and micro particles were precipitated by adding acetone to the mixture. Acetone and ethanol were used to wash the particles to remove non-reacted chemicals, solvent, and emulsifier. Metal chloride salts, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, and FeCl3, were dissolved in ethanol at approximately 0.01 mole in 50 mL. The metal salt amounts were calculated as a function of monomer molar ratio of 1:2. The metal salt loading studies were performed under constant stirring (200 rpm) at room temperature for a week. At the end of the metal loading period, the metal chloride-loaded microgels were washed with ethanol 3 times to remove unbound metal chloride molecules. The metal salt laden p(APTMACl) microgels weighing about 0.5 g were treated with 0.5 M 50 mL NaBH4 to reduce the metal salts to their corresponding metal nanoparticles (MNPs) at 30°C in situ for 2 h at 600 rpm mixing rate to form p(APTMACl)-M (M: Co, Ni, Cu, Fe). The prepared composites were dried and used for catalysis studies."
4,Hydrogen generation via p(APTMACl)-M catalyzed NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis,"2.3 Hydrogen generation via p(APTMACl)-M catalyzed NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis Metal nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl)-M particles at certain weights (0.05–0.2 g), were placed into 50 ml and 50 mM NaBH4 solution. The hydrogen production began as soon as p(APTMACl)-M composites were added and was measured as a function of time under a constant stirring rate of 1000 rpm. In all studies, the produced hydrogen gas filled the volumetric cylinder after passing through concentrated H2SO4 to remove the water vapor. In hydrolysis of NH3BH3 the same technique was used as for NaBH4 hydrolysis."
5,Results and Discussion,
6,P(APTMACl) Microgel,"3.1 P(APTMACl) Microgel Cationic p(APTMACl) was synthesized in bulk, micro, and nano sizes by Sahiner et al. using various techniques, and the characterization of obtained hydrogels at different dimensions was done employing a variety of techniques in terms of water swelling experiments, pH responsive behavior, dye and toxic species absorption properties, and even rheological characterization of polymerization and crosslinking reaction mechanism [30–32]. In this work, p(APTMACl) microgels were synthesized in a different system as described earlier within 1–20 micrometer size range. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), upon crosslinking the cationic monomer, APTMACl, spherical cationic microgels were formed. Fig. 1(b) represents the optic microscope images of dry p(APTMACl) microgels, and (c) are swollen p(APTMACl) microgels. Upon swelling in water the size of microgels increased up to 100 μm. The zeta potential of the microgel was measured using a ZetaPALs zeta sizer (BIC) and was + 28.8 ± 0.97 mV. This value was compared with Lo et al.’s study which used the same material, and was confirmed [33,34]. So, it can be assumed that the positive charges are retained in the p(APTMACl) microgel structure. As the p(APTMACl) microgels are positively charged, it is not possible to load metal ions from aqueous solutions in the conventional way used by metal ion absorption studies. Due to the electrostatic interaction between metal ions in the aqueous environment and the cationic microgels which prevent absorption, these metal ions necessitate a different approach. To surmount this obstacle, metal chloride salts i.e., CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, and FeCl3, were dissolved in ethanol and placed in contact with p(APMACl) microgels. As illustrated schematically in Fig. 2 (a), the metal salts dissolved in ethanol in molecular forms, and it is suggested that they loaded into p(APTMACl) in the form [MCl4]2-, such as [CoCl4]2− (tetrachloro-cobaltate), [NiCl4]2− (tetrachloro-nickelate), or [CuCl4]2− (tetrachloro-cuprate), etc. in cationic compounds [35]. The metal salt-containing p(APTMCl) microgel was then exposed to NaBH4 for reduction to form metal nanoparticles of the corresponding ions in situ. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), TEM images p(APMACl), Co particles with the size range of about 100 nm were formed in microgel networks. Depending on the nature of the metal salt, p(APTMACl) microgels assume a solution color as demonstrated in Fig. 3(a), (b), (c), and (d). Regardless of their color, the metal salt-loaded microgel color turns black as an indication of metal nanoparticle formation as soon as they come in contact with aqueous NaBH4 solution as shown in Fig. 3(f) for p(APTMACl)-Co composites. The other metal salts also assumed the same dark coloration with small changes in the intensity of the black color. The monodisperse ionic microgel beads derived from imidazole derivatives were reported as multiple, chemically switchable functional materials [36]. These beads demonstrated multiple stimuli responsive behaviors including redox response, controlled release of chemical payloads, magnetization, toxic metal removal from water, and robust, reversible pH sensing. Therefore, IL microparticles have great potential in many advance sensing material applications. Even some of IL polymers can be made magnetic field responsive directly by usingparamagnetic anions such as tetrachloroferrate(III) (FeCl4 −) and tetrabromoferrate(III) (FeBr4 −) with Poly(1-vinyl-3-ethyl-imidazolium bromide/chloride) as a reusable catalyst in Friedel–Crafts alkylation [37]. The thermal characterization of p(APTMACl) particles was done by thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) (SII TG/DTA 6300) under inert nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature was increased from 50°C to 1000°C, and the thermogram of p(APTMACl) and its metal composites (p(APTMACl)-[CoCl4]2-, p(APTMACl)-[NiCl4]2-, p(APTMACl)-[CuCl4]2−) are given in Fig. 4 . As can be seen from the thermogram, 3% loss of weight was observed until 150°C and this could be due to the removal of bound water from the structure. However, the actual degradation of p(APTMACl) particles began around 230°C, a sharp decrease was observed at about 300°C, and 40% of the structure was lost. Upon increasing the temperature up to 431°C, 80 wt% of the microparticle degraded. Metal salt-containing microgels also showed similar degradation characteristics. Up to 1000°C, the amount of Co, Ni, and Cu-containing microgels were about 18.2, 2.0, and 17.9 wt% in comparison to bare p(APTMACl). The degradation of Ni-containing p(APTMACl) was similar to bare microgel. In order to determine the metal absorption amount, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used. The metal nanoparticles were prepared within a certain amount of p(APTMACl) microgels and were exposed to 5 M 5 ml HCl to dissolve metal particles as metal ions and their amounts were determined with AAS. According to AAS results, 1.0 g p(APTMACl) microparticles absorbed 148.60 ± 3.1 mg Co(II), 14.70 ± 0.9 mg Ni(II), 163.60 ± 2.4 mg Cu(II), and 86.36 ± 2.2 mg Fe(III). In Table 1 , a comparison is made between dissolved metal ions from p(APTMACl)-M measured with AAS and TGA weight loss. As can be seen AAS results are less than TGA results, this is generally the case as TGA may contain different metal compounds coming from the reaction of p(APTMACl) functional groups or its degradation products. A magnetic susceptibility balance (MSB mkl, Alfa-Aesar) was used to measure the magnetic susceptibility of metal salt absorbed, metal nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl) microparticles [38,39]. χ g = [ ( L e n g t h o f t u b e f i l l e d i n c m / M a s s o f s a m p l e i n t u b e i n g ) * C * ( R − R 0 ) ] , where Xg is mass susceptibility, and Ro and R are empty tube and sample masses in the tube, respectively. C is a constant with a value of 1*10−9. According to MSB results summarized in Table 2 , mass susceptibility values of p(APTMACl)-Co and p(APTMACl)-[CoCl4]2− composites were 1.88*10−6 and 8.02*10−6 in cgs units, respectively. Also, p(APTMACl)-Co particles were reloaded from CoCl2 solution in ethanol a second time and reduced by NaBH4, then the mass susceptibility value measured 3.18*10−5 cgs. These 2nd time loaded p(APTMACl)-Co composites were exposed to a loading and reduction cycle one more time, and the mass susceptibility increased to 3.34*10−5 cgs. As can be seen the susceptibility of p(APTMACl) microparticle composites increased with the increase in amount of Co in the chloride salt and metal nanoparticles. Moreover to further corroborate, as shown in Fig. 5 , the Co metal nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl) microgels are inherently magnetic field responsive and can be directed under an externally applied magnetic field. Fig. 5(a) demonstrates the free suspension of the p(APTMACl)-Co microgel composite system with CoCl2 loaded and reduced three times and their collection with a magnet as shown in (b), (c), and (d). These types of materials as catalyst with inherent magnetic field response may have great potential in hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of metal hydrides controlled under an externally applied magnetic field without any inclusion of ferrites [37,40]."
7,Catalytic comparison of p(APTMACl)-M composites for hydrogen production from NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis,"3.2 Catalytic comparison of p(APTMACl)-M composites for hydrogen production from NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis Early studies of p(APTMACl) showed that negatively charged oxy metal ions such as arsenic and chrome ions, or some dyes used in food industry, and fluorescent dyes could be captured and removed from aquatic environments [41]. In this study, cationic polymeric particles absorb metallic salts from alcohol solution to form IL colloids. It is otherwise impossible to load positively charged metal ions such as Co(II), Ni(II), and so on from an aqueous environment to positively charged p(APTMACl) microgels. The prepared p(APTMACl)-MCl4 were then treated with NaBH4 to form M-metal nanoparticles within the polymeric matrix as encapsulated nanoparticles. It is very well known that metal ions such as Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), and Ru(II) etc. can be readily reduced to their corresponding metal nanoparticles [42]. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of in situ prepared M nanoparticles (M: Co, Ni, Cu, Fe) was tested in NaBH4 hydrolysis for hydrogen production, and their performances were compared. The amount of generated hydrogen versus time for each p(APTMACl)-M composite (M: Co, Ni, and Fe) system was graphed and is illustrated in Fig. 6(a). It is obvious that p(APTMACl)-Co particles catalyzed the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction faster than Ni and Fe nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl) catalyst systems. Interestingly, it was observed that p(APTMACl)-Fe composite catalyst system hydrogen generation rate is very close to p(APTMACl)-Co composite catalyst system in the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4. However, as will be shown during this investigation the catalytic activity of p(APTMACl)-Fe composite system is not very favorable for repetitive use. Also, catalytic activities of Co and Cu composites of p(APTMACl) were compared in the NH3BH3 hydrolysis reaction as shown in Fig. 6(b). According to these results, Co nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl) composite system catalyzes NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis more effectively than Cu, Ni, and Fe nanoparticles. The TOF values for the H2 production of the catalyst systems were also compared and are given in Table 3 . Even though p(APTMACl)-Fe catalyst system has better activity and TOF values for NaBH4 hydrolysis, the reusability of p(APTMACl)-Co is better, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, the TOF value of the p(APTMACl)-Co catalyst system is better than p(APTMACl)-Cu for NH3BH3 hydrolysis. Overall, it can be concluded that p(APTMACl)-Co catalyst systems are viable systems for H2 generation from hydrolysis of chemical hydrides. The most interesting feature of the p(APTMACl)-M catalyst systems is that their catalytic reaction does not require any base addition, as the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction is generally performed in basic media. In the literature, hydrolysis of metal hydride employing metal catalysts necessitates the use of NaOH to increase the reaction rate [1,43,44]. However, here we observed that the use of NaOH does not make any significant difference to reaction rates, contrary to early polymeric catalyst systems. The hydrolysis of NaBH4 was carried out in the presence and the absence of NaOH. As demonstrated in Fig. 7(a), the use of NaOH (5 wt%) reduces the activity of NaBH4 to 60.7% and 45.7% for 2nd and 3rd consecutive uses, respectively. On the other hand, when no NaOH is used as shown in Fig. 7(b), the activity does not change significantly, 99% and 96.9% for 2nd and 3rd use. Even six successive uses resulted in 56.6% activity with respect to initial use. Therefore, it can be assumed that p(APTMACl) has a basic nature and provides enough cocatalyst strength for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. So, these types of inherent cocatalyst-containing materials may provide superior life for the catalyst and increase economic feasibility as the addition of NaOH increases the deactivation rate of metal catalysts by increasing the formation of a byproduct, NaBO2 [45]."
8,The effect of the catalyst amount on NaBH4 hydrolysis catalyzed by p(APTMACl)-Co,"3.3 The effect of the catalyst amount on NaBH4 hydrolysis catalyzed by p(APTMACl)-Co Catalyst amount directly affects the catalytic reaction rate. Therefore, p(APTMACl) microparticles were placed in CoCl2 solution in ethanol and then reduced to the corresponding metal nanoparticles within p(APTMACl) microparticles. This process was repeated three times to increase the amount of metal nanoparticles. After each cycle, the amount of Co increased from 148.60 ± 3.1 mg to 350.16 ± 4.3 mg, and to 659.95 ± 4.8 mg for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd loading-reduction cycles, respectively, per 1.00 g p(APTMACl) microparticles. The amounts of metal ions were measured by AAS after the dissolution of Co metal nanoparticles by the aforementioned acid treatment. Fig. 8 illustrates the effect of Co nanoparticle amount on hydrogen production with time. It is obvious that the increase in the amount of Co metal nanoparticles increases the hydrogen generation rate almost linearly. The inset also confirms these findings."
9,Reusability of p(APTMACl)-M composites for NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis,"3.4 Reusability of p(APTMACl)-M composites for NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis The reusability of a catalyst system is one of the most sought after characteristics for effective industrial use of a system as long as high catalytic activity is retained. The reusability of p(APTMACl)-M composite catalyst systems (M:Co, Cu, and Fe) were tested repetitively for NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis. The results are summarized in Table 4 . As can be seen, Co and Fe nanoparticle-containing p(APTMACl) composite catalyst systems could be used up to four times in NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction without any significant loss of catalytic activity. Although Fe metal nanoparticle catalytic performances are as good as Co metal nanoparticles, the catalytic activity goes down to 53%, whereas, the activity of Co particles is fairly high at 78%. It could be said that p(APTMACl)-Co composites can catalyze NaBH4 hydrolysis more effectively than p(APTMACl)-Fe composites. The hydrolysis of NH3BH3 can be catalyzed by Co, Ni, and Cu metal nanoparticles but cannot be catalyzed by Fe particles. The hydrogen generation rate from the hydrolysis of NH3BH3 by Ni nanoparticles is slow, therefore we compared the catalytic activities of Co and Cu metal nanoparticles. As shown in Table 3, Cu particles catalytic performances are better than Co particles, and reduce to 52%."
10,The effect of anion in p(APTMACl) ILs on NaBH4 hydrolysis,"3.5 The effect of anion in p(APTMACl) ILs on NaBH4 hydrolysis In order to investigate the effects of anion in the structure of p(APTMACl) microparticles Cl− anions were exchanged with dicyanamide (DCA) and tetrafluoroborate (TFB) anions as they are the most commonly used anions for ILs. The anion exchange was done using 0.1 g dried p(APTMACl) microparticles in DCA and TFB solutions in DMF, and mixing for 12 h. To confirm the exchange of anions, FT-IR spectroscopy was used. As demonstrated in Fig. 9(a), the characteristic CN peaks of DCA (2) and the B-F peak of TFB (3) could be observed at 2170 cm−1 and at 1010 cm−1, respectively. These peaks are also seen in p(APTMACl)-DCA and p(APTMACl)-TFB, corroborating the occurrence of the exchange of anions. These anion changed microparticles were also exposed to CoCl2 solution in ethanol to load metal salts into the microgel, then the metal salt was reduced to its metal nanoparticles and they were used in the hydrolysis of NaBH4. As these anions are larger than Cl-, it was expected that the absorption amounts of metal salt should decrease. The absorbed metal amounts for anion exchanged microparticles decreased slightly (< 10%). The metal absorption times were the same for both DCA and TFB exchanged particles and p(APTMACl) particles. Therefore the hydrogen production rate versus time graph for each catalyst system is given in Fig. 9(b) under the same hydrolysis conditions (50 mM and 50 ml NaBH4). As the figure reveals, p(APTMACl)-Co microparticles composite hydrolysis rate is faster than p(APTMACl)-DCA-Co and p(APTMACl)-TFB-Co. These results are plausible as the sizes of the anions increase in the same order as their hydrogen production rates. Additionally, the chloride anion is more mobile than the other anions and is also a common ion in metal salts, therefore the presence of chloride enhances the absorption capacity for metal salt and eventually the hydrolysis rate."
11,Conclusion,"The colloidal polymeric ionic liquid system is reported for the first time by loading a cationic microgel with metal salts. These polymeric ionic liquids were further investigated as a template for metal nanoparticle preparation for Co, Ni, Cu, and Fe, and used as catalyst system to produce hydrogen from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 and NH3BH3. The most important outcome of this investigation is the inherently magnetic Co nanocatalyst preparation and use, requiring no co-catalyst (NaOH in this case) for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. These types of materials can also be tuned for inclusion of different anions that may offer additional advantages for different advanced catalyst designs and material preparation. In fact, our current investigation is focused on devising such a system. Moreover, these colloidal polymeric ionic liquids could be effectively used for green energy and for applications linked to environmental issues."
