0,Introduction,"Global environmental concerns, reduction of fossil fuels resources, growing demand to energy sources as a result of human population increase, are some of the reasons which lead to look for and develop new clean sources of energy. Electrical energy generation by proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is one of the most effective method in order to produce electrical energy with very low detrimental substances emission into environment [1–3]. Pure hydrogen gas is used as fuel in PEMFCs. Hydrogen due to its very low contamination is known as one of the most attractive energy carrier in recent years [4–6]. Earnest problems of hydrogen storage and transportation, lead to on-board production of it through simple alcohols and hydrocarbon reforming process [7–10]. Among all possible chemical compounds, methanol due to some especial advantages such as the absence of CC bond, lower reforming temperature and high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (4:1) can be significantly utilized in reforming process in order to produce hydrogen gas [11–14]. There are 4 different types of methanol reforming process: methanol decomposition (MD) [15,16], partial oxidation of methanol (POM) [17,18], steam reforming of methanol (SRM) [19–21] and oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM) [22–24]. The highest yield of hydrogen generation and also the lowest value of carbon monoxide production are some of the advantages of steam reforming of methanol reaction [25]. There are three main reactions in SRM process [26,27]. Main reforming reaction Eq. (1), methanol decomposition, Eq. (2) and water gas shift reaction, Eq. (3) [28,29]: (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H = 49.7 kj / mol (2) CH 3 OH ↔ CO + 2 H 2 Δ H = 90.2 kj / mol (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = - 41.2 kj / mol As seen, in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, carbon monoxide is also produced through SRM reaction. Because of the harmful effects of CO on the anodic catalyst and membrane of the fuel cells, the amount of this gas must be very low [30–32]. The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) (Eq. (3)) is the most important reaction for production of carbon monoxide along steam reforming of methanol process. Forasmuch as the water gas shift reaction is strongly exothermic, the RWGS reaction cannot proceed at low temperatures, and in this way, CO production is very slight. Steam reforming of methanol is a catalytic reaction and the role of catalyst in higher activity at low temperatures in order to production of hydrogen with low concentration of carbon monoxide is very important. Also, the role of steam reforming of methanol reaction catalysts in order to provide slight selectivity toward carbon monoxide generation particularly at high temperatures is very significant. The SRM reaction catalysts are divided into two major groups: copper based and group 8–10 metals catalysts [33–40]. Copper based catalysts due to their appropriate properties such as higher activity and better selectivity toward desirable products are the most common catalysts for use in SRM reaction. The commercial catalyst for steam reforming of methanol reaction is CuO/ZnO/Al2O3. The performance of this catalyst can be improved by changing the synthesis method or applying different promoters [41–43]. The synthesis method can affect structure, surficial morphology and finally catalytic performance through sensitive variations in specific surface area, interaction between various species as well as distribution and dispersion of active phases on the catalyst. Coprecipitation, sol-gel, impregnation, homogeneous precipitation, hydrothermal and oxalate gel coprecipitation are some of the conventional synthesis methods that have been used for preparation methanol steam reforming reaction catalysts [44–49]. In addition to applying different synthesis methods, post treatment process such as different calcination conditions and plasma treatment can significantly change the performance of the catalysts. Glow discharge plasma as a kind of non-thermal plasma treatment is a novel post treatment process which is used in order to surficial treatment of the nanocatalysts before calcination process [50–53]. Positive and negative ions, electrons, atoms, free radicals and photons are some of the most important constituents of plasma. With increasing the applied voltage across the two electrodes which inserted into glass tube, the current suddenly increases sharply and if the pressure is low, on the order of a few Torrs, and also the external circuit has a large resistance to prevent a large current, a glow discharge develops. Non-thermal glow discharge plasma can significantly affect the crystallography features, surficial morphology, particles size distribution, surficial elemental dispersion and specific surface area of the catalysts. In this regard, applying glow discharge plasma, leads to higher dispersion of different metal crystallites, stronger interaction between different metal oxides, more uniform distribution of small and isomorph particles, better dispersion of various elements on the surface of catalyst and finally higher specific surface area [54–57]. With these changes in physicochemical properties, the performance of the catalysts can be significantly improved for higher conversion of methanol at low temperatures in order to generate hydrogen gas with slight concentration of carbon monoxide. In this research we use hydrothermal and coprecipitation synthesis methods to prepare CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts in order to compare the effects of synthesis method on the performance of the catalysts in SRM reaction. The effects of non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment on the physiochemical properties and performance of the synthesized nanocatalysts by each preparation method are also investigated in this research. Different performance of the catalysts which are prepared by two various synthesis methods as well as plasma treated and non-treated samples can be attributed to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalysts as a result of applying various preparation methods and non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment. Physicochemical properties of the synthesized nanocatalysts are analyzed by use of XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX spectra and dot-mapping, BET and FTIR techniques."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this research work, copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu (NO3)2·3H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O) and aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al (NO3)3·9H2O) were applied as copper, zinc and aluminium precursors respectively. Also, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were used as precipitation agents. Moreover, ethanol was used as solvent for preparation of aqueous/alcoholic solution of precursors in coprecipitation synthesis method. Finally, methanol was applied for steam reforming reaction. All of materials were supplied from Merck Company. Furthermore, high purity Argon gas which was applied as plasma forming gas, was purchased from Technical Gas Service in Ajman, UAE."
3,Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure,"2.2 Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure Preparation process of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst by hydrothermal and plasma-assisted hydrothermal methods is shown in Fig. 1 . Also, processing steps of preparation of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst by coprecipitation and plasma-assisted coprecipitation methods are shown in Fig. 2 . As seen in Fig. 1, hydrothermal synthesis method consists of three stages. In the first stage, 1M aqueous solution of suitable values of copper, zinc and aluminium nitrate precursors was created for preparation of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst. Copper oxide, zinc oxide and aluminium oxide weight percentages in the catalyst were 45, 45 and 10, respectively. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was also created at first stage. The Amount of sodium hydroxide was three times as many as nitrate ions. In the next step, aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added to 1M aqueous solution of nitrate precursors and mixed for 20min at 500rpm. In the second stage, hydrothermal synthesis was done for 9h at 180°C. Post treatment process was performed in the third stage. At first step of this stage, obtained mixture from previous stage was washed with deionized water until pH=7. Then, the mixture was dried at 110°C for 16h under air flow. After drying, calcination process was carried out at 350°C for 5h under air atmosphere. Finally, nanocatalyst powder shaping was done by the help of Plexiglas reticulated plate, in order to have small cylindrical particles of catalyst for use in the reactor of methanol steam reforming reaction. The height and diameter of the prepared small cylindrical particles of catalyst were 3.5 and 1mm, respectively. For preparation of plasma treated nanocatalyst, dried mixture should be exposed under non-thermal glow discharge plasma before calcination process. Plasma treatment for nanocatalysts was performed for 15min at 1000V and this process was repeated three times for each sample in order to obtain uniform treated powder. A schematic flow chart of the non-thermal glow discharge plasma experimental setup for treatment of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 3 . In order to commencement of plasma treatment process of the catalysts, a thin layer of dried powder of each sample with approximate weight about 0.2g was loaded on a rectangular Quartz plate which its length and width were 6 and 3.5cm, respectively. Then, the Quartz plate was located in the Pyrex tube (as a plasma chamber) in vicinity of anode electrode where the positive column zone of glow discharge plasma was formed. The dimensions of Pyrex tube were 20cm in height and 5cm in diameter. At the next stage, high purity Argon gas was applied as plasma forming gas. The injection rate of high purity Argon gas into Pyrex tube was fixed at 20cm3/min by the help of Apex mass flow controller, during the plasma treatment process. After that, the Pyrex tube was evacuated by Pfeiffer turbo-molecular vacuum pump until a pressure about 1Torr. Eventually, by applying a high voltage of 1000V between cathode and anode electrodes with the help of a high voltage DC generator, desirable non-thermal glow discharge plasma was produced in plasma chamber and treatment of the samples was done under these conditions. The nanocatalyst that has been synthesized by hydrothermal method and plasma treated sample of this nanocatalyst were denoted as CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (HP) respectively. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 2, coprecipitation synthesis method consists of three stages. At the first stage, 1M solution (1:1 ratio of ethanol and water) of appropriate quantities of Cu, Zn and Al nitrate precursors was made considering the respective metal oxides weight percent (45/45/10) for synthesis of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. This solution was heated over a hotplate under continuous stirring up to 70–80°C. A 1M aqueous solution of sodium carbonate was also made at first stage. At the next stage, 1M aqueous solution of sodium carbonate was added dropwise to 1M solution of nitrate precursors under continuous stirring until pH=7–9 at 70–80°C. Then, the obtained slurry was kept in the same state for 2h in order to aging process. At the third stage post treatment process was carried out in four steps. Firstly, the slurry was filtered and washed three times with deionized water to remove residual Na+ ions. After that the filtered slurry was dried at 110°C under air flow for 12h. At the next step nanocatalyst powder was calcined at 350°C for 4h. Finally, nanocatalyst powder shaping was performed by the help of Plexiglas reticulated plate, in order to have small cylindrical particles of catalyst for use in steam reforming of methanol reaction. As mentioned earlier, the height and diameter of the prepared small cylindrical particles of catalyst were 3.5 and 1mm, respectively. For synthesis of plasma treated nanocatalyst, dried powder should be exposed under glow discharge of non-thermal plasma before calcination process. Plasma treatment for catalyst powder was done three times for 15min at 1000V in order to get uniform treated nanocatalyst. The nanocatalyst that has been synthesized by coprecipitation method and plasma treated sample of this nanocatalyst were represented as CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) respectively."
4,Nanocatalysts characterization techniques,"2.3 Nanocatalysts characterization techniques X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as well as information about crystallite structure of the synthesized nanocatalysts were obtained by D-5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer. Cu Kα radiation source (λ=0.154056nm) coupled to an X-ray tube that operated at 30kV and 40mA were employed by diffractometer in order to scanning the samples in the range of 2θ=20–90°. Comparison of obtained XRD diffraction patterns with standard diffraction peaks of compounds in Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) confirmed the existence of crystallite phase of various compounds and metal oxides in the catalysts. Surficial morphology and particle size distribution of the nanocatalysts were investigated by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) technique that was implemented on a HITACHI S-4160 analyzer. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis determined surficial dispersion and elemental properties of prepared nanocatalysts. This analysis was performed by VEGA II, TESCAN, EDX analyzer. Specific surface area of fabricated nanocatalysts was measured with N2 gas adsorption technique on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer. The SSA (specific surface area) calculations were done with the help of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis through Unicam 4000 FTIR spectrometer specified the surficial functional groups of the nanocatalysts in the wavenumber range of 400–4000cm−1 by using KBr plate."
5,Experimental setup for catalytic performance test,"2.4 Experimental setup for catalytic performance test Fig. 4 depicts experimental setup for assessment catalytic performance of the synthesized nanocatalysts in SRM (steam reforming of methanol) reaction. The main chemical reactions, were done in catalytic fixed bed of U-shape Pyrex reactor (5mm i.d.) which was placed in the programmable furnace in order to supply all reaction temperatures between 180 and 300°C. 400mg of cylindrical shape catalysts were loaded in the reactor for each batch. H2/Ar 15% (volume percent) gas stream reduced the catalysts before beginning the SRM reaction. The volumetric flow rate of this stream was 100cm3/min and reduction process was done for 3h at 300°C. Liquid methanol and deionized water with the ratio of (1:4) were mixed in the first Pyrex saturator in order to prepare the feed of methanol steam reforming reaction. A stream of Argon carrier gas was arrived into the first saturator which was located in a water ice bath at 0°C, and transported vapour of methanol and water into the second saturator which was empty in order to homogeneity of the feed stream. In the next stage, the gaseous outlet stream from second saturator was entered to the SRM reaction reactor. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 10,000cm3/gcat h. So, the volumetric flow rate of the Argon carrier gas was set on 66.7cm3/min by a mass flow controller (MFC) in the line of Argon stream. In order to obtain the accurate composition of the second saturator outlet gaseous stream which was arrived to the catalytic bed reactor as feed, we have injected this outlet stream to gas chromatography (GC) apparatus with determined time step along activity measurement test. The results of feed composition analysis test, demonstrated that the molar ratio of H2O/CH3OH was approximately fixed and equal with 1.5. After the reaction, the value of unreacted methanol and amount of generated hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases in the reactor outlet gas were analyzed with the help of gas chromatograph apparatus (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran). Regarding to the type of feed and produced gases through the SRM reaction, PLOT-U column (Agilent) was applied in gas chromatography apparatus in order to sequester various gases from each other. GC device employed thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) in order to detect different gases. Hydrogen gas was detected by TCD. FID detector coupled to a methanizer reactor detected methanol, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases even with very low concentration. Carbon balance was calculated for the majority of the experiments with considering the reactants and products of SRM reaction and it was found that the value of carbon balance was approximately equal 98% or even more. Conversion of methanol and selectivity of different products were calculated by the following relations: (4) X CH 3 OH % = F CH 3 OH in - F CH 3 OH out F CH 3 OH in × 100 (5) S H 2 % = F H 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (6) S CO % = F CO out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (7) S CO 2 % = F CO 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 where Fi and Si are flow rate and selectivity of component i in the reactor gaseous effluent respectively."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Nanocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Nanocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis The XRD diffraction patterns of synthesized nanocatalysts with different preparation methods at 2θ=20–90° are depicted in Fig. 5 . The XRD patterns of plasma treated samples are also shown in this figure. The strong diffraction peaks at 2θ=35.5, 35.6, 38.8, 38.9, 48.8, 61.6, 68.2° are assigned to monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS 01-080-1268). The significant diffraction peaks at 2θ=31.7, 34.4, 36.2, 47.5, 56.5, 62.8, 67.9, 69° are assigned to hexagonal phase of ZnO (JCPDS 01-076-0704). There are no strong diffraction peaks for Al2O3 in XRD patterns and this can be due to low loading, high dispersion or amorphous phase of Al2O3 as a result of moderate calcination conditions. Also, detectable diffraction peaks for ZnAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 spinels are not seen in XRD patterns, since these compounds are formed in calcination temperatures above 500°C. As seen in the patterns, CuO diffraction peak at 2θ=35.6° and ZnO diffraction peak at 2θ=36.2° both have overlap. The significant diffraction peak at 2θ=38.8° is related to CuO (111) crystallite facet. According to mechanism of methanol steam reforming reaction, Cu (111) is the most active copper crystallite facet to adsorb methanol and many other intermediates [58]. In addition to Cu (111) facet, ZnO crystallite plates also have considerable role in steam reforming of methanol reaction. In this regard, ZnO (002) and (100) crystallite plates can adsorb methanol, water, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide species [11]. Therefore, better dispersion of copper and zinc oxide crystallite plates can lead to very good effects on the performance of the catalysts in SRM reaction. The comparative study of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) XRD patterns signifies that, the diffraction peaks of different crystallite phases in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) are more intense than the same diffraction peaks in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) sample. Also, this comparison signifies that the diffraction peaks of different crystallite phases in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) sample are broader than the same diffraction peaks in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) catalyst. These observation indicates that crystallinity and crystallite size of various metal oxides are strongly increased by use of hydrothermal synthesis method and also, these properties are greatly decreased by use of coprecipitation synthesis method. Increase in crystallinity and crystallite size, leads to low dispersion of different metal oxides crystallites, particularly CuO (111) crystallite plate. The comparison of XRD diffraction patterns of plasma treated and non-treated samples which have been synthesized with the same preparation method, demonstrates that non-thermal plasma treatment, causes to decrease in peaks intensity at all different 2θ and also leads to broader peaks. As a consequence, the crystallinity and crystallite size of various metal oxides are decreased by use of non-thermal plasma treatment. Table 1 shows crystallographic properties of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts synthesized via plasma-enhanced hydrothermal and coprecipitation methods. Crystallite size of CuO and ZnO crystallite facets has been calculated by the Scherrer equation. Above explanations about crystallinity and crystallite size of various metal oxides facets are confirmed by reported crystallographic properties in Table 1. As seen in this Table, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample has the minimum relative crystallinity and crystallite size of CuO (111) and ZnO (101) crystallite facets. Decrease in crystallinity and crystallite size, leads to high dispersion of different metal oxides crystallite plates in the catalysts. High dispersion of copper oxide crystallite facets particularly CuO (111) which is converted to Cu (111) crystallite facet after reduction process [59], and also high dispersion of zinc oxide crystallite plates leads to very good effects on the performance of the catalysts in methanol steam reforming reaction, and the low dispersion of these crystallite facets leads to adverse effects on the performance of the catalysts in SRM reaction. Therefore, regarding to above explanations, weaker performance of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) sample is anticipated in SRM reaction. Also, better performance of plasma treated samples in comparison with non-treated catalysts which have been synthesized by the same preparation method in higher conversion of methanol and better selectivity toward desirable products in SRM reaction, is predictable. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis Fig. 6 depicts FESEM images of synthesized catalysts with different preparation methods as well as non-thermal plasma treated samples. Surficial morphology and approximate assessment of particle size distribution of the samples are revealed by this analysis. More uniform distribution of particles, more narrow size distribution, smaller particles size and lower agglomeration of particles are some of the surficial morphology features of the appropriate catalysts for use in SRM reaction. More achievement of reactants to metal active phases as a result of better surficial morphology can modify SRM reaction in the way of higher conversion of methanol and better selectivity toward desirable products. FESEM images prove that the size of all particles in synthesized catalysts, plasma treated and non-treated samples is in nanometric scale. It is obvious from images that there are several agglomerated particles in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) sample. The comparative study of the morphology of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) samples indicates that synthesized nanocatalyst by coprecipitation method has more uniform distribution of particles and well order flower like plate structure. The comparison of the surficial features and morphology of the plasma treated and non-treated nanocatalysts demonstrates that due to strong structure of the sample that has been synthesized by hydrothermal preparation method, plasma treatment cannot wildly affect the surficial features of this sample. But, drastic effects of non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment on the morphology of the nanocatalysts can be observed by the comparison of surficial properties of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) samples. As seen in the images, there are no large flower like plates and agglomeration of particles in the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) nanocatalyst and the sample which has been synthesized by coprecipitation method and also treated by non-thermal glow discharge plasma, has the most uniform distribution of isomorph particles, smallest particles size and the best surficial morphology among other catalysts. Regarding to above descriptions, forasmuch as surficial morphology has significant role in SRM reaction, better performance of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) is expected in methanol steam reforming reaction in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) sample. Also, due to better surficial morphology of the plasma treated nanocatalysts, superior performance in SRM reaction in the way of higher conversion of methanol and better selectivity toward desirable products is anticipated for the samples that have been treated by non-thermal glow discharge plasma technology. Thus, regarding to above explanations, forasmuch as CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst has the best surficial morphology features among other samples such as the most uniform distribution of particles, the most narrow size distribution, smallest particles size and the lowest agglomeration of particles, the best performance of this sample in comparison with other catalysts is predictable, in SRM reaction. Surface particles size histogram of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst is illustrated in Fig. 7 . ImageJ software by applying FESEM image determines statistical distribution, maximum, minimum and average particles size of this sample. As seen in the Fig. 7, 5.9, 49.8 and 16.9nm are minimum, maximum and average particles size of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst, respectively. 3.1.3 EDX analysis Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra and dot-mapping micrographs of synthesized nanocatalysts by hydrothermal and coprecipitation methods are displayed in Fig. 8 . This figure also displays EDX analysis of non-thermal glow discharge plasma treated samples. Surficial chemical analysis as well as surficial elemental weight percentages of fabricated nanocatalysts, are obtained by the use of EDX analysis. As mentioned according to the results of XRD analysis, although aluminium has been used for preparation nanocatalysts but, the strong diffraction peaks for alumina are not seen in XRD patterns of different samples. In these cases, EDX spectra and dot-mapping analysis confirms the existence of all compounds and elements on the surface of various nanocatalysts. EDX dot-mapping micrographs prove that there are no sintering and agglomeration of particles on the surface of catalysts and also exhibit uniform dispersion of elements on the surface of each nanocatalyst. Furthermore, the comparison of elemental weight percentages of primary solution with the surficial elemental weight percentages of each nanocatalyst is shown in Fig. 9 . The comparison of EDX spectra and dot-mapping micrographs of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) samples, as well as the comparison of primary solution and surficial elemental weight percentages of these two samples, demonstrates that the nanocatalyst that has been synthesized by coprecipitation method has more uniform dispersion of elements and also less difference between primary solution and surficial elemental weight percentages. On the other hand, the comparative study of plasma treated and non-treated samples which have been synthesized by the same preparation method, demonstrates that plasma treated samples have more uniform dispersion of elements and less difference between primary solution and surficial elemental weight percentages. According to the observations from EDX analysis, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample has the most uniform dispersion of elements and minimum differences between primary solution and surficial elemental weight percentages. Thus, regarding to above explanations better performance of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) sample and also better performance of plasma treated samples in comparison with non-treated nanocatalysts is anticipated in SRM reaction. Finally, the best performance of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample among other nanocatalysts, in higher conversion of methanol and better selectivity toward desirable products, is predictable. 3.1.4 BET analysis Adsorption of reactants on metal active phases, plays substantial role in every chemical reactions on heterogeneous catalysts. Higher specific surface area, leads to existence of more metal active phases for adsorption of reactants as a beginning of all heterogeneous catalytic reaction. After adsorption of reactants and dissociation of their chemical bonds, new chemical bonds are created in order to generate various intermediates and finally the products of chemical reaction. Table 1 illustrates the measured specific surface areas of the nanocatalysts which are synthesized by different preparation methods, as well as the specific surface areas of the plasma treated samples. Calculations are performed with N2 gas adsorption technique and by the help of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. As seen in the table, the calculated specific surface areas of the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H), CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (HP), CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) samples are 19, 25, 46 and 61m2/g respectively. It is obvious that the sample which is synthesized by coprecipitation method has higher specific surface area in comparison with the sample which is prepared by hydrothermal method. Also, it is evident that plasma treatment leads to very good effects on specific surface area of the nanocatalysts and in this way, plasma treated samples have higher specific surface area in comparison with non-treated samples which have been synthesized by the same preparation method. More uniform distribution of particles, more narrow particles size distribution, smaller particles size and less agglomeration of particles lead to better surficial morphology and consequently, higher specific surface area of the nanocatalysts. Therefore, according to FESEM analysis higher specific surface area is expected for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H), and also higher specific surface area is anticipated for plasma treated samples in comparison with non-treated catalysts due to better surficial morphology of plasma treated samples. Regarding to above descriptions, results of BET analysis have appropriate consistency with the findings from FESEM micrographs. Thus, with regarding to the very important role of higher specific surface area in order to provide more metal active phases in the catalysts, better performance of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) in comparison with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) sample and also better performance of plasma treated samples in comparison with non-treated nanocatalysts which have been synthesized by the same preparation method is predictable in steam reforming of methanol reaction. Furthermore, the highest specific surface area of the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) can lead to the best performance of this sample in SRM reaction, in comparison with the other nanocatalysts. 3.1.5 FTIR analysis Fig. 10 demonstrates Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrums of fabricated nanocatalysts by various synthesis methods. FTIR spectra of non-thermal glow discharge plasma treated samples are also depicted in this figure. The spectrums are investigated in wide wave number range from 400 to 4000cm−1 in order to obtain accurate assessment of surficial functional groups. It is obvious from figure that glow discharge plasma treated and non-treated samples which are prepared by the same synthesis method, almost have similar absorption peaks. This can be interpreted by the existence of same surficial functional groups on the surface of plasma treated and non-treated synthesized nanocatalysts. The stretching frequencies in the range of 400–900cm−1 can be related to metal oxides bonds [60–62]. For instance, the absorption bands at 460 and 495cm−1 can be associated to zinc and copper oxide stretching vibration respectively [63]. The absorption peak at around 550cm−1 wave number is recognized to be the characteristic of Al2O3 and also, AlO bonds on the catalysts exhibit a band near 700cm−1 wave number [11,64]. The vibration frequencies at 1430, 1590, 1660 and 3450cm−1 can be attributed to the hydroxide groups [64,65]. The absorption band at 1660cm−1 wave number can be assigned to interlayer water molecules which may be remained in the catalysts from different steps of synthesis procedure [66]. On the other hand, the vibration bands around 1430, 1590 and 3450cm−1 indicate physically adsorbed water in the nanocatalysts after calcination process."
8,Non-thermal plasma treatment mechanism,"3.2 Non-thermal plasma treatment mechanism Generally, there are two main groups of plasmas: High temperature or fusion plasmas and Low temperature or gas discharge plasmas. All constituents of high temperature plasmas such as electrons, ions and neutral species are in a thermal equilibrium state. On the other hand, low temperature plasmas are categorized into thermal plasmas (TPs) and non-thermal plasmas (NTPs). TPs are usually called quasi-equilibrium plasmas due to their local thermal equilibrium (LTE) state. But, NTPs are generally called nonequilibrium plasmas or cold plasmas. The main discrepancy of TPs and NTPs is related to the difference between bulk gas and electrons temperature in these two types of low temperature plasmas. In this regard, there is no tangible difference between bulk gas and electrons temperature in TPs. But, in NTPs electrons temperature can reach to 104-105 K, that this temperature is remarkably higher than the temperature of bulk gas which is equal or near room temperature. The considerable characteristic properties of NTPs such as thermodynamic nonequilibrium nature, low gas temperature and high selectivity lead to use of this technology in a wide range of applications. Surficial treatment and modification of various materials such as heterogeneous catalysts is one the most important applications of NTPs. The glow discharge is the best-known type of non-thermal plasma and has been widely used in plasma chemistry [53,67,68]. In this study, we use non-thermal glow discharge plasma in order to surficial treatment of the prepared nanocatalysts before using them in steam reforming of methanol reaction. As mentioned earlier, non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment in this study is performed through experimental setup which schematic flow chart of this setup is delineated in Fig. 3. After loading some dried powder of catalyst on the Quartz plate and locating it into the Pyrex plasma chamber tube in vicinity of anode electrode, high purity Argon gas is injected into the tube with constant rate of 20cm3/min. Afterwards, the plasma chamber is evacuated by turbo-molecular vacuum pump until a pressure around 1Torr and then, by applying a high voltage of 1000V between cathode and anode electrodes by the help of a high voltage DC generator, favorable non-thermal glow discharge plasma is generated in the plasma chamber. In this state, positive column zone is formed in plasma chamber near the anode electrode in which the electrical field, current density and electrons and ions density are remained constant [69]. These particular characteristic features of positive column zone can be a reason for locating Quartz plate in this region in order to surficial treatment of nanocatalyst powder. With applying high voltage between two electrodes, electrons flow from cathode to anode under the influence of exerted electrical field. When particles of the nanocatalyst which have been loaded on the Quartz plate, are located in glow discharge plasma zone, each nanocatalyst particle can perform as electron sink and subsequently can capture thousands of electrons. As a result of trapping electrons in nanocatalyst particles, density of electrons in glow discharge plasma reduces considerably. The trapped electrons in nanocatalyst particles can form a plasma sheath around the particles. Because of strong repulsive forces between flowing electrons in glow discharge plasma and plasma sheath, strong forces are exerted on the plasma sheath and subsequently nanocatalyst particles. In addition to these outer repulsive forces, there are interior repulsive forces between trapped electrons in the structure of nanocatalyst particles. Thus, under the influences of these outer and interior repulsive forces, the bonds of precursors or clusters can be elongated or distorted and this can lead to remarkable decrease of sintering and agglomeration of particles on the surface of treated nanocatalysts [70,71]. Therefore, crystallographic features, surficial particles size distribution, surficial elemental dispersion and finally specific surface area of the nanocatalysts can be affected and improved by applying non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment."
9,Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming,"3.3 Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming 3.3.1 Methanol conversion Performance and activity evaluation of various prepared nanocatalysts for conversion of methanol in SRM reaction was performed with the help of designed experimental setup. Fig. 11 illustrates the amounts of methanol conversion for different fabricated nanocatalysts in the reaction temperature range between 180 and 300°C. It is evident that conversion of methanol for the sample that has been synthesized by coprecipitation method is significantly higher than the methanol conversion of the nanocatalyst that has been synthesized by hydrothermal method at all different temperatures. The comparison of the performance of plasma treated and non-treated samples which have been synthesized by the same preparation method, indicates that plasma-treated nanocatalysts have higher methanol conversion in SRM reaction at all various temperatures. These observations can be interpreted by the properties such as higher dispersion of different metal oxides crystallites, more uniform distribution of particles, more narrow particles size distribution, smaller particles size, lower agglomeration of particles, more uniform dispersion of elements and finally higher specific surface area of the nanocatalyst that has been synthesized by coprecipitation method and also of the samples which have been treated by non-thermal plasma technology in comparison with non-treated nanocatalysts. Mentioned physicochemical and surficial properties of different samples are confirmed through XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX and BET characterization analysis results. So, better physicochemical characterization and surficial morphological properties of fabricated sample by coprecipitation method and also better physicochemical characterization and morphological features of plasma treated nanocatalysts in comparison with non-treated samples which have been synthesized by the same preparation method, lead to superior achievement of reactants to metal active phases and consequently, higher conversion of methanol in SRM reaction. As previously mentioned according to XRD, FESEM, EDX and BET characterization analysis results, dispersion of various metal oxides crystallites, surficial morphological features and surficial elemental dispersion of the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample are the best in comparison with other nanocatalysts. Also, this nanocatalyst has the highest specific surface area among other samples. Thus, the highest conversion of methanol of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst among other samples can be interpreted by the results of various characterization analyses. Therefore, regarding to above explanations, findings from various characterizations analysis results have appropriate consistency with the amounts of methanol conversion for different samples in SRM reaction. 3.3.2 Products selectivity Products selectivity of each prepared nanocatalyst by hydrothermal and coprecipitation synthesis methods are demonstrated in Fig. 12 . This figure also represents the products selectivity of plasma treated samples which have been synthesized by mentioned preparation methods. It is obvious that hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases are the main products of methanol steam reforming reaction. Comparison the amounts of generated gases for all samples at every temperature indicates that the highest value of products is ascribed to hydrogen. After hydrogen, the value of carbon dioxide is more than carbon monoxide. As mentioned earlier, in order to applying produced hydrogen gas through SRM reaction, as a fuel for PEMFCs, its carbon monoxide content must be very minimal in the order of a few ppms. Reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) and direct decomposition of methanol are two basic reactions which lead to carbon monoxide production in SRM reaction. RWGS is endothermic reaction and thus, significantly progresses toward CO generation at high temperatures. Therefore, suitable nanocatalyst for use in SRM reaction in order to produce hydrogen gas with minimum CO content, at least must represent one of the following properties: high methanol conversion especially at low temperatures or slight selectivity toward carbon monoxide generation particularly at high temperatures. According to the information which has been mentioned in literatures, there are different suitable active copper sites for production carbon monoxide through RWGS and direct decomposition of methanol reactions in the catalysts. Smaller copper sites lead to CO formation through RWGS reaction and larger copper sites lead to carbon monoxide production through direct decomposition of methanol reaction [72]. As seen in the figure, according to FESEM analysis the existence of agglomerated particles in the sample which has been synthesized by hydrothermal method leads to significant CO formation through both RWGS and direct decomposition of methanol reactions and in this way the CO content for this sample is very high even at low temperatures. It is obvious from Fig. 12 that CO generation for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) is very low even at high temperatures and for instance, carbon monoxide production value for this sample is about 400ppm at 200°C. This can be interpreted by limited carbon monoxide production through both RWGS and direct decomposition of methanol reactions due to especial flower like plate structure of this sample. The comparison of CO content of plasma treated and non-treated samples which have been synthesized by the same preparation method, demonstrates that the amount of generated carbon monoxide by plasma treated nanocatalysts is lower than its value for non-treated samples. According to the FESEM analysis results, the size of particles in CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (HP) and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) samples becomes smaller as a consequence of non-thermal plasma treatment. Therefore, as mentioned above, smaller copper particles lead to formation of carbon monoxide only by RWGS reaction and thus, the use of plasma treated nanocatalysts leads to lower CO generation. For example, the amount of carbon monoxide generation for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) sample is about 200ppm at 200°C and this confirms the above explanations about the effects of non-thermal plasma treatment on the value of CO production by the nanocatalysts. Therefore, regarding to above explanations, findings from different analysis have good agreement with the results of products selectivity for each sample. Table 2 represents comparative data of methanol conversion, carbon monoxide selectivity and temperature for some other catalysts available in literature. 3.3.3 Time on stream performance As previously mentioned, best physicochemical properties of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst which were confirmed by various characterization analysis, led to best performance of this sample in SRM reaction in the way of the highest methanol conversion and the best selectivity toward preferable products, among other samples. Hence, this nanocatalyst is selected in order to evaluation of its performance for long term use in steam reforming of methanol reaction. Fig. 13 shows the results of time on stream performance experiment which has been carried out at 240°C for 900min. As seen in the figure, the amount of methanol conversion, and also selectivity of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases are approximately constant pending the stability assessment examination. Thus, regarding to the results of time on stream performance test, the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) nanocatalyst is almost stable for long term usage in SRM reaction."
10,Conclusions,"According to XRD patterns, applying coprecipitation synthesis method in comparison with hydrothermal method and also non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment, led to better dispersion of CuO (111) and another crystallite facets. FESEM micrographs proved that, use of coprecipitation method in comparison with hydrothermal method and also non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment caused to more uniform distribution of isomorph particles, smaller particles size and better surficial morphology. Better surficial elemental dispersion and the absence of agglomerated particles as a result of applying coprecipitation method in comparison with hydrothermal method and also non-thermal plasma treatment were confirmed by the results of EDX analysis. Finally, BET analysis demonstrated higher specific surface area for the sample which was synthesized by coprecipitation method in comparison with the sample which was prepared by hydrothermal method and also this analysis demonstrated higher specific surface area for the nanocatalysts which were treated by non-thermal glow discharge plasma in comparison with non-treated samples which were synthesized by the same preparation method. Thus, with regarding to the results of catalytic performance in SRM reaction and also the results of various characterization analysis, it was indicated that better dispersion of different crystallite facets particularly CuO (111), more uniform distribution of isomorph particles and smaller particles size, better surficial elemental dispersion and the absence of agglomerated particles, and finally higher specific surface area led to higher conversion of methanol and better selectivity toward desirable products. For instance, methanol conversion and CO selectivity at 240°C for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (H) sample were 9% and 6% respectively, while the values of these two parameters for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CP) sample at the same temperature were 93% and 0.28% respectively. On the other hand, the effects of non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment on the performance of samples in SRM reaction were demonstrated by the comparison of the amounts of methanol conversion and carbon monoxide selectivity of the plasma treated and non-treated samples. For example, the amounts of methanol conversion and CO selectivity for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (HP) nanocatalyst at 240°C were 34% and 3% respectively, and the values of these two parameters for CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CPP) at the same temperature were 95% and 0.24% respectively."
