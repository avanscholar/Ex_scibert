0,Introduction,"Many energy sources are still produced from nonrenewable sources in mostly non environmentally-friendly oil refineries. There is a need to look for more sustainable production processes based on a circular economy concept, reducing pollution and considering the advantages of reusing contaminants in a cost-effective way (Andersen, 2007). Biomass and other similar feedstocks as well as pollutants are good candidates to produce biofuels at industrial scale (Martínez et al., 2017). Bioethanol is one of those biofuels suitable to replace transportation fuels such as gasoline (Kennes and Veiga, 2013). Bioethanol production based on the fermentation of carbohydrates obtained from lignocellulosic materials has been quite extensively reported (Kennes et al., 2016). Another, more recent and innovative alternative, consists in gasifying those feedstocks in order to obtain syngas that can also be converted into ethanol, with pure anaerobic bacteria (Mohammadi et al., 2012; Abubackar et al., 2015) or with mixed cultures (Chakraborty et al., 2019). That process can also use some waste gases, e.g. from steel industries, as they have similar gas compositions, and all contain mainly CO, CO2 and H2. Some recent cost analyses have proven that such technology is cost-effective, industrially feasible and competitive compared to carbohydrate fermentation (Roy et al., 2015; He and Zhang, 2011). Gas fermentation to ethanol has now reached precommercial scale (Phillips et al., 2017). Besides, the technology allows to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, while yielding a biofuel, which is a significant aspect as the sustainability of a biofuel production process includes energy and greenhouse gas saving, and a low environmental impact (Rathore et al., 2016). C1-gas fermentation for the accumulation of higher alcohols, besides ethanol, which is the focus of this paper, is a recent process with only a limited number of reports on its optimization (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). Higher alcohols such as butanol and hexanol are interesting as novel energy sources. Butanol has several advantages compared to ethanol and is more similar to gasoline (Ramey et al., 2007). Besides. hexanol is a suitable substitute of refinery diesel, and it can also can be blended with fossil fuels and other alcohols (Atmanli, 2016; Yilmaz and Atmanli, 2017). Ethanol and higher alcohols are thus interesting biofuels, but some research gaps related to the optimization of their production still need to be further addressed, among others for the novel HBE (hexanol-butanol-ethanol) gas fermentation process. Clostridium carboxidivorans is able to metabolize syngas for the production of ethanol and higher alcohols, via the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway (Müller, 2003; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b). Generally, solvent producing clostridia, using that pathway for C1-gas fermentation, will first generate fatty acids, which can later be converted to solvents further down in the WL pathway. If the desired end products are ethanol and higher fuel-alcohols, optimizing conditions that allow to minimize the accumulation of acids while maximizing the production of alcohols, as addressed in this paper, will provide a new body of knowledge that will improve the efficiency of the process and its industrial application. In that sense, some trace metals are used as cofactors by metalloenzymes of the WL pathway. Bioreactor studies on their involvement in HBE fermentation have not yet been reported. In the WL pathway, acetogenic bacteria convert gas-substrates into the common intermediate acetyl-CoA, for their growth and the production of organic acids and alcohols. From basic biochemical studies, it appears that tungsten (W) and selenium (Se) can be considered as two key trace metals involved either in the assimilation of C1 gases or in the conversion of acids, produced from such gases, into alcohols. Se plays a role in formate dehydrogenase (FDH), an enzyme, catalyzing the reduction of C1 gases, mainly CO2, into acetate in some bacteria such as C. thermoaceticum (Andreesen and Ljungdahl, 1973), C. ljungdahlii (Çakar et al., 2018) and C. carboxidivorans (Alissandratos et al., 2013). Besides, some authors have also reported the involvement of W, and sometimes molybdate (Mo), in the activity of formate dehydrogenases (e.g., in C. thermoaceticum) (Andreesen and Ljungdahl, 1973; Saxena and Tanner, 2011). Originally, it was considered that Mo could be replaced by W in some enzymes, while it was later confirmed that some enzymes are only activated in the presence of W but not Mo (L'vov et al., 2002). Depending on the strain, either tungsten or molybdate would thus be involved in the activity of FDH. In the 1970’s, the preference of W, instead of Mo, for the activation of FDH in Clostridium thermoaceticum was confirmed (Ljungdahl, 1976). On the other side, W is considered to be a key trace metal for the activity of aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AFOR), an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of acids into an aldehyde. Later on, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) will catalyze the conversion of the aldehyde into alcohols in several clostridia metabolizing CO, CO2 or syngas (Abubackar et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). That way, the lack of W could presumably affect the conversion of aldehydes into alcohols, by reducing the activity of the enzyme which converts the acids into aldehydes. The combined effect of W and Se is therefore expected to affect the assimilation of C1 gases and their overall conversion into acids and later alcohols in HBE fermentation, while omitting W only would mostly affect the last step of the pathway in which acids are converted into alcohols. The selection of optimized bioreactor operating conditions and the presence of specific trace metals would presumably allow to maximize the production of fuel-alcohols. In this study, four experiments were carried out with C. carboxidivorans and syngas, using different trace element compositions, i.e. absence or presence of tungsten or selenium, in order to study how it affects the bioconversion profile in the HBE fermentation, i.e. the conversion of C1 gases to acids and, later, ethanol and higher alcohols (butanol, hexanol). Objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of the bioreactoŕs operating conditions, and the combined effect of tungsten and selenium as well as the individual effect of those trace metals on bacterial growth and on the production of acids and alcohols, and that way maximize the production of either novel biofuels, e.g., higher alcohols, or otherwise organic acids, that can be used as such or can be precursors of other compounds such as biopolymers (Lagoa-Costa et al., 2017). Four bioreactors were operated under different conditions. First, a reactor was set-up using the complete medium composition (i.e., presence of all trace metals) and allowing natural acidification (no pH control) as a result of the initial accumulation of acids. Then, two additional bioreactors were used with a medium in which tungsten and selenium were omitted and applying different operating conditions in each system, i.e. in one reactor the pH was maintained constant throughout the experiment and in the other one there was no pH control (i.e., with acidification). Finally, a bioreactor without tungsten, at constant pH, was operated in order to check the effect of that specific trace metal."
1,Material and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture media,"2.1 Microorganism and culture media C. carboxidivorans P7 DSM 15243 was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) and was maintained under anaerobic conditions on modified basal medium at pH 6.2 and with a mixture of the following gases as substrate: CO:CO2:H2:N2 (30:10:20:40) (Liou et al., 2005; Tanner, 2007). The medium used in the experiments had the following composition (per liter distilled water): 1 g yeast extract; 25 mL mineral solution; 10 mL trace metal solution; 10 mL vitamins stock solution; 1 mL resazurin; 0.60 g cysteine-HCl. The mineral stock solution was prepared with the following composition (per liter distilled water): 80 g sodium chloride, 100 g ammonium chloride, 10 g potassium chloride, 10 g potassium monophosphate, 20 g magnesium sulfate, and 4 g calcium chloride. Three trace metal solutions were prepared in order to carry out the different experiments. The composition of the complete trace metal solution was (per liter distilled water): 2 g nitrilotriacetic acid, 1 g manganese sulfate, 0.80 g ferrous ammonium sulfate, 0.20 g cobalt chloride, 0.20 g zinc sulfate, and 20 mg each of cupric chloride, nickel chloride, sodium molybdate, sodium selenate, and sodium tungstate. The second solution had the same trace metals composition but omitting sodium tungstate, and in the third stock solution the addition of sodium selenate and sodium tungstate was omitted. The vitamin stock solution had the following composition (per liter distilled water): 10 mg pyridoxine, 5 mg each of thiamine, riboflavin, calcium pantothenate, thioctic acid, para-amino benzoic acid, nicotinic acid, and vitamin B12, and 2 mg each of D-biotin, folic acid, and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid."
3,Continuous gas-fed bioreactor experiments,"2.2 Continuous gas-fed bioreactor experiments Four experiments were carried out in 2L BIOFLO 110 bioreactors (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) with a working volume of 1.2 L. In one of them the complete basal medium described above was used. In other two, tungsten and selenium were omitted in the trace elements solution. In the fourth one only tungsten was omitted. The four bioreactors were all fed the same syngas mixture, which was continuously supplied at a flow rate of 10 mL/min using a mass flow controller (Aalborg GFC 17, Müllheim, Germany). A microsparger was used for optimal diffusion of the gas. Each bioreactor was filled with 1.2 L of the desired medium and was autoclaved for 20 min at 121 °C. After autoclaving, N2 was flushed through the medium in order to remove oxygen and, at the same time, the medium was cooled down using a water jacket. When the temperature reached 40 °C, cysteine-HCl and vitamins were added from a stock solution. When the medium reached anaerobic conditions, N2 flushing was replaced by syngas feeding (CO:CO2:H2:N2 (30:10:20:40)). The operating conditions of the bioreactors were, in all cases, a constant temperature of 33 °C and a constant agitation speed of 250 rpm during all the experiment. Besides, four baffles were placed inside those bioreactors in order to improve medium mixing and to avoid vortex formation. A 10% seed culture, in early exponential growth phase, was used to inoculate the bioreactors. It was grown for 72 h with CO as a carbon source and with the same medium composition as for each bioreactor, meaning that the inoculum for the first bioreactor (with the two trace metals) was grown in a complete culture medium while, for the two bioreactors without selenium and tungsten the inocula were grown without these two trace metals to avoid their presence in the bioreactor and finally for the bioreactor without tungsten the inoculum was grown without W. Regarding the pH, the latter was maintained at a given value, whenever required, using peristaltic pumps for the addition of either 2 M NaOH or 2 M HCl solutions. In the case of the control bioreactor with both W and Se and one of the two reactors without tungsten and selenium, the pH was regulated and maintained constant at 6.2 during the first hours of the experiment until reaching an acetic acid concentration of about 2.0 g/L. When such concentration was reached, automatic pH regulation was switched on, and the pH could drop down naturally, as a result of the production of acids, to a value of 5.2. In the other bioreactor without selenium and tungsten and in the bioreactor without tungsten, the pH was maintained at a constant value of 6.2 during all the experiment. Tungsten and Selenium concentrations of samples taken from the bioreactors were determined and confirmed using an HR-ICP-MS (Element Thermo Finnigan). This method did also allow to confirm that no detectable amounts of those trace metals were found when adding yeast extract to the medium."
4,Growth measurement,"2.3 Growth measurement 1 mL of liquid sample was daily removed from the bioreactors for measurement of the biomass concentration. The concentration was measured on a UV–Visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength (λ) of 600 nm (Hitachi, Model U-200, Pacis & Giralt, Madrid, Spain). A biomass calibration was done previously to be able to estimate the biomass concentration (g/L) from the optical density reading (OD λ = 600 nm) obtained with the spectrophotometer."
5,Gas-phase CO and CO2 concentrations,"2.4 Gas-phase CO and CO2 concentrations In order to quantify the concentrations of CO and CO2, 1 mL of gaseous sample was daily removed from the outlet port of the bioreactor. An HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Technologies, Madrid, Spain) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to measure the gas-phase CO concentrations. The GC was fitted with a 15-m HP-PLOT Molecular Sieve 5A column (ID, 0.53 mm; film thickness, 50 μm), the oven temperature was maintained constant at 50 °C and in the injection port and in the detector the temperature was maintained constant at 150 °C (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016). Helium was used as the carrier gas. Similarly, an HP 5890 gas chromatograph, equipped with a TCD was used for the CO2 analyses. The injection, oven, and detection temperatures were kept constant at 90, 25, and 100 °C, respectively."
6,Fermentation products,"2.5 Fermentation products 1 mL liquid samples were taken from the reactor at least every 24 h. The concentrations of acids, ethanol and higher alcohols were measured using an HPLC (HP1100, Agilent Co., USA) equipped with a supelcogel C-610 column and a UV detector at a wavelength of 210 nm. A 0.1% ortho-phosphoric acid solution fed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was used as mobile phase. The column temperature was set at 30 °C. The samples were centrifuged (7000g, 3 min) using a benchtop centrifuge (ELMI Skyline ltd CM 70M07) before analyzing the concentration of water-soluble products by HPLC."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Continuous gas-fed bioreactor with W and Se and natural acidification from pH 6.2 to 5.0,"3.1 Continuous gas-fed bioreactor with W and Se and natural acidification from pH 6.2 to 5.0 3.1.1 Biomass and solvent production The experiment was carried out with the culture medium containing both W and Se in the trace elements solution and at an initial pH of 6.2. The pH was maintained at such value for 48 h in order to allow acidogenesis to take place, as a higher pH has been proven to stimulate bacterial growth and acids production (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). Once the biomass concentration reached a value of 0.290 g/L and the amount accumulated acetic acid was 1907 mg/L, automatic pH regulation was stopped in order to allow natural acidification until reaching a final pH value of 5.0, expected to stimulate solventogenesis with conversion of the organic acids into alcohols. That pH value was then maintained constant throughout the remaining experimental period. Previous studies have indeed shown that lowering the pH down to values around 5 would generally effectively allow metabolisation of acids in clostridia with simultaneous accumulation of alcohols, which is desirable when fuel-ethanol and other higher alcohols want to be obtained (Abubackar et al., 2015; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). However, lower pH values might become inhibitory, depending on the strain and specific culture conditions. A short lag phase of 19 h was observed after inoculation (Fig. 1 a); then Clostridium carboxidivorans reached its highest biomass concentration of 0.376 g/L within 72 h after seeding the reactor, with a maximum growth rate of 0.074 h−1 calculated in the exponential phase, just before natural acidification started. Fig. 1a shows how biomass growth slowed down simultaneously to the natural acidification process and ultimately leveled off; that way between t = 48 h (when natural acidification was started) and t = 72 h (when the maximum biomass concentration was reached) the amount biomass only increased by 0.094 g/L. This was expected, as it has been reported that a pH decrease would generally inhibit biomass growth and acid production in the HBE (Hexanol-Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation process (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). The same effect of natural acidification on biomass growth was also recently found in another study using the same strain (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). The production of acids was observed as soon as biomass started to increase (Fig. 1b), with acetic acid being the first acid to be detected, around t = 19 h. That acid reached a maximum concentration of 2516 mg/L, 54 h after inoculation. Later on, butyric acid appeared, at t = 48 h, reaching a maximum value of 511 mg/L about 67 h after seeding the reactor (Table 1 ). C2, C4 and then C6 fatty acids would generally appear in that chronological order, with increasing number of carbon atoms. Hexanoic acid would be the last acid to be produced, after acetic and butyric acids; but that acid was not detected in this experiment, which could be attributable to the fast pH decrease in the early stages of the experiment, prematurely finalizing the acidogenic stage. For that same reason, the fast acidification down to pH 5.0 led to lower concentrations of all other acids (acetic acid, butyric acid) as well, due to the negative effect of such low pH conditions on the acidogenic stage. In some other recently published report hexanoic acid was detected 50–60 h after inoculation when maintaining a higher pH (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). Similarly, hexanoic acid was detected when natural acidification was allowed but only down to a less acidic pH of 5.6 (unpublished data) (compared to pH 5.0 in the present study). In both those previous cases hexanoic acid was found in the medium, confirming the negative effect on the accumulation of longer chain fatty acids (C4 and C6, mainly) of early strong acidification or acidification down to low pH values. Provided the final pH is not too low, natural acidification of the medium will have a positive effect on the solventogenic stage, not only in gas fermentation but also in the fermentation of carbohydrates by acetogenic bacteria; and the conversion of acids into alcohols would be stimulated as a result of acidification (Kennes et al., 2016; Millat et al., 2013), while slowing down or ending the production of more acids. This explains the consumption of acids and the conversion of those acids into alcohols when pH 5.0 had been reached. Nevertheless, the production of ethanol started already at a higher pH value, at the same time as acetic acid was detected, which does also largely agree with data reported in other studies with Clostridium carboxidivorans (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016, 2017c). Thereby, alcohols could presumably be produced from the assimilation of acids as well as from the gaseous substrates to some extent. The appearance of ethanol during the acidogenic stage is assumed to be related to the presence of trace metals (W, Se) in the medium, potentially involved in the activity of specific enzymes. Other experiments, shown hereafter, support such hypothesis, as the absence of one or both trace metals in the culture medium largely impedes ethanol production during the acidogenic stage. Besides, acetic acid production stopped at low pH (5.0), while the concentration of ethanol kept increasing after such acidification. In Fig. 1b, it can be observed that the acids were basically completely consumed and reached values near 0 g/L soon after the pH had dropped down to 5.0. The maximum accumulation of alcohols was observed 187 h after inoculation, corresponding to 5912 mg/L for ethanol and 2126 mg/L for butanol. No hexanol was detected throughout the experiment, which would largely be due to the absence of hexanoic acid production, as mentioned above (Fig. 1b). The alcohols production rates, calculated in this experiment are shown in Table 1. The results reached under these experimental conditions are relevant from an industrial viewpoint as they allow to selectively produce ethanol and higher alcohols such as butanol or even hexanol, with only minor amounts of by-products, e.g. fatty acids. Obtaining a fermented medium highly enriched in the desired end products (i.e. alcohols) simplifies downstream processing of any industrial process and reduces the corresponding costs. The presence of various fermentation by-products at non-negligible concentrations would otherwise significantly increase production costs (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012), while their accumulation is largely avoided under the operating conditions evaluated in this study. The production of ethanol as single alcohol and major end product through C1-gas fermentation has been studied in clostridia and has recently been considered for cost-effective precommercial application confirming the industrial relevance of this gas fermentation technology (Daniell et al., 2012). Besides, as reported recently, in biobased industries, it is more economical and environmentally-friendly to produce alcohols from cheap and abundant gases (pollutants) such as CO and CO2, as suggested here, rather than from carbohydrates derived from biomass or food/feed (Dürre, 2016). 3.1.2 CO and CO2 evolution CO consumption was measured during all the experiment (Fig. 1c). A maximum carbon monoxide consumption of 89% was found 67 h after inoculation, when the highest biomass concentration was reached. This is understandable as biomass growth is known to take place during acidogenesis, simultaneous to a high consumption of the gaseous substrate (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). Once the maximum biomass concentration was reached, the CO consumption decreased progressively, as a consequence of the cessation of bacterial growth at the onset of the solventogenic stage. As soon as the fermentor was inoculated, C. carboxidivorans started producing CO2 (Fig. 1d), as a consequence of CO consumption known to be converted to acids and CO2 in the HBE fermentation process (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a). Afterwards, when natural acidification took place, CO2 started to be consumed resulting in a decrease of biomass growth and the beginning of the production of alcohols (Fig. 1d). In HBE fermentation, carbon dioxide would thus initially be produced while it will subsequently be consumed in a later stage, depending also on the availability of compounds such as hydrogen, present in syngas and required in carbon dioxide consumption. A negative CO2 consumption in the figures indicates that more CO2 was produced (from CO) than consumed. In order to confirm that the selective production of alcohols, with negligible accumulation of fatty acids as by-products, is the result of the presence of trace metals and an optimal pH, additional experiments were performed, under different trace metal and pH conditions, as described below."
9,Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W and Se and natural acidification from pH 6.2 to 5.0,"3.2 Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W and Se and natural acidification from pH 6.2 to 5.0 3.2.1 Biomass and solvent production In order to avoid and elucidate the possible effect of pH besides the effect of trace metals (W, Se), this experiment was performed under the same conditions as the first one, but without the trace metals. Similarly as in the first experiment, a short (19 h) lag phase was observed after inoculating C. carboxidivorans (Fig. 2 a). Afterwards, the strain started growing exponentially until natural acidification was allowed, 48 h after inoculation. The maximum biomass concentration was 0.378 g/L, reached 90 h after start-up of the bioreactor (Fig. 2a). The growth rate was estimated during the exponential phase (between 22 and 46 h after inoculation) and was found to reach a value of 0.068 h−1. The maximum amount biomass was similar as in the first experiment, but the growth rate was somewhat lower in this modified medium, without W and Se, compared to the previous experiment. As expected, (natural) acidification exhibited the same negative effect on biomass growth as observed in the first experiment; growth does first slowdown to eventually end up stopping at pH 5.0. A typical acids production pattern was found in this assay. Both here as well as in the other experiment described above, acetic acid was the first acid to be produced, simultaneously with bacterial growth. Maximum acetic acid concentration was detected 91 h after inoculation, (Fig. 2b), while butyric acid and hexanoic acid appeared around the end of the acidification stage, (Fig. 2b). Values of maximum concentrations are summarized in Table 1. W and Se are expected to stimulate the activity of enzymes used in anaerobic gas fermentation or used in the conversion of acids into alcohols. Selenium has, among others, been found to affect the activity of formate dehydrogenase in the gas fermenting species C. ljungdahlii (Çakar et al., 2018), while tungsten has been suggested to stimulate the conversion of acetic acid into acetaldehyde in C. autoethanogenum due to its presence in aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AFOR), the step before of the conversion of that acetaldehyde into ethanol via the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Abubackar et al., 2015). The absence or presence of such trace metals did not notably affect the production of organic fatty acids; but mainly their conversion into alcohols. That way, as can be seen in Table 1, the absence of those trace metals might justify the higher maximum concentrations of all three acids in this experiment (Fig. 2b) compared to the previous experiment with W and Se (Fig. 1b). For that same reason, hardly any ethanol is produced here during the acidogenic stage in absence of those trace metals, contrary to what was observed in their presence in the previous assay with the trace metals. Although some ethanol appeared a few hours after acetic acid was first detected (28 h), most of the alcohol was produced during the solventogenic stage, (Fig. 2b). The first traces of butanol were found 91 h after the experimental start-up; At that time, between t = 120 h and t = 163 h, hexanol just appeared, (Fig. 2b). Similarly as for the acids, shorter chain alcohols are produced first, following a chronological order of production with increasing carbon numbers, from C2 to C4 and finally C6. Maximum concentrations of alcohols and alcohols production rates are given in Table 1. Compared with the first experiment, which was operated under the same conditions (natural acidification down to pH 5.0), except for the absence of W and Se, here lower maximum concentrations of alcohols were reached together with lower production rates (Table 1), which can be considered to be due to the lack of relevant trace metals in the culture medium. However, hexanol was produced and detected in this experiment as well as hexanoic acid that can be converted to the corresponding C6-alcohol, resulting therefore in the presence of hexanol. The production of alcohols is thus clearly stimulated by the presence of specific trace metals, while omitting such trace metals would allow to selectively accumulate organic acids in the HBE fermentation process. This confirms the original hypothesis on the key role of specific trace metals on the production of alcohols in this HBE fermentation process using syngas as substrate mixture. 3.2.2 CO and CO2 evolution CO consumption and growth of C. carboxidivorans started simultaneously, soon after inoculation. The maximum CO consumption was reached 68 h after inoculation with a value of 76% (Fig. 2c). Afterwards, it quickly dropped when medium acidification was allowed, down to minimum values around 15–19%. Although CO consumption was slightly lower than in the previous experiment, the pattern was otherwise very similar, meaning that both CO assimilation and biomass growth decreased when natural acidification took place. Besides, CO concentrations were measured once a day; thus a somewhat higher maximum could have been reached, though not detected. CO2 consumption and production are shown in Fig. 2d. CO2 was produced at the same time as CO was being consumed, reaching its maximum production 67 h after inoculation, exactly when CO consumption reached its maximum value. When CO consumption started deceasing, CO2 production started dropping as well. At the end of the experiment a lower CO2 production was detected, due to the decrease of CO consumption. As explained above and based on stoichiometric bioconversion equations published elsewhere (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a), it can be considered that the amount hydrogen present in the syngas mixture used in this study might not have been high enough to remove all the amount carbon dioxide originally present in the syngas mixture together with the amount produced during the early stages of the process. This is true both in presence or absence of W and Se, and was observed in this experiment as well as in the experiment with a complete trace metals solution."
10,Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W and Se at constant pH 6.2,"3.3 Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W and Se at constant pH 6.2 3.3.1 Biomass and solvent production The absence of trace metals such as W or Se together with bioreactor operation at a constant high pH is expected to favour the production of acids while significantly reducing the presence of alcohols, since both a high pH and the absence of such trace metals would be favourable to acidogenesis and unfavourable to solventogenesis. Such hypothesis was indeed confirmed in this experiment. Growth of C. carboxidivorans started soon after its inoculation, with a maximum biomass concentration of 0.332 g/L reached 95 h after starting the bioreactor operation (Fig. 3 a). A growth rate of 0.076 h−1 was calculated during the exponential phase. In this assay the pH was maintained constant at a value of 6.2 throughout all the experimental period. By maintaining the pH at a relatively high value of 6.2, without any natural acidification, a somewhat higher growth rate was found, due to the fact that a higher pH has been observed to promote bacterial growth (Millat et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2008). As observed in the other experiments described above, acetic acid production and bacterial growth appeared simultaneously (Fig. 3b), but a significantly higher maximum acetic acid concentration was found compared to the previous assays (Table 1). The presence of butyric acid and hexanoic acid was observed 47 h and 91 h after inoculation (Fig. 3b), reaching their maximum values 211 h after start-up of the experiment (Table 1). As hypothesized initially, the maximum concentrations of fatty acids (Table 1) were higher in this experiment due to the higher pH value, maintained constant during all the experiment and considered to limit the conversion of acids into alcohols (Phillips et al., 2015). Only ethanol and butanol were produced and at relatively low concentrations, and no hexanol was detected throughout the experiment due to the negative effect of a high pH on the solventogenic stage (Table 1). Besides, as expected and as observed in the previous experiment, the absence of W and Se, played a key role in the low production of alcohols. The high pH value and the absence of those trace metals exerted cumulative negative effects. That way, alcohols production was lower and delayed in time; ethanol and butanol appeared, respectively, 48 h and 163 h after inoculation. Maximum ethanol and butanol concentrations can be found in Table 1, showing lower concentrations than obtained (2720 mg/L ethanol, 1920 mg/L butanol and 850 mg/L hexanol) in experiments with syngas, at a higher constant pH of 5.75 and with W and Se added to the medium (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). Ethanol and butanol production rates were estimated (Table 1). Compared with the previous experiments, those are the lowest alcohol production rates obtained (Table 1). Those rates are also lower than those obtained in other experiments at higher pH, in presence of W and Se and with syngas as gaseous substrate mixture (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). The absence of W and Se, but also the pH value, do thus clearly affect the metabolic profile and do directly affect the level of production of alcohols in HBE fermentation. Contrary to the first assay, in which the operating conditions allowed for selective production of alcohols, the conditions applied in this experiment resulted in the selective production of organic acids, in both cases with minor presence of by-products. At industrial scale production of either organic acids or alcohols would thus be possible. 3.3.2 CO and CO2 evolution Again, CO consumption and cell growth started at the same time. A maximum CO consumption of 67% was reached 67 h after inoculation. Then, the consumption started gradually to decrease down to values of 20–30% in the last phase of the experiment (Fig. 3c). As in the previous experiments, CO2 was produced in the first part of the study, during the acidogenic stage. When CO consumption deceased, the production of CO2 dropped and it started being consumed, 150 h after inoculation. Some net CO2 consumption was observed (Fig. 3d)."
11,Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W at constant pH 6.2,"3.4 Continuous gas-fed bioreactor without W at constant pH 6.2 3.4.1 Biomass and solvent production Although W and Se together were considered to be potentially able to affect the overall pathway from the assimilation of C1 gases all the way down to the production of alcohols, a reasonable assumption was raised suggesting that W might have played the most relevant role both in the higher production of acids from C1 gases as well as in the production of alcohols. In order to elucidate to effect of W as individual trace metal compared to Se, an additional experiment was undertaken without W but in the presence of Se. At such pH, growth of C. carboxidivorans was observed immediately after inoculation without any lag phase (Fig. 4 a). The maximum biomass concentration was reached 48 h after inoculation with a value of 0.422 g/L (Fig. 4a). A growth rate of 0.100 h−1 was calculated during the exponential phase. The maximum biomass concentration obtained and growth rate were somewhat higher than in the previous experiment. This could be due to the absence of tungsten in the fermentation broth, as tungsten is a trace metal necessary to metalloenzymes of the WL pathway for the production of alcohols. The production of alcohols is a process very expensive energetically for the bacteria; as a consequence, it could be assumed that the absence or reduction of production of alcohols allows the bacteria to be more efficient in their growth and production of acids. The same pattern of acids production was observed as in the previous experiments, where acetic acid was the first acid to appear, followed by butyric acid and finally hexanoic acid (Fig. 4b). Likewise, acetic acid was produced simultaneously to the bacterial growth, reaching its maximum value 162 h after inoculation (Table 1). Clostridium carboxidivorans started to produce butyric acid 50 h after inoculation, while hexanoic acid was observed 211 h after inoculation. Besides, the maximum concentration of those acids was reached around the end of the experiment, after 331 h, when it then remained basically constant (Fig. 4b) (Table 1). As was previously hypothesized, the absence of tungsten results in a clear increase in the production of acids, mainly in the case of acetic acid, compared to other data published recently for the same conditions and similar pH values (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). Concerning the alcohols, ethanol was produced as soon as Clostidium started to grow, whereas butanol was not observed until 162 h after inoculation (Fig. 4b). Their maximum concentrations were reached simultaneously (Table 1). However, hexanol was not produced at all in this experiment (Fig. 4b). Comparing this experiment with the previous ones and with recent literature data using similar pH conditions (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016, 2017c), the absence of tungsten appears to lead to lower concentrations of all alcohols in HBE fermentation (Table 1). However, the absence of the two trace metals together (previous experiment) has a negative effect on the maximum biomass concentration and growth rate when these values are compared with this experiment omitting tungsten only (Table 1). Also, lower concentrations of acids were obtained in the previous experiments in comparison with the present one (Table 1), this could be related with the lower biomass concentration obtained during the third experiment in comparison with this last experiment under same pH conditions. In this way, it can be suggested that the lack of both trace metals had a more negative effect on the production of alcohols than the absence of tungsten only, however the major negative effect seems to be produced by the absence of tungsten (Table 1). A similar effect was observed by Abubackar et al. (2015) using C. autoethanogenum grown in a medium without selenium or tungsten for the production of ethanol. C. autoethanogenum does not perform the full HBE fermentation process, but still produces acetic acid and ethanol through gas fermentation (Abubackar et al., 2015). As expected, the ethanol and butanol production rates are lower than those obtained in the previous experiments (Table 1). The data summarized in Table 1 clearly allow to see the effect of trace metals and/or pH on the selective production of acids and alcohols. 3.4.2 CO and CO2 evolution Carbon monoxide consumption was concomitant with the bacterial growth. Fig. 4c shows a maximum CO consumption of 84%, 23 h after inoculation. When the bacterial growth ceased, CO consumption started to decrease as well (50 h after inoculation). Maximum CO consumption was reached somewhat later in the previous experiments. Also, the maximum consumption was slightly higher in the previous experiment (89%) with respect to this one (84%). Although such difference is low, this could be related to the fact that the bacteria can theoretically also produce some amount of alcohols directly from CO based on the WP pathway, which would also be affected by the presence of trace metals, such as W, in the last steps of the pathway. Nevertheless, for energetic reasons, most of the alcohols produced should go through the production of acids first. As mentioned above, Clostridium carboxidivorans produces CO2 during the acidogenic step, as a consequence of CO consumption. This can also be seen in Fig. 4d, where a maximum consumption of −121% was observed, 43 h after inoculation, coinciding with the maximum biomass growth and CO consumption. Subsequently, CO2 was consumed, until it stabilized and reached an approximate value of −20% (Fig. 4d). When comparing with the previous experiment, it was observed that the production of CO2 was higher in that experiment, also related to the higher CO consumption."
12,Conclusions,"Tungsten plays a major role in HBE fermentation in C. carboxidivorans. It stimulates the conversion of acids into alcohols, reaching a higher conversion at low pH (5.0) than at high pH (6.2), favourable for the accumulation of alcohols rather than acids. The effect of selenium seemed to be less significant. Instead a higher pH and the absence of specific trace metals (e.g., W) increases the accumulation of fatty acids rather than alcohols. The identification of optimal conditions (e.g., trace metals, pH) for the selective production of specific metabolites, either organics acids or alcohols, results in a more efficient production process."
