0,Introduction,"With the development of industry and agriculture, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from refineries and tanneries, urban sewage and sewage treatment plants, fecal treatment plants and paper mills, heat generation and power generation geothermal plants has become an environmental pollutant (Szabo, 2018; Gorini et al., 2020). Occupational exposure to H2S is generally higher than that in the natural environment (Guarrasi et al., 2015). The hazard of H2S exposure on human health is well known. H2S exposure results in bronchoconstriction, eye irritation, olfactory nerve paralysis, and even death (Rubright et al., 2017). The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry evaluated the toxicological effects of H2S: respiratory system damage, circulatory system abnormalities, immune system imbalance, digestive, and nervous system injury (Hu et al., 2018). H2S exposure triggered tracheal inflammatory injury through FOS/IL8 signaling mediated by oxidative stress in chickens (Chen et al., 2019). Oxidative stress induced by H2S stimulated excessive mitochondrial fission and activated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Wang et al., 2019). H2S stimulated the formation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and triggered thymus immune damage in broilers (Hu et al., 2019). The inhalation of H2S induced oxidative stress and damage to jejunum morphology and function in broilers (Zheng et al., 2019). H2S promoted pyroptosis induced by homocysteine in the mouse retina (George et al., 2018). Pyroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis, is a recently discovered pathway of host cell death (Green, 2019). Pyroptosis is triggered by a range of microbial infections, such as Salmonella, Legionella and Francisella as well as non-infectious stimuli including host factors produced during diseases (Liu and Sun, 2019). The formation of inflammasome complexes is a necessary condition in the classical pyroptotic pathway (Robinson et al., 2019). Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) related to pyroptosis like intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or nonpathogen-related damage-associated molecular patterns (Wang et al., 2020b; Amarante-Mendes et al., 2018). The caspase-1-dependent inflammasome complex is formed by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome sensor directly or through apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) when PRRs are stimulated (Bolivar et al., 2019; Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014). Then, Caspase1 (Casp-1) transforms from a proenzyme to a protease to complete its activation and further stimulates pyroptosis (Van Opdenbosch and Lamkanfi, 2019). The swelling and release of proinflammatory factors including Interleukin 18 (IL-18) and Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) of pyroptotic cells produces an inflammatory response in the host (Bergsbaken et al., 2009). The inflammasome complex and inflammatory reactions associated with pyroptotic death cause respiratory tract infection, chronic pulmonary inflammation and novel coronavirus-associated acute respiratory symptoms (Brusselle et al., 2014; Lopez-Reyes et al., 2020). Appropriate concentration of H2S reduced oxidative stress and benefited to the body (Vacek et al., 2010), while excessive H2S caused oxidative stress and played a pathological role (Chen et al., 2019). As an endogenous gas signaling molecule, H2S protected vascular remodeling (Vacek et al., 2010) and reduced skeletal muscle atrophy by alleviating oxidative stress (Majumder et al., 2018). High concentration of H2S inhaled into human body can decompose into HS- which combines with Fe3+ in cytochrome c oxidase IV (Cox IV) to inhibit the activity of the enzyme and prevent it from reducing Cox containing Fe2+, thus blocking the electron transfer of respiratory chain and oxygen utilization (Nicholls et al., 2013). Inhibition of Cox IV results in the leakage of mitochondrial electrons from superoxide and the transformation into reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Lou et al., 2014). The danger signals to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome are extensive, especially ROS (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). ROS serve as redox signaling molecules to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and aggravate the subsequent inflammatory cascade and cell damage (Abais et al., 2015). The increase of ROS was recognized by complex of Thioredoxin 1 (TRX1) and Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), which combined with NLRP3 and mediated pyroptotic death (Gu et al., 2019). In addition, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) had attracted much significant attention due to their competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) axis being involved in the regulation of ROS and pyroptotic death about many disease studies (He et al., 2020). Circle RNAs (circRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) or pseudogenes act as ceRNAs of downstream mRNAs and co-regulate each other by sharing microRNAs (miRNAs) (Tay et al., 2014). LncRNA-XIST/miR-335/SOD2 crosstalk mediated pyroptotic death to influence the pathological process of non-small cell lung cancer by the regulation of ROS generation (Liu et al., 2019). LncRNA-SNHG1 regulated the miR-7/NLRP3 pathway to promote neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (Cao et al., 2018). CircRNA-076631/miR-214-3p/Casp-1 mediated pyroptosis in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy (Yang et al., 2019). H2S regulated cell apoptosis and necrosis to influence the cell cycle through ceRNA crosstalk (Li et al., 2020b). ceRNA may regulate ROS levels and pyroptosis in respiratory diseases (Yu et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2019). However, it is not clear whether H2S triggers pyroptosis or changes transcriptome expression in the trachea. Role of ceRNA axis in the regulation of ROS and pyroptosis is also unclear. Here, transcriptomics provided valuable information about environmental and genetic interactions that were related to harmful stimuli in the regulation of ceRNA axis, signaling pathways, and functional changes. We screened and established a circRNA-related ceRNA network in broilers exposed to H2S using transcriptome technology. A double luciferase reporter system proved the interaction between circRNA-IGLL1-17828 (circRNA-1728) and miR-6631-5p, miR-6631-5p and Dual specificity protein phosphatase 6 (DUSP6). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to explore the expression of pyroptosis-related pathway indicators. Immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence staining were used to observe the changes of cell pyroptosis or ROS levels. These findings further clarified the toxicological mechanism of H2S and provided a reference for environmental research and respiratory disease research."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Treatment of experimental animals and groups,"2.1 Treatment of experimental animals and groups All procedures in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northeast Agricultural University (Li et al., 2020b). A total of eighty chickens (one-day-old) were separate and were housed in two individual standard animal rooms recorded as control (C) or H2S group (Guo et al., 2019). The two animal environment control rooms were raised according to the standard methods of brooding. We used an Innova-1412 Luma Sense photoacoustic field gas monitor to continuously monitor and maintain the constant concentration of H2S in two groups of standard animal rooms. The H2S group inhaled a constant concentration of H2S gas for 24 h, and the concentration in the H2S group was maintained at 19.5–20.5 mg/m3 at 42 days (Li et al., 2020b). Broilers aged 42-days were euthanized. Then the tracheal samples were quickly extracted, washed with normal saline, fixed, and stored for further experiments."
3,Treatment of cell model and transfection,"2.2 Treatment of cell model and transfection Chicken liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (LMH, ATCC, USA) were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum (Gibco, USA), and maintained at 37 ℃ with 5% CO2. We chose NaHS as donor of H2S for cell exposure and screened 2 mM as the exposure concentration of H2S. When cells were exposed to 2 mM NaHS, the cell activity was 85.3% in previous study (Li et al., 2020b). NaHS are water-soluble, so we dissolved NaHS in the DMEM supplemented with 10% serum and prepared them on the spot each time. Cells were cultured on 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells mL−1. To explore the effect of miR-6631–5p in pyroptosis triggered by H2S, cells were treated in three ways: control group (C), NaHS group (H) and NaHS+miR-6631-5p inhibitor group (H+I). Cell culture medium was vehicle control to C group cells, the same below. LMH cells in H+I group were transfected with miR-6631–5p inhibitor in Opti-MEM medium and treated with NaHS for 24 h. H group cells were treated with NaHS alone. miR-6631–5p inhibitor (RiboBio, China) was incubated with 3 μL Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) (Yang et al., 2018) in Opti-MEM medium. To study the existence of ceRNA, miR-6631-5p mimic (RiboBio, China), mimic NC and inhibitor NC were incubated with 1.5 μL of Lipofectamine 2000, miR-6631-5p inhibitor in Opti-MEM medium and added to cells. To explore the effect of miR-6631–5p in ROS levels and pyroptosis, cells were treated with miR-6631-5p mimic (M), miR-6631-5p inhibitor (I), or co-treated with miR-6631-5p mimic and 2.5 mM (Chen et al., 2019) ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). To clarity the effect of DUSP6 in the ROS levels and pyroptosis, cells were treated with DUSP6 siRNA (Ribobio, China), and co-treated with DUSP6-siRNA (50 nM, Ribobio, China) and miR-6631-5p inhibitor (Ribobio, China). Sequences of miR-6631-5p mimic, inhibitor and siRNA-DUSP6 were provided in Table 1."
4,Transcriptome sequencing,"2.3 Transcriptome sequencing Total RNA of 1 μg RNA per sample was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, California, USA) from two groups tracheal samples of broilers. The purity of RNA was measured and detected using a NanoPhotometer® spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). Quantified and identified RNA was applied to synthesize and establish miRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs libraries with the NEB-Next® Multiplex Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) (Chen et al., 2020). First-strand cDNA and second-strand cDNA were synthesized with random primers and reverse transcriptase in succession. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized in a second-strand cDNA synthesis reactor, and dTTPs were replaced by dUTPs. Second, cDNA fragments were preferentially screened from the purified Library of the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) (Wang et al., 2020c). Then, PCR was in progress with DNA polymerase and primers. Finally, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system detected the library quality. The EBseq algorithm was applied to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and implement (false discovery rate) FDR analysis (Anders and Huber, 2010). DEGs were analyzed on the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) database to obtain functional annotation, GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis."
5,Immunohistochemical observation,"2.4 Immunohistochemical observation After paraffin sections dewaxing and gradient alcohol dehydration, antigen repair was carried out. Then, sections were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min after being added the spontaneous fluorescence quenching agent for 5 min. The first antibodies were diluted with 5% BSA. These sections were incubated with diluted primary antibodies against cleaved-Casp-1(1:300, Wanleibio, China) and NLPR3 (1:200, Wanleibio, China) at 4 ℃ overnight, and incubated secondary antibodies labeled with HRP for 50 min. Sections were treated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution. Color development time was controlled under a microscope. Finally, pictures were obtained from a fluorescence microscope."
6,Annexin V-FITC/ Propidium Iodide/Hoechst staining analysis,"2.5 Annexin V-FITC/ Propidium Iodide/Hoechst staining analysis LMH cells were seed on 12-well plates and stained 24 h after transfection. Then, 2.5 μL of Hoechst staining solution and 500 μL of buffer were added to wells. They were incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark. After rinsing three times with PBS, each well was treated with 500 μL of buffer with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of Propidium Iodide (PI). Then, the cells were placed in the cell incubator for 30 min. Finally, pictures were imaged under a fluorescence microscope."
7,Dual-luciferase reporter assay,"2.6 Dual-luciferase reporter assay Recombinant plasmids were constructed and based on the pMIR-REPORT vector. The two 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTR), two target binding sites between circRNA-17828, DUSP6 individually and miR-6631-5p were inserted into the vector. Inserted sequences were composed of 42 cases of original or corresponding mutated sequences. Recombinant plasmids were named as pMIR-circ-WT (circ-MT) and pMIR-DUSP6-WT (DUSP6-WT). Mutated recombinant plasmids were named as pMIR-circ-MT (circ-MT) and pMIR-DUSP6-MT(DUSP6-MT). circRNA-17828 and DUSP6 wild-type/mutant-type sequences are shown in Table 2. LMH cells were co-transfected with pMIR-circ-WT/MT or pMIR-DUSP6-WT/MT, 50 nM miR-6631-5p-mimic, and PHRL-TK plasmids. The ratio of pMIR-REPORT, PhRL-TK, and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was 1 μg: 0.1 μg: 2.5 μL. The luciferase activity was measured according to the methods in previous study (Wang et al., 2020d)."
8,ROS assay,"2.7 ROS assay ROS activity was measured by a reactive oxygen species assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) in Chen’s paper (Chen et al., 2019). The results were observed and visualized by fluorescence microscopy."
9,Western blot analysis,"2.8 Western blot analysis Protein lysate was prepared by diluting PMSF solution with RIPA lysis at a ratio of 1:100. And protein lysate was added to each sample on ice for 30 min. Fully lysed cells were transferred into EP tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in a 4-degree centrifuge. Then the supernatant was total protein which were heat denatured (Zhang et al., 2020) and subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Jing et al., 2020). They were transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes that were blocked with 5% milk at 37 ℃ for two hours, with diluted primary antibodies against DUSP6, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK), phosphorylated ERK (pERK), NLRP3, Casp-1, and β-actin at 4 ℃ overnight. The antibodies related manufacturers and diluted concentrations used for the experiment are shown in Table 4. Then NC membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:8000, Immunoway, USA) at room temperature for an hour. The final bands were quantified on ImageQuant LAS 500 (GE, USA) by the ECL Kit (Kangweishiji, Beijing, China) (Zhang et al., 2021). β-actin was used for an internal loading (Lian et al., 2020)."
10,Real-time quantitative PCR,"2.9 Real-time quantitative PCR After the TRIzol reagent separated the total RNA in the two groups for the trachea from broilers, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized by oligonucleotide primers and a reverse transcriptase, miRNA first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Tiangen Biotech, Shanghai, China). qRT-PCR was implemented to measure the circRNAs, miRNA and mRNAs expression levels with a Light Cycler® 480 system (Zhao et al., 2020) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The relative abundance of mRNA for circRNAs, miRNA and mRNA was calculated according to the 2–△△Ct method (Li et al., 2021). Table 3 shows the primer sequences of circRNAs, miRNA, and mRNAs. β-actin (Cui et al., 2020) and U6 (Qianru et al., 2020) were used for an internal loading ( Table 4)."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis All data analysis analyzed in GraphPad Prism (version 7.0, GraphPad Software, USA) with one-way ANOVA with Tukey's test and Student’s t-test (Cui et al., 2021). The results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Different letters in vitro experiments or *indicated significant values in vivo experiments compared with the corresponding control (P < 0.05). In contrast, the same letters represented no significant values (P > 0.05)."
12,Results,
13,Increase of NLRP3 and Casp-1 expression in the trachea after H2S exposure,"3.1 Increase of NLRP3 and Casp-1 expression in the trachea after H2S exposure To evaluate the effect of H2S exposure on pyroptosis in the trachea, the expression of NLRP3 and Casp-1 in the trachea was detected by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that NLRP3 (arrows in Fig. 1B) and cleaved-Casp-1 (arrows Fig. 1D) signals in were significantly enhanced in the H2S group compared with the C group (Fig. 1A and C). These findings suggested that H2S induced the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and the activation of Casp-1 in vivo. These findings indicated that H2S triggered the pyroptotic death of tracheal cells."
14,Transcriptome sequencing results,"3.2 Transcriptome sequencing results To determine the potential roles of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in cell pyroptosis triggered by H2S in the trachea, we detected their expression in broilers of the H2S and C groups by RNA-Seq and obtained images for visualization. Red and green frames represent the upregulated and downregulated circRNAs (log2fold change > 0.585 or < –0.585, FDR < 0.05) between two groups respectively ( Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows possible circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the trachea exposed to H2S. The targeting relationship between circRNA-17828 and miRNA-6631-5p was noted. Fig. 2C shows the 20 most likely pathways enriched in all DEGs in KEGG pathways, including the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. It is a canonical inflammasome pathway that triggers pyroptosis (Bolivar et al., 2019). Fig. 2D shows the 20-biological process, cell composition and molecular function analyses in which enriched DEGs were most likely to participate. The term “cell cycle” consisted of the largest transcripts. Consistent with previous expectations, key inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and IL-18 in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway were involved in intriguing categories including the immune response and immune system process. These results suggested some indicators in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway may mediate some pathological injury induced by H2S."
15,Verification of circRNA-18728/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 ceRNA axis,"3.3 Verification of circRNA-18728/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 ceRNA axis circRNAs and mRNAs compete for binding to same miRNAs through common miRNAs response elements to regulate each other and influence various biological functions (Yang et al., 2021). Transcriptomics predicted that miR-6631-5p could directly interact with circRNA-17828 as shown in Fig. 2C. The target relationship between DUSP6 and miR-6631-5p is detected on the miRDB database (http://www.mirdb.org/). Therefore, it is speculated that the circRNA-18728/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 axis may be established. To prove this hypothesis, we detected the existence of the regulatory axis in vitro. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A, there was no significant difference in the expression of miR-6631-5p in the C group, MC group and IC group (P > 0.05). When the concentration of miR-6631-5p mimic was 25 nM, 50 nM and 100 nM, the expression of miR-6631-5p was 300, 1300 and 600 times higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). When the concentration of miR-6631-5p inhibitor was 50 nM, 100 nM and 200 nM, the expression of miR-6631-5p was significantly decreased by 62%, 66% and 70% compared with control group (P < 0.05). When miR-6631-5p expression was up-regulated 2 times or more after mimic treatment, its effect was excellent. When miR-6631-5p expression decreased by 70% after inhibitor treatment, its inhibitory effect was excellent. Therefore, we chose the 50 nM mimic and 200 nM inhibitor. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1B, there was no significant difference as for DUSP6 expression between C group and NC group (P > 0.05). Compared with C group and NC group, the expression of DUSP6 in Si-1 groups (50 nM and 100 nM) was significantly decreased by 70% and 79% (P < 0.05), Si-2 groups (50 nM and 100 nM) was significantly decreased by 43% and 70% (P < 0.05), and Si-3 groups (50 nM and 100 nM) was significantly decreased by 48% and 41% (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the optimal concentration of dusp6 knockdown is 50 nM of Si-1 and 100 nM of Si-2. A diagrammatic sketch of circRNA-18728/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 axis is shown in Fig. 3A. The miR-6631-5p mimic inhibited the luciferase activity triggered by the targeted site of wild-type circRNA-18728 but could not inhibit mutant-type circRNA-18728. Similarly, the decreased fluorescence intensity of the wild-type DUSP6 with miR-6631-5p mimic suggested an interaction between DUSP6 and miR-6631-5p (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). After miR-6631-5p was knocked down or overexpressed, miR-6631-5p negatively regulated the levels of circRNA-18728 and DUSP6 (Fig. 3C). Additionally, knockdown of DUSP6 decreased the expression of circRNA-18728 but increased miR-6631-5p as shown in Fig. 3D (P < 0.05). These results proved that circRNA-18728 directly targeted miR-6631-5p which also interacted with DUSP6 through its binding sites."
16,The discovery of the circRNA-17828/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 axis and pyroptosis-related indicators in vivo,"3.4 The discovery of the circRNA-17828/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 axis and pyroptosis-related indicators in vivo RNA-seq revealed that H2S significantly increased 11 circRNAs, while decreased 5 circRNAs (Fig. 2A). We detected above 16 circRNAs by qRT-PCR and their expression was consistent with that predicted by omics ( Fig. 4A). The expression of miR-6631-5p in chickens is shown in Fig. 4B. Among them, the content of circRNA-18728 decreased by 60%, while miR-6631-5p increased more than 10 times in the tracheal samples induced by H2S compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was enriched in KEGG pathway analysis and highly related to pyroptosis. However, pyroptotic genes remain to be evaluated. Based on the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to pyroptotic death via ERK/NOX2 (He et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2019), we examined the expression of pyroptosis-related factors, such as DUSP6, ERK, NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), TRX1, TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC, Casp-1, IL-18 and IL-1β. Fig. 4C showed that H2S significantly elevated the mRNA levels of above indicators (P < 0.05). The protein levels of ERK, pERK, NLRP3, and Casp-1 also significantly increased in H2S-exposed trachea compared with the C group shown in Fig. 4D (P < 0.05). These results indicated that H2S triggered pyroptotic death and circRNA-17828/miR-6631–5p/DUSP6 may be involved in the regulation of pyroptosis induced by H2S."
17,The change in ROS levels after reversal of miR-6631-5p and DUSP6,"3.5 The change in ROS levels after reversal of miR-6631-5p and DUSP6 The relationship between ceRNA components and ROS production is not clear. To clarify how this ceRNA network regulated ROS production, LMH cells were treated with miR-6631-5p mimic (M) or inhibitor (I), miR-6631-5p-mimic with NAC (M + NAC). miR-6631-5p overexpression increased ROS production, but NAC reduced the ROS levels induced by miR-6631-5p overexpression. The knockdown of miR-6631–5p decreased ROS generation ( Fig. 5A, and B) (P < 0.05). As shown in Fig. 5C and D, DUSP6-siRNA (Si) alone significantly increased the ROS levels as well as co-treatment with NaHS and miR-6631-5p inhibitor (Si+I) compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, the knockdown of miR-6631-5p decreased ROS generation induced by the knockdown of DUSP6 (P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that miR-6631-5p and DUSP6 reversed ROS production due to their increase or decrease."
18,The effect of miR-6631-5p on pyroptosis induced by H2S in vitro,"3.6 The effect of miR-6631-5p on pyroptosis induced by H2S in vitro To further detect the effect of miR-6631-5p in pyroptosis induced by H2S, we detected pyroptotic change in cells and expression of related indicators of the pyroptotic pathway. This study modeled H2S exposure by stimulating cultured LMH cells with NaHS (H) in vitro. H group showed Hoechst, PI and Annexin V-FITC staining, and swelling or fracture even with characteristic large bubbles as shown by the yellow arrow in Fig. 6A, which were the characteristic of pyroptosis, but cells in the control group had normal morphology. There were more pyroptotic cells with such features in the H group than in the control and H+I groups. There were more pyroptotic cells in the H+I group than in the control group (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, NaHS reduced the expression of circRNA-17828 and DUSP6, but enhanced the levels of miR-6631-5p. Co-treatment with NaHS and miR-6631-5p inhibitor weakened this effect (P < 0.05). This suggested that H2S upregulated miR-6631-5p by decreasing circRNA-17828. Compared to the control group, NaHS increased the levels of pyroptosis-related indicators while DUSP6 were significantly decreased. Compared with the treatment of NaHS alone, the mRNA or protein levels of pyroptosis-related factors in the co-treatment of NaHS and miR-6631-5p inhibitor groups were significantly decreased (Fig. 6B, and C) (P < 0.05), while the expression of DUSP6 was significantly upregulated. These findings suggested that H2S exposure induced pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo and regulated cell pyroptosis through circRNA-17828/miR-6631-5p signaling."
19,The effect of miR-6631-5p reversal on pyroptosis,"3.7 The effect of miR-6631-5p reversal on pyroptosis To further detect the effect of miR-6631-5p in ROS levels and pyroptosis, we added antioxidant (NAC) to the M group. Fluorescence staining analysis showed that there were the most pyroptotic cells in the M group, but NAC blocked pyroptosis induced by miR-6631-5p. The cells in the inhibitor and control groups did not exhibit pyroptotic characteristics ( Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B and C, the levels of pyroptosis-related indicators were all upregulated, as expected after treatment with the miR-6631-5p mimic. However, DUSP6 showed the opposite trend. Treatment with NAC decreased the levels of the upregulated indicators but increased DUSP6 induced by the miR-6631-5p mimic. These elements expressed the contrary trends in the I group. Most indicators in the pyroptotic pathway increased by 50–100% in miR-6631-5p mimic group, but decreased by 40% after treatment with the miR-6631-5p inhibitor compared to the control group (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that miR-6631-5p triggered the ROS generation to induce pyroptosis."
20,The effects of DUSP6 reversal on pyroptosis,"3.8 The effects of DUSP6 reversal on pyroptosis To further demonstrate that miR-6631–5p and DUSP6 are important factors involved in pyroptosis through ROS rather than independent eﬀects, we set three groups: C, Si, Si+I groups. Annexin V-FITC/PI/Hoechst staining exhibited that the knockdown of DUSP6 induced more pyroptotic cells. Among them, the Si group had the largest number of pyroptotic cells, followed by the Si + I group, but the C group had no pyroptotic cells (Fig. 6A). Knockdown of DUSP6 significantly increased the expression of pyroptosis-related indicators but decreased DUSP6. However, co-treatment of DUSP6-siRNA and miR-6631-5p inhibitor weakened this effect as shown in Fig. 8B, C (P < 0.05). In summary, these findings suggested that miR-6631-5p and DUSP6 regulated pyroptotic death by regulating ROS production."
21,Discussion,"The high incidence of respiratory diseases is inseparable from the inhalation of H2S, especially airway injury (Lindenmann et al., 2010; Saeed et al., 2018). Pyroptosis is a new mechanism of ROS mediated inflammasomes involved in respiratory diseases (An et al., 2019). RNA crosstalk of ncRNAs has potential clinical applications in some diseases due to the regulation of pyroptosis as a novel biomarker, such as circRNA (Yang et al., 2019). However, few studies had associated H2S with pyroptosis and RNA crosstalk of circRNAs in the airway inflammatory response. In this study, we found for the first time that H2S in air induced the differential expression of 16 circRNAs and pyroptosis of broiler tracheal cells. Moreover, it was proved that circRNA-17828 was the molecular sponge of miR-6631-5p, which stimulated ROS generation to produce and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex by targeting DUSP6 in pyroptotic death. The emerging functions of circRNAs under environmental stress provided increasing evidence of environmental health risk assessment (Chen et al., 2019). PM2.5 exposure altered the transcription profile of circRNAs and exerted effects on pulmonary injury (Li et al., 2020a). Air pollutant exposure during pregnancy caused 25 downregulated circRNAs and 55 upregulated circRNAs, even contributing to congenital-defects in offspring (Li et al., 2019). Some ceRNAcrosstalk responded to air pollution but lacked the circRNA-related ceRNAaxis. LncRNA-107052630/miR-205a/G0S2 signaling was involved in intestinal injury induced by ammonia (NH3) in air pollution (Wang et al., 2020c). NH3 in the air regulated tracheal cell death through the LncRNA-107053293/miR-148a-3p/FAF1 crosstalk in chickens (Wang et al., 2020d). circRNAs extend to the complexity of RNA crosstalk. circRNAs or mRNAs change each other's abundance by interacting with a common set of miRNAs (Tay et al., 2014). In this study, H2S exposure caused five downregulated circRNAs and 11 upregulated circRNAs in the trachea. H2S increased levels of miR-6631-5p, but decreased circRNA-17828 and DUSP6 in the trachea. miR-6631-5p and DUSP6 negatively regulated each other. circRNA-18728 was positively regulated by DUSP6, but negatively regulated by miR-631-5p. These results proved existence of the crosstalk of circRNA-18728/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 in chickens exposed to H2S. Interactions between environmental pollutants and genes activated cell pyroptosis and bronchial epithelial injury in asthma (Zhuang et al., 2020). The NLRP3 inflammasome mediated cell pyroptosis to cause airway inflammation in toluene diisocyanate-induced asthmatic mice (Zhuang et al., 2019). Casp-1 recruited NLRP3 and ASC to form the NLRP3 inflammasome complex which activated Casp-1 to trigger pyroptotic death. The imbalance of ion gradients on both sides of the pyroptotic cell membrane led to swelling of the cells, rupture of the cell membrane and release of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and IL-18 (Bolivar et al., 2019). Researchers used NLRP3 and cleaved-Casp-1 to observe the occurrence of pyroptosis in tissue (Zhang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020a) and observed pyroptotic death by Hoechst, PI, and Annexin V-FITC in vitro. They found three kinds of staining in vitro and showed pyroptotic cell swelling or rupture even through the appearance of characteristic large bubbles (Miao et al., 2019) and the above characteristics were consistent with this study. Here, H2S upregulated the levels of NLRP3, ASC, Casp-1, IL-1β and IL-18 in vitro and in vivo. H2S triggered the above pyroptotic characteristics. These findings suggested that H2S activated the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and Casp-1 in vivo and in vitro to induce pyroptotic death. ROS are a very important intermediate link in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (Rada and Leto, 2008). NOX2 dependent ROS production served as a triggering factor to activate the redox regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex by TRX1/TXNIP signaling (He et al., 2020). ERK was physiologically inhibited by DUSP6 in regulating cellular development and survival (Maillet et al., 2008). ERK activation increased ROS production by increasing the NOX2 activity (Kang et al., 2019; Qianru et al., 2021). Moreover, some ncRNAs mediated the molecular pathological mechanism of pyroptosis and disease through 3′ UTR complementary base pairing of their target sites or the change in ROS regulated by their RNA crosswalk (Wan et al., 2020). LncRNA-XIST, as the ceRNA of SOD, regulated the ROS signaling pathway and induced pyroptotic death by miR-335 (Liu et al., 2019). A novel circular RNA (circRNA-0076631) mediated pyroptosis in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by binding with miR-214-3p and functioning as a ceRNAof Casp-1 (Yang et al., 2019). The circHIPK3/miR-421/FOXO3a signaling regulated pyroptosis and ischemic muscle injury (Yan et al., 2020). However, current researches studies have only involved two type of ncRNAs or miRNAs targeting mRNAs to regulate ROS or pyroptosis, and there were few studies on circRNA-related regulation of ROS and pyroptosis. H2S stimulated ROS levels, but NAC decreased the ROS levels induced by H2S (Chen et al., 2019). This study added some information to these gaps. Our results initially showed that H2S downregulated the expression of circRNA-17828 and DUSP6, but upregulated miR-6631-5p in vitro. The miR-6631-5p inhibitor reduced the downregulation of circRNA-17828 and the upregulation of pyroptotic indicators such as ERK, NOX2, Trx1, TXNIP, ASC, NLRP3, Casp-1, IL-1β and IL-18 induced by H2S. The overexpression of miR-6631-5p or knockdown of DUSP6 promoted ROS production and performed a positive pyroptotic effect. However, the addition of NAC reduced ROS stimulation and the pyroptotic effect of miR-6631-5p. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that circRNA-17828, miR-6631-5p, and DUSP6 are interdependent in the process of ROS generation and pyroptosis induced by H2S."
22,Conclusion,"In summary, this study showed for the first time the differential expression profile of circRNAs after H2S exposure, the occurrence of pyroptosis in chicken trachea exposed to H2S and the existence of circRNA-17828/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6. We further demonstrated that circRNA-17828/miR-6631-5p/DUSP6 signaling regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and triggered pyroptotic death by regulating ROS levels. This study not only provided important references for understanding the airway toxicity of H2S but also theoretical basis for the research on ncRNAs in the cell response to air pollution and environmental toxicology."
