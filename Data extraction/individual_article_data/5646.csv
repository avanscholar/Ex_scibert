0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas and its emission has made an important contribution to climate change and global warming [1]. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of innovative technologies to deal with the global CO2 emissions [2]. On the other hand, CO2 is a carbon resource, which is able to be chemically converted to value-added chemicals and fuels [3,4]. Dependent on catalysts and reaction conditions, CO2 can be used to produce CO [5], CH4 [6,7], methanol [8], alcohol [9], methyl ether [10], C2+-hydrocarbons [11–13] and other useful chemicals. Since CO2 is highly stable thermodynamically, an intense energy is needed to activate it. A theoretical calculation demonstrated that the breakage of chemical bonds in the CO2 molecule occurs above 1500 °C, and the complete dissociation temperature of CO2 into carbon and oxygen is higher than 5000 °C [14,15]. Since most of CO2 conversions are exothermic [16], high temperature is thus unfavorable to the forward reaction [17,18]. In addition, catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition on the surface was frequently observed at high temperatures [19]. It is, therefore, desirable to carry out CO2 hydrogenation at low temperatures. It is reported that CO2 conversion could be enhanced in the presence of a non-thermal plasma [20]. Plasma, considered to be the fourth state of matter, contains a large concentration of active species with high energy [19]. Several types of plasma have been used in CO2 hydrogenation, including corona discharge, glow discharge, microwave discharge, gliding arc discharge, radio frequency discharge and dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) [20–23]. DBD plasma is generally operated at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, and its typical energy level of the high-energy electrons is in the range of 1–10 eV [20]. Since CO2 dissociation requires an energy of 5.5 eV, it is, therefore, possible to convert CO2 to value-added products in a DBD reactor [24,25]. In the plasma-induced catalytic hydrogenation of CO2, CO and CH4 are reported to be the major products. Zeng and Tu [26] found that the yields of both CO and CH4 were significantly enhanced when Ni/Al2O3 was packed in the DBD plasma zone. Nizio et al. [27] investigated CO2 methanation on Ni-Ce-Zr-O hydrotalcite-derived catalysts in a packed bed DBD reactor, and the highest yield of CH4 was ~80% at 110 °C. Nevertheless, little to trace amounts of C2+-hydrocarbons, such as C2H6, C2H4, C3H8 and the like, were obtained in the plasma-catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The chemical nature of support of the catalyst plays important role in the plasma-induced catalytic reactions, because it affects the catalytic performance as well as the discharge in the DBD plasma. Bacariza et al. [28,29] investigated the CO2 methanation on Ni-based catalysts supported on zeolite. They concluded that zeolite was a promising porous support material for CO2 hydrogenation and the framework of zeolite had marked effects on the catalytic performance. In the present work, we have chosen ZSM-5 (NaZSM-5) as the support to prepare CO2 hydrogenation supported metal catalysts, and investigated the synergy between DBD plasma and the supported catalysts in the selective CO2 hydrogenation reaction towards lower hydrocarbons in addition to CH4."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O chemicals were of analytical grade. They were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. NaZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 50, specific surface area of 340 m2/g) was supplied by Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of catalyst precursor,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst precursor NaZSM-5-supported metal catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method and denoted as M/ZSM-5 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo). The metal loading was 15 wt%. As an example, Co/ZSM-5 was prepared as follows: 2.6143 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O was first dissolved in 1.5 mL de-ionized water to obtain a clear solution. The solution was dropwise added to 3.0 g NaZSM-5 zeolite under continuous stirring. The resultant mixture was aged at ambient condition for 10 h, and the obtained solid was dried at 110 °C for 12 h, then calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 h to yield the Co/ZSM-5 catalyst. The other ZSM-5-supported metal catalysts were prepared in a similar way."
4,Reduction of the catalyst,"2.3 Reduction of the catalyst The in situ reduction of M/ZSM-5 was carried out in the DBD reactor in which the CO2 hydrogenation was subsequently performed. The schematic diagram of the DBD reactor is shown in Fig. 1 . A high-voltage electrode at the central axis of a quartz tube (8 mm in inner diameter and 10 mm in outer diameter) was connected with the plasma generator, and the aluminum foil, which was wrapped around the outer wall of the quartz tube, was connected to the ground. The quartz tube wall served as the discharge barrier. The discharge area, where the catalyst particles were packed, was 5 cm in length. The applied high voltage was kept at ~10 kV, and the discharge frequency was at 10 kHz. In a typical run, 1 mL catalyst (80–100 mesh) was packed in the discharge gap. H2 gas flow controlled by a mass flow-meter was then introduced at the top of reactor to purge the reactor. After the reactor was purged with the H2 flow for 5 min, a high voltage was applied from the plasma generator. The input voltage was gradually increased until the input power was ~12 W. The catalyst was then reduced by H2 plasma at the flowrate of 80 mL/min for 40 min."
5,Plasma-induced catalytic CO2 hydrogenation,"2.4 Plasma-induced catalytic CO2 hydrogenation After reduction of the catalyst, the feed gas was switched to a mixture of H2 and CO2, whose flow rates were regulated separately by mass flow-meters, adjusted to provide a H2/CO2 molar ratio of 3. The input power was gradually increased from zero to 14 W and kept at this value. The applied high voltage was kept at ~10 kV and the discharge frequency was at 10 kHz. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was kept at 4800 h−1. The effluent gas from the plasma reactor was first passed through a gas-liquid separator and then the gas product was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (GC7890II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. CO, CO2, CH4 and C2H6 were determined using a GDX-502 packed column, while C1–C4 hydrocarbons using a γ-Al2O3 packed column. The liquid products trapped in the gas-liquid separator were analyzed off-line by gas chromatography (Agilent GC6890, HP-5 capillary column and FID). The liquid product was mainly water with trace amounts of methanol, ethanol and other higher hydrocarbons. Generally, the yield of organic compounds in liquid product was negligible. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured using an infrared temperature detector. The temperature was always below 200 °C. The CO2 conversion and product selectivities were determined as follows: (1) CO 2 Conversion = mole converted CO 2 mole supplied CO 2 × 100 % (2) CO selectivity = mole produced CO mole ( ∑ produced CO + CH 4 + 2 C 2 + 3 C 3 + 4 C 4 × 100 % (3) CH 4 selectivity = mole produced CH 4 mole ( ∑ produced CO + CH 4 + 2 C 2 + 3 C 3 + 4 C 4 × 100 % (4) Selectivity of C 2 − C 4 = 100 % − CO selectivity − CH 4 selectivity (5) Selectivity of total hydrogenations HC = 100 % − CO selectivity Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and three parallel measurements were made every time, and the average result is presented. When a large difference among the data occurred, the experiment was repeated at least three times."
6,Catalyst characterization,2.5 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was determined on a Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA with 2θ ranging from 10 to 90° at a scan rate of 8°/min.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synergy of plasma and catalysis,"3.1 Synergy of plasma and catalysis CO2 conversion and product selectivities in the plasma-induced hydrogenation in the absence and presence of ZSM-5-supported metal catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . It is illustrated that CO2 was hydrogenated into CO and H2O at a conversion of 8.1% in the DBD plasma without packing material in the gap, suggesting that plasma is able to drive the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. De la Fuente et al. [5] found that the RWGS reaction took place significantly in a microwave plasma reactor. The optical emission spectroscopy measurements revealed that the main species in the plasma were H and O atoms. De Bie et al. [30] estimated the spatially and time averaged radical densities as a function of the initial CO2 composition in the CO2/H2 gas mixture in a DBD plasma using a one-dimensional fluid model. It was shown that H and O atoms were the most abundant species in the DBD plasma. The dissociation energy of H2 (4.4 eV) is lower than that of CO2 (5.5 eV), and both are readily dissociated in a DBD plasma (1–10 eV): (6) CO 2 + e ‐ → CO + O ˙ + e ‐ (7) H 2 + e ‐ → 2 H ˙ + e ‐ Subsequently, H and O radicals will react to produce water: (8) 2 H ˙ + O ˙ → H 2 O When the ZSM-5 solid was packed in the gap, CO2 conversion increased to 25%, which is over four times that without the packing material. Similarly, only CO was produced and no hydrocarbons were detected. The remarkable enhancement of CO2 conversion might be attributed to the adsorption of active species on the solid surface and the trapping of electrons in the pores of porous ZSM-5. The weak chemisorption can sufficiently increase the lifetime of the incoming species, whereas the trapped electrons are able to act as an electron reservoir and to generate surface streamers. Among ZSM-5-supported metal catalysts, Cu/ZSM-5 did not promote the formation of any hydrocarbons but Fe/ZSM-5 and Mo/ZSM-5 facilitate the formation of methane. For Co/ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5, both the CO2 conversion (six times that without packing material) and hydrocarbons formation were significantly enhanced. Remarkably, C2+-hydrocarbons including olefins were produced on Co/ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5, in addition to CH4. Ni/ZSM-5 had the highest selectivity of total hydrocarbons (90.5%), while Co/ZSM-5 gave the highest C2-C4 selectivity (13.7%) with an alkene/alkane ratio of 0.23. The C2-C4 hydrocarbons produced on Co/ZSM-5 consisted of 10.1% C2, 2.3% C3 and 1.3% C4, whereas only C2-hydrocarbons were obtained on Ni/ZSM-5. The kinetics of thermal CO2 conversion is slow at low temperatures (<350 °C), even with highly effective catalysts [11,31,32], whereas thermodynamic limitations make it impossible to obtain high CO2 conversion at high temperatures [16]. In a typical thermal catalytic process, CO2 conversion was generally in the range of 10–30% [17,18,32]. In the present work, a much higher CO2 conversion (>45%) was achieved by Ni/ZSM-5 and Co/ZSM-5 in the DBD plasma reactor at <200 °C. It is apparent that a significant synergy between plasma and the catalyst particles packed in the discharge gap exists. CO is generally regarded as the main intermediate in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. When CO is adsorbed on the metal active sites, it is possibly hydrogenated to hydrocarbons as in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [9,33]. The production of hydrocarbons might include the following steps: (i) adsorption of CO and H, (ii) dissociation of CO, (iii) formation of monomer, (iv) monomer coupling (chain growth), and (v) hydrogen addition/abstraction to/from CxHy intermediates on the active sites [31]. Both Ni and Co are catalytic active phases for the methanation of CO, and the plasma-generated CO and H atoms are apparently favorable to the formation of CH4 and other CHx species on supported Ni and Co catalysts. To further investigate the synergetic roles of plasma and the packed catalyst, two different reactor configurations were set up, separating the catalyst bed from the plasma zone. Co/ZSM-5 was chosen as the catalyst, because it showed high CO2 conversion and high yield of C2-C4 hydrocarbons. When the catalyst bed was located downstream, immediately below the plasma zone, the conversion of CO2 was reduced to 34.3%, but this was much higher than the value obtained without catalyst in the gap (8.1%). It may suggest that the activated species in the plasma zone continued to react in the downstream catalyst bed. In addition, the selectivity to CH4 (97.8%) was increased, whereas that of CO was decreased (2.2%), and no C2-C4 was detected in the effluent gas stream. These results imply that Co/ZSM-5 catalyst led to the formation of hydrocarbons from plasma-generated active species, such as CO and H atoms. When the catalyst bed was located downstream, below the plasma zone with a distance of 1 cm, the conversion of CO2 dropped dramatically to 13.9%, and only CO was detected in the effluent. It appears that the average life time of the majority of the activated species in the plasma zone was probably shorter than 0.38 s. Lee et al. [34] confirmed that the excited and ionized hydrogen atoms were the primary accelerators in the plasma-assisted CO2 methanation reaction. The fact that no C2-C4 hydrocarbons were formed, when the DBD plasma and Co/ZSM-5 catalyst were separated, confirms that C2-C4 hydrocarbons were produced due to the synergy of the DBD plasma with Co/ZSM-5 catalyst. The dissociation energies of CH4 to CH3, CH2, CH and C are 8.8, 9.4, 12.5 and 14.0 eV, respectively [35]. As a result, the following electron impact dissociation might probably occur in the DBD plasma, whose energy level is in the range of 1–10 eV: (9) CH 4 + e ‐ → ˙ CH 3 ⋅ H ˙ + e ‐ (10) CH 4 + e ‐ → ˙ CH 2 ⋅ H 2 ˙ + e ‐ The recombination and propagation of the generated CH3 and CH2 radical species may be responsible for the production of C2-C4 hydrocarbons. It has been reported that non-oxidative coupling of CH4 in DBD plasma produced C2-C4 hydrocarbons, including alkanes, alkenes and alkynes [35]."
9,Influence of reaction conditions on catalyst performance,"3.2 Influence of reaction conditions on catalyst performance To further study the performance of Co/ZSM-5 catalyst in the DBD plasma reactor, the effects of reaction conditions, including the feed gas composition (H2/CO2 mole ratio), the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the input power were investigated. Fig. 2 shows the effect of H2/CO2 molar ratio in the feed on the CO2 conversion and product selectivities. CO2 conversion monotonically increases with H2/CO2 ratio in the range 1 to 4. The selectivity to CH4 increases simultaneously as CO2 conversion is increased. The selectivity to C2-C4 hydrocarbons did not change markedly, and a maximum is observed at H2/CO2 ratio of 3. In addition, the alkene/alkane molar ratio in the C2-C4 hydrocarbons varied with H2/CO2 in a similar way. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of CO2 conversion, product selectivity and alkene/alkane ratio on GHSV. It is indicated that CO2 conversion did not change noticeably in the 3500–6000 h−1 range, suggesting that the plasma-induced catalytic CO2 hydrogenation proceeded promptly. The selectivity to CH4 increased slightly with GHSV, whereas that of C2-C4 hydrocarbons decreased monotonically. These results may suggest that short residence times might be unfavorable for the chain-growth reaction in the formation of C2-C4 hydrocarbons. Additionally, the alkene/alkane ratio did not change noticeably with GHSV. The effect of the input power on the performance of plasma-induced CO2 hydrogenation on Co/ZSM-5 is presented in Fig. 4 . CO2 conversion did not change significantly when the input power was increased from 11 to 16.5 W, indicating that the dissociation of CO2 and that of H2 by plasma were highly efficient, and subsequent reaction steps were not affected considerably by plasma. With increasing the input power, the selectivity to CH4 decreased monotonically, whereas that of C2-C4 hydrocarbons increased simultaneously. This suggests that CH4 might be the primary product and the C2-C4 hydrocarbons might be originated partly from the dissociation of CH4. The alkene/alkane ratio passed through a maximum when the input power was raised. The lower alkene/alkane ratio at high input power might be attributed to an enhanced hydrogenation pathway."
10,Active phase of Co/ZSM-5 catalyst,"3.3 Active phase of Co/ZSM-5 catalyst Fig. 5 shows the variation of CO2 conversion and product selectivities with time on stream for Co/ZSM-5-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation in the DBD reactor. In the initial 4 h, CO2 conversion, C2-C4 selectivity and the molar ratio of alkene/alkane in C2-C4 hydrocarbons decreases with time, whereas those of CO and CH4 are increased. After 4 h, the reaction system reaches a steady-state, and CO2 conversion and product selectivities become constant. Fig. 6 presents XRD patterns of Co/ZSM-5 as fresh and spent catalyst. It is shown that Co3O4 crystal phase was present in the Co/ZSM-5 catalyst. After reduction by H2 plasma, diffraction peaks characteristic of Co3O4 disappear, while the characteristic peaks of metallic cobalt appear as cubic (PDF#15-0806) and hexagonal (PDF#05-0727) phases. After CO2 hydrogenation, the cubic Co remains, whereas diffraction peaks characteristic of hexagonal Co disappear, suggesting that cubic Co is more stable than hexagonal Co. The phase change of supported Co metal particles might be linked with the slight decline of the activity in the initial stage of reaction."
11,Conclusions,"Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation was significantly enhanced in a DBD plasma reactor over ZSM-5 supported metals. A variety of products were obtained depending on the supported metal. Cu/ZSM-5 did not promote the formation of any hydrocarbons, Fe/ZSM-5 and Mo/ZSM-5 yielded only methane, whereas Ni/ZSM-5 and Co/ZSM-5 promote the formation of C2-C4 hydrocarbons. Co/ZSM-5 showed the highest yield of C2-C4 hydrocarbons with an alkene/alkane ratio of 0.23. The formation of C2-C4 hydrocarbons might be attributed to the significant synergy between the DBD plasma and Co/ZSM-5 catalyst. Plasma initiates the dissociation of CO2 and H2, while the catalyst promotes the reaction path towards the formation of hydrocarbons. XRD measurements of the fresh and spent Co/ZSM-5 catalyst revealed that cubic Co metal was the stable active phase for the selective CO2 hydrogenation reaction to lower hydrocarbons in the DBD plasma reactor."
