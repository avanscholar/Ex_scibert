0,Introduction,"The excessive use of fossil fuels, especially petroleum, has caused serious environment pollution, despite of possessing with the strengths of high energy density and convenient transportation [1–4]. Due to the above concerns, the global demand for renewable clean fuels for the energy and environmental sustainability are expected to increase greatly in the future [5,6]. Nowadays, hydrogen is considered as the most attractive energy carrier since zero pollution [7–10]. But, hydrogen is known as an energy carrier rather than an energy source, which should be produced from other primary energy sources (such as hydrocarbons). Therefore, hydrogen production from hydrocarbons have became a research hot spot in recent decades. Steam reforming, partial oxidation reforming, autothermal reforming, and CO2 reforming have been widely investigated as primary processes for converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen [11–13]. Catalytic steam reforming is the most efficient process to complete this conversion. Currently, over 50% of the world’s hydrogen supply is from steam reforming of hydrocarbons [14]. n-decane is a kind of hydrogen carrier with high-energy density; catalytic steam reforming of n-decane is a promising path for hydrogen production due to its high hydrogen yield [15,16]. But, n-decane steam reforming is a complex process compared with some low-carbon hydrocarbons (such as alcohols, ethers) steam reforming, which is easily influenced by the nature of catalysts and the reaction conditions [9,17]. On the one hand, CC and CH bond of n-decane cleavage need a higher temperature than that of low-carbon hydrocarbons. On the other hand, carbon deposition of n-decane reforming is easier to generate than that of low-carbon hydrocarbons reforming [18,19]. Therefore, the catalysts used for n-decane steam reforming reaction should simultaneously keep adequate stability and anti-carbon ability at high temperature. Several catalytic systems based on noble and transition metals are considered to be effective for hydrocarbons steam reforming towards hydrogen [20–27]. Although the noble metal catalysts (Ruthenium, Rhodium, Platinum) have high CH bond scission activity, the applicability can be reduced on account of the high cost and limited availability [26,27]. Observation shows that there is a great interest in catalysts development over transition metals catalysts due to the advantage of the lower cost, better availability and higher activity [20–25], especially Ni-based and Co-based catalyst. In recent years, alumina supported Co or/and Ni catalysts have already attracted extensive attention due to their high activity for a variety of reforming reactions [24,26,28,29]. Although Co- or/and Ni-alumina catalysts are favorable in CC cleavage, showing high activity and hydrogen selectivity, their stability are not good enough due to sintering of active components and deactivation caused by carbon deposition [30–33]. In order to inhibit carbon deposition and prevent the active component of sintering, many researchers introduced another active species into Ni- or Co- alumina catalyst by various techniques to form bimetallic catalysts [34–39]. Wang et al. [34] introduced Pd into Ni supported on alumina catalysts and investigated the catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts. The results demonstrated that the addition of Pd obviously improve the thermal stability of Ni alumina catalyst. Vizcaino et al. [40] found that Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst showed better anti-coke ability compared with monometallic Ni catalyst. Adding Cu can improve the process for eliminating the deposited carbon. Resini et al. [41] found that bi-metallic catalyst of Ni-Co/hydrotalcites exhibited better anti-sintering ability than mono-metallic Ni. The introduction of cobalt increased the dispersion state of nickel. Unfortunately, despite adding another active species can decrease the amount of carbon deposition as well as strengthen their stability, the activity more or less have a reduction [42,43]. Under the circumstances, how to introduce two active species synchronously into alumina support to create synergetic effect, in order to remit the above two problems (sintering of the active components and carbon deposition) is a great challenging work. In our previous works [15,43], the rare earth Ce promoters have been introduced into alumina by co-precipitation method, in order to maintain the larger surface areas and improve the thermal stability of Ni/Al2O3. Typically, Ce as an effective promoter can increase the dispersion of Ni, which is helpful for improving the activity and stability of Ni-alumina catalyst [36,43–45]. On the other hand, in order to improve the catalytic activity at relatively lower temperature (550–650°C) and anti-carbon ability, we have introduced transition metal M (Fe, Co, Cu, Zn) into the Ni/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst [15]. Clearly, Co doped Ni/Ce-Al2O3 showed a better catalytic activity at lower temperature and carbon-resistant effect. In addition, the amount of promoters M and active species Ni did not exceed the monolayer saturation capacity of the Ce-Al2O3 support. With this background, in this contribution we study the effect of Co addition (as another active species) on the behaviour of Ni catalyst supported on Ce-Al2O3 for n-decane reforming. Careful investigation of the structure of catalysts were done in an attempt to establish a relationship between catalytic activity and the changes in textural, structural and morphological properties induced by Co addition to Ni catalysts. This work provided some positive suggestions for catalysts preparation and optimization by studying the structure-activity correlations."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Ce-Al2O3 composite oxides (5wt.% Ce) support was prepared by co-precipitation method, and the complete experimental procedure is detailed in [3,15]. Monometallic Ni or Co catalyst (Ni/Ce-Al2O3, Co/Ce-Al2O3, 10wt.% Ni, Co) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Ce-Al2O3 support with aqueous solutions of the corresponding metal precursors Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, respectively. The impregnated samples were dried at 120°C, and finally calcined at 800°C for 4h. Co-Ni bi-metallic catalyst (Co-Ni/Ce-Al2O3, 5wt.% Ni and 5wt.% Co) was prepared by co-impregnation mothed, and the preparation process as monometallic Ni or Co catalyst. Finally, the Ce-Al2O3, Ni/Ce-Al2O3, Co/Ce-Al2O3 and Co-Ni/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts were made into columnar particles, and marked as CA, NCA, CCA, and CNCA, respectively. The catalysts dosages were all 3.0±0.05g."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorptione-desorption (BET method), XRD, IR, Raman and SEM-EDS according to the procedure described in our previous work [15,16]."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test To evaluate the catalytic activity of these catalysts, n-decane catalytic reforming was chosen as the probe reaction. Steam reforming experimental apparatus consists of a liquid reactants feeding unit, a tubular fixed-bed quart reactor (12mm i.d.) loaded with 3.0g catalyst, and heating systems, the condenser, and a analysis unit [15,16], and the schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 1 . A mixture vapors of n-decane and water was fed in the reactor after preheating and uniform mixing. The volumetric feed flow of water and n-decane are both 2.5mL/min. The temperature of preheaters were both kept at 350°C, and the temperature of reactor was varied from 650 to 800°C at the range of 50°C to evaluating the catalysts activity. Each catalytic performance test was taken at a time-on-stream of 2h. Gas phase products were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs: (1) GC-2010, (SHIMADZU Co., Ltd.), equipped with a HP-Al/S separation capillary column and flame ionization detectors for analyzing CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C3H6, C4; (2) SP-2100A, (Beijing Beifen-Ruili analytical instruments Co., Ltd.), was used to separate H2, CO and CO2 with a TDX-01 packed column and a thermal conductivity detector. Solid products deposited covering the catalyst were investigated by Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), the characteristics signals of CO and CO2 were tested by IR analyzer. Activity data were reported as n-decane conversion X A (%), and H2, CO and CO2 selectivity (Si), which are defined as follows: (1) X A ( % ) = Δ m A m A , in = m A , in - m A , out m A , in × 100 (2) S i = moles P i ∑ i = 1 n moles P i × 100 % where i represents the different gas products detected."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance 3.1.1 n-decane conversions and H2 selectivity Fig. 2 (a)–(d) lists the selectivity of H2, CO x (CO and CO2), and the conversion of reactant over mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts after reforming reactions. It can be seen that the selectivity of H2, CO x and conversion over the mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts are all increased with the addition of Ni or/and Co at the range of 650–800°C. Meanwhile, the numerical value progressively increased with the temperature. It is worth noting that the doped of mono- Co or Ni into CA obviously accelerated the rate of steam reforming reaction, improved yields of H2 and CO x as well as the n-decane conversion. Moreover, the synchronous additions of Co-Ni further enhanced the catalytic activity compared with the values over mono- Co or Ni catalyst, suggesting that the introduction of Co could provide sufficient Ni active sites for the reactants. Meanwhile, the H2 selectivity over bi-metallic CNCA catalyst are increased by 0.4, 1.4, 1.3 and 0.75 folds at 650, 700, 750, 800°C separately relatived to the values over CA, and the result of 74.0% is almost the same with the value over Co/CeO2 catalyst [36]. This indicated that active components Co and Ni were strongly interacted with support, while produced obvious synergy between Co and Ni. The results are consistent with the results of catalysts characterization. 3.1.2 Thermal stability and regeneration of CNCA Fig. 3 shows the thermal stability of the mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts at 800°C. The time-on-stream at 800°C was used to weigh the stand or fall of the catalysts stability. It can be seen that the H2 selectivity and n-decane conversion over CA catalyst is gradually decreased in an hour, over NCA catalyst is gradually decreased in two hours, over CCA catalyst is gradually decreased in six hours. However, the H2 selectivity (∼74% at 800°C) and n-decane conversion (100% at 750°C and 800°C) kept in a horizontal line within eight hours for CNCA catalyst. So the CNCA catalyst has good stability at higher temperature than others. Carbon deposition on used CNCA catalyst was removed by enriched oxygen calcination, and the regenerated performance of the CNCA catalyst was assessed again in the reaction vessel. The catalyst regeneration experiment was carried out again in the same reactor as the fresh ones, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . It is found that the n-decane conversions and H2 selectivity over the reused-1 (-2) CNCA catalyst are approximately equal to the results of fresh one. Therefore, the CNCA catalyst is renewable. 3.1.3 Carbon deposition The amount of carbon deposition over these catalysts were quantified by the TPO analysis and the results are shown in Table 2. The results presents that the amount of carbon deposition are different with each other as the introduction of different active species. Clearly, the amount of carbon deposition over CA catalyst is larger than others. Fortunately, the value decreased with the addition of Ni or/and Co, especially with the synchronous addition of Co and Ni (11.6 to 5.17mg/g-fuel). It may be caused by adding moderate Co can reduce the cracking, isomerization, hydrogen transfer reaction, and other side effects, decreasing the carbon deposition generation. Its possible reason is that the addition of these metals reduces the acidity of the CA catalyst and carbon dioxide adsorption, and inhibits the carbon monoxide decomposition reaction resulting in carbon resistance [16]. According to reports in the literature, the adding Co increased the dispersion state of nickel, prevented metal sintering and carbon deposition via controlling Ni particle size and dispersion [41]. For the bi-metallic CNCA catalyst, the amount of carbon deposition, which is much less than conventional Ni-alumina catalysts. Obviously, the bi-metallic CNCA catalyst not only possesses the optimal catalytic activity, but also has excellent coking inhibition performance."
7,Textural properties of mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts,"3.2 Textural properties of mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts Table 1 shows the BET surface area of fresh and used CA, mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts. All the fresh catalysts possesses excellent total surface areas (more than 145.0m2/g), and no sintering took place after 800°C calcination. Larger surface area is conducive to improving active sites dispersion, preventing the sizes of active component growth, reducing the active sites sintering [46]. So, the larger total surface areas of mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts is responsible for theirs superior catalytic activity. A slightly reduction in surface area and pore volume is observed for all samples after the introduction of Ni or/and Co. The loss can be attributed to the incorporation of active ions in the CA support after impregnation. In addition, the amount of active species Ni or Co or Ni-Co did not exceed the monolayer saturation capacity of the support, so that the surface area and pore volume of the catalysts had little change. The results suggest that all the active ions impregnated homogeneously on the CA support. On the other hand, the surface areas of all used catalysts decreased after the reforming reactions. CA and NCA catalyst reduced by 56% and 44% compared with the fresh ones, respectively. However, the values of CCA and CNCA just dropped by 21% and 15%, respectively. Co as the active species showed a better carbon-resistant effect than Ni."
8,XRD analysis,"3.3 XRD analysis Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh CA, mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts. It is found that all the samples present similar diffraction peaks. The relative intensities of the peaks of all the spectra of catalysts appeared at 2θ=45.7°, 66.8° correspond to γ-Al2O3 crystallite, the peaks at 2θ value of 28.5°, 56.3° can be attributable to the different planes of cubic fluorite structural CeO2, while 2θ=34.7°, 49.8° and 59.2° assigned to the Ce crystallite by Bragg’s refections [15,16]. All the samples have a broad and dispersion XRD patterns, which is indicating that the crystallization of all the fresh catalysts are smaller (800°C, less than 45%). The research reported by Bartholomew et al. [47], the increase of crystallinity would led to the decrease of the catalysts surface with concurrent reducing the catalytic activity. In present work, we introduced ceria species into Al2O3, which can effectively prevent the support phase transformations and crystallization, in order to improve thermal stability of the catalysts. The results are consistent with the literatures and our previous works [15,16,48–50]. Prior to active species loading is modified with Ce in order to increase the surface area and inhibit the phase transformations is a excellent way to improve thermal stability of catalysts. The possible crystalline phases in the mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts calcined at 800°C are CoO x , CoAl2O4, NiO, NiAl2O4, CeO2 and γ-Al2O3. However, the diffraction peaks owing to crystalline NiAl2O4, CoAl2O4, CoO x and NiO did not appear in the spectra of catalysts, suggesting that the CoO x and NiO particles size are quite small (less than 4nm in diameter) which are not easy to be detected by XRD [51]. In addition, the synchronous addition of Co and Ni on CA support will results in some Co or Ni ions are replaced each other. Co-impregnation Ni and Co did not cause the stack of active component, nor generate Ni-Co alloy phase. At high temperature, the interface between metal particles and support will restructure, which should tend to let the interaction between them stronger and resultantly lower the interface energy. Comparing with the single metal particle, the restructuring should lead to lower interface energy and stronger interaction, for that two metals have more assembling possibilities. This indicated that CoO x and NiO species were strongly interacted with CA support, and all of the as-prepared have a good thermal stability, which is consistent with the results of surface area analysis [52,53]."
9,IR analysis,"3.4 IR analysis To obtain information about the surface chemical bonding of the catalysts, IR measurements were performed and the spectrum was shown in Fig. 6 . Distinctly, all the spectra show a broad band in the range of 3250–3750cm−1 and a weak band around 1640cm−1, and these two peaks are assigned to the stretching and deformation vibrations of the hydroxy, respectively [54,55], indicating that the interaction between hydroxyls groups and/or chemisorbed water on the CA support via hydrogen bonding [56]. Over all catalysts, a broad band with several weak shoulder peaks below 1000cm−1 is recorded, which is attributed to the characteristic vibrations of CeO and AlO [57,58]. In addition, the weak peak centred at 1384cm−1 can be attributed to the CA support and more specifically to the AlO flexing vibration band [59]. It can be seen that the peaks intensity increased with the addition of Ni and Co, which may own to more surface NiO and CoO x species migrate into the support lattice, suggesting that the interaction between the metal particle and the support is obviously enhanced. Moreover, the strong metal-support interactions caused by high calcination temperature could change the electron transfer between Ni-Co and Ce species."
10,Raman and SEM-EDS analysis,"3.5 Raman and SEM-EDS analysis The structure of carbon deposition was tested by the Raman spectroscopy and the results were shown in Fig. 7 . The results can be used for explaining the origins of the catalysts deactivation. It can be seen that all the curves contain two obvious major peak, which are belonged to the D-band (disorder related peak, ∼1300cm−1) and G-band (graphite related peak, ∼1600cm−1) of carbon, respectively. Many scholars [60,61] believe that the D-band can be considered as disordered carbon, while the G-band can be ascribed to ordered carbon which attributed to the in-plane carbon-carbon stretching vibrations. The ratio of peak area of D-band to G-band (ID/IG, the intensity of D-band/the intensity of G-band) can be used to describe the strength of the relationship between the two peaks and the graphitization degree of carbon deposition, the lower the graphitization degree of the carbon, the higher the ID/IG values [62,63]. It can be obviously found according to the Fig. 7 that the ID/IG values are larger than 1 for all the used samples, indicating plenty of defective carbon species. Moreover, the value of CA catalyst is 3.28, which is far higher than the mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts, suggesting the formation of a large number of disordered carbon. The addition of Ni and Co is conducive to the formation of the ordered carbon. The SEM images as shown in Fig. 8 were used to describe the micro-morphology of the carbon deposition over used catalysts. It can be seen that carbon deposition grows in different range of catalyst surface and take on the filamentous. The results are consistent with the mechanisms of filamentous carbon growth reported in literature [64]. Table 3 presents the EDS results of the actual content of kinds of metals of catalysts. The result shows that the mean actual content of Ni, Co and Ce on the fresh CA, NCA, CCA, CNCA catalysts are in close proximity to the catalyst composition design. However, the contents of these elements reduced in different degree with the completion of reaction. As the generation of filamentous carbon, active metals overflow constantly from the catalyst surface. The C content over used CA, NCA, CCA, CNCA catalysts are 91.14%, 63.90%, 33.64% and 13.43%, respectively. Obviously, the BET specific surface area decreased caused by the formation of carbon deposition is the main reason of the activity of CA catalyst and the thermal stability is lower than others."
11,Conclusions,"Series mono- and bi-metallic CNCA catalysts are prepared by co-precipitation technique in combination with impregnation for n-decane steam reforming. Compared to the CA and mono-metallic CNCA catalyst, the bi-metallic CNCA catalysts shows the higher catalytic activity, coinciding with its larger the H2 selectivity (74%), n-decane conversion (100%), and better anti-carbon ability. Meanwhile, long-term stability and the regeneration performance tests showed the CNCA catalyst was stable and capable of regeneration. The results were mainly interpreted on the basis of characterization studies, which revealed the significant role of texture and structure properties on reforming performance."
