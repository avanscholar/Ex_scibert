0,Introduction,"Activated carbon is an excellent and widely used catalyst carrier due to its low cost and structural stability under normal reaction conditions [1]. However, activated carbon itself has poor conductivity and often only has oxygen-containing groups that form a weak coordination structure with metals when preparing supported metal catalysts [2]. This may result in the inability to form a strong interaction between carbon carrier and the metal particles, but this strong interaction is often necessary to stabilize the metal species in the catalyst, especially when the catalytic reaction is carried out under severe conditions such as high temperature and high pressure. To solve this problem, introducing heteroatoms such as N atoms into the carbon carriers to prepare the N-doped carbon is an effective way to improve the performance of the carbon carriers. In recent years of researches, the role of N-doped carbon carrier is mainly explained in the following aspects: the intercalation of nitrogen in the carbon support results into the change in charge distribution of N-doped carbon making it electronically noble [3–5]. The electrons are pumped from N-doped carbon towards the metal nanoparticles via back donation to enhance the ability of the metal to adsorb and activate molecules. For example, it is easier for the N-doped carbon supported metal catalsyt to activate hydrogen into active hydrogen atoms in the hydrogenation system. As a consequence of the N-doping, the C-N defects and N interstitials serve as the nucleation sites for the metal, improving the metal dispersion, stability and resistance to agglomeration [6–8]. And the transition metals based N-doped carbon hybridized materials (MNCs) have shown excellent catalytic effects in electrochemical oxygen reduction/evolution reactions [9], photocatalytic and thermocatalytic organic transformations (oxidation, hydrogenation, and dehydrogenation), etc [10–13]. However, the traditional methods of preparing N-doped carbon materials often involve introducing foreign N sources such as NH3 and melamine into the carbon source, or sacrificing a pre-designed N-containing template [14]. These preparation methods are relatively complex and also produce some pollutants [15]. In contrast, pyrolysis of some N-containing substances that exist in nature, even some solid wastes, also has the potential to directly prepare N-doped carbon materials. For example, Advani et al. used natural N-containing waste chitosan as the catalyst carrier via pyrolysis treatment and then loading Pd to prepare the Pd@N-C nanocatalyst. The results proved that the nitrogen in chitosan played the role of supporting metal Pd nanoparticles. The catalyst has excellent activity in the hydrogenation reaction of various unsaturated bonds [6]. This sustainable development idea of using biological waste to prepare N-doped carbon deserves more consideration. In the pharmaceutical field, antibiotic fermentation residue (AFR) is the main by-product remaining in the culture medium after antibiotics are extracted. It is mainly composed of residual medium, mycelium, microbial metabolites and residual antibiotics that are not completely extracted [16]. On average, 8–10 tons of AFR can be produced for every ton of antibiotics production. Since AFR contains antibiotic residues, it is a common hazardous solid waste, which may lead to bacterial resistance and harm human health. On the other hand, AFR contains abundant carbon and nitrogen elements, and it is a potential biological carbon resource due to its large production. How to reasonably and valuably use this type of hazardous organic solid waste is a practical problem that needs to be considered [17]. In recent years, there have been many methods of using AFR, such as hydrothermal treatment to convert it into the clean solid biomass fuel [18], anaerobic digestion technology to produce combustible gas [19], and composting technology [20]. Besides, AFR contains a large amount of crude protein components (20–50% in dry AFR), making AFR rich in the content of nitrogen elements. Because of this characteristic, AFR is often used as a nitrogen source. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that AFR can be used as the raw material to prepare N-doped carbon via pyrolysis, which is a potential approach for the valuable utilization of AFR and has not been reported before. The Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reaction is commonly used to convert carbonyl compounds into alcohols or their derivatives. Using isopropanol as hydrogen source under mild reaction conditions and no use of precious metal-based catalysts are the typical advantages of MPV reaction [21]. So far, many non-precious metal homogeneous catalysts have been applied to the transfer hydrogenation reaction of unsaturated functional groups, such as highly effective and soluble Fe, Cu, Zn, Co complexes [22–25]. Besides, there are some heterogeneous Fe, Co, Ni catalysts [26–28]. However, most non-noble metal catalyst systems need some additional basic additives, such as triethylamine, NaOH, KOt-Bu or some P-containing organic ligands to adjust the acidity and alkalinity sites of the catalyst and obtain higher product selectivity [29,30]. At present, there are relatively few cases of applying transition metals based N-doped carbon hybridized catalysts for MPV reactions. From the perspective of the reaction mechanism, N doped in the carbon support can serve as an important basic site for the MPV reaction [31,32]. In this study, we used the oxytetracycline fermentation residue (OFR) as the carbon and nitrogen source to prepare the N-doped carbon carrier by demineralization and sequent pyrolysis. The prepared N-doped carbon carrier was used to support the metal cobalt to construct the Co@OFR+C catalyst. Co@OFR+C was applied into the MPV reaction of ketones. Experimental results showed that Co@OFR+C has an excellent catalytic effect for biomass platform ethyl levulinate as well as other ketone substrates, and it could be reused for 8 cycles without obvious decreasing in the performances. Detailed characterizations were conducted to reveal the microstructures of the catalyst. The results showed that the doped N in the carrier can combine with Co to form a Co-N coordination structure, which acted as active sites during the catalytic process. This work offers a high-performance catalyst for transfer hydrogenations of ketones and provided a high-value utilization route of the OFR resource."

3,Preparation of the catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of the catalyst 20 mL ethylene glycol was added into a 100 mL beaker and 0.6 g CoCl2.6H2O was dissolved. In another 500 mL beaker, 20 mL ethylene glycol, 20 mL distilled water, 3 g NaOH, and 0.5 g OFR+C was added in sequence (for the preparation of OFR+C, see supporting information, page 2), and the slurry was magnetically stirred for 30 min under room temperature at 500 rpm. 40 mL hydrazine hydrate (80%) was added into the above 500 mL beaker as the reducing agent. Then the 20 mL glycol solution of CoCl2.6H2O was added dropwise into the above mixed solution under vigorous stirring at a constant temperature of 25 °C and the system was kept for 3 h. The solid precipitate was collected, washed with distilled water to pH neutrality, and dried overnight under vacuum at 80 °C. The pyrolysis temperature and Co loading were changed to investigate their effects on the activity of the catalyst. The preparation process included simple pyrolysis, loading, and reduction, as illustrated in Scheme 1 and labeled as Co@OFR+C-T-x (T: pyrolysis temperature, °C; x: Co loading, wt%)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a TEM JEOL-1011 with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The high-angle annular dark-filed scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were performed on a Talos F200X instrument Compared with the complex diffraction contrast and coherent imaging of conventional TEM, HAADF-STEM can more intuitively reflect the atomic information in the sample, with high resolution and low detection limit, which is suitable for observing the atomic distribution in the sample [33]. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a NOVA 4200e analyzer (Quantachrome Co. Ltd). The specific surface area was calculated by the BET method, and the mesopore volume was derived from the adsorption isotherm according to the DFT Mode. The DFT model is based on a collection of multiple theoretical isotherms. Each point on the isotherm corresponds to a specific pore size. These theoretical isotherms are developed using molecular simulation technology and are called density functional theory. When the DFT model faces a sample with the microporous structure, the accuracy of the calculated data is higher than that of other models [34]. All calculations were based on the adsorption isotherms. Temperature programmed adsorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was recorded on an AutoChem II 2920 TPD (Micromeritics USA) using 5% NH3 in helium gas. The powdered samples were pressed until reaching transparency and placed in a Pyrex glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a PHI-5400 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) at a pressure of 3 × 10−7 mbar using Al Kα as the excitation source (hν=1486.6 eV) and operating at 15 kV and 150 W. We used the highest peak position of standard C1s (284.6 eV) to correct all test elements. The Raman spectrum was collected on a Renishaw inVia microscope in the range of 200 cm−1−4000 cm−1 (λ = 532 nm). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powder were collected on a Rigaku D/tex Ultra 250 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°, the tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was carried out via Thermo Fisher Scientific iCAP 7000. The elemental compositions were determined using an Elementar Vario EL cube (Germany). The theoretical loading of cobalt is based on the mass of cobalt actually added during preparation divided by the sum of the mass of carrier and cobalt. Industrial analysis methods see the supporting information page 2."
5,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests The selective hydrogenation reactions of carbonyl compounds to alcohols or their derivatives were carried out in a 10 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer and using isopropanol as the solvent and hydrogen-donor. Isopropanol is one of the hydrogen sources with the most excellent transfer hydrogenation performance in the MPV reaction system [35]. Typically, EL (1 mmol), isopropanol (5 mL), and the catalyst (100 mg) were added into the reactor. The remaining air in the reactor with N2 was replaced, and 1 MPa N2 was filled as a protective gas. After that, the reactor was transferred to an oil bath under constant temperature with magnetic stirring and allowed to react at a preset temperature and time. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled down in the cold water to quench the reaction, and the slurry was diluted by isopropanol. The liquid samples were analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography (TECHCOMP GC7900) with a flame ionization detector using decane as the internal standard. The identification of the products was made by GC-MS (Agilent 7890B-7000D). To check the reusability of the Co@OFR+C catalyst, the solid catalyst were removed from the reaction system by centrifugation after quenching the reaction, washed three times with fresh isopropanol, and then reused for the next run without other treatment. All the experimental devices used were checked by repeating experiments for at least two times to obtain good operation stability during the experiment. The quantitative analysis of the reaction mixtures was repeated twice or three times to assure the accuracy of the data, and average values were used."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Activity of the catalysts,"3.1 Activity of the catalysts We chose the hydrogenation reaction of EL-GVL to investigate the ability of Co@OFR+C catalysts to catalyze MPV reaction. For comparison, the OFR and OFR+ were directly added into the reaction system as the catalysts. The results showed that neither OFR nor OFR+ could catalyze the MPV reaction ( Table 1, entries 2–3). The ability of Co@OFR+C catalysts was adjusted by changing the preparation conditions. There were three variables investigated, demineralization, pyrolysis temperature of OFR+, and cobalt loading. The results of the reaction were shown in Table 1 (entries 5–12). Firstly, Co@OFRC-800–20 prepared using OFR without demineralization had almost no MPV activity (entry 7). In contrast, Co@OFR+C-800–20 (entry 8) prepared from OFRC-800 after demineralization had excellent catalytic activity. Next, on the basis of using OFR+, we examined that the effect of changing the pyrolysis temperature of OFR+ on the catalytic ability of Co@OFR+C. The results were shown in entries 5–6, 8–10. At the pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, Co@OFR+C-600–20 had almost no catalytic ability. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the catalytic ability of Co@OFR+C also linearly increased, when the pyrolysis temperature reached to 900 °C, Co@OFR+C-900–20 had the most excellent catalytic ability, but further increased the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 °C, the catalytic ability of Co@OFR+C-1000–20 was significantly reduced. Finally, on the basis of using OFR+C-900 as the catalyst carrier, we adjusted the cobalt loading of the catalysts. The results were showed in the entries 9, 11–12. When the cobalt loading was 27.5 wt%, Co@OFR+C-900–30 had the best catalytic performance, with the highest turnover frequency (TOF). Through the investigation of the above three sets of variables, we found that the catalytic activity of the catalyst were closely related to the properties of the carrier. Next, we would investigate the structure of the catalysts through a series of characterizations to further explore this structure-activity relationship."
8,Characterizations of catalysts,"3.2 Characterizations of catalysts Before preparing the catalyst, some fundamental analysis about the OFR and OFR+ was conducted. According to the element analysis data (Table S1), the OFR was mainly composed of C, H, O elements, and there were also a large amount of N element (8.2%) and a small amount of P and S. The high nitrogen content comes from the crude protein content in the OFR. Through ICP analysis (Table S2) of the metal content of the OFR, it could be seen that a large amount of Ca (4.3 wt%) remained in OFR, which was resulted from the addition of CaCO3 as an auxiliary growth regulator during the production of oxytetracycline. In order to avoid CaCO3 affecting the catalyst preparation, the OFR was demineralized with 18 wt% HCl, and industrial analysis (Table S3) showed that the ash content was significantly reduced after HCl washing, proving most of the metal salts in the OFR were eluted. In addition, the carbon yield of the carbon carrier produced by OFR+ under each pyrolysis temperature were shown in Table S4. The cobalt content in each sample was detected by ICP-AES, and the results were showed in Table 1. The results showed that the cobalt loading could be basically the same as the theoretical cobalt loading calculated based on the cobalt dosage and the mass of the support. From this test result, it could be preliminarily inferred that the cobalt species may have a strong interaction with the OFRC/OFR+C instead of simply loading on surface of OFRC/OFR+C, which makes the cobalt supported stably on the carbon carrier. The content of cobalt in Co@OFR+C-1000–20 was lower than that under other lower temperature pyrolysis conditions, which may be due to the high pyrolysis temperature destroying the active components in the OFR+C-1000 that can effectively interact with Co, such as Nδ-. HRTEM was used to analyze the microscopic morphology of the catalysts. Firstly, we compared the Co@OFRC-800–20 with the Co@OFR+C-800–20. As shown in Fig. S1, compared with Co@OFR+C-800–20, in the HRTEM image of Co@OFRC-800–20, a dense network of lattice structure can be seen. By expanding the magnification, measuring the lattice spacing and comparing with the XRD library data, we found that this crystal form came from CaCO3 (JCPDS card No. 83-0577, 104, d= 0.303 nm). From the HRTEM image of Co@OFR+C-800–20, no CaCO3 crystals were observed, and it can be clearly seen that the cobalt nanoparticles were surrounded by a carbon shell with an outer diameter of 5–10 nm, and the cobalt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the OFR+C-800 carrier. This feature of metal nanoparticles being wrapped by a carbon shell and uniform dispersion may prevent the aggregation of active sites during the recycle of the catalyst, thereby improving the stability of the metal catalyst [36,37]. Next, we observed the morphology of Co@OFR+C-T-20 (prepared under different pyrolysis temperatures of OFR+C, Fig. S2 and Fig. S3). The cobalt nanoparticles in Co@OFR+C-600–20 and Co@OFR+C-700–20 showed a smaller particle size (6.3 ± 0.6 nm and 7.8 ± 0.5 nm, by randomly counting 200 particles, Fig. S4a, b) and a higher degree of dispersion. As the pyrolysis temperature raised to 800 °C, the particle size of the cobalt nanoparticles increased significantly to 17.1 ± 2.8 nm (Fig. S3a, b, Fig. S4c), and there was a core-shell structure between the cobalt species with the carbon shell. This may be because the N species in OFR+C formed a graphite nitrogen structure at 750 °C. The graphite nitrogen structure has been proven to effectively form a coordination effect with cobalt species [38–40]. The possible reasons for the increased in the particle size of Co nanoparticles and the binding mechanism of Co species with carbon carriers would be discussed in detail in the next section. With the further increasing of the OFR+C pyrolysis temperature, the cobalt nanoparticles size of Co@OFR+C-1000–20 significantly increased to 53.0 ± 7.7 nm (Fig. S3e, f, Fig. S4e). A suitable particle size of the metal cluster can help the mass transfer and electron transfer between the active site and the reaction system [37]. We have summarized the relationship between the particle size of Co@OFR+C-T-20 catalysts with the GVL yield, as shown in the Fig. S5. The result showed that the catalytic hydrogenation activity was closely related to the particle size of the Co nanoparticles. We then observed the Co@OFR+C-900–30 catalyst’s morphology and elemental distribution by HRTEM and high-angle annular dark-field transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The results were showed in Fig. 1, cobalt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the catalyst with a particle size of 15.5 ± 1.3 nm. The EDS mapping data (Fig. S6) showed that on the surface of Co@OFR+C-900–30, the Co content was about 6.7 wt%, and the actual total Co content in Co@OFR+C-900–30 was 27.5 wt% measured by ICP-AES. Combined with the phenomenon that the Co species were embedded in the carbon shell (Fig. 1a, b), we speculated that partial Co nanoparticles were covered by the carbon shell in the pore structure of Co@OFR+C-900–30, and partial cobalt existed on the surface without being totally covered by carbon shell. Fig. S7 and Table 1 (entries 7–8) compared the specific surface area and pore size distribution of Co@OFRC-800–20 with Co@OFR+C-800–20. The results showed that the surface area and pore volume of Co@OFRC-800–20 were much larger than those of Co@OFR+C-800–20. This was because the remaining CaCO3 in Co@OFRC-800–20 could play a role in promoting pore formation during the pyrolysis process [41,42]. At the same time, we analyzed the specific surface area and pore size of Co@OFR+C-600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000–20 (Fig. S8 and Table 1 (entries 5–6, 8–10)). The Co@OFR+C-800–20 possessed mixed micro-/mesoporous structure. Co@OFR+C-600, 700, 900 and 1000–20 were mainly composed of mesoporous structure. Regarding the BET surface area, the Co@OFR+C-800–20 sample showed the highest specific area (77.18 m2 g-1) compared to Co@OFR+C-600, 700, 900 and 1000–20. We would discuss in detail the causes of this phenomenon and the interrelationships between different characterization results in the next chapter. XRD was used to characterize the crystal structure of cobalt species. Firstly, for Co@OFRC-800–20 (Fig. S9), there were multiple sets of strong diffraction peaks at 29.4°, 35.9°, 39.3°, 43.2°, 47.5° and 48.5°, corresponding to CaCO3 (JCPDS card No. 83–0577). No obvious diffraction peak corresponding to cobalt species was found. Comparatively, in the XRD spectrum of Co@OFR+C-800–20, the three characteristic diffraction peaks at 41.7°, 44.4°, and 47.2° correspond to the (100), (002) and (101) crystal planes of hexagonal close-packed cobalt (hcp) (JCPDS card No.05–0727). The hcp structure is the most stable phase of cobalt crystals at room temperature [43]. No obvious diffraction peaks of CaCO3 or other minerals were observed, indicating the demineralization of the carbon carrier was efficient. Next, we investigated the changes of the XRD spectra of Co@OFR+C-T-20 with different pyrolysis temperatures of the carbon carrier ( Fig. 2a). It was difficult to observe the existence of typical crystal form of cobalt in Co@OFR+C-600–20. This may be due to the strong dispersion of Co species on the surface of Co@OFR+C-600–20. As the pyrolysis temperature of the OFR+C increased, for Co@OFR+C-700, 800, 900–20, the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 41.7°, 44.4°, and 47.2° belonging to the hexagonal cobalt structure (hcp) was gradually enhanced. However, when the OFR+C pyrolysis temperature was further increased to 1000 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peak attributed to cobalt was weakened again. This phenomenon indicated that the nature of the OFR+C that changed with the pyrolysis temperature could significantly affect the formation of cobalt crystals during the catalyst preparation process. In addition, no other crystal forms of cobalt were observed in the XRD spectrum. We then carried out XPS measurements to examine the composition and chemical state of the Co@OFR+C samples. The XPS surveys clearly showed the presence of C, N, Co and O elements for all samples (Fig. S10). Fig. 2b showed the high resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p for Co@OFR+C-900–20. Cobalt species almost completely existed in the form of Coδ+ in Co@OFR+C-900–20, with only a small amount of Co(0). By peak fitting, the small peak of 779.51 eV was assigned to Co(0), the main peak at 780.87 eV of Co 2p3/2 was assigned to CoO, and the peak at 782.79 eV was assigned to Co-N, which was derived from the strong coordination of Co species with electronegative N atoms in the OFR+C-900 [44,45]. The N 1s signal (Fig. 2c) for Co@OFR+C-900–20 could be deconvoluted into four types: pyridinic-N (398.6 eV, N1), pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV, N2), graphitic-N (401.6 eV, N3), and oxidized-N (403.2 eV, N4) [46]. Compared to Co@OFR+C-900–20, the N 1s spectra of the Co@OFR+C-600–20 sample could just be divided into two fitted peaks: pyridinic-N (398.6 eV, N1) and pyrrolic-N species (400.2 eV, N2) (Fig. S11b). We could conclude that the high pyrolysis temperature would facilitate the formation of N3 and N4 species. Also, the Co 2p3/2 of Co@OFR+C-600–20 (Fig. S11a) was almost comprised of Coδ+ (CoO), and also contained a small amount of Co(0). The Co 2p and N 1s spectra of Co@OFR+C-1000–20 were similar to Co@OFR+C-900–20 (Fig. S11c, d). Then, we analyzed the XPS spectra of O element for Co@OFR+C-600, 900, 1000–20. The results showed that the chemical environment of O 1s (Fig. S12) remained the same under the three catalysts, and the peak positions of the three groups of O 1s spectra were all at 532 eV, which were attributed to oxygen-containing species in carbon matrix [10]. This proved that the chemical environment of oxygen element was more stable than nitrogen element under the pyrolysis temperature of OFR+C above 600 °C. We next used Raman spectroscopy to further investigate the degree of graphitization and the existence form of cobalt species of the catalysts. Fig. 2d showed the Raman spectra of Co@OFR+C-600, 900, 1000–20. They all showed a D band at 1356 cm-1 and a G band at 1585 cm-1, among which D band represents the defect carbon site, and G band represents the graphitic carbon peak. The lower the peak intensity ratio of D to G peak, the higher the order of the carbon structure [47]. Co@OFR+C-600–20 showed the intensified and narrow peaks for D and G bands (ID /IG = 0.90), implying the highest degree of order of the carbon matrix among the three samples. The carbon matrix of Co@OFR+C-900–20 (ID/IG=0.97) was more disordered than that of Co@OFR+C-600–20, as also evidenced from the sharp decrease of the 2D band peak intensity (the broad peak, representing the degree of order of the carbon structure) [48]. This may be explained by the generation of more defects due to the removal of unstable atoms in carbon matrix after overheating. Notably, new peaks located at 468 and 663 cm−1 occurred for Co@OFR+C-900–20 and Co@OFR+C-1000–20 but not for Co@OFR+C-600–20. According to the previous literature, these peaks can be assigned to Co-N or CoO [49,50]. As cobalt oxides and Co(0) can be removed easily by washing with acidic solution, while Co-N sites can not be affected [51], the sample Co@OFR+C-900–20 was washed with 0.5 M HCl solution and further investigated by Raman analysis. The Raman spectrum for the acid-treated sample Co@OFR+C-900–20 showed the retained peaks (467 cm-1, 677 cm−1) (Fig. S13). Combined with the previous XPS analysis, we speculated that, cobalt species coexisted in the form of Co(0), Co-N, and CoO in Co@OFR+C-900–20. For Co@OFR+C-600–20, the correlation between Co species with nitrogen species may not be strong, or this kind of correlation was difficult to detect by Raman spectroscopy. The acidity and basicity of the catalysts were tested using NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, respectively. The results were showed in the Fig. S14, 15, 16 and Table S5, 6. The acidic and basic properties of the Co@OFRC-800–20 and Co@OFR+C-800–20 were compared. Both of them had certain acid and basic sites. However, the TPD spectrum showed that at the desorption temperature of around 700 °C, the intensity of the NH3 and CO2 desorption peak of Co@OFRC-800–20 were much stronger than that of Co@OFR+C-800–20. At the same time, the quantitative calculation results of specific acid-base sites also displayed that the content of acid-base sites of Co@OFRC-800–20 were much greater than that of Co@OFR+C-800–20. The results indicated that CaCO3 could affect the acidity and basicity of the catalysts during the catalysts preparation process. From Fig. S15, 16 and Table S5, 6, it could be seen that the acidic and basic properties of Co@OFR+C-600, 700–20 were much stronger than that of Co@OFR+C-800, 900, 1000–20. The acid-base sites of the catalysts Co@OFR+C-800, 900, 1000–20 tended to be stable. Among them, Co@OFR+C-900–20 had more medium-strong acid-base sites, and Co@OFR+C-1000–20 had more strong acid-base sites. The abundance in the medium-strong acid-base sites for Co@OFR+C-900–20 contributed greatly to its activity, which would be discussed in detail below."
9,Structure-activity relationship,"3.3 Structure-activity relationship Firstly, in the absence of a catalyst (Table1, entry 1), no conversion occurred. No product could be detected in the presence of the OFR, OFR+ and OFR+C-900 alone (entries 2–4). This showed that the cobalt species played a vital catalytic role in the process of catalyzing the MPV reaction. It's undeniable that the activity of a catalyst can be determined by many factors such as the number of active sites, mass and charge transport, and the adsorption type of the substrates, etc. In our case, the content of Co and N, specific surface area, pore size distribution, and the particles size of cobalt species could have impacts on the activity of the catalysts. And the acidity and basicity of the catalyst was also proved to play an important role in the MPV reaction [35,52]. It is very difficult to differentiate and assess the order of the importance of each factor for the activity. However, we could qualitatively analyze the influence of these factors on the activity of the catalysts based on the characterization results of the catalysts and the results of the catalytic experiment. 3.3.1 Demineralization Firstly, the Co@OFRC-800–20 using OFR as the support without deminerzliaztion had almost no MPV activity (Table1, entry 5). In contrast, Co@OFR+C-800–20 (Table1, entry 6) prepared using OFRC-800 after demineralization had excellent catalytic activity. Combining with the HRTEM image (Fig. S1) and the XRD (Fig. S9), we could see that during the pyrolysis of OFR at 800 °C, the remaining Ca species in OFR formed dense crystal CaCO3. This may hinder the coordination of the cobalt species with the basic groups of the OFRC-800, which could be proved by the different magnetic response behaviors of the two catalysts (Fig. S17). It could be clearly seen that when OFR+C-800 was used as the carrier, the resulting catalyst precipitate could be completely adsorbed on the magnetron due to the strong interaction between cobalt species with OFR+C-800 carrier, with the supernatant maintaining transparent. But on the contrary, when OFRC-800 was used as the carrier, a large amount of OFRC-800 carrier particles were still dispersed in the solution in the presence of magnetron, indicating that most of the cobalt particles were not combined with the carrier due to the weak interaction. In addition, from the analysis of the acidity and alkalinity of the catalysts (Fig. S14), the difference in the catalytic performance of the two catalysts could also be predicted according to catalytic mechanism. Excessive acidity and alkalinity could cause the carbonyl groups in the substrate to be firmly adsorbed on the catalyst, and it was not easy to desorb, which led to the failure of the hydrogen transfer process. 3.3.2 Pyrolysis temperature of OFR+C Next, we investigated the catalytic activity of Co@OFR+C-T-20 prepared under different pyrolysis temperatures of the carbon carrier (Table 1, entries 5–6, 8–10). The reaction results showed that the pyrolysis temperature of the carbon carrier would significantly affect the catalytic activity of Co@OFR+C-T-20. Under the same conditions of other preparations, Co@OFR+C-600–20 had almost no catalytic activity, but on the contrary, Co@OFR+C-900–20 had the best ability to catalyze EL-GVL reaction. The results of these reactions illustrated that the nature of the OFR+C carrier also played a vital role in the process of catalyzing the MPV reaction. Such difference in catalytic performance may be explained by the changes in the forms of Co, C, O and the microscopic morphology of Co@OFR+C-T-20 catalysts under different pyrolysis temperatures of the carbon carrier. 3.3.2.1 The chemical environment of Co, O, and N species Firstly, through ICP-AES (Table 1, entries 5–6, 8–10), we could observe the content of Co in Co@OFR+C-T-20 did not differ greatly, which indicated that the obvious difference in activity between Co@OFR+C-T-20 catalysts was not likely caused by the difference of Co loading. Next, we analyzed the chemical environment of the Co, O and N elements in Co@OFR+C-T-20 catalysts in detail. First of all, it could be seen from the XPS results that there were a large amount of Coδ+ in Co species regardless of whether it was under low-temperature pyrolysis (Co@OFR+C-600–20, Fig. S11a) or high-temperature pyrolysis (Co@OFR+C-900–20, Fig. 2b). The Co nanoparticles doped into the carbon carrier easily became electron-deficient when they contact with negatively charged atoms in the carbon carrier[39,53]. We could see from the XPS full spectrum analysis (Fig. S10) that the elements in Co@OFR+C-T-20 could provide electronegativity were O or N species. Among them, the information on the chemical environment of O species could be seen from XPS (Fig. S12). The chemical environment of O species in Co@OFR+C-T-20 remained stable regardless of low-temperature pyrolysis (600 °C) or high-temperature pyrolysis (1000 °C), and they all showed a typical peak centered at 532.0 eV, which were attributed to oxygen-containing species in carbon matrix [10]. This result indicated that O element was not the critical factor influencing the activity of the catalyst because its chemical environment did not change with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, we next mainly considered the changes in the properties of the N species as the pyrolysis temperature increased. From elemental analysis (Table 1) and XPS (Fig. 19b), it could be found that N species had undergone significantly changes in element content and existing form. In terms of content, Co@OFR+C-600–20 possessed a much higher N content (5.0 wt%) than that of Co@OFR+C-900–20 (1.2 wt%). From the form of existence, the peak position of the N 1s orbital had an obvious shift to the high position. In addition, at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, N species exist in the form of pyridinic-N (N1), and pyrrolic-N (N2), while at 900 °C, a certain amount of graphitic-N (N3), and oxidized-N (N4) appeared in Co@OFR+C-900–20. Graphitic-N could coordinate with cobalt to form the Co-N coordination structure, which could serve as the active site in the hydrogen transfer reaction [11,51,54,55]. N atoms provided lone pair electrons to coordinate with empty Co 3d orbitals (Lewis acid-base pair), thus promoting strong metal-support interactions [10,56,57]. In the MPV reaction, Lewis acid-base pairs often act as actual catalytic sites to adsorb substrate molecules [35,52]. Regarding our Co@OFR+C-900–30 catalyst, electron donation from Co nanoparticles to OFR+C-900 would take place, thus making N-neighbored carbon sites electron-enriched. In order to confirm this, XPS valence band spectra were performed and shown in Fig. S18. After the incorporation of metallic Co, the peaks of both N lone pair and C&N 2p π-bonding orbitals were intensified, indicating an increase of density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level. This could prove that an electron transfer indeed happens from Co nanoparticles to OFR+C-900, possibly via bridged N atoms (increased DOS as well) [10]. In addition, in our previous characterization, the Co-N coordination structure could be clearly found from 468 and 663 cm−1 peaks in the Raman spectrum of Co@OFR+C-900, 1000–20 (Fig. 2d). In Co@OFR+C-900–30, the existence of cobalt species in the carbon support was in the form of coated or semi-coated as previously analyzed by HRTEM (Fig. 1). Some outer cobalt nanoparticles that were not tightly covered by a carbon shell may be oxidized to CoO by oxygen when exposed to the air. The typical peaks attributed to CoO could also be seen in XPS (780.87 eV, Fig. 2b). Therefore, we speculated cobalt species may co-exist in the form of Co(0), Co-N structure, and CoO in Co@OFR+C-900–30. 3.3.2.2 Acidity and basicity analysis The acidity and basicity of the catalyst have been proved to play a vital role in the MPV reaction. Therefore, the analysis of the acidity and basicity of Co@OFR+C-T-20 may directly find the connection between the active site with the catalytic activity. Firstly, the strength of strong acid-base sites in Co@OFR+C-600, 700–20 was much stronger than that in Co@OFR+C-800, 900, 1000–20 (Fig. S15, 16). Excessive acid-base strength may hinder the desorption of the product, thereby hindering the occurrence of the hydrogen transfer process. The acidity of the catalyst may come from the coordinated state of Coδ+ [58], and the basicity may come from the Nδ- sites in the carrier [59]. At the same time, Co@OFR+C-900–20 had strong desorption peaks of CO2 and NH3 at a desorption temperature of 510 °C (Fig. S16), which indicated that moderate acidity and alkalinity was predominant in the catalysts and were beneficial to the MPV reaction. To further examine the strength of these formed acid and base sites in Co@OFR+C-900–20, we used XPS to test the binding energy of Co 2p in Co@OFR+C-900–20 for comparison with CoO. The cobalt species in Co@OFR+C-900–20 were found to have a larger positive charge based on higher Co 2p3/2 binding energy (Fig. S19a), proving the relatively stronger Lewis acidity [58]. On the other hand, a lower basicity of nitrogen species in Co@OFR+C-900–20 was observed on the basis of a relatively higher N 1 s binding energy than Co@OFR+C-600–20 (398.6 and 400.2 eV vs 401.6 eV and 403.2 eV, Fig. S19b), corresponding to a weaker Lewis alkaline [57]. Relatively higher acid strength but lower base strength was speculated to be favorable for the transfer hydrogenation and the suppression of side reactions like condensation especially caused by strong basic species [60]. 3.3.2.3 Microscopic morphology We could also analyze the structure-activity relationship of Co@OFR+C-T-20 by combining the characterization data of the microscopic morphology with the catalytic activity (Table1, 5–6, 8–10). First of all, we could observe an interesting phenomenon through HRTEM, as the pyrolysis temperature of the carrier increased, there was a very obvious aggregation phenomenon of cobalt species. This was because the carbon-nitrogen species in OFR+ formed g-C3N4 with a higher degree of graphitization under low-temperature pyrolysis (300–750 °C) [39,61]. The surface morphology of this structure was relatively dense, making it difficult for foreign cobalt species to be doped into the carbon support, thereby hindering the formation of metal-nitrogen-carbon structure or the contact between the metal and carrier interface with the reaction system [61]. Therefore, in the HRTEM image of Co@OFR+C-600–20, it could be clearly seen that the cobalt exists on the surface of OFR+C-600 in the form of dispersed small particles. As the pyrolysis temperature of the OFR+C increased, the degree of graphitization of the carbon structure decreased, and the appearance of defect sites made it easy for the introduced cobalt species to enter into the pores of the OFR+C, existing in the carrier in the form of being semi-coated or fully coated. Therefore, we could see very obvious aggregation and coating of cobalt species in Co@OFR+C-800, 900, 1000–20. In addition, the reaction activity was also related to the particle size of the cobalt nanoclusters. We have summarized the relationship between the average cobalt species particle size of the five groups of catalysts in Co@OFR+C-T-20 with the catalytic yield, as shown in the Fig. S5. From the analysis of specific surface area, the specific surface area and cumulative pore volume of Co@OFR+C-T-20 showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, reaching the maximum for Co@OFR+C-800–20. Firstly, the increasing of the specific surface area at the pyrolysis temperature of 600–800 °C was consistent with the changes of the catalyst morphology in HRTEM. The rich pore structure was derived from the defects caused by the decrease of the graphitization degree of the carbon carriers. With the further increasing of the pyrolysis temperature of OFR+C, the specific surface area of Co@OFR+C-900, 1000–20 decreased significantly, which may be due to the collapse of the carbon skeleton structure of OFR+C. However, combining with the reaction results, Co@OFR+C-900–20 had better catalytic activity than Co@OFR+C-800–20, so we speculated that the performance of the catalyst was also influenced by other factors, not just the specific surface area. Raman spectroscopy showed that as the pyrolysis temperature of OFR+C increased, the degree of graphitization of the carbon carrier in Co@OFR+C-T-20 decreased significantly, which was consistent with our previous inferences. 3.3.3 Cobalt loading and blank control experiment We investigated the influence of cobalt loading on the catalytic activity (entries 9, 11–12, Table 1) and the results showed that increasing the cobalt loading to 27.5 wt%, Co@OFR+C-900–30 could achieve the best reaction activity (150 °C, 3 h, EL conversion: 96.7%, GVL yield: 81.7%). With further increasing the theoretical cobalt loading to 32 wt%, the conversion increased slightly, but the GVL yield decreased. Next, we replaced OFR+C with pure carbon powder, and used the same preparation method to prepare Co@C-30 catalyst as a blank control experiment to investigate whether the N element in hydrazine hydrate could interact with Co to form active sites. The results were shown in the Table 1, entry 13, Co@C-30 could not catalyze the MPV reaction. Finally, we investigated the catalytic performance of several different forms of cobalt species without carriers (entries 14–17). The results showed that CoCl2.6H2O, CoO, Co3O4, and the Co(0) could not be used as the efficient catalyst for the EL-GVL reaction, indicating the key role of the N-doping carrier for the MPV reaction. In our MPV catalytic system, the effect of N-doping carbon on catalytic activity may have the following aspects: the intercalation of nitrogen in the carbon support results into the change in charge distribution of N-doped carbon making it electronically noble [3–5]. The Co-N coordination structure formed between N-doping carbon with Co provides the Lewis acidity and basicity which is essential for the MPV reaction, and the doped N element mainly provides the Lewis basicity [11,35,51–55]. As a consequence of the doping of N and the increasing of the pyrolysis temperature of the N-doped carbon carrier, the C-N defects and N interstitials serve as the nucleation sites for the cobalt nanoparticles, improving the metal dispersion, stability and resistance to agglomeration [6–8,36,37]. In summary, we believed that both the Co(0) species and the appropriate Lewis acidity and basicity provided by the Co-N coordination structure were the two key factors determining the catalytic activity of Co@OFR+C catalysts."
10,Reaction performance and substrate expansion of Co@OFR+C-900–30,"3.4 Reaction performance and substrate expansion of Co@OFR+C-900–30 Next, we further investigated the catalytic reaction conditions, recyclability and the universality of the Co@OFR+C-900–30 catalyst for the ketone substrates. Under the optimized reaction conditions (Co@OFR+C-900–30, 150 mg; El 1 mmol; 150 °C; 3 h), the GVL yield could achieve to 91% (Fig. S20). The Co@OFR+C-900–30 could be reused 8 times, and the catalytic performance remained stable (Fig. S21). Detailed discussion was given in the supporting information. We then tried to use Co@OFR+C-900–30 for MPV conversion of various ketone substrates, and the results were shown in Table 2. Except for p-chloroacetophenone, other ketone substrates could be successfully hydrogenated, which proved that Co@OFR+C-900–30 had a certain universality of ketone substrates. Regarding p-chloroacetophenone, it may be due to the existence of the electron withdrawing group Cl, which reduced the electron cloud density of the para-carbonyl group and led to an increase in its positive charge, so that it was not easy to be attacked by H in the reaction system."
11,Analysis of probable reaction mechanism,"3.5 Analysis of probable reaction mechanism We further discussed the probable reaction mechanism of Co@OFR+C-900–30 catalyst when catalyzing the MPV reactions based on the experimental results and the reported literatures. The first thing that needed to be clarified was the existence form of cobalt species in the carbon carrier. As inferred in Section 3.3, cobalt species coexist in the form of Co(0), Co-N and CoO. Among them, Co(0) came from the reduction of cobalt salt by hydrazine hydrate, and Co-N came from the coordination of Co with N element in the carrier. Through HRTEM, we could find that the cobalt species were coated or semi-coated in the carbon shell in the form of nanoparticles. Part of the cobalt existing on the surface of the carbon shell may be oxidized to CoO by air. We simulated the diagram structure of active site of Co@OFR+C-900–30 catalyst, as shown in the Fig. 3. We next combined the existing literature to speculate the possible reaction mechanism. First, the MPV reaction is a hydrogen transfer reaction using isopropanol as a hydrogen source. The activation of hydrogen in isopropanol is an important step in the reaction process. Among them, Co(0) has the ability to activate isopropanol. Since the energy of the 4s orbital in the ground state electron orbital arrangement of Co(0) is lower than the 3d orbital, the electrons preferentially fill the 4s orbital, and the 3d orbital is underfilled. Under this state, the phenomenon of ""d band with holes"" appears. At this time, Co(0) is more likely to accept electrons or adsorb substances, so that it is easy to adsorb hydrogen in isopropanol to form a Co–H bond [62–64]. At the same time, the Lewis acid-base pair (Coδ+-Nδ-) in the Co@OFR+C-900–30 also have the ability to fix isopropanol, and isopropanol was dissociated into isopropoxide and hydride [11,55]. In order to find out which site played a leading role in the process of activation isopropanol, we destroyed the Co(0) sites in the Co@OFR+C-900–30 via oxidizing the catalyst in air under 105 °C for 48 h, and the activity of the oxidized catalyst was tested (Table 1, entry 18). The results showed that the catalytic ability of Co@OFR+C-900–30 was significantly reduced. Therefore, Co(0) might play a leading role to absorb and activate isopropanol (Step 1). Meanwhile, the ketone carbonyl group was adsorbed by Lewis acid-base site (Coδ+-Nδ-, Step 2). Then under the synergistic effect of Co(0) and Lewis acid-base site, the activated isopropanol and the carbonyl formed a six-membered ring intermediate transition state [35,65]. The isopropanol undergoes a dehydrogenation reaction to produce acetone, and the carbonyl functional group was hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohol. Fig. 4."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we used a kind of hazardous, industrial bulk, carbon and nitrogen rich waste oxytetracycline fermentation broth to prepare the N-doped carbon carrier, and the obtained carrier was used to load cobalt to synthesize the Co@OFR+C catalyst. The activity and active sites of the catalyst could be tuned by changing the pyrolysis temperature and cobalt loadings. In the synthesized catalyst, cobalt existed in the form of Co(0), Co-N, and CoO. Co(0) played the leading role in the activation of the isopropanol, and the Coδ+, Nδ- in the Co-N coordination structure acted as the Lewis acid-base pair in the catalyst to adsorb and activate the substrates. The synthesized catalyst Co@OFR+C-900–30 had excellent catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of ketones via MPV reaction. The catalyst could be recycled and reused for at least 8 cycles without decreasing in performances, indicating the excellent stability. This work provides a valuable utilization of the hazardous waste OFR and a potential catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones via MPV reaction."
