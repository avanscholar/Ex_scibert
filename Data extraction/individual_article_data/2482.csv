0,Introduction,"Chemoheterotrophic (‘dark’) fermentation of carbohydrate-based feedstocks presents a promising route of biological hydrogen production, compared with phototrophic (light driven) routes [1,2]. Dark fermentative hydrogen process produces hydrogen at higher rate (0.5–65.0l H2 l−1 d−1) than light driven process (0.04–4.3l H2 l−1 d−1) [3]. Other major advantages of the dark fermentation compared to light-driven processes are higher bacterial growth rates and lower energy demands (no need for light sources), resulting in low capital costs for at least small-scale production facilities (100–1000l H2 h−1) [4–6]. With respect to biochemistry of the dark fermentation, 4mol of hydrogen are produced theoretically from 1mol glucose concomitantly with 2mol of acetate (Reactions (1) and (2)). Alternatively only 2mol of hydrogen are produced when butyrate is the main fermentation product (Reactions (3) and (4)). (1) C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 +2C2H4O2 ΔG° (35°C)=−184.2kJ (2) C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 +2C2H4O2 ΔG° (60°C)=−20.1kJ (3) C6H12O6 →2H2 +2CO2 +C4H8O2 ΔG° (35°C)=−244.2kJ (4) C6H12O6 →2H2 +2CO2 +C4H8O2 ΔG° (60°C)=−84.2kJ From the above reactions, it can be concluded that the highest theoretical yield of hydrogen is associated with acetic acid as the fermentation end product. Hydrogen yields can be improved by direction of metabolic fluxes preferably to Reactions (1) and (2), than to Reactions (3) and (4). This can be accomplished by thermophilic or extreme thermophilic fermentation, operating at temperatures higher than 60°C [7,8]. Thermophilic bacteria are able to utilize a wide range of organic wastes [5,9]. Thermophilic mixed cultures and pure culture have been examined for their potential as H2 producers [10–12]. High H2 production rate and less variety of fermentation end products were observed under thermophilic conditions compared to mesophilic ones [13]. In addition, thermophilic conditions resulted in much better pathogens destruction for organic residues coming out from anaerobic digestion process [14]. These properties make application of thermophiles for H2 production economically and technically attractive. However, biohydrogen production by thermophilic dark fermentation requires further improvement before commercial exploitation is possible. For industrial application of the biohydrogen process, the hydrogen production rate is as important as its overall yield. The hydrogen production rate can be enhanced by selection of efficient fast growing microbial strains and also by improvement of cell density by whole cell immobilization. One thermophilic microbial strain with high rate of hydrogen production was previously isolated from our laboratory and characterized as Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain PSU-2 [15]. To achieve satisfactory hydrogen production rate, immobilized-cell systems such as UASB have become popular alternatives to carrier-free (suspended-cell) systems. They are more capable of maintaining higher biomass concentration even at shorter HRTs and have higher feasibility in practical environmental applications [16]. Previous studies have shown that the cell immobilization techniques including cell-entrapping and cell-attaching methods improve cell retention and hydrogen production rate at higher dilution rates in the granular reactors [17], fixed-bed reactors [18], fluidized bed reactors [19] and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) [20]. However, cell-entrapping methods suffer from mass transfer resistance [21]. Moreover, the gas produced inside the gel could lead to damages to the structure of the immobilized bioparticles [16] and have the drawback of being cost intensive and less feasible when a larger-scale is intended to be developed. Hydrogen-producing bacteria can be immobilised into granules by extracellular polymers excreted by bacteria during granulation process [17]. Extracellular polymers play a key role in agglutinating bacteria into granules and also in maintaining structure integrity. It was found that hydrogen-producing biomass can develop into granules with high bioactivity [22]. However, granular sludge processes have some limitations. A major drawback is the long period that takes to develop the active hydrogen-producing granules [22]. Therefore, readily constructed anaerobic granules containing active and fast growing hydrogen producers is a prerequisite for fast and efficient hydrogen production. In the present study, thermophilic dark fermentative hydrogen production from heat-pretreated methanogenic granules immobilized with T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 in UASB reactor was compared with hydrogen production in carrier-free UA system. The effects of HRT and sucrose loading rate on process performance were investigated. Substrate conversion efficiency and cell growth kinetic parameters using immobilized T. thermosaccharolyticum strain PSU-2 were determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium composition,"2.1 Microorganism and medium composition The thermophilic fermentative bacterium used was T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 as previously described in Ref. [15]. The basal anaerobic medium (BA medium) used in this study was prepared as previously described [23]. The BA medium was supplemented aseptically with sucrose, peptone and NaHCO3 to final concentrations of 20gl−1, 2gl−1 and 2.5gl−1, respectively. The medium was flushed with nitrogen for 20min to obtain completely anaerobic conditions. The pH of medium was adjusted to 5.5 by adding 1M NaOH or 1M HCl. The stock culture of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 was maintained in synthetic medium containing tryptone, yeast extract, glucose, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, MgCl2, FeSO4·7H2O and resazurin of 6gl−1, 3gl−1, 10gl−1, 3gl−1, 4gl−1, 0.4gl−1, 0.2gl−1 and 0.5mgl−1, respectively [24]. The culture was stored in a refrigerator and subcultured once every month. The purity of this culture was routinely checked under the microscope."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up Two laboratory scale reactors, granular (UASB) and carrier-free (UA) system, with 240ml total volume, and a liquid volume of 220ml, were set up. UA reactor was used as a control to study the hydrogen production with suspended (non-immobilised) T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2. Fresh medium was supplied from the bottom by a peristaltic pump. The evolved gas and effluent liquid were discharged from the top of the reactor and were separated in the separation bottle. Gas meter with water replacement method was connected with separation bottle in order to collect the gas and measure the gas volume [25]. The pH of mixed liquid in the reactors was manually controlled with addition of NaOH when pH in reactors was below 5.0. During the process, the pH in effluent was monitored daily, and when it dropped below 5.0, the concentration of NaHCO3 in influent was increased to maintain the pH inside reactors around 5.5. The reactors were operated at a stable temperature of 60°C. For UASB set-up, heat-pretreated methanogenic granules were used as biomass carrier. The methanogenic granular sludge was obtained from a potato factory (Kruiningen, The Netherlands). Granules were sieved and those with a diameter of between 0.25 and 0.5mm were autoclaved at 121°C for 30min to remove methanogenic activity as previously described [20]. 80ml of treated intact methanogenic granules were added in a UASB reactor. UA reactor was operated without addition of treated methanogenic granules under the same conditions with UASB."
4,Startup and operation of UASB and UA,"2.3 Startup and operation of UASB and UA The medium described above containing 20gl−1 sucrose was used for all of the experiments. Batch cultivation in serum vials was used to obtain inoculum (seed culture) [24]. 100ml seed culture before the end of the exponential growth phase (OD660 =0.5) was transferred into UASB and UA. 80ml of treated methanogenic granules were added to UASB. Reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for 10min to create an anaerobic environment. The reactors were operated in batch mode for 12h in order to provide the bacteria time to start growing and subsequently continuous cultivation was initiated by feeding medium at the lowest HRT of 24h for 1 week to establish good growth conditions in reactor. For UASB, the culture was recycled through a pump connecting the outlet and feed at constant flow rate of 20mlmin−1. When the cells began to attach to treated metanogenic granules (approx. 2 days after recirculation start when low bacterial concentration (OD660 =0.01) in effluent was registered) and the sucrose was completely consumed, the dilution rate was increased step-wise at 20 cycles of dilution rate intervals. After reaching steady-state operation, the HRT was decreased progressively from 24 to 0.75h. For each HRT, the reactors were allowed to stabilize until the value of hydrogen production rate did not change, and sucrose and metabolites concentrations were constant in effluent. The reactors were run 20 cycles of the corresponding HRT to ensure that steady-state conditions were reached. Steady-state conditions defined in the present study were considered to be reached when the variations of products and hydrogen production were less than 5%. Each steady-state period lasted over 20 HRT. The gaseous and liquid samples were collected daily for further analysis."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The volume of gas produced was recorded daily using a gas meter with water displacement method [25]. The H2 concentration in the gas phase was measured by using a gas chromatograph (MicroLab, Arhus, Denmark) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an s-m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Fermentation liquid end products (organic acids and alcohols) were determined by gas chromatograph (HP 5890 series II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP FFAP column (dimensions 30m×0.53mm×1.0mm). The GC-TCD and GC-FID conditions were set according to Liu et al. [26]. Lactate and formic acids were determined by suppressed ion chromatography, which consisted of HPLC pump (HP 1100, Waldbronn, Germany). Sucrose was analyzed by phenol–sulfuric acid method [27] and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the standard methods [28]."
6,Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),"2.5 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Granular samples were collected from UASB reactor at 1h HRT, immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde [29], and preserved in PBS–ethanol mixture at −20°C until its use. The granules were then resuspended and incubated for 1 day at 4°C in each of following solutions and in the sequence: 15% sucrose; 1:3CT (optimum cutting temperature solution; TissueTek, Sakura, Inc.): sucrose; 1:1CT: sucrose; 3:1CT: sucrose; and 100% OCT. OCT-embedded granules were frozen at −80°C and section with a cryotome (Leica CM 1850) in 5–10μm slices [30]. To analyze the different microbial populations, samples were prepared using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) according to the protocol described by Amann et al. [31] with FITC-labeled EUBMIX probe specific for bacteria [32] and Cy3-labeled Tbm1282 probe (5′-TGGGACCTGTTTTCTGCG-3′ specific for genus Thermoanaerobacterium) (designed in our laboratory, manuscript in submission). Tbm1282 probe was designed and evaluated using PRIMROSE as described previously [33]. In silico specificity of Tbm1282 with the genus targeted was confirmed based on the alignment of 16S rRNA sequence of 54 members of Thermoanaerobacterium group. Designed probe was tested using the probe match function of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) software package version 9 [34]. To validate the specificity of in situ detection, a genus-specific Tbm1282 probe was experimentally tested with target and non-target reference strains. T. thermosaccharolyticum DSM 571 and Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense DSM8692 were used as target bacteria, whereas Desulfotomaculum geothermicum DSM3669 and Clostridium thermocellum DSM1237 were used as a non-target bacterium for probe Tbm1282. The probes were used at 30% formamide. Images were visualized by Zeiss LSM 510 (Thornwood, NY) confocal laser scanning microscope. The dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenilindol (DAPI) was used to corroborate that the observed fluorescence with the FISH technique corresponded to bacteria cells."
7,"Calculation of hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield and growth parameters","2.6 Calculation of hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield and growth parameters The volumetric H2 production rate (ml H2 l−1 h−1) was calculated from the total gas production rate and the concentration of H2 in the headspace. The molar H2 production rate (mmol H2 l−1 h−1), was calculated using the ideal gas law as molar H2 production rate (mmol H2 l−1 h−1)=volumetric H2 production rate (ml H2 l−1 h−1)/(RT), where R =8.314 (15) JK−1 mol−1 equal to R =0.082latmK−1 mol−1, and T =333K [35]. Hydrogen production yield was calculated as total molaric amount of H2 divided into molaric amount of consumed sucrose (mmol H2/mmol sucrose). Cell growth was initially investigated based on simple Monod equation [36]. Linearization of Monod equation (μ =(Sμ max)/(K S + S)) was done to find out the kinetics parameters with the help of Lineweaver–Burk plot (S/μ = S/μ max + K S/μ max). Regression analysis was used to find the best fit for a straight line on a plot of 1/μ vs 1/S to predict values of μ max and K S, where μ is specific growth rate (h−1), S is substrate concentration (gl−1), μ max is maximum specific growth rate (h−1) and K S is half saturation constant (gl−1). The growth kinetics parameters such as μ max and K S values for the immobilized cells were calculated by plotting 1/D vs 1/S."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Thermophilic biohydrogen process performance of UASB vs UA,"3.1 Thermophilic biohydrogen process performance of UASB vs UA Thermophilic biohydrogen production process with immobilized cells of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 (Fig. 1 ) was compared with performance of same process in the absence of immobilization (Fig. 2 ). In comparison with maximum hydrogen production rate of 12.1mmol H2 l−1 h−1 obtained by UA, a 12-fold increase in hydrogen production rate up to 152.5mmol H2 l−1 h−1 were achieved by UASB. However, no difference in hydrogen yields was registered in both systems. As shown in Fig. 1, hydrogen production rate of UASB increased from 8.6 to 152.5mmoll−1 h−1 with decrease in HRT from 24 to 0.75h. Sucrose utilization ranged from 96.2 to 99.5% at HRT change from 24 to 1h, whereas it decreased to 68% at 0.75h HRT. Taking into account both sucrose conversion efficiency (95%) and sucrose loading rate (46.8mmol sucrosel−1 h−1) the optimal rate of hydrogen production in UASB was considered to be 144.6mmoll−1 h−1 at HRT of 1h. Hydrogen production rate of UA increased in response to decrease of HRT from 24 to 18h. After change of HRT from 18 to 12h, a washout of the biomass occurred resulting in drop of hydrogen production rate from 12.1 to 1.7mmol H2 l−1 h−1 (Fig. 2). The hydrogen content in gas phase of UA went to almost zero when HRT decreased to 12h. In comparison, the hydrogen content in gas phase of UASB was not sensitive to decrease of HRT up to 1.0h (Fig. 1). The dissolved metabolite products in both reactors were similar, mainly composed of acetate and butyrate, with smaller quantities of other volatile fatty acids and alcohols. Results obtained for process performance showed that heat-pretreated methanogenic granules have good mechanical strength and were suitable carrier for bacterial immobilization, allowing efficient and stable hydrogen production. Formation of bacterial biofilm on treated methanogenic granules substantially enhanced biomass retention that was closely associated with hydrogen production performance. More biomass retained in the UASB compared to UA system (16 vs 4.6g VSSl−1). As shown in Table 1 , the hydrogen production rate was related to the biomass concentration. Specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) of the granular (immobilized cells) system stabilized at 10.2–10.32mmol H2 g VSS−1 h−1, which was 3 times higher compared to that of carrier-free (suspended cells) system. This result suggests that the microbial activity of hydrogen producing bacteria was not suppressed when the microorganisms were in the form of biofilm developed on granules. Our finding was in contrast with other study where activity of hydrogen producing bacteria was suppressed when the microorganisms were in biofilm on activated carbon and cells-entrapped bioparticles [37]. UASB reactors carrying T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 were able to operate at high hydraulic loading rates or low HRT. However, when HRT decreased to 0.75h, gas formation around granules forced them to float (gas hold up) and the immobilized cells accumulated towards the liquid surface on the top of the bioreactor. Gas hold-up resulted in decrease of working volume. Low-substrate conversion and inefficient hydrogen production were achieved at HRT of 0.75h (Table 1). Gas accumulation in this experiment was occurring only at 0.75h HRT, while gas accumulation was a major problem in bioreactor with immobilized cells using lignocellulosic materials (coir, rice straw and bagasse) as solid matrices [21]. It is generally accepted that only microorganisms located in the exterior layer of treated methanogenic granules function actively in substrate utilization. The sharp rise of attached biomass concentration in response to increase of substrate loading rate (Fig. 3 ) was observed. HPR and SHPR also seem to be influenced strongly by the OLR. The statistical results imply that HPR (0.96) and SHPR (0.96) were exponentially and polynomial (x 3) correlated to the effective OLR, respectively. The results obtained clearly show that increase in OLR was not always followed by increase in HPR and SHPR. In fact, HPR and SHPR might be affected by end product inhibition, for example, inhibition due to dissolved (supersaturated) hydrogen gas in the liquid at high OLR [38]. In comparison, the attached biomass concentration (R =0.94) was found to be linearly correlated to the effective OLR, indicating that the enhanced OLR could always stimulate the increase in attached biomass concentration. The μ max and K S for immobilized cells were 1.0h−1 and 15.3gl−1, respectively, while the μ max and K S for suspended cells were 0.9h−1 and 7.3gl−1, respectively. The soluble metabolites (organic acids and alcohols) profile associated with the HRT changes are shown in Table 2 . The soluble metabolites concentration increased with decrease in HRT. It is generally accepted that the hydrogen yield is highly related to the effective microorganisms and environmental conditions in hydrogen fermentation processes, but seems to be independent on and biomass concentration [37]. Immobilized cells of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 with treated methanogenic granules seems to demonstrate an advantage over the others biofilm systems. Firstly, microbial kinetic characteristics of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 revealed that the maximum specific growth rate and biomass yield are comparable to others hydrogen producing bacteria. The maximum specific growth rate and biomass yield were reported to be 0.3–0.5h−1 and 0.15–0.3g cellg−1 sucrose [15]. It indicates that T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 grows rapidly when a higher organic loading was employed. Washout of support materials did not occur in UASB process. Treated methanogenic granules are excellent carrier for biomass immobilization and consequently hydrogen production in upflow reactors. Kim et al. [39] also found that reactor system using granular sludge as carrier produced significantly higher amounts of gas and for a longer time than biofilm reactor system with microorganisms attached to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (ca. 300 vs 50mll−1 h−1). This was presumably attributed to a higher surface area of the granular sludge compared to the surface area of PVA. Moreover, more microorganisms were harbored by granular sludge than PVA with biofilm (approximately 7000mgl−1 reactor vs 4000mgl−1 reactor). These results indicate that the granular sludge reactors appear to be superior to biofilm reactors for high-rate fermentative hydrogen production. Another potential advantage of the present system is that low pH operation (pH=5) would contribute significantly to the cost reduction in the alkali amount required for pH control. In this study, the pH was maintained consistently by adding weak alkali buffer in the feed. An alkaline substance such as NaOH or equivalent NaHCO3 is required to balance culture pH due to the production of organic acids during continuous hydrogen fermentation. NaOH was added in the reactor when the culture pH dropped below a set value, while a dose of NaHCO3 could be mixed with the feedstock as a buffer to maintain the culture pH. However, when the sucrose loading rate increased to 4.87mmol sucrosel−1 h−1, a large amount of NaOH was required and it could not be transported rapidly along the reactor column and distributed evenly in the up-flow column reactors, resulting in system upset. Sodium bicarbonate as an alternative to alkali was supplemented at 5.6gl−1 into the feed solution so that less NaOH was required for culture pH adjustment and the reactor could perform stably."
10,Development of biofilm on treated methanogenic granules,"3.2 Development of biofilm on treated methanogenic granules Confocal laser scanning microscopy images revealed that treated methanogenic granules possess excellent physical characteristics as a support medium in UASB. The biomass concentration attached to treated methanogenic granules was found to be in the range of 12–16g VSSl−1. A thick and high density biomass layer around treated methanogenic granules was found. Spatial distribution of bacteria was studied with oligonucleotide probe Tbm1282 designed specifically for detection of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. The probe Tbm1282 was previously tested and completely matched to 16S rRNA sequence of 10 known species of Thermoanaerobacterium group and 11 non-cultured Thermoanaerobacterium with 75% coverage of Thermoanaerobacterium group (manuscript in submission). Closely related species such as D. geothermicum and C. thermocellum had three mismatches. Surface layer of treated methanogenic granules contained microorganisms that hybridized with Tbm1230 probe specific for genus Thermoanaerobacterium (Fig. 4 ). The bacteria were stained in pink and were grouped into small colonies. A large accumulation of microorganisms around surface of granules was observed. Supporting surface was formed by compact mass of microorganisms, principally with bacillary and chain forms. The extension of new surface layer on the granules would results from the extracellular polymer (ECP) excreted by bacteria during the granulation process. Recent reports [17,22,40] also showed that granules were formed directly in biohydrogen producing system where methanogenic activity was eliminated. ECP may play the key role in agglutinating bacteria into granules and also in maintaining structural integrity of granules [22]. Kotsopoulos et al. [20] and Hu and Chen [41] also reported that treated methanogenic granules were used as the support medium for extreme thermophilic biohydrogen production with mixed culture."
11,Evaluation of reactor process performance,"3.3 Evaluation of reactor process performance The production rate of hydrogen was used to evaluate the process performance and compare it with other studies for hydrogen production in granular reactor system. The results obtained in other studies (Table 3 ) clearly pointed out that hydrogen production is influenced by the biomass level retained in the systems. Comparing with suspended cell systems, the immobilized cell systems achieved a biomass concentration of 15.8–44gl−1 even at a short HRT (0.5–2h), which essentially lead to an elevated production rate of hydrogen. In the present study, the maximal thickness of well-developed biofilm layer on the granules was estimated to be 40–50μm. In general, insignificant mass transfer limitation is encountered when the biofilm thickness is less than 80μm [39]. This indicates that the UASB system could function free of mass transfer resistance, which is the fatal drawback of some other cell immobilization processes and techniques for biohydrogen production, e.g., fixed-bed reactor and agar gel entrapping technique. In fact, Kumar and Das [21] obtained a slight increase in the HPR in the rhomboid reactor using immobilized cell on lingocellulosic materials as compared to the tubular and tapered reactors due to the enhanced turbulence and reduction in gas hold-up. They also compared different techniques of cell immobilization and concluded that attaching methods give better performance in the HPR as compared to entrapping methods in the packed-bed reactors [21]. Therefore, attached biomass concentration up to 16g VSSl−1 and good mass transfer efficiency enable the present UASB system to be superior in HPR compared to UA system and even to other immobilized-cell systems including tricking biofilter reactor (TBR) [42], packed-bed reactors [21], granular-activated carbon-anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (GAC-AFBR) [37], continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with entrapped-cell [43], draft tube fluidized bed reactor (DTFBR) with entrapped-cell [44] with the exception of carrier induced granular sludge bed (CIGSB) process whose hydrogen production rate reached 227–415mmoll−1 h−1 [17,45,46] and continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactor (CSABR) with silicone entrapped cell whose reach hydrogen production rate of 673.7mmoll−1 h−1 [47]."
12,Conclusion,"The results obtained in this study clearly showed excellent physiological characteristics and the adequate environment of heat-pretreated methanogenic granules as an efficient carrier in UASB reactor system for dark fermentative thermophilic biohydrogen production. At the same hydrogen yield and substrate conversion, 12-fold increases in hydrogen production rate were achieved in the granular UASB system with immobilized T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 compared to that obtained in carrier-free (suspended) UA reactor system. More than 3 times higher biomass concentration (16g VSSl−1) was found in the treated methanogenic granules compared to carrier free UA system (4.6g VSSl−1). Biohydrogen process performance was highly related to the reactor biomass retention. Sucrose utilization high as 95% was achieved at sucrose loading rate of 46.8mmoll−1 h−1. The soluble metabolites were predominated by acetate and butyrate, with smaller quantities of ethanol and propionate. These results indicate that the immobilized T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 is superior in the production rate of hydrogen compared to suspended cells of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 and other dark fermentative biohydrogen production processes with immobilized biomass reported till now. UASB reactor system containing immobilised T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 appears to be most promising process for high-rate thermophilic continuous hydrogen production from sucrose."
