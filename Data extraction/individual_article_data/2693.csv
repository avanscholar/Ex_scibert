0,Introduction,"Pd-based film hydrogen sensor, like PdNi film, sensing hydrogen concentration by monitoring the resistance, is considered to be one of the most reliable hydrogen sensors [1–3]. When Pd-based film is exposed to a hydrogen environment, hydrogen molecules are easily absorbed on the surface and broke up into hydrogen atoms [4]. Then hydrogen atoms enter into the lattice of Pd-based material, which hinders the free movement of electrons, leading to the increase of resistance [5]. When hydrogen is discharged, hydrogen atoms are released from Pd-based film, and the resistance recovers [6]. Although there are lots of new type hydrogen sensors being researched vigorously, Pd-based film hydrogen sensors still eclipse them in some certain aspects. For example, contrasting with optical type hydrogen sensors, Pd-based film hydrogen sensors are small in size, low in power consumption, and do not require complex testing equipment [7,8]. Meanwhile, compared with semiconductor resistance hydrogen sensor, Pd-based film sensors process high cycle stability and gas selectivity [9]. Specially, it processes high compatibility as its optimum applicable temperature is as low as room temperature (RT) [1]. More than that, the Pd-based film hydrogen sensor fabricated by Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology can be integrated on the chip, which lays the foundation for realization of large-scale preparation. Therefore, the lucubration about Pd-based film hydrogen sensor is necessary and irreplaceable. There are lots of researchers endeavoring to develop hydrogen sensors with a low limit of detection (LOD) and excellent sensing performance of low concentration. It contributes to timely warning and investigation of hydrogen leaks in fuel cells, H2-fuelled cars, and chemical industry production and so on. Meanwhile, the low LOD provides the possibility for in-situ hydrogen detection in deep-space where the hydrogen concentration maybe low than 1 ppm [10,11]. Among them, PdNi film hydrogen sensors as the key research direction in Pd-based film sensors received great attention. Jiang et al. designed special PdNi film hydrogen sensors based on Wheatstone bridge realizing the effective amplification of output signal [12]. Ling et al. researched the effect of Ni content on hydrogen sensing response of closely spaced PdNi alloy nanoparticle film, and concluded that an optimal content of Ni contributed to rapidly response, high sensitivity, good linearity and reliability to hydrogen [13]. Liu et al. found that the response and recovery characteristics of PdNi film hydrogen sensor depended on work temperature, and the response performance in the heating mode was greatly improved compared with room temperature [2]. Lee et al. fabricated nanogaps in PdNi alloy film on an elastomeric substrate by simple stretching and demonstrated that it processed excellent hydrogen sensing performances [14]. However, the influences of the thickness of PdNi film on hydrogen sensing performances, which is very likely to affect the surface activity and hydrogen transmission of the film, are always disregardful, and no systematic researches were reported. In this work, we modulated the film thickness of PdNi film hydrogen sensor to improve the response and decrease the LOD. The influences of the microstructure and micro morphology of PdNi films with different thicknesses on the hydrogen sensing performances were deeply studied. Specially, the relationship of the response with the hydrogen concentration and the film thickness was fitted by bivariate cross effect linear regression model."
1,Experimental procedure,"The design of the PdNi nano-film hydrogen sensor is similar to our previous reports [7,8]. The thermally oxidized （100） Si slice with the size of 1 mm × 1 mm was chosen as the substrate. The PdNi nano-film as the hydrogen sensing layer was design in a zigzag type. There are lots of literature researching the influence of the content of Ni on the sensitivity and response time of PdNi film hydrogen sensors. And it is a consensus that around 14% is the optimal Ni content to obtain better hydrogen sensing performance [13,14]. Our previous explorations confirmed the conclusion, so PdNi film with 14% Ni was applied to carry on the following researches. The thicknesses of PdNi nano-film were design as 12 nm, 18 nm, 36 nm, 54 nm, 72 nm and 145 nm respectively. For precise resistance measurement, the bond pads of the PdNi were covered with Au film with the thickness of 150 nm. And ultra-thin Cr film was deposited as the connective layer before PdNi film or Au film deposited. At first, the substrate was cleaned by acetone, alcohol and deionized water, respectively. Then the PdNi films with different thicknesses were patterned and deposited by direct current magnetron sputtering and lift-off process. High-purity PdNi mosaic target with special area ratio was applied to obtain the PdNi film. The sputtering background pressure was 8 × 10−4 Pa, the atmosphere was pure Ar with gas flow of 30 sccm, the sputtering pressure was 0.3 Pa, the sputtering power was 40 W, and the sputtering times were controlled from 100 s to 20 min to obtain different film thicknesses, which were confirmed by cross section SEM further. In addition, Au film and Cr film were deposited in turn by the same way. Finally, the samples were fixed on a special design flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) with their pads connected by gold wire ball bond. And the optical photo and schematic of the fabricated hydrogen sensor was shown in Fig. 1 . The structure of the PdNi film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction radiation (XRD, PANalytical PW3040/60, Netherlands) with Cu Kα. The surface morphology and microstructure were researched by transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin TMP, US). The test method of gas sensing properties was reported in our previous works[7]. The hydrogen sensor was placed in a closed test chamber with a gas inlet and a gas outlet. The special hydrogen concentration was obtained by controlling the ratio of nitrogen and nitrogen–hydrogen mixture. The constant temperature was provided by thermostat, and the test pressure was atmospheric pressure. The sensor response (Rs) was defined as formula (1): (1) Rs % = R g - R a R a × 100(%) where Ra and Rg were the resistance of the sensor stable in pure N2 and nitrogen–hydrogen mixture with a certain hydrogen concentration, respectively. The response time and recovery time (trs and trc) of the sensor were defined as the time taking for reaching 90% of the total resistance change."
2,Results and discussion,"To research the influences of thicknesses on the microstructure of PdNi nano-film, the XRD patterns are revealed in Fig. 2 a, which includes the diffraction peak reflecting the (111) lattice plane of PdNi films. The position of (111) peak is significantly higher than that of pure Pd (PDF#26-1043, (111) peak is located at 2θ = 40.118°) due to the smaller atomic radius of Ni than that of Pd. But there is no obvious difference in the (111) peak position of PdNi films with different thicknesses, demonstrating that the lattice constant is not influenced by the thickness, because the relative content of Pd with Ni is not changed. The average grain size perpendicular to (111) (Fig. 2b) is speculated by Bragg diffraction angle and full width at half maximum of diffraction peak according to Scherrer Formula [7,15]. Choosing the 145 nm PdNi film which has the highest crystallinity in this work as the standard sample, the relative crystallinity in this work can be calculated by ratio of intensity of (111) peaks of each nano-film sample and the 145 nm standard sample [16,17]. The results are shown in Fig. 2b. Obviously, it is only a semi-quantitative result representing the relative relationship of the crystallinity degree of different samples. Thus, with the decrease of the film thickness, the average grain size and relative crystallinity of PdNi nano-film drop sharply. The film thickness was controlled by adjusting the sputtering time. Extending the sputtering time means that the film can grow more fully. As we all known, the growth process of the film includes two stages: nucleation and film growth [18]. In the first stage, the Pd atoms and Ni atoms condense on the surface of the substrate, starting the nucleation process. With the sputtering time increasing, these clusters continue to receive new atoms and fuse with others to grow up. This process keeps until the cluster islands are connected into pieces. Therefore, the increase of film thickness is beneficial to the film fully crystallize and grain growth, while a thinner PdNi film means worse crystallinity and smaller grains. For PdNi film with 12 nm, the (111) peak is too weak to be detected (Fig. 2a), and the average grain size and relative crystallinity are too low to be calculated. The morphologies and micro-structures of PdNi films with different thicknesses were further investigated by TEM. The EDS mappings, SAED patterns and HR-TEM images of PdNi nano-films with 18 nm and 145 nm are revealed in Fig. 3 . The elemental mappings show the uniform distribution of Cr, Pd and Ni elements in PdNi film regardless of the thickness, and the atomic ratio between Pd and Ni is consistent with the design (Fig. 3a and d). The SAED patterns of both PdNi films match well with the powder patterns in the PDF of Pd (PDF#46-1043). It means that the PdNi films possess face-centered cubic structure and belong to the space group Fm-3m (225), which is as same as Pd. And the lattice constant of PdNi films is about 3.79 Å, which does not significantly change with the film thickness changing. Fig. 4 shows the typical TEM images with low magnification of PdNi films with different thicknesses and the statistical distributions of particle sizes. The particle size statistical distributions reveal that the average grain size increases significantly from 10 nm to 25 nm with the increase of film thickness, which is consistent with the analysis of XRD. The small grain size of 12 nm PdNi film means a high density of grain boundaries. The great number of defects concentrated near grain boundaries provides considerable absorption sites and fast-moving channels of hydrogen atoms [19,20]. Meanwhile, it can be found that pores are existed universally in the triangular area between grains of PdNi nano-films with different thicknesses, such as the places marked by the red circles in Fig. 4. So, the PdNi nano-films fabricated by magnetron sputtering are not dense enough. The real-time response change to 1% H2 for PdNi sensors with different film thicknesses are shown in Fig. 5 a. When 1% hydrogen is introduced, the responses of all the sensors increase rapidly and tend to be stable until the maximum values are reached. When the hydrogen environment is discharged, the responses drop immediately and gradually return to the initial value. The influences of the thickness of PdNi nano-film on the Ra and Rs, trs and trc of the sensors to 1% H2 are revealed in Fig. 5b and 5c, respectively. The error bars represent standard deviation of five experimental points, which are too small to be visible on the graphs. The decrease of film thickness leads to an increase of initial resistance. On the one hand, it conforms to the law of resistance that the value of film resistance is inversely proportional to thickness. On the other hand, the lower crystallinity and smaller grains of thinner film contribute to the increase of resistance. The large initial resistance also means greater resistance change for the same response. The response time and recover time reveal a pretty weak downward trend with the decrease of thickness. It means that the time required for PdNi nano-films with different thicknesses to reach equilibrium with hydrogen is basically the same. On the contrary, the response increases drastically as film thickness decreases from 145 nm to 12 nm. It is well known that hydrogen atoms are transported quickly through dislocations instead of slow lattice diffusion [21]. And dislocations are abundantly enriched near the grain boundaries. Therefore, the distribution of hydrogen in the PdNi nano-film at a certain concentration is not uniform. In low-concentration hydrogen environment, absorbed hydrogen of PdNi film concentrated near grain boundaries rather than grain bulk where atoms arranged orderly [19,22]. According to the analysis of the XRD (Fig. 2b) and TEM (Fig. 4), the thinner PdNi film is accompanied by the smaller grain size and lower crystallinity. For the approximately spherical grains, the volume fraction Ct of the distorted part around the grain boundary is shown in formula (2): (2) C t = 3 Δ d where d is the average grain size, Δ is the average thickness of the distorted part around the grain boundary [21]. Assuming that the Δ of different size grains are similar, the thinner film which has the smaller grain size possesses higher Ct. Therefore, with the decrease of film thickness, the film has higher volume fraction to provide the low-energy trapping sites to absorb hydrogen atoms, and the resistance change caused by a certain concentration of hydrogen is also greater. Specially, the dislocations are not continuous on the grain boundaries although they are enriched near the grain boundaries. Therefore, the hydrogen carried on the dislocations cannot be directly transferred from the surface grains to the internal grains. In fact, the hydrogen has to be offloaded by the dislocations at or near the boundary, diffuse through the boundaries or pores between the grains, and finally be picked back up by dislocations in the internal grain. It is envisioned that there must be a sufficient potential energy difference between the two sites so that hydrogen can be desorbed and re-adsorbed smoothly, otherwise it cannot be transported to the internal grains. For the film with a thickness about 10 nm, the grain size is also about 10 nm, which means that the film should be composed of a single layer of crystals, and the transmission of hydrogen between the crystal grains is not a concern. For the film with a thickness about tens or hundreds of nanometers, the grain size increases with the increase of the thickness, but is still significantly smaller compared with the film thickness. Therefore, the film is composed with multiple layers of grains, and the gaps between layers of grains may result that the hydrogen cannot reach the deep grains. If so, there are the PdNi grains existing inside the thicker PdNi film, and the resistance of which is less effected by the environment hydrogen concentration or even not changing. Combining with the parallel circuit analysis, the internal of the thicker nano-film whose resistance is less affected by hydrogen can cause the response of the nano-film sensor to decrease. Detecting of hydrogen with low concentration is one of the essential topics in the study of hydrogen sensors. The real-time response changes to H2 with the concentrations less than 50 ppm of PdNi nano-film sensors with different thickness are shown in Fig. 6 . The Rs increases with the increase of hydrogen concentration. Meanwhile, the Rs for the same hydrogen concentration significantly increases with the reducing of film thickness. In particular, the Rs of 12 nm PdNi sensor to 2.5 ppm hydrogen is as high as 0.04%, which is 4 times higher than that of the 145 nm PdNi sensor. The relationship of Rs with the hydrogen concentration and film thickness is revealed in Fig. 7 a. There are lots of researches about hydrogen sensors based on Pd and Pd alloy with nano-sized domains confirming that the sensing performance of low-concentration hydrogen conforms the Sieverts’ law [23–25], that is, the value of response is proportional to the one-half of the ambient hydrogen concentration, as shown in Formula (3): (3) R s = K × C H 2 1 2 where C H 2 is the concentration of ambient hydrogen, K is the Sieverts’ coefficient [26]. Meanwhile, it is concluded in our work that the value of Rs is improved with the decrease of film thickness. Based on them, the relationship of Rs with the hydrogen concentration and film thickness can be fitted by a bivariate cross effect linear regression model [27] where the variables are the one-half of the hydrogen concentration and the inverse of the film thickness. After many fitting attempts, considering that the Rs is zero when the hydrogen concentration returns to zero, the applied fitting model is shown in formula (4): (4) Rs = ∑ i = 0 3 ∑ j = 0 1 a ij x i y j R s x , 0 = 0 where x is the inverse of the film thickness, y is the one-half of the hydrogen concentration, aij is constant. Furthermore, ignoring the items that sum to zero, the fitting results can be simplified, as shown in Formula (5): (5) R s = C 1 + C 2 h - 1 + C 3 h - 2 + C 4 h - 3 × C H 2 1 2 where h is the value of the film thickness, and C1–4 are constants which can be obtained from the fitting results. The fitting results is revealed in Fig. 7a, and the value of Adj. R-Square is as high as 0.997. The high value both means the fitted model can almost completely explain data and means there is no concern for overfitting. In order to further verify that Rs is proportional to the power of one-half of the hydrogen concentration, the value of y in fitting model (Eq. (4)) is replaced with different powers of the hydrogen concentration. After fitting, the relationship of Adj. R-Square with the index of the hydrogen concentration is shown in Fig. 7b. Obviously, when the value of index equals to 0.5, the degree of fit is the best. Therefore, the fitting results agree with the Sieverts’ law, and the value of the Sieverts’ coefficient is a function of the film thickness. The relationship of coefficient K with the film thickness is shown in Fig. 7c. Based on it, the response of PdNi film hydrogen sensors can be modulated by thickness control. Besides, it is worth noting that the film thickness should not decrease indefinitely. Because the extremely thin film is too easy to be discontinuous, which causes trouble during the preparation and application. Meanwhile, hydrogen uptake by Pd is not an atomic property, but has a strong dependence on the structure of the Pd, so the too loose structure and poor crystallinity may cause the decrease of hydrogen response [28]. According to the researches, PdNi film hydrogen with the thickness of 12 nm has the best sensing performance and stability. The real-time response changes for H2 with concentration less than 1 ppm of 12 nm PdNi nano-film was also studied (Fig. 8 a). It shows that the LOD of the hydrogen sensor is as low as 50 ppb, which is significantly better than most of current researches [7,29–31]. In addition, compared with hydrogen, the response of the 12 nm hydrogen sensor to other common interfering gases are negligible, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene and ammonia (Fig. 8b). In repeated tests for up to six months, the sensor's response to 1% hydrogen was almost constant (Fig. 8c), which reveals excellent stability."
3,Conclusion,"The response of PdNi nano-film hydrogen sensor can be improved by decreasing the film thickness. On the one hand, decreasing the film thickness does not affect the crystal structure, but reduces the crystallinity, refines the grains and increases the grain boundary density significantly, thereby possesses a higher volume fraction of the distorted part around the grain boundary to react with hydrogen. On the other hand, the thinner film means fewer grain layers, which has fewer barriers for hydrogen to transfer to the inside. The relationship between sensing response with hydrogen concentration and film thickness is fitted by the bivariate cross effect linear regression model and meets well with the Sieverts’ law. Specially, the Sieverts’ coefficient K is a function related with the thickness. The response to 2.5 ppm hydrogen of 12 nm PdNi sensor is 4 times higher than that of 145 nm PdNi sensor, and the LOD of 12 nm PdNi sensor is as low as 50 ppb hydrogen. A practical strategy to improve the response of gas sensors is proposed and scientifically demonstrated in this work."
