0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier because water is the only product when it is combusted, which can store or deliver tremendous amount of usable energy due to its high energy density [1–5]. Recently, more efforts have been devoted to develop a low cost and scalable preparation technique for hydrogen production, such as water electrolysis [6–8], water photolysis [9–11], biological hydrogen production [12], by-products refining and pyrolysis of fossil oil [13], etc. Differing from conventional energy with the risks of high-energy consumption and high-pollution, hydrogen generation by water photolysis with solar energy is the highly competitive strategy to satisfy the demand for future green, clean and sustainable development [14–17]. Besides, solar energy is a kind of powerful, clean, inexhaustible natural resource [18]. So, the technology of producing hydrogen and oxygen only by sunlight and water is one of the “ideal technologies of mankind”, which can be seen as a manner to store solar energy [19]. The key factor to achieve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water is to design a highly efficient photocatalyst [20]. The pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda about TiO2 laid the solid foundation of hydrogen production technique using semiconductor photocatalyst [21]. Since then, TiO2 has been studied as photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution owning to its nontoxicity, low cost, high stability and excellent photocatalytic activity. However, due to the wide band gap (3.2 eV) of the original TiO2 [22–27], its photocatalytic hydrogen production performance is still not ideal. So, it is of great necessity to develop a new type of titanium dioxide-based photocatalyst to improve the utilization of visible light. Doping TiO2 with different transition metal cations [28–34] and nonmetallic elements [35–41] can reduce the band gap and enhance the carrier lifetime effectively. Due to the low electron transfer resistance, large electronic storage capacity and excellent optical absorption ability [42], the presence of carbon dopant or coat on photocatalyst can efficiently promote the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and successfully extend the light absorption range to the visible light region. For instance, TiO2 nanosheets with a uniform decoration of amorphous carbon (TiO2/C-400-1) presented a boosted photocatalytic performance up to 3 times of P25 [43]. Besides, carbon doping can also significantly improve the thermal stability of TiO2, suppressing the aggregation and phase transformation of TiO2 [33]. Generally, carbon-modified TiO2 have been synthesized by many methods, such as sol–gel synthesis [44], thermal oxidation of titanium carbide [45], solvothermal synthesis [46] and electrostatic spinning method [47,48]. These methods are usually complicated and even dangerous. Developing a new simple and safe strategy to synthesize carbon-modified TiO2 will be meaningful and practical. We have reported that boric acid can promote the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate not only under hydrothermal conditions [49]but even at room temperature [50]. On this basis, we synthesized a carbon-modified titanium dioxide by hydrolyzing tetrabutyl titanate with boric acid in ethanol solution, then calcining for in-situ carbon generation, and followed by boiling the product to remove boron oxide derived from boric acid. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the catalyst achieved at 500 °C (TiO2-500-W) exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity (434.91 μmol h−1 g−1). The photocatalytic performance of TiO2-500-W under visible-light irradiation is even higher than other reported carbon-doped TiO2. Characterizations and control experiments demonstrate that the carbon coat can not only reduce the band gap of TiO2 but also improve the electronic conductivity. The presence of carbon coat can also facilitate the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, so that the quantum efficiency is improved. DFT calculations indicate that the presence of carbon sheet on TiO2 introduces valence tail in the band gap of TiO2 and reduces the work-function, which facilitate the improvement of photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrabutyl titanate (>99.0%), Ethanol absolute (AR), Boric acid (>99.0%), Methanol (>99.0%), P25 (>99.0%). All chemicals are used as received."
3,Synthesis of catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of catalyst The flow chart of carbon-modified TiO2 was simply displayed in Scheme 1 . In general, we added 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate, 10 mL absolute ethanol and 5 g boric acid to the beaker in turn. The mixture was stirred and the tetrabutyl titanate was hydrolyzed into a titanium dioxide gel due to the existence of boric acid. After the gel was dried in air at room temperature for two days, a faint white powder product was obtained and then calcinated at different temperatures for 1 h in N2 atmosphere. Then, the obtained powder was boiled in 500 mL water for 1 h and filtrated immediately to remove boron oxide or boric acid. The boron oxide can be transformed into boric acid in water so that boric acid can be achieved after evaporative crystallization and be reused for next preparation of catalyst. So, this strategy was sustainable. The black powder product was achieved after dried at 80 °C overnight and was termed as TiO2 -T-W, where T refers to carbonization temperature W indexes to the washing process. As a control, if the boric acid and butanol derived from hydrolysis in preliminary TiO2 were firstly washed in boiling water, the dried product was white and named TiO2-W. TiO2-W was then calcinated in a tubular furnace in nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C, producing a white powder named TiO2-W-500. To further remove carbon components, TiO2-W was also calcinated in the muffle furnace in air at 500 °C and the corresponding product was named TiO2-W-500-Air."
4,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions with these catalysts were conducted in a quartz reactor (100 mL) with top-irradiation quartz window and gas sampling hole. Generally, 50 mg of catalysts, 40 mL of water and 10 mL of CH3OH were added into the photoreactor in sequence. A 300 W Xenon lamp (YM-GHX-XE-300, Shanghai Yuming Instrument) with an output light intensity 200 mW cm−2(λ: 350–780 nm) was used as the light source. A circulated cooling water system was connected to control the temperature of the reaction system at 20 °C. In order to remove other gases, the solution was bubbled with high-purity N2 for 30 min before illumination. The H2 production was quantified on a gas chromatography (CHUANHAO GC-7890)."
5,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements The photocurrent response test was investigated with the irradiation of the Xenon lamp (300 W, output light intensity 200 mW cm−2). The photocatalyst (4 mg) was dispersed in ethanol solution containing Nafion (50 vol%) and then sonicated extensively. Then the dispersion was sprayed on a piece of ITO-coated glass (1 cm2) to prepare working photoanode for PEC measurement. We used Pt foil as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Na2SO4 (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte. EIS was measured in a 1.0 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution with frequency range of 105~10−2 Hz. The foam nickel was selected as conductive collector for working electrode. The counter electrode was Pt foil reference electrode was Ag/AgCl electrode. The slurry containing 40 mg catalyst, ethanol and PTFE were coated on the cleaned foam nickel. Then the working electrode was achieved after the slurry was dried at room temperature overnight."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations Transmission electron microscope (TEM, G2 F20 S-TWIN) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7500) were used to observe the morphology of the samples. A physical adsorption instrument (JW-BK100C) was selected to analyze the specific surface area and pore size distribution of samples. The phase structure of all samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with Cu kα (λ = 1.5418 Å). Raman spectrum was recorded by Laser Confocal Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (LabRAM HR800) with 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectrums (XPS) of all samples were obtained on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI). Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker ALPHA) was used to analyze the surface functional groups of all samples. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrums were achieved on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were analyzed by Hitachi F-7000 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a TG analyzer (STA 449C, NETZSCH, Germany) in air from room temperature to 900 °C (10 °C/min) to determine the carbon content in each sample."
7,DFT calculations,"2.6 DFT calculations DFT calculations were performed by using Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the projector augmented wave method. The thermodynamically stable (101) surface of anatase TiO2 with three-layer thick and 3x3 supercell was created, which was composed of 54 Ti and 108 O atoms. For the model of carbon-coated TiO2, one layer of graphene was placed on the surface of TiO2 model. In addition, one hydroxyl group was introduced on the surface of graphene to present the hydroxyl-containing carbon-coated TiO2. DFT + U calculations were adopted to reduce the impact of 3d electrons of Ti on electronic structure of TiO2. The value of Ueff was 5.5 eV by setting U = 6.0 and J = 0.5 parameters in INCAR were applied [51]. The vacuum slab on the model surface was set to 20 Å to eliminate the impact of periodic structure. The calculation precision was normal and the cutoff of value of plane wave was 500 eV. The Gamma k-points were 3 × 3 × 1 for these model catalysts. In calculations, the bottom two-layers of TiO2 were fixed."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"3.1 Photocatalytic activity evaluation We firstly explore the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-W and TiO2-T-W in the hydrogen evolution reaction from water under irradiation of Xenon lamp (Fig. 1 a). TiO2-500-W exhibited the higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2-W, TiO2-400-W and TiO2-600-W. According to XRD analysis (Fig. S1), the crystallinity of TiO2-400-W is significantly lower than TiO2-500-W and TiO2-600-W, while the rutile phase appeared TiO2-600-W. So, we conclude that the crystallinity and phase structure of catalyst impact the photocatalytic performance, which can be induced by calcination temperature. Therefore, we selected 500 °C as the optimal calcination temperature in the following research. The corresponding H2 evolution rate of TiO2-500-W is determined to be 434.91 μmol h−1 g−1, which is nearly 28-fold higher than that of commercial P25 and about 2-10 times that reported TiO2-based photocatalysts (Fig. 1b, Table S1). If the calcination and washing process are exchanged during the preparation of the catalyst, the color of the obtained catalyst TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air is white and the photocatalytic activities of two samples are only slightly higher than P25 (Fig. 1b). Besides, TiO2-500-W can boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) while TiO2 -W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and P25 had no catalytic activity under the same conditions (Fig. 1c). In recycling experiment, TiO2-500-W exhibited excellent stability. The high hydrogen production still maintained even after four experimental cycles (Fig. 1d). These results demonstrate that the in-situ generated carbon in TiO2-500-W is essential to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 catalyst. The specific function of carbon in the photocatalysis process will be investigated and explicated by the following characterizations and theoretical calculations."
10,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations The morphology of TiO2-500-W is observed by TEM and displays uniform size TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 15 nm (Fig. 2 a and Fig. S2a). HRTEM image reveal that the spacing of crystal lattice of these nanoparticles is about 0.35 nm (Fig. 2b), relating to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. In HRTEM image, it can be clearly seen that there is a layer of carbon coating outside TiO2 (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2b), demonstrating that the structure of TiO2-500-W is a kind of carbon-coated TiO2. SEM images also show that TiO2-500-W is composed of uniform nanoparticles (Fig. S2c). In Fig. 2c, it can be found that the carbon element is uniformly distributed in the sample TiO2-500-W. As a control, the nanoparticles in TiO2-W-500 image are slightly larger than that in TiO2-500-W and present a state of aggregation (Fig. 2d). Compared with TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air, the grain sizes of TiO2-500-W and TiO2-W are smaller (Fig. S2). Besides, it can be clearly observed that there is no carbon layer around TiO2 nanoparticles in the HRTEM images of TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air (Fig. S2). This result indicates that the procedure for preparing the catalyst has an important impact on the nanostructure of TiO2 samples. The presence of boric acid can not only hydrolyze tetrabutyl titanate into anatase phase TiO2 at room temperature, but also avoid the aggregation of TiO2 during the calcination process. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments are conducted to investigate the surface area and porous structure of samples. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of TiO2-500-W (Fig. 2e) and TiO2-W-500 (Fig. 2f) have the property of type IV isotherms, suggesting that the two samples all have mesoporous structure. The BET surface areas of TiO2-500-W and TiO2-W-500 are 135.6 m2/g and 98.5 m2/g respectively according to the adsorption isotherms, further demonstrating that the positive function of boric acid and carbon coat during the calcination on the surface area and porous structure of final products. The large surface area and mesoporous structure make TiO2-500-W have more active sites so that TiO2-500-W shows excellent photocatalytic performance. However, the sample TiO2-W possesses higher BET surface area (274.8 m2/g, Fig. S3) than TiO2-500-W but a lower photocatalytic activity, indicating that surface area is not a key factor determining the photocatalytic performance. The phase structures of samples TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W are investigated by XRD characterization (Fig. 3 a). It can be clearly discriminated that the diffraction profile of TiO2-W has the characteristic pattern of anatase despite that the diffraction peaks are weak and broad. The crystallinity of TiO2-W is about 52.7% according to the calcinations based on its XRD diffraction pattern. In contrast, the diffraction peaks of TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W become stronger and sharper than TiO2-W due to the calcination process at high temperature of 500 °C, suggesting that the crystallinity of anatase in the three samples is improved. Indeed, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W have the crystallinity of 63.9%, 72.0% and 70.1% respectively. In addition, it has been well established that the lattice plane (001) of anatase has excellent activity for hydrogen evolution via water splitting [52]. According to the intensity ratio of the lattice plane (004) to (101) in XRD diffraction patterns, the proportion of lattice plane (001) in sample can be estimated. As shown in Table S2, the intensity ratios of lattice plane (004) to (101) for TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W are 0.27, 0.18, 0.18 and 0.23, respectively. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-W is poor although it has the higher ratio of (004) to (101). TiO2-500-W possessing the best crystallinity and higher exposure ratio of lattice plane (001) exhibits the highest photocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution. So, we conclude that the crystallinity is a major factor for the photocatalytic activity of anatase and the exposure proportion of active lattice plane has some contribution to the photocatalytic performance. Besides, a small and broad diffraction peak at about 2θ = 30.8° appears in the XRD pattern of all samples. The microstructure changes of TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W are further studied by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). All samples showed the Raman characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 at 144 cm−1, 197 cm−1, 399 cm−1, 513 cm−1, 519 cm−1 and 639 cm−1 [52,53]. It has been widely accepted that the intensity and frequency of Raman peaks are related to the grain size of anatase [54]. Along with the grain size of TiO2 decreases, the intensity of peaks at 144 cm−1 will decrease and blue-shift obviously [55]. Compared with TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air, the peak at 144 cm−1 of TiO2-500-W and TiO2-W are wider and show a slight blue-shift, indicating that the grain sizes of TiO2-500-W and TiO2-W are smaller. This analysis is consistent with TEM analysis. This point further demonstrates that the presence of boric and carbon coat prevents the anatase nanoparticles from agglomeration during the calcination at high temperature. Moreover, the exposure proportion of (001) lattice planes can also be described by the intensity ratio of 514 cm−1/144 cm−1 . The ratios of 514 cm−1/144 cm−1 in Raman spectrums of TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W are 0.060, 0.043, 0.045 and 0.053, which is in accordance with the order of XRD analysis. More importantly, it is found that only TiO2-500-W has two obvious peaks at ~1333 cm−1 and ~1600 cm−1 corresponding to the D band and G band of graphitic carbon, which further illustrates that there are graphitic carbon structures in sample TiO2-500-W. FTIR spectroscopy is selected to research the functional groups of all samples (Fig. 3c). All samples have vibration peaks belonged to O-H (3400 cm−1) and water molecules (1630 cm−1) adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 [56]. The absorption band at 1392 cm−1 is attributed to the O=C-O [57]. The spectrum shows a broad absorption peak around 500 cm−1, which is attributed to the Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations [58]. It can be observed that the intensity ratio of Ti-O-Ti vibration for samples TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air are smaller than that for TiO2-500-W and P25, suggesting that the carbon in TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500 and TiO2-W-500-Air may exist in the bulk phase and TiO2-500-W has a perfect phase structure of TiO2 despite of the existence of carbon coat. This makes TiO2-500-W possess excellent photocatalytic performance. In order to obtain carbon content in samples, we conducted thermogravimetric (TG) analysis in air. It is fund that the weight loss of TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W are 11.0%, 3.5%, 2.5% and 5.0% (Fig. 3d), suggesting that more carbon can be remained in sample TiO2-500-W. It is obvious that TG curves of all samples increased slightly after about 400 °C and presented a platform between 500 and 700 °C. To clarify this point, we calcined the sample TiO2-500-W in the air at 400 °C (TiO2-500-W(400)) and 600 °C (TiO2-500-W(600)) respectively, and investigated the ratio changes of oxygen to titanium in the two samples. It was found that the O/Ti atomic ratio in TiO2-500-W(600) was higher than in TiO2-500-W(400) according to XPS analysis (Fig. S4a), which means the oxygen in the air filled the oxygen vacancies of TiO2 samples so that the mass of TiO2 has an increase procedure between 400 and 700 °C during the calcination. XPS survey spectra of TiO2-W, TiO2-500-W, TiO2-W-500-Air were also investigated (Fig. S4b) and the distinct C1s, Ti2p and O1s peaks could be observed. However, B1s peak was not detected because of its low contents in the survey spectra. The fine XPS B1s spectra could be distinguished, which located at 191.9 eV and corresponded to the B-O bonds (Fig. S4c) [59]. No B-C or B-Ti bonds could be deconvolved. So, it was deduced that the trace amount of B maybe existed in the form of Ti-O-B in the TiO2 samples, which would be favor to improve the photocatalytic activity [60,61]. The XPS C1s spectra of TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500-Air and TiO2-500-W displayed three characteristic peaks centered at 284.8, 286.3 and 288.7 eV with corresponding C-C, C-R(H), and C-OOR(H) [62–64], respectively (Fig. S4d). The absence of peak centered at 281.5 eV indicated that there was no Ti-C bond in the three samples. The UV–vis spectra reflect the effect of carbon coat on the band gap of samples (Fig. 3e). TiO2-500-W has a lower optical band gap of 2.82 eV while TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-500-W-Air and even P25 have a larger band gaps than 3.2 eV, demonstrating that the carbon coat on TiO2 nanoparticles facilitates the narrowing of band gap so that improve the photocatalytic performance. This explains why sample TiO2-500-W can catalyze the hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation but TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, and P25 cannot. The lower photoluminescence (PL) intensity of TiO2-500-W than TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500 TiO2-500-W-Air and P25 further suggested that TiO2-500-W can separate photo-induced electron-hole pairs and decrease their recombination efficiently (Fig. 3f). So, TiO2-500-W exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2-W, TiO2-W-500, TiO2-500-W-Air and even P25, which may result from the presence of carbon coat. The transient photocurrent responses of all samples under simulated sunlight irradiation are measured to evaluate the electron-hole separation rate (Fig. 4 a). When light is turned on and off, the photocurrent of all samples increases and decreases rapidly respectively. The sharp rise and fall of photocurrent indicate that the charge transfer in photocatalyst is progressing rapidly. It can be observed clearly that the photocurrent response order is as follows: TiO2-500-W > TiO2-W-500-Air > TiO2-W-500 > P25 > TiO2-W, which is consistent with the order of photocatalytic performance of these samples in hydrogen evolution. It indicates that carbon-coated TiO2 can generate more excited charge carriers under light irradiation so that TiO2-500-W exhibits the best photocatalytic performance. Electrochemical impedance spectra of all samples are also investigated in three-electrode system (Fig. 4b). The smaller diameter of EIS semicircle of TiO2-500-W indicated its less charge transfer resistance (Rct) and superior conductivity than other samples."
11,DFT calculations,"3.3 DFT calculations To further explore the essential influence of carbon coat on the photocatalytic performance of anatase TiO2, we model a thermodynamically stable (101) surface of anatase involving three-layer TiO2 (TiO2(101)), carbon-coated TiO2 (TiO2-G) and hydroxyl-containing carbon-coated TiO2 (TiO2-GO) (Fig. 5 a). It clearly can be seen that there is no energy state in the band gap of TiO2(101) (Fig. 5b). However, in the presence of G or GO as carbon coat on TiO2(101), valence band (VB) tail and conduction band (CB) tail both appear as new energy states in the band gap of TiO2-G and TiO2-GO, which will facilitate the decrease of band gap for TiO2 so that carbon-coated TiO2 such as TiO2-500-W can adsorb visible light and exhibit higher photocatalytic performance. In addition, the workfunction is also a descriptor of photocatalytic activity of catalyst. The smaller workfunction of a catalyst implies that to transfer an electron from the surface of catalyst to infinite is easier. As shown in Fig. 5c, the workfunctions of TiO2-G and TiO2-GO are 4.71 eV and 4.75 eV, being smaller than that (6.88 eV) of TiO2(101). It can be concluded that it is easier for hydrogen ion to achieve electron on TiO2-G or TiO2-GO than on TiO2(101). So, the carbon-coated TiO2, that is TiO2-500-W in our experiments, exhibits the best photocatalytic activity."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism The valence band (VB) of the TiO2-500-W is determined to be 2.67 eV by VB-XPS (Fig. 6 a). Because the band gap of the TiO2-500-W is 2.82 eV according to the UV–Vis measurement, its corresponding conduction band minimum (CBM) should be −0.15 eV. So, the photogenerated electrons at CB have enough potential to reduce hydrogen ions to hydrogen molecules (Fig. 6b). The presence of carbon layer coated on TiO2 facilitates the separation and transmission of photogenerated charges, which has been demonstrated by transient photocurrent response and ESI measurement. Moreover, the VB tail expands the VBM energy to 2.36 eV, which makes the electronic transition easier under irradiation and experimentally demonstrates the rationality of DFT calculations for DOS."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, we developed a simple in-situ carbonation method prepares carbon-coated TiO2 photocatalyst (TiO2-500-W) that shows excellent photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution. Boric acid function as gentle hydrolytic reagent for hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate to generate small TiO2 nanoparticles and template to prevent TiO2 nanoparticles from aggregation during calcination process. Butanol hydrolyzed from tetrabutyl titanate is in-situ carbonized on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles by calcination. The presence of carbon coat decreases the band gap of catalyst and facilitates the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and electron transport, hence carbon-coated TiO2 exhibits outstanding activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This research will guide researchers to develop high efficiency photocatalyst for H2 evolution from water."
