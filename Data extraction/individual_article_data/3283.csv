0,Introduction,"There is a general trend in developing processes to efficiently convert waste organic compounds into new resources. To minimize operational costs and deal with variations in environmental and feedstock parameters, mixed culture fermentation (MCF) has been proposed as a promising approach to realize resources recovery and valuable biomaterials production, such as fatty acids, ethanol, bioplastics and hydrogen (Agler et al., 2011; Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht, 2007). The produced fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, etc.) are also important precursors for liquid biofuels production (Agler et al., 2011; Steinbusch et al., 2008). Compared to gas products (H2 and CH4), liquid biofuels (ethanol, butanol, etc.) offer much more advantages, such as high energy density, easy storage and transportation. Recently, Steinbusch et al. proposed a direct production of medium chain fatty acids (caproate and caprylate) from acetate and ethanol/H2 by mixed cultures (Steinbusch et al., 2011). Medium chain fatty acids, that have a longer carbon chain and lower O/C ratio (oxygen/carbon ratio) than acetate or ethanol, are considered to be much more suitable precursors for biofuels or biochemical by granting higher energy density. The conversion of organic waste by biological processes is difficult and a significant amount of non-biodegradable material remains in the effluents (Xu and Lewis, 2012). For example, Hartmann et al. reported that in an anaerobic digester for the treatment of municipal solid waste, the achieved reduction of volatile solids (VS) was just about 70% (Hartmann and Ahring, 2005). The lignocellulose is the most abundant renewable organic material on the earth, but most of the degradable cellulose (40–50%) and hemicellulose (20–40%) in the biomass is packed with lignin (10–40%) that is resistant to microbial degradation (Abubackar et al., 2011). It was shown that the waste sludge can be converted to syngas as a mixture of H2, CO and CO2 for the benefit of solid residues treatment and energy production (Judex et al., 2012). Therefore gasification is suggested as a good alternative for the resource recovery. The produced syngas can be converted to chemicals in a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. However, after decades of development this route is still rather complicated and the biological conversions can be potentially more efficient. The production of acetate from syngas (for example, H2 and CO2 in Eq. (1)) is a well-known biological process (de Kok et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2011). Also the chain elongation of acetate by H2/CO2 has been described as microbiological mediated processes, such as butyrate (Eq. (2)) and caproate production (Eq. (3) and Eq. (4)). (1) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 2 H 3 O 2 − + H + + 2 H 2 O ; at pH 7.0 , Δ G r 0 ′ = − 95 kJ / mol (2) C 2 H 3 O 2 − + 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 4 H 7 O 2 − + 4 H 2 O ; at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = − 143 kJ / mol (3) 3 C 2 H 3 O 2 − + 2 H + + 4 H 2 → C 6 H 11 O 2 − + 4 H 2 O ; at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = − 97 kJ / mol (4) C 4 H 7 O 2 − + 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 6 H 11 O 2 − + 4 H 2 O ; at pH 7.0 , Δ G 0 ′ = − 143 kJ / mol As proposed by Nie et al. and de Kok et al., homoacetogens can be used to consume H2 and CO2 in fermentation processes which could prevent hydrogen formation and increase the acetate yield (de Kok et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2008). When firstly acetate is produced directly from syngas, it can be combined with a process proposed by Steinbuch et al. converting the produced acetic acid to long chain fatty acids (Steinbusch et al., 2011). These have not only better fuel value then e.g. bioethanol but are also easier to separate from the fermentation medium (Agler et al., 2012; Steinbusch et al., 2011). Therefore, the medium chain fatty acids produced in mixed culture fermentations from H2 and CO2 could offer better biofuel production and lower operating cost. The low solubility of hydrogen in the water phase (around 1.6 mg/L at 1 atm H2 at 298 K) is the main challenge for its utilization (Rittmann, 2007). Vigorous stirring and gas circulation are the common methods to promote the gas transferring from headspace to liquid solution in the gas fermentation reactor, which has a high energy requirement and is hard to scale up (Abubackar et al., 2011; Henstra et al., 2007; Hussain et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2008). The hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor (HFMBR) (Rittmann, 2007) is recently considered as an elegant and attractive technology, in which gas permeates from inside of the membrane lumen and is directly consumed by biofilms naturally attached on the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane without loss of gas through bubble formation, as shown in Fig. 1 . The high specific exchange surface area of HFMBR also promotes a high volumetric gas transfer rate, increases the product generation rate and reduce the investment cost (Henstra et al., 2007; Hussain et al., 2011). Meanwhile, as biofilms naturally formed on the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane, it could be resilient to the environmental stress, allowing low growth rates and avoiding the microorganisms washout in planktonic state (Hussain et al., 2011; Rittmann, 2007). Actually, HFMBR has already been evaluated for reduction or oxidation of NO3 -, ClO4 - and other contaminants with H2 or O2, in which the gas utilization efficient was close to 100% (Lee and Rittmann, 2002; Martin and Nerenberg, 2012; Sahinkaya et al., 2011). Until now there were no reports on fatty acids production from H2 and CO2 in hollow-fiber membrane bioreactors. In a recent overview of technologies for biomass-derived syngas fermentations, the hollow-fiber membrane biotechnology was indicated as a highly promising approach (Munasinghe and Khanal, 2010). Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the in-situ fatty acids production from hydrogen and CO2 by mixed cultures in a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor. Theoretically methane could be produced in such systems. Bromoethane sulfonate (BES), a methanogenic specific inhibitor, can be consumed in mixed cultures at pH 7.0 (Steinbusch et al., 2011). Methanogenic activity is reported to be inhibited at a pH lower than 6 at mesophilic temperatures (Luo et al., 2011). Therefore, in this work pH was controlled at 6.0 to reduce methanogenic activity in the long-term operation. The evolution of fatty acids production, such as acetate, butyrate, caproate and caprylate, was discussed and the microbial community attached on the hollow-fiber membrane was analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,The inoculum and medium,"2.1 The inoculum and medium The configuration of HFMBR is shown in Fig. 1. Its working volume was 240 mL. The inoculum (40 mL) was taken from a mixed culture mesophilic methane production reactor fed with both glucose and acetate. The composition of feeding gas was 60% H2 and 40% CO2, which represents the composition of syngas. The internal circulation rate was about 0.5 L/min to ensure the mixing conditions. The hollow-fiber membrane (0.1 μm diameter) was purchased from Suzhou Huilong membrane technology development Co., Ltd (China). One end of the hollow-fiber membrane was sealed with epoxy resin, while the other end was packed into the gas tube and also sealed with epoxy resin at the joint. The total membrane area was 0.11 m2. HFMBR was initially supplemented with 10 mmol/L BES to inhibit methanogenesis. pH was manually controlled at 6.0 ± 0.2 with 2 M NaOH. This pH was chosen to minimize methanogenesis. The temperature was maintained at 35 ± 1 °C with a water bath. The composition of medium (in 1.0 L distilled water) was, NH4Cl, 500 mg; KH2PO4, 200 mg; Na2SO4, 40 mg; KCl, 50 mg; CaCl2, 10 mg; MgCl2 ·6H2O, 70 mg; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.8 mg; CoCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 3.2 mg; AlCl3, 0.5 mg; NaMO4·2H2O, 0.1 mg; H3BO3, 0.2 mg; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5 mg; CuCl·2H2O, 1.1 mg; ZnSO4·2H2O, 3.2 mg; EDTA (Na+), 3 mg."
3,"Determination of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide","2.2 Determination of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide The content of hydrogen in the headspace was determined with a Gas Chromatograph (Lunan model SP7890, CN) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.5 m stainless steel column packed with 5 Å molecular sieve. The temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 100, and 50 °C, respectively. N2 was used as the carrier gas. The contents of CH4 and CO2 in headspace were analyzed with the same gas chromatograph, but the temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 170, 170, and 150 °C, respectively. And H2 was used as the carrier gas."
4,Determination of volatile fatty acids and ethanol,"2.3 Determination of volatile fatty acids and ethanol The concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ethanol were measured by a Gas Chromatograph (Agilent 7890, CA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 10 m × 0.53 mm HP-FFAP fused-silica capillary column. The column operating temperature profiles were 70 °C for 3 min, then 10 °C/min to 180 °C, hold for 6.5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The samples were filtered with 0.45 μm microfilter membrane and then acidified with 3% (v/v) formic acid before analysis."
5,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of biofilms on the outer surface of HFMBR,"2.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of biofilms on the outer surface of HFMBR The biofilm sample for SEM analysis (SIRION200, FEI, USA) was prepared as follows: the sample was firstly immersed in 5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 12 h, and then was gradually dehydrated in 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions for 15 min each, at last was immersed in 100% 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexamithyldisilazane solution at least 30 min."
6,"DNA isolation, PCR amplification","2.5 DNA isolation, PCR amplification The biofilm was detached from the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane by a vortex mixer (Vortex-Genie 2, Scientific Industries, Inc., USA) and collected in the phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS solution). The composition of PBS solution (in 1.0 L distilled water) was NaCl, 8 g, KCl, 0.2 g, Na2HPO4 1.44 g, and KH2PO4, 0.24 g, the pH was 7.4. DNA was extracted from the collect biomass solutions using the DNA Isolation Kit (Biocolor, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was amplified using the universal bacteria 16s rRNA primers: 27F and 1492R. (Nunoura et al., 2008) The Amplification was carried out with the following program: 94 °C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min."
7,Clone library construction and sequencing,"2.6 Clone library construction and sequencing The methods of clone library construction and sequencing were according to Thomsen et al. (Thomsen et al., 2001), which can be briefly described as: the amplicons were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels, the bands were cut out and then recovered directly with the gel DNA recovery kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China). The recovered products were ligated into a pMD19-T vector (TAKARA, Dalian, China) and then transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells according to the manufacturer's directions. The white clones were obtained by the blue-white screening and were checked by the PCR methods using the M13 primers. The positive clones were selected and sequenced by the ABI PRISMTM 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies Corporation, Shanghai, China)."
8,Phylogenetic analysis,2.7 Phylogenetic analysis The obtained 16S rRNA sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database using the NCBI Blast search program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Closest cultured and uncultured relatives were retrieved from the database. A neighbor-joining tree was made based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences determined in this study and related reference sequences. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed with the MEGA 4.1 (Beta) software. Sequences retrieved in this study were accessible under the accession numbers: JX628605–JX628609 and JX628613–JX628618.
9,Results and discussion,
10,The performance of the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor,"3.1 The performance of the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor The evolution of fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, caproate and caprylate) and biogas during the 80-day operation period under constant inlet gas pressure (0.4 atm) is shown in Fig. 2 . In period I (PI, day 0–17), the acetate concentration increased from 0 to 3.2 g/L at day 17 by growth of homoacetogenic bacteria (Eq. (1)). The initial hydrogen accumulation in headspace was due to the relative thin biofilm on the outer surface of HFMBR. The amount of biomass was not yet enough to convert all supplied hydrogen. After two days, the hydrogen content decreased to below 0.05% and even to 0% as time elapsed. The hydrogen concentration in the liquid was also undetectable (<0.001 mg/L) according to the method of Lee et al. (Lee and Rittmann, 2002). Because the ratio of H2 to CO2 in the feed was 3:2 in our study, i.e. below the stoichiometric ratio, CO2 accumulated in the headspace. The addition of BES in this period prevented the formation of methane. In period II (PII, day 18–30), butyrate started to appear and increased to 0.13 g/L at day 30, which produced from acetate, hydrogen and CO2 via the reverse β-oxidation reaction (Eq. (2)) (Steinbusch et al., 2011). The acetate concentration continuously increased to 4.5 g/L at day 30. In period III (PIII, day 31–64), methane was detected, which meant that pH at 6.0 also could not inhibit methane formation in long-term operation. Therefore 10 mmol/L BES was added once again. Acetate and butyrate increased to the maximum concentration of 7.4 and 1.8 g/L at day 64, respectively. Caproate was initially produced at day 37 which was likely formed from the building blocks of acetate, butyrate, hydrogen and CO2 (Eqs. (3) and Eq 0.(4)) via the reverse β-oxidation reaction (Steinbusch et al., 2011), and the final concentration reached was 0.7 g/L. In period IV (PIV, day 65–80) caprylate appeared and reached 0.42 g/L at day 80. From the building blocks of acetate, butyrate, caproate, hydrogen and CO2, the metabolic reaction towards caprylate by Clostridium kluyveri was likely more complex than for caproate (Steinbusch et al., 2011). We propose that the production of caprylate follows reverse β-oxidation reactions (Eqs. (5)–(7)), but the actual mechanism of caprylate formation needs to be studied in future. Acetate dropped significantly from 7.4 to 2.3 g/L. Butyrate had a slight decline and caproate kept rising to 0.98 g/L. Hydrogen accumulation was observed and the maximum headspace content was 37%. This indicates a decreased microbial activity towards the end of the experiment. (5) C 2 H 3 O 2 − + 18 H 2 + 6 CO 2 → C 8 H 15 O 2 − + 12 H 2 O (6) C 4 H 7 O 2 − + 12 H 2 + 4 CO 2 → C 8 H 15 O 2 − + 8 H 2 O (7) C 6 H 11 O 2 − + 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → C 8 H 15 O 2 − + 4 H 2 O As shown in Table 1 , the net acetate production rate was 6.5 mmol-C/(L·day) in PI. The values of total VFAs production in PII (4.7 mmol-C/(L·day), day 18–30) and PIII (6.3 mmol-C/(L·day), day 50–64) were quite similar to that in PI, indicating rather constant H2 and CO2 utilization rate in the system. The slowdown of acetate production rate and the increase of butyrate and caproate ones suggested the conversion of acetate to butyrate and caproate, as shown in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3). In contrast, the total rate in PIV (day 64–80) was about −8.7 mmol-C/(L·day), illustrating no net utilization of feeding gas. This was supported by the significant increase of hydrogen content in the headspace. As reported before, the toxicity of VFAs is related to their hydrophobicity (Casal et al., 2008; Zaldivar and Ingram, 1999). The hydrophobicity of VFAs increased with the carbon chain number. It was likely that medium chain fatty acids were more toxic to microorganisms than short chain acids at acidic pH. The in-situ removal of medium chain fatty acids would be needed to overcome their inhibition. For example, a hollow-fiber membrane was recently proposed for extracting VFAs from fermentations at pH 7.0, which could concentrate the produced VFAs, increase their production rates and reduce the investment cost (Agler et al., 2012). Steinbusch et al. demonstrated that at pH 7.0, the biomass concentration in the suspended system was 0.76 g/L, the caproate and caprylate production rates were 33.7 and 3.92 mmol-C/(L·day·g-biomass), respectively. The biofilm weight in our study (methods according to Lee et al. (Lee and Rittmann, 2002)) was just 0.012 g, equivalent to 0.051 g/L, so the caporate and caprylate production rates were 31.4 (day 50–64) and 19.0 (day 64–80) mmol-C/(L day g-biomass) at pH 6.0, respectively. Therefore, our specific C6 production rate at pH 6.0 was comparable to that of Steinbusch et al. at pH 7.0 while the C8 production rate was 6 times higher, even though it might be expected that at lower pH inhibition effects of fatty acids increased. As reported by Steinbusch et al., the caporate production rate decreased from 25.6 to 3.9 mmol-C/(L day) as pH decreasing from 7.0 to 5.5, and caprylate was even not detected at pH 5.5 (Steinbusch et al., 2011). Therefore, the biomass activity for medium chain fatty acids production in the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor was better than that of biomass suspended system (Steinbusch one). Likely this is related to a higher resistance towards inhibition for biofilm growth in general (Martin and Nerenberg, 2012; Misiak et al., 2011). Biofilm bacteria have often been suggested to be more resistant towards toxic compounds, although full mechanistic explanations lack in the literature. For example, as shown by Misiak et al. (2011), biofilm reactors were ideally suited to the biological treatment of the toxic compounds, such as 4-fluorobenzoate. Biofilm reactors also allow an increased the SRT of microorganisms, allowing conversions occurring at potentially decreased growths rates due to the presence of toxic compounds (Misiak et al., 2011). This higher resistance combined with a maximized membrane surface area per reactor volume will lead to high volumetric activities needed for large scale applications."
11,Community analysis of the acetogenic biofilm,"3.2 Community analysis of the acetogenic biofilm The outer surface of hollow-fiber membrane gradually changed from white to deep brown color during the enrichment as shown in Fig. 3 A. The SEM images (Fig. 3B–F) also showed that bacteria were naturally developed as biofilms on the outer surface of hollow-fiber membrane. Moreover, the bacteria were mainly rod-shape about 2 μm long as shown in Fig. 3F. Table 2 and Fig. 4 show that Clostridium spp. dominated biofilms attached on the hollow-fiber membrane. As known, Clostridium ljungdahli, Clostridium autoethanogenum and Clostridium scatologenes are the functional microorganisms for acetate and butyrate production from H2 and CO2, and C. kluyveri is a functional microorganism for butyrate, caproate and caprylate production initially from acetate, H2 and CO2 (Abrini et al., 1994; Küsel et al., 2000; Nie et al., 2008; Steinbusch et al., 2011). The percentage of clones related to the above functional bacteria was 57.1%. This population was comparable to those of Steinbusch et al. (57.8% of C. Kluyveri) and Algar et al. (50% of Clostridium ljungdahlii and C. Kluyveri) (Agler et al., 2012; Steinbusch et al., 2011). Besides Clostridium spp., Azospira oryzae was also detected in biofilms, which has been reported to convert ethanol to CO2 using inhibitor BES as electron acceptor (Steinbusch et al., 2011). The need to newly spike BES in HFMBR in our case also indicated BES consumption. Ethanol was not detected in our study, which might be due to that ethanol was consumed within biofilms by C. kluyveri and/or Azospira oryzae. Although the clone library is a common technology for community analysis and the results in this work showed that the dominant bacteria were similar to former works (Agler et al., 2012; Steinbusch et al., 2011), the low sequencing depth of this method hindered a comprehensive characterization of the microbial community structure (Zhang et al., 2012). For example, as shown by Ye et al., comparing to the pyrosequencing results, the clone library could not reflect the whole profile of the bacterial community, especially for the minor community members (Ye et al., 2011). So, next sequencing methods, such as 454 pyrosequencing, are needed to reveal the full microbial community structure."
12,Perspective of the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor,"3.3 Perspective of the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor In a biobased society a large amount of organic material is produced that is difficult to directly use in the fermentation industry (Hartmann and Ahring, 2005). One proposed route for valorization is the gasification and production of syngas. The Fisher-Tropsch process for producing chemicals from syngas is already for long time under development. Biological alternatives based on the activity of acetogenic bacteria might form a good alternative. This study and a few others (Datar et al., 2004; Xu and Lewis, 2012) have shown that microbiologically these conversions are well feasible. A process based on membrane associated biofilm reactors as described in this paper will give many advantages in future process development. It allows an efficient mass transfer and use of hydrogen gas, a protective biofilm environment for the acetogenic bacteria and with a good in-situ product recovery also likely a high productive reactor. Syngas is normally a mixture of CO, H2 and CO2. In this work, the possibility of H2 in-situ utilization in the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor was demonstrated. Recently, some researchers also found that CO could be utilized for ethanol, acetate and butyrate production by anaerobic microorganisms such as C. ljungdahli and C. scatologenes (Datar et al., 2004; Köpke et al., 2010; Küsel et al., 2000). These functional microorganisms were also detected in this work. Therefore, syngas including CO, H2 and CO2 should be studied for VFAs production in future work, but we expect that all major syngas components can be converted. Moreover, for the application of the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor, more work is needed, such as the control of product formation and the integration of separation and purification technologies. The inhibition of methanogenic activity is also necessary for VFAs production in the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor. However, as BES could be biological converted, inhibition of methanogens by BES addition is not a practical solution. An acidic pH is normally considered to be a good method to inhibit methanogens, but pH controlling at 6.0 was also not the ideal solution. Recently, Luo et al. demonstrated that a long-term inhibition of methanogenic activity was achieved at pH below 6 (Luo et al., 2011). But, low pH would partly reduce medium chain fatty acid production activity and shift metabolite distribution. Use of a biofilm process might reduce the inhibitory effect. Short pulses of nitrite addition could be a potential option to inhibit methanogenic activities (Jiang et al., 2011), but this method will lead to a lower fatty acid yield. The hollow-fiber membrane was also recently proposed for extracting VFAs from fermenter at pH 7.0, which could concentrate the produced VFAs, increase their production rates and reduce the investment cost (Agler et al., 2012). This process demonstrated that the anaerobic digestion and fermentation byproducts such as acetate and butyrate could be upgraded to medium chain fatty acids. For a longer carbon chain and lower O/C ratio, the mixture of produced medium chain fatty acids also could be upgraded to biofuels by hydrogen based reduction. Recently, Steinbusch et al. proposed that organic acids could be upgraded to alcohols with H2 as the electron donor (Steinbusch et al., 2008). The H2 utilization efficiency in the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactors would also be improved in this case. Besides, the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor could also be utilized for water treatment application. For example, H2 was a common electron donor for nitrate and perchlorate reduction, and the hollow-fiber membrane bioreactors could increase H2 utilization efficiency and nitrate and perchlorate reduction rates (Van Ginkel et al., 2008). Moreover, the development of functional microbes to efficiently produce target compounds is one main challenge in the biotechnological field (Jang et al., 2012). Therefore, the hollow-fiber membrane based biofilm reactor is of high interest for further development."
13,Conclusions,"For the first time, a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor was successfully utilized to realize in-situ hydrogen and CO2 utilization for fatty acid production by mixed cultures. The main outcomes were: • Before the accumulation of caprylate, hydrogen was not escaping to the reactor headspace, its utilization reached 100% within the biofilms of HFMBR. • Acetate, butyrate, caproate and caprylate were the major products, their maximum concentrations were 7.4, 1.8, 0.98 and 0.42 g/L, respectively. • Clostridium spp, such as C. ljungdahlii and C. kluyveri dominated the biofilms, which were 57.1% of total clones. • HFMBR is a promising technology for syngas fermentation."
