0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, is an ideal substitution to tradition fossil fuels, given its high energy-density and non-carbon dioxide emission [1,2]. One auspicious method for producing high-purity hydrogen is the use of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrocatalytic water splitting. Noble metals, such as Pt, Ir and Ru, represent the most efficient HER catalysts to date [3]. However, their scarcity and high cost hinders their wide applications on stationary and portable device [4]. Hence, exploring low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts to substitute for the platinum group metals is highly recommended. Recently, considerable efforts have been made in the exploration of transition metal-based materials for HER [5–7]. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), featuring a high intrinsic activity, stability, and low-cost, is a promising candidate for high-efficiency HER electrocatalyst in the acidic electrolyte [8–10]. It has been corroborated that the edge planes of the MoS2 play a major role in HER activity while the basal plane is catalytically inert [11,12]. Thus, tremendous studies have been undertaken to increase the number of actives sites, for example through defects engineering [13–15] or by growing different MoS2-based nanostructures with exposed edges [16–18]. Notably, amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) with a low percentage of basal planes and abundant defects and edges are believed to be an excellent catalyst for the HER [19–22]. However, the conductivity of such amorphous MoSx has nonetheless been insufficient and creates large overpotential, impeding the overall HER kinetics, and thus lowering the efficiency of the HER [23,24]. To address this issue, coupling MoSx with a suitable conductive supporting materials is an effective approach for improving the electron transport toward the active sites of catalyst [25]. Easily accessible carbon cloth (CC) is an excellent supporting material for edge-rich MoSx domains. However, its hydrophobic nature limits the wetting area of the precursor/solvent solution, thus reducing the available electrochemically active area [20]. Bose et al. synthesized MoSx on electrochemical and plasma-pretreated carbon fiber paper (CFP) to enhance its catalytic performance [19]. Unfortunately, the morphology of MoSx grown on CFP is rather non-uniform, leading to low electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Therefore, it is of great significance to improve both conductivity and ECSA. Recently, the low-cost and earth-abundant vanadium-based materials have shown promising applications in supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries [26–28]. However, their application in water electrolysis has rarely been reported. Among them, V2O3 is reported to possess a very high electronic conductivity of over 103 S cm−1 at room temperature [29] with good compatibility with electrocatalysts [30,31]. Very recently, Ming et al. reported that combining Ni and V2O3 could synergistically promote the HER activity of Ni in 1 M KOH with proper V/Ni ratios [30]. However, such a synergetic effect has not been fully understood and its universality has not been verified in other HER catalysts systems or in different electrolyte. The beneficial role of V2O3 in HER as a support, therefore, is worthy of exploring. Herein, we prepared a hybrid HER electrode, which consists of V2O3 and MoSx coatings on CC (MoSx/V2O3/CC). The optimal MoSx/V2O3/CC shows a uniform MoSx nanostructure on the V2O3 surface with a large ECSA. The MoSx/V2O3/CC also shows a significant enhancement in conductivity compared to MoSx/CC. The crafted hybrid MoSx/V2O3/CC catalyst exhibits good catalytic stability as well as a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1 and a low overpotential of 146 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2."
1,Experimental and calculation section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The materials used include: vanadium pentoxide (V2O5; 99.5%, Xiya Reagent), ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4; 99.95%, Aladdin Ltd), dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent limited corporation), Ethanedioic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O; 99.5%, Aladdin Ltd), CC (Taiwan)."
3,Preparation of MoSx/V2O3/CC,"2.2 Preparation of MoSx/V2O3/CC Prior to the synthesis of the MoSx/V2O3/CC, the CC (1 cm × 4 cm) was washed for 10 min (each) with acetone, ethanol, and water, in that order, under sonication. For a typical synthesis, 0.75 mmol of V2O5 and 2.25 mmol of H2C2O4·H2O were added to 30 mL of H2O and stirred for 2 h, the homogeneous liquid was obtained. Then, 30 mL of ethyl alcohol was added into the liquid and stirred for additional 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred unto a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL). After that, a cleaned CC was transferred into this solution and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. Following natural cooling down, the CC coated with the products was rinsed with deionized water several times and is referred to as VO2/CC. After drying under vacuum, the VO2/CC was annealed at 700 °C for 2 h in an Ar/H2 (v/v, 80/20) atmosphere. The amount of V2O5 was varied at 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mmol to explore its effect on the performance of HER. The corresponding sample is referred to as V2O3-s/CC (s = 0.5, 0.75, 1). The V2O3-s/CC was immersed in an ammonium thiomolybdate solution (2 wt% of (NH4)2MoS4 in DMF) and dried under vacuum. It was then subsequently thermo-decomposed at 200 °C for 2 h in an Ar/H2 (v/v, 80/20) atmosphere to obtain MoSx/V2O3-s/CC. The sample denoted as MoSx/V2O3-0.5/CC was synthesized by 0.5 mmol V2O5, and MoSx/V2O3/CC references the sample synthesized using 0.75 mmol V2O5, unless stated otherwise. For comparison, we also prepared the MoSx/CC by immersing the CC in the same ammonium thiomolybdate solution, followed by thermo-decomposition at 200 °C for 2 h."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements A three-electrode system with a CHI660D electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai) was employed for the electrochemical measurements. All the samples were directly used as the working electrodes, with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. To evaluate the HER activities of the studied catalysts, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. All potential values mentioned were iR corrected and referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in this study (E(RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.241 + 0.059 × pH). To estimate the ECSA, the double-layer capacitances (C dl) were measured using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.05 and 0.15 V (vs RHE) with the scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1. To understand the electron-transfer dynamics involved in the HER, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at the frequencies range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz, with an amplitude of 10 mV. We also performed a stability test for MoSx/V2O3/CC by cycling from 0.1 to −0.2 V (vs RHE) for 1000 cycles. The LSV was recorded before and after the stability test. The long-term stability test was conducted under a chronoamperometry (CA) method at a fixed overpotential (146 mV) for 10 h."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations To evaluate the surface morphology of different prepared samples, the Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted on a Talos F200S microscope fitted with a probe forming lens; the EDS system, was operated at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on an Ultima III equipment with Cu-K α radiation. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi equipment. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Quanta FEG 250 instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV."
6,Computational method,"2.5 Computational method The spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) was calculated using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [32,33]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation function was applied to all calculations [34]. To measure the pseudopotentials, a projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method was adopted [35]. The energy cutoff for the expansion of the plane-wave basis was set to 380 eV. The energy and force convergence criterion were set as 10−3 eV and 0.05 eV/Å. A slab model with an atomic layer of approximately 9 Å and a vacuum layer of approximately 18 Å in the z direction, was constructed in order to avoid interactions between the layers. The sampling in the Brillouin zone was set with 1 × 1 × 1 by the Monkhorst-Pack method [36]."
7,Results and discussion,"Our approach for synthesizing MoSx/V2O3/CC electrocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The morphologies of the as-synthesized samples were first investigated by SEM. Dense pyramid-shaped V2O3 were uniformly distributed on the fibers of the CC (Fig. 2 a). After the thermo-decomposition reaction, the MoSx/V2O3/CC had a very similar morphology to V2O3/CC (Fig. 2b). The SEM elemental mapping of MoSx/V2O3/CC in Fig. S1a shows that the Mo, S, V and O were each distributed uniformly over the CC, indicating that the MoSx grew uniformly on the pyramid-liked V2O3. However, without V2O3, the corrugated MoSx are randomly distributed on the CC (Fig. S2), which is also demonstrated by the SEM elemental mapping (Fig. S1b). Furthermore, we used HAADF-STEM and TEM to investigate the nanostructures and analyze the composition of MoSx/V2O3/CC, respectively. A clear interface between V2O3 and the ultrafine nanosized amorphous MoSx were observed (Fig. 2c and d). The HRTEM image shows lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.27 nm, which is consistent with the (104) facets of hexagonal V2O3 (JCPDS No.85–1411) (Fig. 2d and e). The corresponding STEM-HAADF images (Fig. 2f) and STEM-EDS mappings (Fig. 2g–i) show that S and Mo distributed on the edge of the V2O3, which again confirms the existence of the molybdenum sulfide phase. The thickness of the MoSx layer is approximately 30 nm. We also performed the XRD to analyze the phase and compositions of MoSx/V2O3/CC (Fig. 3 a). The typical diffraction peaks at 24.3, 33.0, 36.2 and 53.9° are well indexed to the (012), (104), (110), and (116) lattice planes of hexagonal V2O3 (JCPDS no. 85–1411), respectively. Previous studies have reported that thermal degradation of ammonium thiomolybdate below 500 °C was more likely to produce amorphous MoS2 [20,37]. There was no characteristic peak of MoS2 observed in both the MoSx/V2O3/CC and MoSx/CC samples indicating that the form of the present MoSx is amorphous. The surface compositions of MoSx/V2O3/CC and MoSx/CC were further characterized by XPS. Survey spectrum of XPS confirmed the existence of O, V, S and Mo in MoSx/V2O3/CC (Fig. 3b). The high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 3c; it exhibits three doublet peaks, including a well-defined doublet with an electron binding energy (BE) of 229.6/232.7 eV that is assigned to Mo4+ ions, as well as a doublet with electron BE of 230.4/233.7 eV that was likely belong to Mo5+ ions, and a very weak doublet with electron BE of 232.3/235.5 eV, denoting Mo6+ 3d in the MoO3 [23,24,38]. The peak at 227.1 eV corresponds to the S 2s orbital. The S 2p spectrum was attributed to two doublets of S2− and S2 2−, seen in Fig. 3d. The doublet with electron BE of 162.1/163.3 eV suggest the existence of S2−, while the unsaturated sulfur ion S2 2−was observed with electron BE of 163.6/164.8 eV. It has been demonstrated that unsaturated sulfur atoms such as bridging S2 2− are mainly responsible for electrocatalysts of the HER [19–21,39]. The O spectrum can be fitted as two peaks at 532.1 eV and 530.4 eV; the one at 532.1 eV is indexed to the adsorbed O2, while another peak at 530.4 eV corresponds to the bond of V–O. The high-resolution V 2p spectrum can be fitted into three peaks, belonging to V5+(517.9 eV), V4+(516.6 eV) and V3+(515.0 eV) [30,31]. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Mo 3d and S 2p for the MoSx/CC are shown in Fig. S3, and are similar to those of MoSx/V2O3/CC. The valence states ratio of Mo and S within MoSx/V2O3/CC and MoSx/CC are compared in detail in Table S1. V2O3 did not noticeably alter the chemical valence of the as-prepared MoSx. The HER performance of bare CC, V2O3/CC, MoSx/CC, commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and MoSx/V2O3/CC were evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 using a typical three-electrode system (Fig. 4 a). Impressively, our MoSx/V2O3/CC displays an overpotential as low as 146 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Although Pt/C has only a 30 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, MoSx/V2O3/CC still shows much lower overpotential than MoSx/CC (211 mV). It is important to note that the pure CC and V2O3/CC exhibit negligible HER activity. Additionally, MoSx/V2O3/CC shows a significant improvement compared to the sum of V2O3/CC and MoSx/CC LSV curves. The double layer capacitance of MoSx/V2O3/CC catalyst is much higher than in preciously published studies, the performance of our MoSx/V2O3/CC compares favorably with recently reported MoSx-based catalysts (Table 1 ). The obtained Tafel slopes for V2O3/CC, MoSx/CC and MoSx/V2O3/CC were shown in Fig. 4b. The linear portions of the polarization curves in Fig. 4a were fit using the Tafel equation (η = b log(j) + a), where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density. The quantification of b is an important factor that describes the intrinsic characteristic of the catalyst and reveals the basic steps involved [45]. Our MoSx/V2O3/CC shows a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1, which was lower than MoSx/CC (50 mV dec−1) and V2O3/CC (361 mV dec−1), respectively. For HER in acidic solution, three conceptual steps are suggested and described in the following equations: H + + e − → H ads ( Volmer reaction ) H ads + H + + e − → H 2 ( Heyrovsky reaction ) H ads + H ads → H 2 ( Tafel reaction ) The Tafel slopes of Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reaction have been evaluated at about 120, 40 and 30 mV dec−1, respectively [46,47]; a similarity in observed slope values would suggest an analogous process. The Tafel slope of our MoSx/V2O3/CC is only approximately 45 mV dec−1, suggesting that the HER proceeds mainly through a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. To further investigate the influence of the ratio of MoSx/V2O3 on the HER performance, a series of MoSx/V2O3/CC were prepared by simply adjusting the amount of the precursor (V2O5 = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 mmol) (Fig. S4). The MoSx/V2O3-0.5/CC presented an insular morphology attached to the CC and the MoSx/V2O3-1.0/CC exhibited highly spherical morphology aggregated on the surface of the fiber. All of the prepared MoSx/V2O3-s/CC presented improved HER performances compared with the MoSx/CC, as shown in Fig. S5. The MoSx/V2O3-0.75/CC sample prepared with 0.75 mmol V2O5 exhibits the best catalytic activity (Table S2). To explore the electron-transfer dynamics involved in the HER reaction, the EIS was recorded and the obtained Nyquist plots were shown in Fig. 4c. The electrocatalytic HER kinetics of different samples can be evaluated according to their respective charge transfer resistance (R ct) values. The lower R ct value, the faster reaction rate [44,48]. Under the same conditions of the overpotential (140 mV), the R ct values is only 6.43 Ω for MoSx/V2O3/CC but 45.5 Ω and 216.8 Ω for MoSx/CC and V2O3/CC, respectively. Specifically, the R ct values of MoSx/V2O3/CC are nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that of MoSx/CC and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of V2O3/CC. These results indicate that the HER performance was enhanced by the improved conductance of the hybrid structures when V2O3 is appropriately interfaced with MoSx. Furthermore, the electrochemical double-layer (C dl) were also measured under non-Faradaic condition to evaluate the ECSA of various catalysts [49]. The CV curves obtained at scan rates from 10 to 50 mV s−1 for all the specimens are presented in Fig. S6. As shown in Fig. 4d, MoSx/V2O3/CC exhibits a considerably higher C dl (85.0 mF cm−2) than MoSx/CC (4.0 mF cm−2) and V2O3/CC (19.1 mF cm−2), suggesting that V2O3 can greatly enhance the ECSA, thus creating more accessible active sites for HER. The ECSA-normalized LSV curves of the two electrodes (Fig. S7) clearly show that the intrinsic activity of MoSx/V2O3/CC is almost the same as that of MoSx/CC, which further confirmed that the high HER activity of MoSx/V2O3/CC compared to MoSx/CC originates mainly from its higher ECSA and better electron transport. As shown in Fig. 5 a, negligible loss was observed after the 1000 cycles stability test. The overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 only increased 4 mV (0.146 V–0.150 V). To evaluate the long-term stability of MoSx/V2O3/CC, the overpotential was fixed at 146 mV and the resulting curve of density vs time (j vs t) is presented in Fig. 5b. The decay of the HER current was observed to be approximately 11.0% for MoSx/V2O3/CC following evaluation for 10 h. To further give an in-depth analysis of the stability, the corresponding SEM and EDS characterization of MoSx/V2O3/CC before and after stability test were compared (Figs. S8 and S9). It is clear to observed that the morphology of MoSx/V2O3/CC did not change. We further performed the XRD to analyze the phase of sample after stability test (Fig. S10), the characteristic peaks still fit well to the hexagonal V2O3. The above characterizations confirm that MoSx/V2O3/CC has a great stability for HER in the acid-electrolyte. To justify the experimental results and further understand the influence of V2O3 and MoSx on HER, typical V2O3/MoSx heterointerfaces were established and studied by the DFT calculations. Based on the S/Mo ratios from XPS, two clusters named Mo2S5 and Mo2S6 with S/Mo ratios 2.5 and 3.0 were built respectively. In principle, MoSx cluster could connect with V2O3 surface in two ways, which means that the Mo–S–Mo–S four-membered ring placed vertical or parallel on the surface of V2O3. Both clusters are presented herein; the four models are labeled as V2O3/Mo2S5_v, V2O3/Mo2S5_p, V2O3/Mo2S6_v and V2O3/Mo2S6_p (Fig. 6 a–d). It is also found that parallel configurations are energetically favourable at 0.19 eV and 0.33 eV for Mo2S5 and Mo2S6, respectively. The corresponding total density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) are shown in Fig. 6e–h. Overall, three general features can be identified from these data: (i) the Fermi line (dashed green line) falls across the DOS profiles, indicating that they are metallic; (ii) all structures present inter-band states, which help improve the conductivity; (iii) at the Fermi energy (E-EF = 0 eV), MoSx contribution is higher than that of V2O3, suggesting that MoSx shows a strongly metallic feature. Based on these features, it is concluded that MoSx conductivity has been improved. It is worthwhile to further examine the contribution from interface atoms. Using the V2O3/Mo2S6_v model as an example, four interface atoms (Mo, S, V, O) are highlighted in Fig. S11a and calculated the local density of states (LDOS) for these four atoms are shown in Fig. S11b. It is clear that Mo atoms make up the majority a DOS profile at the Fermi energy. Form the geometries, we find that the Mo atom is still four-coordinated, which is same as that in Mo2S6 cluster. However, such coordinated Mo atom is far from full saturation using [Mo2S12]2- or [Mo3S13]2- unit as a reference, as described in an early study regarding amorphous MoSx [38,50]. This means that Mo4d still presents non-bonded electrons. It is also worth mentioning that O–Mo distance (2.11 Å) is notably smaller than that for S–Mo (2.38 Å). Consequently, Mo–V d–d bonding can result, as highlighted by the dashed black line in Fig. S8b, which is metal-metal interaction and helpful to enhance the electron conductivity over the interface."
8,Conclusions,"We have developed an accessible two-step process for synthesizing a new hybrid structure of MoSx/V2O3/CC type catalysts. The optimized hybrid MoSx/V2O3/CC catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 146 mV at 10 mA cm−2, favoring the HER under acidic conditions, and high stability with no significant changes throughout 10 h of the stability test. We attribute the improved HER activity to two aspects: a larger ECSA and a uniform distribution of MoSx on the support as well as better electron transport through the interface of V2O3 and MoSx which is supported by the DFT calculation. This study also provides a new strategy for designing proper metal-oxide–metal-sulfide interface with excellent performance, for use in other energy conversion applications."
