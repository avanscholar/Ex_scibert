0,Introduction,"The bone defect has become a pervasive disease in surgery clinics nowadays. It is of great value to investigate the bone regeneration issue. There are some drawbacks of traditional treatment methods of autograft and allograft, such as lack of donor, infect diseases and immunological response, etc. [1–3]. It has become a significant challenge for researchers to find the proper artificial bone substitutes to repair the damaged bone tissue. To solve this problem, biomaterial scaffolds have been performing a pivotal role in cell culture and bone tissue regeneration [4]. However, biomaterial scaffolds used in bone regeneration need to have a similar structure with natural bone, and possess preeminent mechanical properties, outstanding of osteoinductivity and osseous-integration performances [5–8]. Biomimetic functionalization is a novel and alternative method for preparing biomaterial scaffolds to construct the similar structure of bone. The internal parallel hollow structure of the cuttlefish bone makes the liquid can move freely inside, which is similar to the function of the ordered porous skeletal structure of the bone [9]. These superior performances of cuttlefish bone, especially the sequential structure, well-organized porosity, and high flexural stiffness have made the cuttlebone become the keen object in biomimetics [10–13]. However, biomimetic biomaterials were generally prepared via indirect methods, for example, template method, which was complicated and inconvenient to operate [14]. PVA has been used in many biomaterial applications due to ease of preparation, biodegradability, and physical properties and now successfully used in drug delivery system, injectable bone substitutes and vascular tissue engineering [8,15]. Polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (PVA/SF) nanofibrous heart patch for cardiac tissue engineering was fabricated by an electrospinning technique [16]. Fibroblast cells were seeded on the PVA/SF patches and the results showed remarkable performance of attachment and proliferation on the patches biointerface. Schizophyllan/polyvinyl alcohol (SPG/PVA) nanofibrous were fabricated as a potential wound healing material [17]. Besides, some studies have been reported PVA biomimetic scaffold for bone regeneration. Fu et al. developed 3D printed biomimetic scaffolds to support the growth of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and formation of cell spheroids, which demonstrates that it is potential biomimetic materials for tissue engineering [18]. Wu et al. successfully prepared the lamellar silicate based bioceramic composites with the brick-and-mortar architecture of nacre via the bidirectional freezing technique [19]. The lamellar composites not only possess high mechanical properties but enhance the cell proliferation in vitro significantly and promote new bone tissue formation with the degradation of silicate bioceramics in vivo. Overall, these studies indicated a future direction in designing biomimetic functionalization materials of bone tissue regeneration. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are composed of two-dimensional hexagonal graphite sheets, and are considered a promising material in biomedical applications due to the attractive mechanical, electrical and chemical properties[20–22]. Besides, according to the composition of the bone, the HAP is the main inorganic material and has a great application prospect in bone regeneration [23–25]. As a result, the PVA-based biomimetic cuttlebone aerogel scaffold is first developed by a one-step rapid freeze-drying method for bone regeneration. The prepared aerogel scaffolds not only consist of modified carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) but possess the ordered pores for their structure ( Scheme 1). The effect of MCNTs content on the mechanical properties and hydrophilia was characterized by mechanical tester system and static water contact angle (WCA) measurement. By adding MCNTs, the surface hydrophilicity and mechanical properties were enhanced. Besides, via implanting the MC3T3-E1 cells on several aerogel scaffolds, the performances of the cells adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and mineralization on the aerogel scaffolds were investigated. At last, in vivo study was executed to explore the osteogenesis capability of aerogel scaffolds using a calvarial defect model of SD IGS Rat. It is expected the study could provide a basis for bone regeneration of PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds in the future."

11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of MCNTs,"3.1 Characterization of MCNTs Herein, a homogeneous and stable solution of CNTs was prepared by using a cationic surfactant CTAC dissolved in water to obtain a PVA/CNTs aerogel scaffold. The MCNTs was prepared by the CNTs and CTAC as shown in Fig. 1a,b. The CNTs surfaces are smooth and clear whereas the modified surface is rough and granulated on the surfaces of CNTs (Fig. 1a). This modification profound effects on CNTs stability, as MCNTs dispersed in water maintained homogeneity even after 10 h compared to individual CNTs dispersed in water slow precipitation (≈10 min) (Fig. 1b). MCNTs leads to a proper separation in solution and it has strong stability because of CTAC cationic surfactant formed electrostatic attraction with the negative charge on the surface of CNTs. Besides, the stability of PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.10 wt%) and PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) suspension were studied as shown in Fig. 1c. Several PVA/MCNTs suspensions perform satisfactory stability because they maintained homogeneity even after 10 h."
13,Characterization of PVA-based aerogels,"3.2 Characterization of PVA-based aerogels The different amounts of MCNTs were added into PVA solutions to obtain PVA/MCNTs solutions with 0.05 wt%, 0.10 wt% and 0.15 wt% of MCNTs. PVA/MCNTs aerogel scaffolds were suspended in 50 mL simulated body fluid (SBF) in 37 ℃ incubators to achieve PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds. The morphology of PVA, PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.10 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) and PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds were shown in Fig. 2a. PVA aerogel scaffold had a compact 3D network with ordered porous whose size is about 2 µm. The structure was similar to the parallel sheets of calcium carbonate in the cuttlebone. Besides, the MCNTs are evenly distributed the PVA aerogel scaffolds, respectively. The PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold also has a porous structure containing the MCNTs and circular HAP nanoparticles with diameters of 20–50 nm. For PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.10 wt%) and PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) aerogels scaffolds, the peaks appear at 1360 (D-band), 1583 (G-band) and 2701 (2D-band) cm-1, (Fig. 2b). The three peaks of PVA/MCNTs aerogel scaffolds can indicate the introduction of MCNTs. The X-ray diffraction was researched for the PVA, PVA/MCNTs and PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds. From Fig. 2c, there is a peak at 2θ = 19.5° due to the (101) reflection plane of the PVA. This peak has originated from the PVA semi-crystalline polymer molecules. The crystallinity is the result of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the PVA [27]. A visible peak at 2θ = 26.5° can be attributed to the CNTs in the PVA/CNTs aerogel scaffold [28]. For the aerogels loaded with nanoparticles, the peak at 2θ = 19.5° index to the PVA, the peak at 2θ = 26.5° index to the CNTs and the others peaks could be indicated to crystal phase of hydroxyapatite (JCPDS No. 09-0432). Fig. 2d shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of the PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold, proving the existence of C, O, Ca and P elements in the scaffold. The thermal degradation behavior of PVA aerogel is mainly divided into four stages (Fig. 2e). The first weight loss occurs before 270 ℃, the second stage in the 361–385 ℃, the third stage occurs in the 416–438 ℃ and the four stage is higher than 477 ℃. Besides, we can find that the residual weight of aerogel scaffolds shows a trend, which is PVA/MCNTs/HAP > PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) > PVA/MCNTs (0.10 wt%) > PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%) > PVA. In sum, PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds were prepared successfully, as confirmed by all of these characterization results. The low density, high specific surface area, high porosity and high pore volume of biomaterial scaffolds could promote the cell proliferation and tissue regeneration [29–31]. As shown in Fig. 2f, the PVA-based aerogel has a large wave peak between 500 and 2500 nm, and the peak appears near 1200 nm. The main pore size distribution range is 1000–1700 nm. The pore size distribution of aerogel is consistent with that of SEM. The surface area, volume, density and porosity of aerogels estimated from the mercury intrusion are shown in Table 1. The surface areas of aerogels are 65.93 m2/g for PVA, 61.23 m2/g for PVA/CNTs (0.05 wt%), 62.36 m2/g for PVA/CNTs (0.10 wt%), 63.15 m2/g for PVA/CNTs (0.15 wt%), 61.15 m2/g for PVA/CNTs/HAP. The volume available for filling with liquid in the prepared PVA based on aerogels ranged from 3 mL/g to 3.5 mL/g. There is no significant difference of the density among different aerogels, which is 0.3 g/mL. The porosity of aerogels is 76.03% for PVA, 70.66% for PVA/CNTs (0.05 wt%), 72.40% for PVA/CNTs (0.10 wt%), 72.75% PVA/CNTs (0.15 wt%), 70.10% for PVA/CNTs/HAP, respectively. Thus, the PVA, PVA/CNTs and PVA/CNTs/HAP aerogels could promote the cell proliferation and tissue regeneration due to their physical characteristics. The stress-strain curves of porous aerogel scaffold are shown in Fig. 2g. The PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%) aerogel scaffold could approximate the stiffness with about 3.5 MPa on the dry state stress at 70% deformation. PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%) aerogel scaffold has the largest stiffness compared with other aerogel scaffolds, which is attributed to the addition of MCNTs to PVA to improve the mechanical properties of the aerogel scaffolds. The mechanical properties of PVA/MCNTs (0.1 wt%) and PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) aerogel scaffolds were reduced, because the dispersion of MCNTs in aerogels gradually decrease with the increase of MCNTs. Therefore, PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold was prepared by PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%) aerogel scaffold with superior mechanical properties. The PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold could achieve the stiffness about 4.2 MPa at 70% deformation. PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel possesses greater compression stress compared with the PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%) aerogel, which is due to the HAP deposited on the surface of PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%). The hydrophilic materials allow for fast adhesion and high-efficient seeding of cells [32]. As shown in Fig. 2h, the WCA of PVA, PVA/MCNTs (0.05 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.10 wt%), PVA/MCNTs (0.15 wt%) and PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds are 55.5°, 0°, 0°, 0° and 15.3°, respectively, which manifested the five aerogel scaffolds were significantly hydrophilic materials, and maybe easier to adhere to cells under this condition."
14,Adhesion of cells on aerogel scaffolds,"3.3 Adhesion of cells on aerogel scaffolds Osteogenic differentiation is associated with cell morphology and extracellular matrix. Actin filament refers to the skeleton fiber of eukaryotic cells with a diameter of 7 nm. It is an important factor in the cellular interaction and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which can maintain the morphology, mechanosensing and mechanotransduction of cells. The cell adhesion and spreading behaviors were evaluated by actin staining as shown in Fig. 3. The protruded filopodia and lamellipodia of cells were attached tightly on the surface of the aerogel scaffolds. At day 1, the cells on the PVA, PVA/MCNTs, PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds had spread out and possessed long filopodia, and then the cells spread well at day 3. Moreover, cells had regular forms and extended larger cellular areas on the aerogel scaffolds surface. Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that cells have better adaptation and differentiation on aerogel scaffolds, which are likely due to the multihole, wrinkled and coarse nanoscale surface morphology [33]."
15,Proliferation and ALP activity of cell on aerogel scaffold,"3.4 Proliferation and ALP activity of cell on aerogel scaffold The proliferation assay on the aerogel scaffolds at 1, 3, and 7 days was examined by the CCK-8 method in Fig. 4a. The cell viability of these three scaffolds could not be seen as a significant difference compared with control at 1 and 3 days, but the cells on the scaffolds showed high cell activity compared with control at 7 days. The results demonstrated that the scaffolds do not display cytotoxicity and promoted cell proliferation. ALP is considered as an early marker of osteogenesis differentiation that increasing with the cell-matrix fundamental interaction increase, and mainly expressed during the culture from 7 to 14 days [34–37]. Fig. 4b shows the ALP activity of the MC3T3-E1 cells on the aerogel scaffolds from 7 to 14 days. At 7 and 10 days, the ALP activity of the MC3T3-E1 cells on the aerogel scaffold was higher than cells on control group. At 10 days, PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold had better performance, it was 2 fold higher than that of the MC3T3-E1 cells in the control and the PVA and PVA/MCNTs scaffold in terms of enhancing the ALP activity of MC3T3-E1. At 14 days, cells both on control and aerogel scaffolds, the ALP activity are decreased because ALP is an early marker of osteogenesis differentiation. The ALP expression of cells was analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR analysis mothed. The results as shown in Fig. 4c, At 10 day, PVA/MCNTs/HAP scaffolds had better performance, it was about 2 fold higher than that of the MC3T3-E1 cells on control and was about 1.5 fold higher than that of the MC3T3-E1 cells on PVA and PVA/MCNTs scaffolds. The results demonstrated that cells cultured on PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold exhibited significantly increased ALP compared to other groups. It is suggested that the existence of HAP in aerogel scaffolds enhanced the ALP activity of the cells and promoted the early differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4d, ALP production of the MC3T3-E1 cells on all the aerogel scaffolds occurs as early as 7 days and increases with incubation time culture from 10 days. Fig. 4d shows that there has a discernable increase in the ALP product of PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds compared with other groups at day 10. The reason is that the HAP nanoparticles in aerogel scaffolds enhanced the ALP activity of the MC3T3-E1 cells. Besides, Fig. 4d is also showing that the all groups staining results of ALP activity after 14 days of culture is lower than all groups after 10 days, respectively. The MC3T3-E1 cells will reduce ALP activity culture over 10 days due to ALP is an early osteogenic marker and keep other activities that are required more late stage of osteogenesis. The results established PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold could promote bone formation in the early stage because of the large specific surface area of the scaffolds and the HAP on the scaffolds."
16,Osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of cells on aerogel scaffold,"3.5 Osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of cells on aerogel scaffold The runt-related transcription factor 2 (RunX-2), osteocalcin (OCN) and type I collagen (Coll(I)) play an important role in the osteogenic differentiation progress. The gene expression of cells was examined to investigate the effects of aerogel scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Runx-2 levels were increased after 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment with different aerogel scaffolds compared with the control group. In terms of the osteogenic cascade, PVA/MCNTs/HAP scaffolds induced the gene expression levels of Runx-2 was more than other aerogel scaffolds. The reason is that the ordered porous structure of scaffolds facilitate the flow of nutrients and the rough surface of HAP promotes cell adhesion and proliferation. At the same time, nanometer HAP is gradually absorbed and the absorbed material releases calcium, which is further benefited by osteoblasts use to promote gene expression and osteogenesis. Fig. 5b showed that the OCN was significantly increased cultured in PVA/MCNTs/HAP scaffolds at 7, 14 and 21 days than other groups because the release of calcium ions in HAP promote the upregulation of osteocalcin. Coll(I) is the major protein in the bone matrix, which is synthesized by osteoblasts in late bone formation. The PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds promoted the Coll(I) genes express of the cells that involved in 21 days due to the integration of scaffold and cells promoted the differentiation and maturation of cells as shown in Fig. 5c. It is indicates that the PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold is a material that has a high potential of osteogenicity at late. Mineralization function is the calcium deposition content on the scaffolds at day 21 and is a necessary process of osteoblasts from bone calcification. Thangprasert et al. prepared gelatin/PVA hydrogels for tissue engineering that the separate PVA hydrogel could enhance calcium deposition [38]. In our work, the ordered multi-channels structure of PVA aerogel scaffolds could promote the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and could better promote calcium deposition. The quantitative calcium deposition validated that cells mineralization on PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds was greatly higher than other groups (Fig. 5d). PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold was the top material for inducing the mineralization of cells due to the porous structure of aerogel scaffolds facilitates cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM perfect integration. In addition, nutrient flow and calcium release of HAP can promote osteogenic differentiation and thus improve stromal calcification."
17,In vivo bone formation analysis,"3.6 In vivo bone formation analysis The micro-CT images in Fig. 6a, shown the new bone formation within bone damage area at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-surgery. The qualitative analysis of micro-CT demonstrated that the new bone formation was accelerated when the bone defects filled in PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold at 8 weeks. Meanwhile, the micro-CT quantitative analysis indicated that the PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold could enhance new bone formation in bone defects as shown in Fig. 6b. The bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and bone surface/tissue surface (BS/TS) of the PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold at week 8 than other groups. This may be due to the more osteoinductivity for the HAP nanoparticles on the composite aerogel scaffolds. The new bone (NB) formed was enriched in more collagen fibers. As shown in Fig. 6c, more collagen fibers (blue stained fibers) were formed when the bone defects filled in PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold compared with other groups. The result demonstrated that the new bone formation was accelerated when the bone defects filled in PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold, which was consistent with the Micro-CT analysis. In sum, PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds could promote the bone formation, as confirmed by all of these results."
18,Conclusions,"Multi-channel PVA-based biomimetic cuttlebone aerogel scaffolds consisting of MCNTs and HAP are first fabricated using the one-step rapid freeze-drying method. The structure of aerogel scaffolds was similar to the parallel sheets of calcium carbonate in the mullet bone, and the size of the ordered pore was about 2 µm and the addition of MCNTs excellently improved the hydrophilicity and compression properties of aerogel scaffolds. The ordered multi-channels structure of aerogel scaffolds could promote the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, circulation of nutrients and optimization signaling cascades for osteogenic differentiation. The PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds exhibited the best osteogenic differentiation including cell adhesion, proliferation, ALP activity, target gene expression and mineralization. Finally, aerogel scaffolds were implanted into the calvarial defect model of SD IGS Rat to evaluate osteogenic performance in vivo. The Micro-CT and bone content theoretical analysis indicated that PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffold could availably promote bone formation at 8 weeks. These results were performed without the contribution of endogenous cytokines on the aerogel scaffolds. The rough nanostructures on the surface of ordered porous structure, good mechanical performances and nanometer HAP with osteogenic capacity together supported the fact that the PVA/MCNTs/HAP aerogel scaffolds materials have potential application for bone regeneration."
