0,Introduction,"The over-exploitation and consumption of non-renewable fossil energy in traditional chemical industry have been leading to aggravating energy crisis, global warming and severe environmental pollution [1]. The utilization and transformation of lignocellulosic biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) is an alternative approach to provide renewable materials, valuable bio-fuels and green chemicals in the future [2–6]. In recent years, catalytic conversion of inexhaustible biomass-based chemicals (e.g., 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), furfural (FF), levulinic acid, glycerol, sorbitol, xylitol) have aroused particular interest [7–13]. Among these platform compounds, FF and 5-HMF can be directly obtained from hemicellulose and cellulose and have been widely used in the bio-industry to manufacture a variety of value-added products through various reactions [14–17]. Especially, selective reduction of FF and 5-HMF into furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-furan (BHMF) is of great application value in biorefinery. Because, FA and BHMF are important industrial intermediates widely utilized in producing artificial fibers, pharmaceuticals, crown ethers, furan-based resins, adhesives or the production of liquid biofuels [18–20]. The Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reaction is an ideal reduction technique for biomass-derived aldehydes, which furnishes a very promising alternative to dangerous gaseous hydrogen by using abundant and safe ""sacrificial"" alcohols as H-donor [21,22]. Various catalysts based on metal alkoxides, metal complexes, hydrotalcites, metal oxides or hydroxides, metal-organic hybrids and various zeolites have been applied for MPV reduction of biomass-based carbonyl compounds with alcohols [23,24]. Among these catalysts, abundant Zr-containing catalysts (e.g., zirconium oxide [25], ZrO(OH)2 [20], zirconium phosphate [26], Zr-beta zeolites zeolites [27], Zr-based metal–organic frameworks [28], zirconium alkoxides [29]) are widely used. But there are still some inevitable shortcomings for these catalysts, such as complex preparation process, high cost of nonrenewable raw materials, high reaction temperature, long reaction time or low selectivity of target products [24]. Most recently, Zr-based inorganic−organic hybrid materials have been developed by assembling a variety of organic ligands (e.g. meta-xylylenediphosphonates [30], nitrilotris(methylene)triphosphonic acid [31], 4-hydroxybenzoic acid dipotassium salt [32], cyanuric acid [33]) with Zr4+. Nevertheless, undesirable employment of high-toxic organic solvents (e.g., N, N-dimethylformamide), complex preparation process or high cost in organic ligands may limited its practical application. More importantly, a large number of organic ligands are synthesized from fossil fuel sources. Therefore, the raw materials for preparing catalysts are non-renewable. Consequently, it is desirable and imperative to explore more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable catalysts for MPV reductions of bioderived aldehydes. Recently, several Zr-containing inorganic−organic hybrid materials using natural sources (e.g., phytic acid [24], humic acids [34] and 2,5-furandicarboxylate [35,36]) as building blocks were reported for the transformation of ethyl levulinate into γ-valerolactone. These reports indicate that construction of catalysts from natural materials has huge potential for practical applications due to the cost advantages, non-toxicity and sustainability. Lignin is the second most abundant lignocellulosic biomass fraction after cellulose in nature and shows great application potential owing to its inexpensiveness, accessibility, biodegradability and sustainability [4,37]. Industrial lignin, including lignosulfonate and alkali lignin, is one of the major waste by-products from the pulp and paper industry. Traditionally, most of industrial lignin is directly combusted as a low-value fuel. There's no doubt that this process could lead to serious environmental pollution. Only a minority of lignin is used to produce chemicals or biomass-based materials [38]. Thus, the development of high-value applications of industrial lignin is one of the most important directions of both modern biorefinery and the pulping industry [39]. Lignosulfonate or sulfonated lignin (LS) is abundantly found in black liquor from sulfite pulping process. Sodium sulfite or sodium bisulfite were employed in this process to remove lignin, resulting in the by-products of soluble lignosulfonates (Fig. S1) [40]. As an amphiphilic biopolymer, lignosulfonate has been widely used in the fields of concrete additive, dispersant, modifier, carbon materials, plasterboard, corrosion inhibitor or surfactant during the past few years [41]. Recently, researchers found that lignosulfonate can be used to prepare macro/mesoporous solid acids catalysts by pyrolysis process and proton exchanging. This carbon material was a highly effective catalyst for acetalization of glycerol [40]. However, the application of lignosulfonate as a ligand in catalyst synthesis is seldom reported. Due to the existence of abundant active functional groups (phenolic hydroxyl groups, alcohol hydroxyl and sulfonic groups) in its molecular structure, LS is soluble in water of varied pH and it can coordinate with various metal ions to form metal-biopolymer hybrid material. In this contribution, we aim to prepare a novel zirconium-lignosulfonate polyphenolic polymer catalyst (ZrLS) by using paper industry waste LS as raw materials. The fabrication process only involves a facile, nontoxic and scalable hydrothermal synthesis (Scheme 1 ). We performed extensive characterizations to demonstrate the formation of strong acid-base catalytic sites and robust inorganic-organic framework in ZrLS through strong coordination interaction between zirconium and phenolic hydroxyl group. The ZrLS was explored to be highly efficient for MPV reactions of a variety of bioderived carbonyl compounds to alcohols with 2-propanol (2-PrOH) at low temperature. To elucidate the relationship between catalytic active sites and their catalytic performance, optimizations of reaction parameter and kinetic experiments were conducted. To further investigate the FF reduction mechanism by ZrLS, deuterium isotope tracing experiments, in combination with GCMS analysis and ex situ 1H NMR technique were carried out as well. Moreover, heterogeneity, leaching and recycling experiments were also performed. We anticipate that the results will open new possibilities for exploring low-cost, environmentally friendly, renewable catalytic materials from low-rank lignosulfonate for biomass transformation."

All chemical reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts In a typical procedure, ZrCl4 (5 g) and sodium lignosulfonate (5 g) were respectively dissolved in 15 ml and 50 ml water to form aqueous solution under ultrasound for 5 min. Subsequently, these two solutions were mixed and stirred with magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 15 min. Afterwards, the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and tightly sealed. This autoclave was placed into an oven that had been heated to 120 °C. After hydrothermal reaction for 12 h, the autoclave was taken out and cooled to room temperature by running water. The as-obtained brown precipitates (Fig. S2a) were centrifuged and totally washed with water for 15–20 times and ethanol for 2 times to remove the excess ZrCl4 or lignosulfonate. After the filtrate was neutral, colourless and transparent, the obtained sample was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to afford about 6 g ZrLS (1:1) catalyst (Fig. S2b). For the sake of reading, we abbreviate ZrLS (1:1) as ZrLS in the whole paper. Other Zr-lignosulfonate hybrids were prepared by changing the initial ZrCl4/lignosulfonate mass ratios of 0.5:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1. These catalysts were designated as ZrLS (0.5:1), ZrLS (1.5:1) and ZrLS (2:1) respectively. For comparison, a conventional UiO-66 (Zr) metal organic framework material was synthesised by solvothermal treatment of zirconium tetrachloride and terephthalic acid in N, N-dimethylformamide at 120 °C in an oven for 24 h, according to a previously reported literature [36]. Zr-HAs and Zr-SBA-15 were also prepared according to the previous reports [34,42]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a MERLIN SEM of ZEISS to observe the surface morphologies of different prepared catalysts. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was conducted on a JEM-2100F with EDX analysis operated at accelerating voltage of 200 kV to observe the morphology and elemental mapping of different catalysts. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of different catalysts were obtained from a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. Before testing, all the catalysts were degassed at 120 °C for 6 h. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of different catalysts were conducted using Rigaku diffractometer (D/MAX/IIIA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.543 Å) at ambient temperature from 5 °C to 90 °C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of various catalysts were recorded using a Bruker Vector 33 spectrometer. The thermal stability of different samples was examined using a Mettler Toledo thermal analyser (TG) with temperature from 28 to 740 °C under flowing Ar (heating rate of 15 K min−1). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis (UV–vis DRS) of solid samples were obtained on an UV-2550 spectrophotometry using barium sulfate as background standard to confirm the coordination effect. Pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectra of different catalysts were obtained on a Nicolet 380 equipment using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 to determine the type of acid sites. The amount of Brönsted acid sites was calculated according to 1550 cm−1 characteristic band and the amount of Lewis acid sites was calculated according to 1450 cm−1 characteristic band. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of various samples were examined on imaging photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD system) under ultrahigh vacuum. The acidity and basicity of different samples were determined through temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3/CO2-TPD) by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipment. Firstly, the catalyst was degassed under a flowing He (30 mL/min) at 150 °C for 2 h. Then, the system was cooled to ambient temperature under He. After the sample was adsorbed with NH3 or CO2, the system was purged under a flow of He at 50 °C and the TPD results were obtained from 50 °C to 300 °C under flowing He. The zirconium and sulfur contents in the catalysts and the solution were determined with an ICP-OES equipment (Spectro Arcos FHX22)."
5,Procedures for the MPV reduction of aldehydes,"2.4 Procedures for the MPV reduction of aldehydes The MPV reduction reaction of aldehyde was carried out in a 25 mL pressure tube reactor (Beijing Synthware Glass Co. Ltd.) under oil-heating conditions. Typically, aldehyde (1 mmol), 2-PrOH (10 mL), and catalyst (100 mg) were added into the reactor. After that, the reactor was transferred into a preheated oil bath. After magnetically stirring for a desired time, this reactor was rapidly placed in running water. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged and collected for analysis. Identification of products was conducted using GC–MS (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra) equipped with HP-5MS capillary column (30.0 m × 250 mm × 0.25 mm). The quantification of reduction products was conducted on GC (Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030) equipped with FID detector and HP-5 capillary column (30.0 m × 250 mm × 0.25 mm)."
6,Isotopic labelling experiments,"2.5 Isotopic labelling experiments For isotopic kinetic study of MPV reduction of FF to FA, we used different deuterated 2-PrOH (2-PrOH-d8 and 2-PrOH-OD) as hydrogen source to reveal the reaction mechanism and the rate-determining step. After the reaction, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by GC–MS (Agilent 7890B-5977A) and 1H NMR (JEOL-ECX 500 NMR)."
7,Leaching experiment,"2.6 Leaching experiment In the leaching experiment, the catalyst was filtered out from the reaction system after reacting for 20 min at 100 °C. Afterwards, the FF reduction reaction was allowed to react for another 160 min under identical conditions without ZrLS catalyst. The Zr and S species leached into the reaction mixture were analyzed by ICP-OES."
8,Catalyst recycling experiment,"2.7 Catalyst recycling experiment The reusability test of ZrLS catalyst was performed as follows: After the reaction proceeded at 80 °C for 1 h, the solid ZrLS was separated by centrifugation, and washed several times with 2-PrOH. After dryied under vacuum at 70 °C for 10 h, the ZrLS was employed for the next cycle directly under the identical reaction conditions."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The structure, chemical composition, morphology and physical-chemical properties about different catalysts were characterized by several techniques. SEM and TEM revealed that ZrLS was composed of connected irregular nanoparticles with a size range from 80 to 120 nm (Fig. 1 a–d). The inserted EDS in image Fig. 1d exhibited a strong zirconium signal in ZrLS after the coordination interaction of Zr4+ with -Ar-OH in LS. The corresponding elemental mappings from HAADF-STEM in Fig. 1e and f confirmed the even dispersion and connectivity of -Ar-OH and Zr4+ and homogeneous spatial arrangement of Zr, O, C and S elements throughout ZrLS. Furthermore, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that ZrLS displayed a typical II-type isotherm with an obvious adsorption–desorption hysteresis loop (Fig. 2 a), indicating that the prepared ZrLS was porous [43]. Table S1 showed that UiO-66 (Zr) possessed the largest surface area (1115.7 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.62 m3 g−1) with the smallest average pore size (2.2 nm) calculated from N2 adsorption-desorption. LS and ZrO2 possessed low specific surface area and pore volume. In contrast, ZrLS had medium BET surface area (115.15 m2 g−1), pore volume (0.18 cm3 g−1) and average pore diameter (6.1 nm), respectively. The larger average pore sizes can improve the diffusion of reaction substrates in pores and accessibility of active species. The X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig. 2b showed that ZrLS exhibited a few broad diffractions without obvious crystallinity, further confirming the irregular connectivity between Zr4+ and LS and the amorphous structure of ZrLS, which is unlike ZrO2 having high crystallinity with tetragonal (t) structure. As shown in the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2c), the enhanced transmittance at 1116.7 cm−1 and 1039.6 cm−1 were attributed to the anti-symmetry SO2 stretching vibration and SO symmetric stretching vibration of sulfonic groups in LS chains, respectively. The samples also had a broad weak band at about 655 cm−1 and 520 cm−1, which arose from CS bonds vibration of sulfonic groups, due to the presence of sodium sulfite or sodium bisulfite in sulfite pulping process. These FT-IR characteristic peaks indicated that the sulfonic groups remained after the hydrothermal preparation process. Meanwhile, the FT-IR spectrum of LS and ZrLS displayed the characteristic anti-symmetry -Ar-OH stretching (LS, 1517.4 cm−1; ZrLS, 1512.6 cm−1) and symmetric -Ar-OH stretching (LS, 1460.5 cm−1; ZrLS, 1459.7 cm−1) of the phenolic hydroxyl group from the lignosulfonate chains [44]. These two different types of peaks were narrowed from 57 cm−1 to 53 cm−1 compared with the spectrum of LS, indicating that the phenolic hydroxyl groups of LS were coordinated to Zr4+ ions. The coordination between LS and metal ion was also confirmed by UV–vis DRS (Fig. 2d). Evidently, the LS exhibited stronger absorption between 300–360 nm with a maximum at 350 nm. This electronic absorption band can be ascribed to non-conjugated phenolic groups in the lignosulfonate [45]. For ZrLS, the π→π* absorption band was blue-shifted (˜280 nm from UV–vis DRS spectra), and had relatively weaker absorption in this area due to the metal chelation between large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups on phenyl rings and Zr4+. The UV–vis-DRS patterns of ZrO2 show an absorption band in the range of 205–230 nm which is attributed to the excitation of electron from valence band of O2− (2p) to conduction band of Zr4+ (4d) [46]. TG and DTG analysis were conducted to study the thermal stability of ZrLS and LS in the range of 50–750 °C (Fig. 2e, f). The weight loss of LS was clearly observed in four steps (97.4, 221.0, 265.8, 343.3 °C). These can be attributed to the loss of adsorbed water and the decomposition of organic species, indicating the instability of building block LS. Fig. 2f showed that the decomposition temperature of ZrLS rose to 285.45 °C. The improvement of thermal stability further confirmed the coordination between LS and the Zr4+ ions. We examined and compared the acid/base properties of ZrLS, ZrO2 and other Zr-based MPV reduction catalysts (UiO-66, Zr-HAs, Zr-SBA-15) by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD method (temperature-programmed desorption) (Fig. 3 a, b). Larger amount of NH3/CO2 desorbed and longer desorption time suggested that ZrLS possessed higher contents of acid-base sites as compared with commercial ZrO2. The results also indicated that more acid-base sites of as-prepared ZrLS than other Zr-based MPV reduction catalysts (Table S2). This could be ascribed to the coordination between phenolic hydroxyl groups and Zr4+ promoting the formation of robust ArOZrOAr frameworks that bore both high content of acidic (Zr4+) and basic (O2−) sites during hydrothermal treatment of LS and ZrCl4. In order to have more insight into the Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites of catalyst, pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR spectra were conducted at two desorption temperatures of 110 °C and 250 °C under vacuum condition. As can be seen from Fig. 3c, five IR bands emerged at wavenumber of around 1450, 1490, 1550, 1610 and 1640 cm−1 in ZrLS. These bands were attributed to the pyridine interacting with Lewis acid sites (LA), or Brønsted acid sites (BA), or both of these two acid sites in ZrLS [36]. The Lewis acid sites should originate from Zr centers and the Brønsted acid sites should originate from the SO3H in the molecular structure of LS. The forming reason of Brønsted acid sites (SO3H) in ZrLS is as follows: partial hydrolysis of ZrCl4 in the aqueous solution led to the formation of protonic acid (HCl). The occurrence of proton-exchange between Na+ and H+ impelled the formation of Brønsted acid sites (SO3H). Trace Na element can be detected in ZrLS, while 3.14% Na existed in LS through ICP-OES analysis further confirmed our speculation (Table S2). In addition, the quantitative analysis demonstrated that the amount of Lewis acid sites of ZrLS was 0.231 mmol g−1 at 110 °C and 0.095 mmol g−1 at 250 °C, and the Brønsted acid sites of ZrLS were 0.079 mmol g−1 at 110 °C and 0.031 mmol g−1 at 250 °C, respectively. These values were far stronger than that of ZrO2. More and stronger acidity in ZrLS was favorable for enhancing the adsorption of substrates and activating the carbonyl groups in aldehydes and hydroxyl groups in 2-PrOH, and thus promoted the MPV reduction reaction. Apart from the content and nature of acid-base sites, the strength of active sites in different samples was examined by analyzing the local environment of Zr and O element through XPS technique. The survey spectra in Fig. 3d confirmed the presence of the Zr, O, C and S elements in ZrLS. Zr 3d peaks showed that the binding energies at 180.03 eV and 182.40 eV which were assignable to Zr 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 shifted to a higher level (180.98 eV and 183.32 eV) in comparison with ZrO2 (Fig. 3e). This implied a higher positive charge on zirconium atoms in ZrLS and thus manifested a stronger Lewis acidity of zirconium centers [24]. On the other hand, the binding energy of O1 s belonging to ArOZrOAr coordination interactions in ZrLS was higher than for ZrOZr interactions in ZrO2 and lower than ArOH interactions in LS (Fig. 3f). The medium binding energy of O1s assigned to negative charge on the oxygen atoms manifested the medium basic strength of ZrLS. In addition, a peak at 166.7 eV belonging to S 2p species in ZrLS (Fig. S3), evidently indicated that sulfonic groups were preserved after hydrothermal process and these sulfonic groups in ZrLS could facilitate the formation of Brønsted acidic sites [31]. These results showed the functional groups in LS could stabilize Lewis acidic Zr4+ species and increase the basic contents achieved by the formation of porous ArOZrOAr framework structure, although the ZrOZr bonds in ZrO2 seemed to give enhanced basic strength in comparison with ZrLS."
11,Catalytic performance evaluation of the various catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance evaluation of the various catalysts For our initial catalytic tests, we choose the MPV reduction of FF with 2-PrOH to examine the catalytic performance of different catalysts and the results were listed in Table 1 . As anticipated, the blank run showed that the reduction reaction did not proceed without any catalyst at 80 °C for 1 h (Table 1, Entry 1). Then, different zirconium-containing compounds (ZrO2, ZrSO4, ZrCl4, ZrClO2, Zr(OH)4) were tested (Table 1, Entries 2–6). Neither Lewis acidic zirconium salts (ZrSO4, ZrCl4 and ZrClO2) nor ZrO2 with enhanced basic strength could efficiently catalyze MPV reduction of FF into FA and the furfural diisopropyl acetal (FDIA) derived from acetalization of FF with 2-PrOH was detected to be the dominant by-product (Fig. S6a). Moreover, UiO-66 (Zr), a conventional metal–organic framework, only gave a low FA yield of 10.36% (Table 1, Entry 7). In sharp contrast, Zr(OH)4 showed relatively high catalytic activity with high FA selectivity (97.9%), moderate formation rate (3450 μmol g−1 h−1) and TOF (0.89 h−1). This result was consistent with literature results for effectively MPV reduction of 5-HMF and ethyl levulinate catalyzed by metal hydroxides bearing both acidic and basic sites [20,26,47]. Furthermore, the acidic LS precursor gave scarcely conversion of FF, suggesting that the building block for catalyst synthesis were not active in this reaction under the investigated conditions (Table 1, Entry 8). Gratifyingly, the prepared ZrLS, which had both high strength acidic and basic sites, exhibited the highest conversion (61.1%), FA formation rate (5940 μmol g−1 h−1) and TOF (2.74 h−1) with high selectivity (97.2%) at 80 °C for 1 h among these examined catalysts (Table 1, Entry 10). When the reaction temperature was further raised to 100 °C, a near quantitative yield (96.0%) and extremely high FA formation rate (9600 μmol g−1 h−1) were obtained (Table 1, Entry 13). Moreover, the conversion of FF was remarkably from 43.7% to 61.1% as the initial ZrCl4/lignosulfonate mass ratios was increased from 0.5:1 to 1:1 (Table 1, Entries 9–12). However, further elevating ZrCl4-initial loading amounts has only slightly improved the FF conversion. This is due to the amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate is constant. Lignosulfonate could only coordinate with a certain amount of Zr4+. In addition, the prepared ZrLS had better catalytic activity than other Zr-containing catalysts reported in the recent literature (Zr-HAs, Zr-SBA-15, ZrO2) under comparable or more harsh reaction conditions (Table 1, Entries 14–16). As we discussed above, the contents of the acidic and basic sites of ZrLS were more than ZrO2 and other Zr-based MPV reduction catalysts (UiO-66, Zr-HAs, Zr-SBA-15) by analyzing the results of NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD. Therefore, we speculate that the presence of both acidic and basic sites with appropriate content and strength in the prepared catalytic materials seemed to be key factors for the selective reduction of FF into FA combining with characterizations of catalysts and the above experimental results. In order to confirm our speculation and obtain more insight toward the role of acid-base active sites in ZrLS on MPV reduction, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine and benzoic acid as poisoning additives were separately introduced into the reaction system. In the presence of benzoic acid, a drastically drop of FF conversion and FA selectivity was observed, indicating that the ZrLS catalyzed MPV reduction was closely related to basic sites on the catalyst surface (Table 1, Entry 17). Furtherly, the addition of pyridine also reduced the conversion of FF (Table 1, Entry 18). When the Brønsted acid were selectively poisoned by adding 2,6-lutidine, the catalytic activity of ZrLS was also slightly decreased, indicating that the presence of Brønsted acid in ZrLS can be helpful for MPV reduction of FF (Table 1, Entry 19). By consulting relevant literatures, we know that the poisoning effect of pyridine or 2,6-lutidine is weak when compared with benzoic acid [48]. Therefore, the addition of pyridine or 2,6-lutidine only slightly reduced the conversion of FF due to partial poisoning of acidic sites. These poisoning tests further verified both of acid-base sites are essential for the high catalytic performance of ZrLS in MPV reduction of FF."
12,Influence of hydrogen donor,"3.3 Influence of hydrogen donor The influence of the hydrogen donor on the MPV reduction of FF catalyzed by ZrLS was investigated and the results are depicted in Fig. 4 . When primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol) were used, the acetalization reaction proceeded faster than MPV reduction. A large number of bulky by-products such as furfural dimethyl acetal and furfural diethyl acetal and were obtained in yield of 86.5% and 60.4%, respectively. When tert-butanol was selected as solvent and hydrogen source, we get extremely low conversion of FF, suggesting that the presence of β-H in alcohol is essential for MPV reduction reaction. Therefore, primary alcohols and tertiary alcohol did not work as hydrogen donors. In contrast, satisfactory FF conversion and FA selectivity were obtained when some secondary alcohols such as 2-PrOH, 2-butanol and 3-pentanol were employed as H-donor. Moreover, with the increase of carbon number in secondary alcohol, the conversion of FF decreased a little. The possible reason for this phenomenon is that longer carbon chains of the secondary alcohol could lead to more significant negative steric effect, which hinders the diffusion of substrate molecules into channels of ZrLS. Therefore, 2-proponal was the best H-donor and solvent for MPV reduction of aldehydes over ZrLS."
13,The reaction kinetics study,"3.4 The reaction kinetics study To further reveal the relationship between acid-base catalytic active sites of the as-prepared ZrLS catalyst and their catalytic performance, reaction kinetic experiment was conducted. In order to determine the kinetic data more accurately and avoid mass transfer limitations, the experiment for FF reduction was performed under low reaction temperature (100 °C) with 30, 65 and 100 mg catalysts (Fig. 5 a). It can be observed that the FF conversion increased rapidly with an increase in ZrLS amount. FF conversion can reach 100% by prolonging the reaction time to 2 h with 100 mg catalyst. Meanwhile, the selectivity toward FA also increased from 81% to 96% with the increase of ZrLS amount, indicating more acid-base sites can promote the equilibrium shift from the acetalization reaction toward MPV reduction reaction. The effect of the number of bifunctional acid-base sites of ZrLS on the FF conversion rate was depicted in Fig. 5b. The concentration of acid-base sites was obtained from NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD tests (Table S2). The reaction rate was measured by collecting FF conversion data at 30 min. We can observe that a linear relationship between the reaction rate of FF and the concentration of acid-base sites in ZrLS. This signified that the FF conversion rate had a first-order dependence on the concentration of acid-base sites, supporting that the adsorption and activation of substrate molecule on acid-base sites in ZrLS was the rate-determining step. The effect of the concentration of 2-PrOH on MPV reduction of FF was investigated. The volume of 2-PrOH was changed in the range from 2.5 ml to 10 ml and toluene was added to keep the volume of solvent constant. Fig. 5c showed the effect of concentration of 2-PrOH on MPV reduction of FF to FA at 100 °C. When the concentration of 2-PrOH was only 25%, the FF conversion increased extremely slowly with prolongation of reaction time. With the elevated concentration of 2-PrOH from 25% to 100%, the FF conversion increased more rapidly and 99% conversion was obtained after reaction at 100 °C for 2 h. This result indicated that the concentration of 2-PrOH as both hydrogen donor and solvent is also key factor for the reductive transformation of FF. The effect of concentration of 2-PrOH on the MPV reduction rate was shown in Fig. 5d. TOF value was regarded as the reaction rate, which was calculated according to the conversion of FF within 30 min from Fig. 5c. It’s obvious that the reaction rate of FF also followed a first-order dependence on the concentration of 2-PrOH. The first-order dependence of the hydrogen donor supported a reaction mechanism in which the direct hydride transfer on catalytic active sites was involved in the rate-limiting step. Further information about the catalytic reaction mechanism in ZrLS will be illustrated in the part of Reaction mechanism studies. The effect of the reaction temperature on FF conversion over ZrLS was also studied. As depicted in Fig. 6 a and b, the reaction temperature demonstrated a remarkable effect on the catalytic performance of ZrLS for the MPV reduction of FF from 60 to 80 °C. When the reaction was performed at low reaction temperature (60 °C) for 40 min, both low conversion (27.1%) of FF and selectivity (75.2%) of FA was obtained. The conversion of FF dramatically increased to 77.0% and the FA selectivity also increased significantly to a higher value of 86.0% as the reaction temperature was increased to 100 °C. Additionally, the FF conversion can reach 99.0% with high FA selectivity (96.0%) by prolonging reaction time to 2 h at 100 °C. Meanwhile, the acetalization products (furfural diisopropyl acetal) of FF with 2-PrOH gradually decreased with the raised reaction temperature from 60 °C to 100 °C (Fig. 6b), indicating that the equilibrium shift from the acetalization reaction to MPV reduction can be enhanced by elevating the reaction temperatures. However, the selectivity of FA gradually declined due to etherification of FA with 2-PrOH to 2-(isopropoxy)methyl furan with further increased reaction temperature (120 °C). Therefore, the suitable temperature was 100 °C for preparing FA with high selectivity. Since the content of catalyst was fixed and hydrogen donor was in great excess, we hypothesize that the reaction was a first-order reaction as a function of FF concentration. It's obvious that ln(c0/ct) followed a linear relationship with reaction time t at FF low conversion (Fig. 6c). By calculating the corresponding slope of the plots, the reaction rate constants (k) were calculated to be 0.00407, 0.00992, 0.03226 min−1 for the reaction temperatures of 60, 80 and 100 °C, respectively. On the basis of the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 6d, the apparent activation energy (Ea ) was determined to be 52.25 kJ mol−1 over the ZrLS catalyst for the MPV reduction of FF into FA. This Ea value was lower than our previous Ea value (83 kJ/mol) of Mn-NCA-700 for the same reaction and comparable to those of latest reported heterogeneous catalysts for the production of FA from FF (Table S3). We have also compared our developed ZrLS catalyst for the selective reduction of FF with other earlier reported literatures which were summarized in Table S3. Obviously, ZrLS can produce nearly quantitative FA yield (96.0%) under more mild conditions (80–120 °C). There were mainly three reasons accounting for the excellent catalytic performance of ZrLS with high selectivity: (1) Poisoning experiments authenticated that the catalyst with high content of basic sites was crucial to improve the catalytic activity for MPV reduction. A large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the chains of lignosulfonate can provide abundant and strong basic sites (O2−) in coupled Zr4+–O2− species after coordinating with Zr4+, thus significantly enhancing the conversion rate. (2) Poisoning experiments also indicated that the Lewis acidic sites play an important role in selective reduction of FF into FA. After hydrothermal self-assembly between strong Lewis acid ZrCl4 and lignosulfonate, ZrLS can still retain Lewis acidity with appropriate content and strength. This is another key factor for highly selective reduction of FF into FA because stronger Lewis acidity could promote undesirable side reactions. (3) Previous studies had demonstrated that the Brønsted acidic SO3H groups could also activate the carbonyl group [14,49]. Thus, the inherent sulphonic groups from lignosulfonate chains in ZrLS were the other catalytic active sites contributing to enhanced performance in the MPV reduction reaction of FF. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the raw material for catalyst synthesis is lignosulfonate, a waste by-product of the paper industry. From the viewpoint of the reaction conditions and the cost for catalyst preparation, the ZrLS catalyst had obvious advantages and showed a greater potential in the practical application."
14,MPV reduction of other carbonyl compounds,"3.5 MPV reduction of other carbonyl compounds Besides the high activity of ZrLS in catalytic transformation of FF, the highly efficient MPV reduction of other biomass-based platform compounds is also of great significance. Accordingly, the general scope of the prepared ZrLS was investigated. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), which can be obtained from C6 carbohydrates, is also considered as a versatile platform chemical [50–52]. Clearly, the developed ZrLS exhibited also superior high activity toward 5-HMF and more than 98% conversion with 91% selectivity to the corresponding alcohol was obtained (Table 2 , Entry 3). The only by-product of this reaction was 5-(isopropylmethyl) furfuryl alcohol (the etherification product of reduced alcohol with 2-PrOH) based on the results of GC–MS. This etherification product was also particularly important and could serve as a promising fuel additive owing to their high energy density [53,54]. Another lignocellulose-derivative ethyl levulinate was also efficiently converted into γ-valerolactone with a high selectivity of 91% at 150 °C within 8 h (Table 2, Entry 4). Furtherly, other biomass-based carbonyl compounds were also used as substrates to investigate the feasibility of ZrLS. For example, cinnamaldehyde, citral and veratraldehyde could be successfully reduced into corresponding alcohols with both high conversion (>90%) and selectivity (>90%) (Table 2, Entries 5–7). These corresponding alcohols are important organic intermediates with wide applications in manufacturing pharmaceuticals, flavors and cosmetics, etc. Besides the reduction of bioderived platform molecules, other typical aldehydes and ketones from traditional chemical industry were also tested as substrates to examine the catalytic potential of ZrLS (Table 2, Entries 8–18). In these reactions, high conversions (90–99%) of all substrates with excellent selectivities (91 to 100%) were produced. However, the MPV reductions of ketones with electron-donating alkyl groups were more difficult. For example, higher reaction temperature (150 °C) and longer reaction time (8 h) were needed for 1-phenylethanol to obtain satisfactory yields of acetophenone (Table 2, Entry 18). The wide substrate scope indicates that the ZrLS catalyst was a highly versatile catalyst for MPV reduction of both biomass-based platform compounds and other commercial aldehydes to alcohols."
15,Time course of the MPV reduction of FF over ZrLS,"3.6 Time course of the MPV reduction of FF over ZrLS In order to investigate the reaction pathway, the time course of MPV reduction of FF over the ZrLS catalyst was recorded at 100 °C. Fig. 7 recorded the products distribution during the reaction process of the MPV reduction of FF with 2-propanol. It was observed that FF was completely consumed and FA was produced in a yield of 96% at 100 °C after 2 h. Besides the formation of FA, FDIA (furfural diisopropyl acetal, the acetalization of FF with 2-PrOH) was observed to be the only by-product especially in a short reaction time. It was interesting to note that FDIA was not stable and could be reversibly converted to FF with the increase of the reaction time. Nevertheless, etherification reaction of the generated FA with 2-PrOH didn't happened at the initial stage. After extending the reaction time to 3 h, the FA yield decreased slightly and 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan (IPMA) as side products was formed and increased (Fig. S6b). This result suggested that the Brønsted acidic active sites in ZrLS can also catalyze the etherification reaction of the generated FA with 2-PrOH (Scheme S1) when the MPV reduction of FF was completed. This reaction is also particularly important for the upgradation of biomass because ethers of furfural/5-hydroxymethyl furfural and its derivatives hold particular promise as fuel additives. Further studies on how to increase the Brønsted acidic sites in ZrLS and one-step reductive etherification of furfural/5-hydroxymethyl furfural are now in progress."
16,Heterogeneity and recycling experiments,"3.7 Heterogeneity and recycling experiments In order to prove that the catalyst is heterogeneous, we filtered the ZrLS catalyst from the solvent after 20 min at 100 °C. Afterwards, the FF reduction reaction was allowed to react for another 160 min under identical conditions without ZrLS catalyst (Fig. 8 a). It can be observed that the FF conversion was still maintained at 56.5%. ICP-OES result also showed that there was no apparent compositional change in the filtered sample, implying that no active species were leached into the reaction mixture and the heterogeneous character of ZrLS. Furthermore, the recycling experiments of ZrLS for MPV reduction of FF was investigated by keeping approximately 60% FF conversion at 80 °C for 1 h (Fig. 8b). FF conversion was only slightly reduced from 61% to 58% in seven consecutive reaction cycles and the selectivity of FA remained unchanged in all runs. The recycled ZrLS in the seventh run was characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, FT-IR and pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR. SEM showed that the average diameter of recovered ZrLS catalyst was slightly decreased from 148.9 nm to 134.7 nm due to the magnetic stir in seven consecutive reaction cycles (Fig. S4a–d). XRD patterns and FT-IR proved that the amorphous morphology and microstructures of the recovered ZrLS remained largely unchanged as compared to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. S5a, d). In addition, XPS and the pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR spectra indicated that there was no significant change in the strength and amount of acidity and basicity, and the distribution of Lewis acid and Brønsted acid sites before and after seven cycles of reactions (Fig. S5b, c, e). ICP-OES analyses showed that less than 2.6 and 6.4 ppm of Zr and S species were leached into the filtrate after the seventh round of reactions. This result suggested the loss of a small amount of Zr active sites during process of seven recycling, thus contributing to the slightly decrease of catalytic performance."
17,Reaction mechanism studies,"3.8 Reaction mechanism studies To elucidate the FF reduction mechanism by ZrLS, isotopic labeling experiment in different deuterated 2-PrOH was conducted (Fig. S4). The GC–MS fragmentation showed that the parent ion of the FA in unlabeled 2-PrOH is the same as the FA standard (Fig. 9 a). However, this parent ion increased to 99 when 2-PrOH was labeled (2-PrOH-d8), indicating that one H atom in FA product was replaced by a deuterium (D) atom. To clarify whether the reaction proceeded via direct hydrogen transfer or metal dihydride route (Scheme S2), 2-PrOH-OD was used as H-donor for FF reduction. The mass fragmentation showed that the parent ion of FA product in labeled 2-PrOH-OD was also m/z = 98, which is closely similar to that in 2-PrOH. In addition, the m/z shift equaled to 1 when 2-PrOH-OD and 2-PrOH-d8 were respectively used as hydrogen source (Scheme S3 and S4). These results suggested that there was no H scrambling between O of 2-PrOH and α-C of FF, thus explicitly substantiating that ZrLS facilitate the reduction of FF through direct hydrogen transfer [55]. It is worth noting that in both hydrogenation mechanisms (Scheme S2), the FA molecule contains two Ds using 2-propanol-d8. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed mass shifts (2 and 1 amu, respectively) can be rationalized by the fact that the deuterium in the OD group of FA can exchange the OH groups in the capillary gas chromatograph (GC) column [55]. We also perform ex situ 1H NMR spectra to further prove this mechanism by demonstrating the location of the replaced deuterium (Fig. 9b). It was observed that all samples in 2-PrOH or deuterated 2-PrOH exhibited 4 distinct peaks of FA at 7.33 ppm, 6.24 ppm, 6.18 ppm and 4.39 ppm. The front three peaks were characteristic peak of H atoms on the furan ring. The last peak (Hd) can be attributed to the hydrogen atom at α-C. The ratio of peak height (Hd:Hc) can approximately represent the relative number of H at different locations. It was observed that Hd: Hc in FA standard sample, and FA synthesized in 2-PrOH and 2-PrOH-OD is around 2:1. However, slight chemical shift of Hd between FA formed in 2-PrOH-d8 and normal FA occurred. Meanwhile, the ratio of peak height (Hd: Hc) decreased to 1:1, implying that one hydrogen atoms at the α-C was replaced by deuterium atom. Furtherly, the reaction rate for the reduction of FF in normal (kH) 2-PrOH and isotopic (kD) 2-PrOH was determined respectively under the same conditions. In the case of 2-PrOH-OD, no KIE (intermolecular kinetic isotope effect) was observed (kH/kD = 1.16). In contrast, a larger KIE of 2.286 was observed when 2-PrOH-d8 was used as hydrogen source. The different kinetic isotope effect further corroborate that the reaction involves the cleavage of β-H in 2-PrOH and this direct hydride transfer step between aldehyde and alcohol was the rate-determining step for MPV reduction. As discussed above, the Lewis acid-base couple sites and Brønsted acid sites were crucial for the MPV reaction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. In combination with the results of physicochemical characterizations, catalytic performance evaluation, poisoning experiments, dynamics experiment, isotopic tracing experiments and previous reports, we proposed a plausible reaction mechanism for ZrLS catalyzed reduction of carbonyl compounds (Scheme 2 ). In the first step, 2-PrOH was adsorbed on ZrLS, resulting in its dissociation to alkoxide and hydrogen by the acid–basic coupled sites (Zr4+ O2−). Meanwhile, the deprotonation of 2-PrOH was enhanced by the basic phenate O2− atoms [24]. The carbonyl group in the substrate molecules was activated by Lewis acidic Zr4+ species or electron-withdrawing Brønsted acid sites (sulfonic groups) [49,56]. Next, the six-membered ring transition state was formed with carbonyl groups and 2-PrOH, leading to direct hydride transfer via β-H elimination and yielding corresponding alcohols and acetone."
18,Conclusions,"In summary, we have constructed a Zr-containing catalyst, using lignosulfonate, a by-product from sulphite pulping process, as the building block. The resulting ZrLS possessed high activity in the MPV reduction of biomass-derived oxygenates, especially for the reduction of FF to FA in quantitative yields (96%) under mild conditions (80 °C within 3 h). Compared with previous reports, our prepared ZrLS has three significant advantages: i) From waste to wealth: the raw material lignosulfonate is renewable, low-cost and abundant, ii) The fabrication process only involves a facile, nontoxic and scalable hydrothermal synthesis, and iii) the inherent sulfonic groups in lignosulphonate could serve as Brønsted acidic sites avoiding the use of hazardous sulfonating agents. Kinetic studies revealed that Ea of the MPV reduction of FF was estimated to be 52.25 kJ/mol. Mechanism studies indicated that the cooperative role of strong Lewis acid-base couple sites (Zr4+−O2−) and moderate Brønsted acidic sites (−SO3H) in ZrLS contributed to the outstanding catalytic performance in MPV reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrated direct hydrogen transfer from α-C of 2-PrOH to the α-C of FF based on the formation of six-membered intermediates was the rate-determining step. Furtherly, the ZrLS could be reused at least seven consecutive cycles with no distinct changes in activity and structures. The utilization of lignocellulosic derivatives as feedstocks for both fabricating highly active biomacromolecule catalysts and producing valuable platform chemicals in this study presents a sustainable chemical conversion process."
