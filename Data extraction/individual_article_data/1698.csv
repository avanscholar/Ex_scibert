0,Introduction,"Scaffolds are three-dimensional porous structures used in regenerative medicine because they mimic the extracellular matrix of tissues and stimulate biological responses at the molecular level. The electrospinning technique is one of the most used to obtain scaffolds. It is based on the application of high voltage to a needle through which a polymeric solution is passed, resulting in the formation of the Taylor cone. When the electrostatic force inside the Taylor cone becomes greater than the surface tension, the polymer solution is released in the form of jets that are deposited as nanofibres in a distant collector. Furthermore, it is a simple and inexpensive method compared to bioprinting [1–4]. One of the biggest challenges in wound healing is bacterial infections. Conventional synthetic antibiotics are used to control these infections, but inappropriate use of these drugs can lead to toxicity and bacterial resistance [5]. From the deacetylation of chitin (the second most abundant natural polymer in the world), chitosan (CS) is obtained, a biopolymer with excellent antimicrobial activity, due to the positively charged amino groups in its chain. Furthermore, it is biocompatible, biodegradable, and has healing properties [6–9]. However, natural polymers and derivative nanofibres are difficult to obtain because of their poor mechanical properties [10]. The case of chitosan is even more critical because the repulsive interactions between the positive charges in its chain cause the dramatic increase of viscosity of aqueous solutions with increasing concentration, hindering the electrospinning process and preventing the formation of a continuous nanofibre. For this reason, high concentrations of acid are commonly used to make it possible to obtain chitosan scaffolds, which concern the biocompatibility of the final product. To reduce the amount of acid in the solution, a widely used alternative is the development of blends with synthetic polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which has numerous biomedical applications thanks to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and hydrophilicity [11–14]. There are studies in the literature that show the development of chitosan and PVA scaffolds. However, normally other materials are added in order to increase strength [15–18]. Some authors use other strategies, such as the deposition of PVA nanofibres separately from chitosan nanofibres [1]. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of formulation and procedure parameters in obtaining thick and continuous chitosan/PVA/glycerol nanofibres to be applied in skin care. So far, electrospun nanofibres with this composition (including glycerol) have not been found in the literature."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Chitosan (medium molecular weight and 75%–85% deacetylated), PVA (PVA1; Mw 146.000–186.000 and 99.3%–100% hydrolysed), deuterated solvents and rhodamine were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, Brazil); PVA (PVA2; viscosity (4% in water, 20 °C) 40–48 mPas and 86.5%–89.5% hydrolysed) and sodium hydroxide P.A. from Vetec (Duque de Caxias, Brazil); Glacial acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and glycerol from Synth (Diadema, Brazil); Absolute ethyl alcohol 99.8% P.A. from Neon (Suzano, Brazil); Microorganisms, antimicrobials, and culture media from Newprov (Pinhais, Brazil), and ultrapure water purified by a Milli-Q purification system from Millipore (Milford, USA)."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Chitosan purification Five grams of crude chitosan (CS2) were weighed and dispersed in 1 L of 0.5 mol·L−1 glacial acetic acid solution. This system was kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h. After this period, the obtained solution was centrifuged at 3220 g and 40 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and neutralized with a 10 mol·L−1 sodium hydroxide solution until pH ~9. The precipitate was vacuum washed with ultrapure water then with absolute ethyl alcohol and oven-dried at 60 °C until constant weight. The same procedure was repeated 3 times and thus purified chitosan (CS1) was obtained [19–20]. 2.2.2 Determination of degree of deacetylation of purified chitosan The degree of deacetylation of purified chitosan (CS1) was determined by the classical method of potentiometric titration proposed by Broussignac. One hundred milligrams of purified chitosan were weighed and dispersed in 20 mL of 0.1 mol·L−1 hydrochloric acid solution. This system was kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h. After this period, this solution was titrated in a T50 automatic titrator (Mettler Toledo®) with a 0.1 mol·L−1 sodium hydroxide solution. A curve with two inflection points was obtained. The difference between the curve volumes corresponds to the acid consumed for the salification of the amino groups and allows the determination of the degree of deacetylation of chitosan through the equation: % NH 2 = 16.1 V 2 − V 1 x Mb / W where V1 and V2 are the volumes (mL) referring to the first and second inflection points, respectively, Mb is the concentration of NaOH, and W is the mass (g) of the polymer [21]. 2.2.3 Characterization of polymers 2.2.3.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of PVA (PVA1 and PVA2) and chitosan (CS2) NMR experiments were carried out at 70 °C using a Bruker AVANCE III 400 spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm multinuclear inverse detection probe. Base frequencies were 400.13 and 100.63 MHz for 13C and 1H nuclei, respectively. The samples' hydrogens were exchanged for deuterium by successive freeze-drying steps in D2O (99.9%) prior to sample dissolution on the indicated solvents. Chemical shifts (δ) were expressed in parts per million (ppm), and acetone was used as the internal standard for 13C NMR (30.2 ppm) and 1H NMR (2.224 ppm) spectra, together with the indicated solvents. 2.2.3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of PVA (PVA1 and PVA2) and chitosan (CS1 and CS2) Confirmation of the identity of the polymers was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). For this, chitosan solutions (CS1 and CS2) at 3% and PVA solutions (PVA1 and PVA2) at 5% were prepared. 20 mL of these solutions were placed in Petri dishes and oven-dried at 60 °C to obtain films (with approximately 0.2 mm thick) that were evaluated in an Alpha-P (Bruker®) equipment, in transmittance mode, using the attenuated total reflectance technique and the following conditions: 24 scans, 4 cm−1 resolution, and spectral range of 4000–400 cm−1. 2.2.3.3 Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of PVA (PVA1 and PVA2) Two samples of PVA1 and two samples of PVA2 were dispersed in the mobile phase of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 0.01 mol·L−1 with 300 ppm of sodium azide at a concentration of 1 mg·mL−1 and filtered on cellulose acetate membranes with an average pore diameter of 0.22 μm (Millipore®). A sample of each PVA was also filtered on acrylic copolymer membranes with non-woven support with an average pore diameter of 5 μm (Versapor®), simulating the ultrafiltration step of the final polymer solution in the preparation of scaffolds. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular weight (Mn) were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a Viscotek (Malvern®) equipped with a SHODEX SB-806 M HQ column, coupled to detectors in series of refractive index and laser light scattering. 0.1 mL of each sample was injected with a flow of 0.400 mL·min−1 at 40 °C. Data were analysed using Omni SEC software. 2.2.4 Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan (CS2) The antimicrobial activity of crude chitosan was evaluated using the colorimetric microdilution test described by Veiga et al. [22]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosan was determined for the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538). A 5% hydroalcoholic solution of chloramphenicol 100 μg·mL−1 was used as a positive control for S. aureus and E. coli and 1000 μg·mL−1 for P. aeruginosa. Five percent hydroalcoholic solution was used as a negative control. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test. 2.2.5 Development of scaffolds According to Tables 1 and 2 , 96 scaffolds were prepared by electrospinning using 23 factorial designs. The influences of the following independent variables were evaluated: 1) formulation (lower [−] and higher [+] concentrations of polymers and glycerol); 2) raw materials (crude chitosan [CS2] and purified [CS1], PVA of two different brands); and 3) procedure (needle with a gauge of 0.7 mm or 1.2 mm and ultrafiltration or not of the final polymer solutions), on the morphological properties (dependent variable) of the scaffolds. The 96 polymer solutions were prepared by mixing 20 g of chitosan solution, 20 g of PVA solution, and 0.25 g (−) or 0.50 g (+) of glycerol. The crude and purified chitosan solutions were prepared at concentrations of 2% m/m (−) and 3% m/m (+) in an aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid (0.5 mol·L−1) with 5% of dimethylsulfoxide as a co-solvent, under magnetic stirring for 24 h. PVA1 solutions were prepared at 5% m/m (−) and 7% m/m (+) and PVA2 at 6% m/m (−) and 8% m/m (+) concentrations in ultrapure, heated water (100 °C), under magnetic stirring (without heating) for 24 h. Ultrafiltration was performed on acrylic copolymer membranes with non-woven support with an average pore diameter of 5 μm (Versapor®). Each final polymeric solution was subjected to the electrospinning process to produce the scaffolds. The solutions were placed in Hamilton® glass syringes connected to a high voltage source, which ranged from 7.5 to 25.5 kV, depending on the sample. The nanofibres were ejected into a collector with a potential difference at a distance of 14 cm. 2.2.6 Characterization of scaffolds 2.2.6.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphological evaluation of the scaffolds obtained was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a JSM 6360-LV (Jeol®) at 10 kV. The samples were fixed in stubs with the aid of carbon adhesive tape and submitted to vacuum metallization with gold. Fibre thickness measurements were made using ImageJ software. The average thickness obtained for each formulation was equal to the average of 5 measurements at the same image. 2.2.6.2 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) One scaffold was evaluated by atomic force microscopy. The AFM experiment was conducted with Agilent Scanning Probe Microscopy 5500 equipment using the non-contact method, with cantilever NSC14-AlBS (Mikromasch) with force constant of 5 N m−1 and resonance frequency of 160 kHz. Previously, the sample was sputtered in a silicon wafer. An 8 × 8 μm area was scanned and the topography image was analysed. Data processing was performed with Gwyddion 2.85 software. 2.2.6.3 Confocal microscopy (CM) One formulation was analysed by confocal microscopy. For this, the nanofibres were modified with rhodamine (20 mg) via 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylami- nopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 1 mg) and N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS, 10 mg) reaction during 18 h protected from light. The sample was examined by a laser scanning confocal multiphoton microscope, model A1MP+ (Nikon®, Tokyo, Japan), using a 60× objective (NA 1.40 with oil immersion). Fluorescence imaging was acquired by exciting rhodamine using a laser at 561 nm, and emission was captured using filter 595/50 (570–620 nm bandpass). All images were captured with the software Nis Elements 4.20 (Nikon®, Tokyo, Japan)."
4,Results and discussion,"The chitosan purification process presented an average yield of 97% and the degree of deacetylation obtained for the purified chitosan was equal to 79.24%, a value within the range specified by the supplier, indicating that there was no change in the positively charged active amino groups during the purification process. As for the characterization of the polymers used to obtain the scaffolds by NMR (Fig. 1 ), the signals observed between 1.5 and 1.8 ppm, for both PVA1 and PVA2, are characteristic of hydrogens from the CH2 groups, while the signal at 4.03 ppm (not shown) refers to the hydrogen of the CH group [23–24]. Comparing the spectra of PVA1 and PVA2, differences in the degree of acetylation can be observed. Since the hydrogen signal of CH3 of the acetyl group has a displacement of 2.09 ppm, it is concluded that PVA1 is a less acetylated polymer, therefore more hydrolysed than PVA2 (the supplier did not specify the degree of deacetylation of this raw material) [25–26]. The spectra obtained for the characterization of CS2 are shown in Fig. 2 , together with their markings. Characteristic signals of the D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units, especially those referring to the N-acetyl group (179.6 ppm, 22.5/2.09 ppm), were observed [27]. The NMR characterization of CS1 showed similarity with the starting material, possibly reflecting the low concentration of impurities already in the CS2 sample, not observed using this technique. The identity of the polymers used for the production of scaffolds was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Fig. 3 ). In the chitosan spectra (CS1 and CS2), the characteristic peaks of OH stretching between 3600 and 3200 cm−1 were identified; stretch bands of Csp3-H at ~ 2900 cm−1; amide CO stretch bands at ~ 1650 cm−1; NH2 angular deformation bands at ~ 1550 cm−1, and CN stretch bands at ~ 1100 cm−1. The PVA spectra (PVA1 and PVA2) showed the characteristic peaks of OH stretch between 3600 and 3200 cm−1; Csp3-H stretch bands at ~ 2900 cm−1, and ester CO stretch bands at ~ 1750 cm−1. These results are in accordance with those found in the literature [28–29]. Furthermore, in the spectra of the PVAs (Fig. 3), it was possible to observe, similarly to the NMR (Fig. 1), that PVA1 is completely hydrolysed while PVA2 has acetylated groups in its chain. Table 3 shows the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular weight (Mn) obtained for PVA1 and PVA2, with and without ultrafiltration, by SEC. It is observed that the average molecular weights of PVA1 and PVA2 are higher without ultrafiltration (a step performed to simulate the ultrafiltration of the final polymeric solution subjected to electrospinning). This happened because the ultrafiltration membrane retained the higher molecular weight molecules. Additionally, PVA2 has a higher average molecular weight than PVA1. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan is well known. In this study, we performed the determination of the MIC of the crude chitosan to compare with the chitosan concentrations used in scaffolds. As shown in Fig. 4 , the MIC values found for chitosan were 0.62 mg·mL−1 for E. coli and 0.31 mg·mL−1 for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Kavaz, Idris, and Onyebuchi [30] developed chitosan nanoparticles and found MIC values of 0.04 mg·mL−1 for the same strain of E. coli and 0.08 mg·mL−1 for the same strain of S. aureus. These differences in MIC values may be due to the degree of deacetylation of chitosan that the authors used, which is higher than the degree of deacetylation of chitosan used in this study. In previous studies [31], we showed the antimicrobial activity of polymeric films composed of chitosan, PVA, and glycerol through disk diffusion assays. This polymeric blend did not present a measurable halo of inhibition of bacterial growth. However, there was no colonization of bacteria on the films. The images obtained by SEM of all scaffolds produced are shown in Fig. 5 . Nanofibres with different structures and thicknesses were observed. As the objective was to select continuous fibres as thick as those obtained with just PVA (approximately 250 nm), 5 measurements were taken of each sample in different regions of the images, and the average thicknesses were calculated (Table 4 ). The thickest nanofibres were as follows: NF11, NF15, NF59, NF63, NF67, NF71, NF80, NF84, NF88, NF91, NF92, and NF96. However, from these 12 formulations, only 4 were presented as continuous nanofibres: NF59, NF63, NF67, and NF71. NF11 and NF15 were eliminated because they showed many beads, and NF80, NF84, NF88, NF91, NF92, and NF96 were eliminated because they were not as uniform as NF59, NF63, NF67, and NF71. We analysed the composition of NF59, NF63, NF67, and NF71 fibres (Tables 1 and 2) and verified that they were all obtained from CS2, PVA1, and a 1.2 mm gauge needle. The difference between them is that the polymer solutions that originated the NF59 and NF63 samples were not submitted to the ultrafiltration process, while NF67 and NF71 were submitted to the ultrafiltration process. We also verified that the ultrafiltered samples had a higher deposition yield than the non-ultrafiltered samples. Among the ultrafiltered samples (NF67 and NF71), the difference is that in NF67 a lower concentration of glycerol was used than in NF71. Therefore, these results indicate that the sample with the best structure (continuous), greater thickness, and greater yield was obtained from: crude chitosan, PVA1, a larger gauge needle, ultrafiltered final solution, and lower glycerol concentration. NF67 was prepared with a chitosan:PVA ratio of 1:3.5. As mentioned, the purpose of using a polymer blend is to improve the mechanical properties of chitosan with the addition of a synthetic polymer. In this sense, some authors who produced chitosan and PVA nanofibres also found better structures with a higher concentration of PVA [5,13]. Typically, polymers with large molecular weights facilitate obtaining thick and continuous nanofibres. However, in this study, the nanofibres with the best structures were obtained from PVA1, which has a lower molecular weight than PVA2 (Table 3). However, we can observe in the NMR spectra (Fig. 2) that these polymers also show different degrees of deacetylation. This may be one of the reasons for the results obtained. Since PVA1 has a higher percentage of hydrolysis, meaning a lower amount of acetylated monomers, the interaction between its chains is stronger in solution than the interaction between molecules that have more acetyl groups. With stronger interactions, the chains are closer, which allows the accommodation of a greater amount of polymer molecules (higher concentration) in the same volume, which results in lower viscosity, a beneficial characteristic for the electrospinning process. In previous studies [31], we observed that the use of glycerol reduces the hydrosolubility of the chitosan/PVA blend, which is also desirable since these scaffolds are applied over dermal wounds. For this reason, glycerol was added to all formulations. However, smaller amounts of glycerol provided fibres with better structures, which may be because glycerol has a similar affect to the presence of acetyl groups, positioning itself in polymer solutions between the polymer chains reducing surface tension, which means weaker interactions between molecules [32]. In general, increasing the gauge of the needle improved the quality of the deposited nanofibres, which can be considered a strategy for obtaining thicker nanofibres. AFM analysis was used to visualize the three-dimensional structures obtained from the electrospinning technique. Through a cross-section in the topography images, it is possible to observe the profile of the width of the fibres obtained. The width lies at 214 ± 86 nm for the NF83 (Fig. 6A). These values are slightly larger than those obtained by SEM due to the convolution effect resulting from interactions between the tip and the sample [33]. In Fig. 6B, we can see through the confocal microscopy image obtained that chitosan (labelled with rhodamine) is uniformly distributed throughout the scaffold."
5,Conclusion,"Of the 96 samples obtained, NF67 was the formulation with the highest deposition yield with thick and continuous fibres. NF67 was obtained at a 1:3.5 (chitosan:PVA) ratio using crude chitosan; PVA with lower molecular weight, but more hydrolysed; lower glycerol concentration; larger needle gauge (1.2 mm), and ultrafiltration of the final solution. From these results, it can be suggested that the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA was more important than the molecular weight of this polymer for obtaining better quality nanofibres. Although glycerol can help reduce the solubility of this blend, it also disorganizes the polymeric chains in an aqueous medium, making the electrospinning process difficult."
