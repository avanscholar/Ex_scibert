0,Introduction,"Humanity consumes non-renewable energy derived from fossil fuels, biomass, wind, hydropower and solar. Most developed countries such as India, China, US, etc. suffer from high increase energy and electrical power demands such that new power plants needed to be constructed to meet such intensive demands [1–9]. Reducing the use of fossil fuels that release the carbon (IV) oxides (CO2) to the atmosphere is crucial to have a sustainable environment, because CO2 is extremely notorious greenhouse gas (GHG). The problems associated with the emission of CO2 have raised serious concerns over the past two decades with lots of associated investments therein. In order to realize eco-friendly, stable environmental and transitions that are favorable towards societal sustainability, the CO2 gas produced from the earth's crust is expected to be the same as the amount of CO2 gas consumed to maintain the unchanged or balanced CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Therefore, reducing the emission of CO2 and its further regeneration to chemicals and fuels is paramount and expected to be excellent techniques to alleviate the global demands for fossil energy that has a high affinity for pollution and threatens global peace. This could be achieved through mimicking the green plants' photosynthetic process, thereby providing essential assets for major applications in the industries [6,10–13]. Numerous methods have been employed for converting CO2 to various chemicals e.g. biological and chemical transformations [6,14,15], photocatalytic [16–21] and electrocatalytic reductions [1,5,6,12,22-38], hydrogenation and reforming methods [1,27,28,29,37,39–44]. Converting CO2 to various hydrocarbons has been documented as a notable and valuable approach than geological sequestration due to its highly efficient utilization and carbon source recycling abilities. Though efforts made to achieve this through CO2 absorptions, conversion, and activation processes have resulted in certain shortcomings, including high energy demands involve in transferring molecules of CO2 to the active sites, and also lower conversion rates for obtaining the higher value of hydro-chemicals. Among all methods available, electrochemical reduction of CO2 has gained much attention and realized as the unique method owing to several advantages [1,5,6,512,22-38,45–51], such as practical applications of the system, ability to operate the CO2 electroreduction process under mild, moderate and controllable conditions. In addition, electrochemical reduction products could be adjusted by tuning the reaction/operating parameters (i.e. temperature, redox potential, electrolyte), electrocatalysts can be optimized, minimization of CO2 electroreduction by-products at lower contents can be achieved, and also possibility of attaining electrical power (as a drive force) with some additional renewable energy sources (including solar, wind) without generating more CO2. CO2 is an inert and very stable molecule since its carbon atom has the highest oxidation state. This, therefore, necessitates the development of electrocatalysts which are efficient to promote the sluggish kinetic CO2 reduction processes. The electrochemical routes for reducing CO2 involve multiple electrons transfer in an aqueous media using suitable electrocatalysts [52,53]. Various products of CO2 electroreduction via different pathways include formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol, methane, etc. as illustrated in Fig. 1 [54]. Considering the thermodynamic studies for CO2 reduction [55,56], it is highly possible to form a mixture of liquid products (such as formic acid and methanol) and gaseous products (e.g. carbon monoxide and methane) than the single product in an electrochemical cell. Table 1 presents a variety of half-reactions with the electrode potential versus standard hydrogen electrodes (SHE) [52,53]. The electrocatalysts used and electrode potential applied are fundamental factors in determining the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction. The associated challenges here are the capital cost, lower efficiency and/or product selectivity, inadequate stability, degradation of electrocatalytic activities [57–65] which could be categorized into mechanical, thermal and chemical/electrochemical [66]. These challenges experienced by the existing electrocatalysts have made the electrocatalytic conversion technique to be unable to meet the large-scale industrial application requirements. Over the past years, as the clean energy demands increases globally, so also the electroreduction of CO2 progressively increases such that numerous attentions have been made to enhance the electrocatalysts' performance and reaction conditions to overcome the limitations associated with CO2 reduction [5,29,32,34–37,45-49,51,52,67,68]. Considering, all these shortcoming and inherent problems; associated with the other metal electrodes and the superior ability of Cu to produce alcohols, aldehydes, and hydrocarbons which bypass other metal electrodes. These have attracted the attention of numerous researchers to gain better insight and understanding of the Cu reactivity, stability, tuneability to obtain better selectivity and efficiency. Thus leading to numerous studies on the different classes of Cu-based electrocatalysts including Cu-nanocrystals, nanostructures or nanowires, Cu oxides, mixed oxide and oxide derived Cu, polycrystalline Cu, Cu thin-film, bimetallic Cu, etc. Therefore, this review is mainly focused on Cu-based electrodes. We discussed some realized advancements reported on the classes of different Cu-based electrocatalytic materials. In addition, some improvement on the pathways for CO2 reduction to C1-C3 products, new mechanistic insights on the Cu electrodes for the electroreduction of CO2 to C3 and C4 and the roles of the catalyst supports for the realization of more useful products and efficient systems. Additionally, for the furtherance of the effective and practicability of Cu-based electrocatalysts, major frequently unnoticed factors were proposed as the challenges and prospects to foster better improvements of these electrocatalyst materials for CO2 reduction."
1,Environmental impact of CO2 and recent efforts to its utilization,"Since the last centuries, the universe has witnessed the unparalleled energy consumption growths, being stimulated by the increased populations and technological advances. Meeting these increasing growing demands have made the planet turned to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, wool, and natural gases. Notable successes have been established through this means in term of quality of energy produced at low-cost but their uses are unavoidable and more so, they release many compounds including heavy metals, sulfur and nitrous oxides, radioactive materials, CO2, etc. which are extremely toxic to the ecosystem [31,69–73]. Among all these, CO2 is colorless, odorless and appeared to be very harmless on the surface. It is not toxic to human beings; its occurrence is natural and is the primary carbon source of the crops and plants' photosynthesis. However, it is GHG that usually absorbs infrared heats that reflect off the Earth from the Sun. The excess heats are trapped, thereby resulted in an adverse increase in global temperatures. The high rises in concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have been simultaneously linked to the inceptions of industrial revolutions that occurred between the 18th and 19th centuries [14,36,74–79]. This has led to alarming increasing trends in global warming and climate changes which threatening peace of humankind [27,29,80–82]. The world has witnessed remarkable interests in limiting the CO2 emission and ways of reducing the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 to abort and combat the global catastrophes [5,11,14,78,83,84]. Controlling the emission of CO2 has led the scientists to adopt numerous approaches including development of environmentally benign energy source, enhancement of energy efficiencies, improvement of the existing process, capturing and sequestration of CO2, and conversion of CO2 to value-added products and chemicals [3,6,8,35,69,85], hence the main focus of this review."
2,Current efforts to chemically utilize CO2,"Utilization of CO2 for industrial feedstocks to produce the appropriate reaction precursor. Direct application of organic material remains the potentially long-term resources that are sustainable in the use of the energy of renewable sources (from the wind, solar or geothermal) as the only energy input for various processes. Interestingly, scientists have embarked on the applicability and feasibility of CO2 as sources of producing organic chemicals of industrial relevance. Several authors have adopted heterogeneous catalysis to successfully produced syngas, salicylic acid, ethanoic acid, urea, carbonated compounds, formic acid, etc. [35,86–90]. Also, many oxygenated species useful as direct oxidants have been produced via dissociation of CO2. However, CO2 was found very useful for producing styrene from selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and activated carbon-supported iron catalyst has been employed via dehydrogenation reactions of butane, ethane, and propane to produce butane, ethylene, and propylene respectively [91]. Photocatalytic reductions of CO2 to CO, CH4, and CH3OH over TiO2 and ZrO2 catalysts were reported recently[92–97]. Nevertheless, chemically conversion of CO2 to useful products did not only suffer challenges of high capturing costs, separating, purifying and transporting CO2 to users but also energy-intensive e.g. ΔGo= 0 for reactions (Eq. (1)–(5)). (1) Urea : C O 2 + 2 NH 3 → NH 2 CO NH 2 + H 2 O (2) Salicyclic acid : C 6 H 5 OH + CO 2 → C 6 H 4 OHCOOH (3) DMC : CO 2 + 2 CH 3 OH → CH 3 COCOO CH 3 + H 2 O (4) CO for syngas : C O 2 + H 2 → CO + H 2 O (5) Acetic acid : CH 4 + CO 2 → CH 3 COOH"
3,Uniqueness of Cu over the conventional catalysts for CO2 electroreduction,"As far back as the 1980s, the research in the field electroreduction has been gaining widest popularity on investigating the activities of different catalysts especially bulk metal electrocatalysts [98,99,108–115,100–107]. So, it is no more new that a single elemental (metal) electrode such as bulk polycrystalline electrocatalyst has been utilized for CO2 electroreduction [116–122]. Over these years, the variation of CO2 electroreduction products obtained were largely dependent on the physical features of cathodic materials, electrolytes and operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, etc. [85,123–125]. However, the CO2 reduction products' selectivity is strongly influenced by the activation barrier and binding energy of the intermediate species. Moreover, kinetics are powerfully governed by the intrinsic electronic properties of the cathodic surface [78,126]. Various studies after Hori et al., studies on the polycrystalline metal electrodes [127] has led to grouping of the metal electrodes into four classes. Categorically, pure metal such Al, Fe, Ga, Ni, Pt, and Ti produced CO as the main carbonaceous product, but their rate of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been reported to be extremely higher than the reduction rate of CO2 itself, while CO is produced from Ag, Au, and Zn with high current efficiencies [128–131]. However, formate is the primary product of metals like Hg, In, and Sn [128,129,132,133] but the reduction reactions of these metals to formate formation proceed via a mechanism where there is no existence of CO bond breaking. Whereas, metals like Cr, Mo, and W have been reported to be poor metallic electrodes owing to their poor selectivity and poor rate of reduction [134]. Notably, Cu is a well-known catalyst for its ability to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons (HCs) and alcohols. Though, some bulk metal catalysts (eg Ag and Au) were able to reduce CO2 to CO just like Cu, but they are energetic process and the Faraday efficiency (FE) is much lower than that of Cu and also their rate of reactions influenced by the binding energy of the CO intermediate molecules. Fig. 2 presents the schematic mechanism of various metal electrocatalysts for CO2RR [54]. Therefore, Cu catalyst remains a unique electrode having supreme binding energy that can produce numerous alcohol and hydrocarbon products with more superior activities [135]. It is imperative to note here that it is important to tune the binding energy of the reactant intermediates on the catalytic metal surfaces for the production of more efficient high carbon products. Additionally, Cu is the only well-known metal catalyst that is capable of reducing CO2 to alcohol (e.g. CH3OH), aldehydes and hydrocarbons (such as, C2H4, CH4) with higher FE than other bulk metals reported recently without having the binding energy to be influenced by the CO molecule intermediates. In comparing with other metal electrodes, it is the only pure metal electrode that requires more than 2 electrons transfer to reduce CO2 to products with significant FE. Hori 2008; provided the summary of CO2 reduction on these metal electrodes [136] and noted that substantial overpotential is needed to attain −5 mA/cm2 by all electrodes (readers are advised to check Table 3 in the work of Hori 2008 [136]). In addition, the Cu electrode solely produced oxygenated and hydrocarbon products at the intermediate potential of −1.44 V vs SHE [136]. The grouping of these metal electrodes into different classes with respect to their selectivity was further explained based on the binding energy to the key HER and CO2RR intermediates such as *H, *CO *OCHO (surface-bound via O), and *COOH (surface-bound via C) [137]. Also, Cu is the only metal with negative adsorption energy for *CO but positive adsorption energy for *H (Fig. 3 ) [137,138] which could be responsible for its uniqueness to reduce CO2 to products with more than >2e − . The unique ability of Cu to generate multiple products than 2 electrons was attributed to the binding of CO on the surface of Cu [139–141]; because the *CO intermediate ideally bonded to the Cu surface can be better understood from its position in the volcano plot (Fig. 4 ) for CO2RR. In comparison with other metals in the plot, especially Au, which has CO binding energy closest to the ideal value than all other metals in the volcano plot [142], but its selectivity remains a major concern and key reduction products is CO (Fig. 4a). However, Cu which is located on the strong binding position of Au; possesses a higher selectivity towards more CO2RR products that are greater than 2 electrons transfer; which are of great importance as industrial chemicals or fuels [143]. Therefore, the stronger CO binding energy of Cu puts it on a better advantage than Au and other metals in the plot. This was also confirmed as a function of onset potential (Fig. 4b) in the previous study [142], thus emphasizing the relations between the wide-ranging CO2RR activities and the binding energies of CO among the metal under consideration [142]."
4,The chemistry of CO2 reduction: Expectation and realities of the mechanism on Cu electrodes,"The combustion of the organic molecule produces CO2 as the final carbon products, and which is very linear and stable from the thermodynamic point of view. The CO2 reduction final products are usually determined by the cathodic electrocatalysts used in the electrochemical reactions. Generally, this is multistep reaction processes which involve adsorption of CO2 onto the electrocatalyst surface, transfer of protons and electrons, and desorption of CO2 from the surface of the electrocatalyst. It has been proposed that the first step towards a multistep of CO2 electroreduction to the final product(s) is CO2 −• formation on the Cu metal surfaces; both in aqueous and non-aqueous media [129]. Depending on the electrolytes' media and electrocatalysts used, C1 and C2 products such as CO, CH4, and C2H4 are usually produced. Table 1 gives experimental half-reactions of different electrode potentials used in electroreduction of CO2 in aqueous solution at standard conditions [52]. Thermodynamically, CO2 − formation is unfavorable, thereby demands higher potential as −1.9 vs SHE to drive or make a reaction, and transfer of protons occur at a low potential. This makes the reduction of CO2 to valuable products of interest to be more complex and problematic, and instead, mixed products were usually obtained. More so, due to HER, CO2 reduction is a challenging task in the presence of H2O, thereby, making the H2 to become the main product. Kinetically, electrocatalysts must be selectively chosen and designed in a way to suppress the formation of H2 and promote the reduction of CO2 so as to increase the formation of interested products. The typical laboratory set-up for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on the Cu electrode is present in Fig. 5 . From this setup, significantly large numbers of fuels and chemicals have been achieved [81,85,117,144-153]. Presently, CO2 is considered as the major carbon feedstock, substitute for gas and oil to produce different chemicals. Different developmental stages are: matured, current development and future application as presented in Table 2 . In the matured stages, the CO2 is recognized as the unlimited resources where chemicals including urea were produced. However, on the developmental stages, only small numbers have been realized on the industrial scale, giving opportunities for more central researches to rationally access the exploratory technologies. Nevertheless, the German Ministry of Research has demonstrated a unique effort on the utilization of CO2 [37,154] with the goal of conserving fossil fuel reservoirs and reducing the emission of CO2. The electrokinetic experiments on the single-crystal Cu-electrode surface and polycrystalline Cu foil to produce CH4 and C2H4 have been reported at higher overpotential with CO, HCOOH, and H2 as the major products [2,129,155–158]. Kuhl et al. reported the use of NMR to detect 16 products of C1 to C3 and little amount of CH3OH from CO2 conversion with CH4 and C2H4 as the dominant products with FE of about 40 and 25% respectively at the potential of −1.0 V and CH3OH having FE of 0.18% [143]. The authors proposed general enol intermediate as being responsible for several products detected but the detailed mechanism and the precise enol intermediates were not proposed. However, electrolytic conversion of H2 and CO2 on copper-based electrodes to produce CH4 instead of CH3OH opposes the synthesis of the CH3OH using the thermochemical gas phase [146,159–165]. Numerous experimental works have been reported on the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2/CO on different Cu-based catalysts, yet reaction mechanisms are still on debate products [2,26,155–159,166,167-174]. Some authors proposed that COH intermediate for CH4 production [158,169] while many other groups have revealed that electroreduction of CO could lead to similar CO2 product distributions that reinforce the rate-determining step which occurred after the CO formation [26,135,168,175–180]. Identifying the surface-bound intermediates experimentally remains a critical challenge in the electroreduction of CO2 in aqueous media. CO2 reduction to CH4 involves 8 electrons which can also involve the formation of several intermediates and pathways, thus making it problematic to successfully validate the numerous pathways proposed. However, DFT calculation provides a source of inspiration to investigate the catalytic reaction pathways by elementarily inspecting the individual reaction [55,56]. Nonetheless, the challenges of length and time scales related to the electrocatalytic exist in the DFT systems [159,168–174,181]. At the electrochemical interfaces, there are drops in electrostatic potential as a result of charge separations between the Cu electrode surfaces and the electrolyte phases. This may have detrimental effects on the local structure and the stability of the adsorbate surfaces. Therefore, integrating such limitations into DFT models require deep knowledge of electrode-electrolyte interfaces at molecular levels [182–187]. Numerous works have been done to avert these challenges [116,143,185,188–197] but they also present some shortcomings such as lack of solvation and electrolyte inclusions as well as charge separation interfaces thus created a vacuum; such that any of the limitations affect the precision and accuracy quantitatively or unsettle the qualitative trends. Some authors have proposed a detailed mechanistic conclusion based on the free energy calculations using thermochemical techniques, that first reduced the CO2 to CO• over the hydrocarboxyl (COOH⁎) intermediates [30,190] where CHO• was the key intermediate. The reduction of CO• to CHO• was proposed as the rate-determining step that determined the overpotential requirements, and thermodynamically, CH4 and adsorbed oxygenates were favored over CH3OH. Several other intermediates were also proposed by different authors [22,53,117,122,143,166,186,198,199]. Consequently, potential-dependent activation barriers have been proposed which agreed with experimental electroreduction overpotential with CH4 and C2H6 selective over CH3OH on Cu electrodes [186]. Several mechanisms have been proposed and they are thereby summarized in Fig. 6 [52,186]."
5,Pathways for CO2 reduction to C1 – C3 products on Cu-based electrodes,
6,Pathway for CO2 reduction to C1 products,"6.1 Pathway for CO2 reduction to C1 products The CO2 reduction to C1 products includes CH3OH, HCOOH, HCHO, CO and CH4. HCOOH may be formed via 3 different pathways: firstly, by CO2 insertion into metal–hydrogen bond or via direct CO2 protonation with H+ from the solution, where the intermediate formed binds with the electrocatalyst through the atom in a monodentate or bidentate manner as shown in Fig. 7A. The second pathway involves the reactions between the protons and the CO2* radicals as presented in Fig. 7B. Thirdly, the reactions between the hydroxyl group surfaces and CO2 to produce the surface-bound carbonate (Fig. 7C). CO could be formed via *COOH (carboxyl intermediate) formation through the concerted transfer of an electron to CO2 as seen in Fig. 7D [200]. Other C1 products (CH3OH, HCHO and CH4) can be formed through initial formation of *CO, and subsequently hydrogenated to form *CHO, *CH2O (which desorbs as HCHO), and *CH3O (methoxy). The intermediate of *CH3O may then be converted to CH4, thus, leaving the *O to be evolved into H2O [201] (Fig. 7E). On the other hand, CH4 formation can also be originated from *CO formation on the surface. This intermediate hydrogenates to produce *COH on the surface that later produces *C intermediate, which through step-by-step hydrogenation produces CH4 (Fig. 7F) [200]. In addition, two other pathways that differ from the above pathways have been proposed [201]. Instead of the formation of initial *CO, this alternative mechanism starts with bidentate coordination of CO2* through the oxygen atoms, followed by the evolutions of HCO2*, H2OCO* and *CHO. Upon dimerization processes, these intermediates undergo further conversion to glyoxal, which proceeds its reaction to produce *CH2CHO, *CHOHCHO, CH2OHCHO, CH3CHO, and *COCH3 [201]. Finally, at the release of CO, these intermediates become *CH3 that undergo further conversion through the transfer of proton-electron to form CH4 as demonstrated in Fig. 7G [202]."
7,Pathway for CO2 reduction to C2 products,"6.2 Pathway for CO2 reduction to C2 products Owing to some foundational restrictions reported experimentally and also by DFT simulation, a pathway for C2 product formation has been proposed which started from CO leading to the formation of *CHO and *COCHO [203]. The *COCHO was considered as the key intermediate that generates the C2 compounds and that determines the selectivity between C2H4 and C2H5OH which could be converted to glyoxal. This undergoes further reactions to produce acetaldehyde, ethylene glycol and glycolaldehyde. An alternative probable intermediate pathway is *COCHOH formation, which further reacts to form acetaldehyde, ethylene glycol and glycolaldehyde [201] as presented in Fig. 8 ."
8,Pathway for CO2 reduction to C3 products,"6.3 Pathway for CO2 reduction to C3 products CO2 reduction to C3 products has been a critical challenge currently in the field of electroreduction of CO2 to long-chain products. Up till now, acetone, CH3CH2CH2OH and (CH3)2CHOH are the only reduction products reported. It has been hypothesized that adsorbed intermediates of C2 undergo intermolecular CC couplings with the adjacent C1 intermediate which then tailed by the transfer of electron or proton to produce CH3CH2CHO (propionaldehyde) that further reduces to C3H7OH as presented (Fig. 9A) [200]. A possible mechanism of CO2 reduction to acetone and n-propanol or isopropanol is described in Fig. 9B. On the other hand, the HCOads (formed by 3H+ +3e−+ CO2) can couple with a species of C2 to produce adsorbed C3 intermediate. This then results in the formation of acetone and n-propanol or isopropanol (Fig. 9B) [204]."
9,Conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon and alcohol products on Cu-based electrocatalysts,
10,Cu- nanoparticles/nanowires,"7.1 Cu- nanoparticles/nanowires The generation of carbon multi-products from CO2 electrocatalytic conversion processes has attracted a lot of interest in Cu electrodes. Numerous hydrocarbon products are generated from Cu electrode, the selectivity of C−C coupled products in relation to H2 and CH4 have always remained barriers. The Cu electrodes are known for mixtures of hydrocarbon products typically methane, ethylene, and alcohol. The formation of C2H4 on a rough Cu-electrode was reported by Kas et al. [205]. Covering of identical electrodes with Cu nanoparticles was demonstrated to predominantly yield C2H4 or CH4 depending on the concentration of the electrolytes and the applied pressure of CO2. The pH determined near electrode was suggested to be responsible for C2H4 formation which was favored at higher local pH. However, the formations of significant amounts of CH4 were attributed to the rapid deterioration of rates of hydrocarbon productions. Their study provides a substantial mechanism that significantly altered the mechanistic interpretation of C2H4 formation on a rough Cu electrode surface as shown in Fig. 10 [30,158,166,169,205–210]. The activity of operando Cu electrocatalyst nanowires synthesized from Cu(OH)2 was investigated [211] for CO2 selectivity shifting of C0 − C1 to C2 − C3 products. The electrocatalyst was strictly controlled by mesostructures which are potential dependent. The mesostructured Cu- electrocatalyst maintained its stable activity and selectivity for 40 h of CO2 electroreduction. Ethanol, ethylene, n-propanol, and alcohol were produced at low overpotentials by morphologically tuning the electrocatalyst (Fig. 11a) [211]. At moderate potentials (−0.81 V R.H.E), the FE of C2 − C3 products reached 38% (Fig. 11b) [211]. The selectivity shifting of C0 − C1 to C2 − C3 products is relative to the Cu planar electrode after the formation of the hierarchically nanorod morphologies that initiated efficient reaction environments for C2 − C3 hydrocarbons (Fig. 11c) [211]. Their study gave a good insight into promising prospects and opportunities for using multi-length scales in designing electrocatalysts starting from instantaneous interaction occurring at the atomic scale surfaces to the mesoscale morphologies, so as to create active and selectivity for CO2 reduction which is the complicated multi-electron reactions. Schmid et al. [212] fabricated a competent in-situ grown nanostructure Cu electrocatalyst having abilities for a range of transformations of organic functional groups to final products. The authors investigated the CO2 electroreduction to ethene using multistep electrochemical processes that went through a variety of organic species intermediates. They embarked on the bulk electrolysis of CO2 benchmark at an impressive current density of 170 m/Acm2 to simultaneously yield ethene and ethanol with FE of 43% and 23%. Their results suggested that there was a presence of CH2 dimerization at the higher overpotential and current density which is another interesting pathway for ethene formation apart from the reduction of acetaldehyde, thereby suggesting a mechanism for high current. In another research by Xie et al. [213], the CO2 was electrochemically reduced to HCs and the environmental carbon balance was maintained. Though, the overall selectivity of the Cu electrode to produce HCs was limited, but the approach to generally modify amino acid on Cu electrode was developed for selectively reduced CO2 to HCs where a significant argumentation in the generation of HCs was obtained on the modified Cu electrode irrespective of the morphologies of Cu electrodes. Moreover, the DFT calculations revealed that the CHO* is major intermediate and this was further stabilized through interaction with –NH3 + zwitterionic glycine adsorbed, thus confirming the amino acid as the capable modifier to improve the HCs selectivity in electroreduction of CO2 [213]."
11,Polycrystalline Cu electrode,"7.2 Polycrystalline Cu electrode Han et al., [214] reduced CO2 to C ≥ 2 hydrocarbon using highly selective catalytic systems over polycrystalline Cu electrode with 70–80% selectivity C2 and C3 products. The additive used was N-substituted pyridinium additives in bicarbonate aqueous solutions. The selectivity of the product was tuned from C ≥ 2 species to H2 with approximately ~90% while the N-heterocyclic additive was used to suppress the CH4 formation. Usually, when C ≥ 2 products have experimented at ca. −1.1 V vs R.H.E over polycrystalline Cu electrode, the product distributions were achieved with the higher FE [143] due to possibility of tuning the nature of Cu catalyst to augment the selectivity of carbon multi-products. Hori et al. [157] reported the single-crystal electrode that displayed the Cu (100) facets, thus promoting the coupling of C−C to form ethanol and ethylene as the main products [157,215,216]. On the other hand, Cu(711) and Cu(911) with (100) stepped surfaces are capable to convert CO2 to C ≥ 2 products with FE closed to 80% [157]. Different approaches used to increase the selectivity of cheaper polycrystalline Cu towards the C ≥ 2 products include plasma activation [217], nanostructuring of the electrodes [173,218–224], and optimizing the process environments/conditions e.g. the CO2 pressure, and improving the electrolyte strengths [205,225]. The effects of pH on the surfaces of the electrode have been emphasized on the selectivity shifting from C1 to C ≥ 2 hydrocarbons and drastically affect the adsorption and selectivity of the product of CO to the Cu electrodes [205,225–227]. Though, CO is an intermediate of Cu-catalytic CO2 reductions [26,228] but oxides of Cu-derived catalysts are known to increase CO conversion to C ≥ 2 products [26,173,228]. The utilization of pyridines and ionic liquids have been reported with approximately 30% FE [229–231] with mechanisms that invoked electrons and protons transfer mediation via a single or multiple reduced and protonated species [232,233] to give multi-proton-multi-electron nature of CO2 reductions. Mediator with weak hydridic moiety (weak element − H bond e.g. H−C or H−N) were reported to be suitable particularly; to facilitate the generation of species from the reduction of CO2 [234,235]."
12,Cu-based nanocrystals,"7.3 Cu-based nanocrystals Fabrication of the Cu-based nanocrystals for the conversion of CO2 to C2- products was investigated to reveal the catalytic activity and a size-dependent selectivity in the cube-shaped Cu nanocrystals which is non-monotonic [236]. The activity of these nanocrystals (NCs) for CO2 electroreduction and selectivity for hydrocarbon particularly C2H4 was dependent on the size and the morphology of the NCs. Smaller size NCs within a given morphology were reported to exhibit high activity towards CO2 reduction, whereas, the NCs with cube shape showed more electrocatalyticactivity than the sphere NCs. The Cube-shaped NCs with sizes ranging from 24 to 63 nm shows a nonmonotonic size-dependent selectivity while 44 nm cube-shaped demonstrated the superior electrocatalytic performance, therefore, exhibited 80% efficiency towards selectivity of CO2 reduction over the competing HER and 41% FE for C2H4. Active sites such as plane, edge, and corner on the surface of NCs were reported to be responsible for the observed selectivity. X-ray Diffraction pattern (XRD) reveals an NCs surface with predominantly (100) plane facets [236]. An increase in the size of the nanocubes resulted in a corresponding decrease in the atomic numbers on the edges and the corners. Their observation shows that the Cu nanocubes trending towards the coordinated (100) plane sites was accountable for the selectivity enhancement in CO2RR. This active site/size trend suggests a better catalytic performance exhibited by the CuNC 44 nm cubes; considering the optimum balances between edge and plane sites. Whereas, the selectivity towards ethylene was due to the edges, serving as the active site in the cubes of CuNC for conversion to ethylene. DFT calculations proposed a tandem mechanism where Cu active sites and nanospikes of carbon worked to control electroreduction of dimer CO to alcohols. This further suggested that the strong carbon nanospike (CNS) morphology curling helps in the adsorption of C2 intermediates [148]. CNS used in their study was puckered curled with the local corrugation embedded on the surface. Some other nanocrystal catalysts were reported on the size-dependent and selectivity of Cu, particularly, nature and formation mechanisms on Cu active sites are the crucial factors for advancing energy conversion technologies. Though these electrodes showed unique activity for electroreduction of CO2, but the origins are not fully understood [173,205,244,208,237–243]."
13,Cu-and Cu2O-film,"7.4 Cu-and Cu2O-film Hahn et al., [245] controlled the Cu thin-film surface structures for probing the correlation between the catalytic active site and its activity in CO2 electroreduction to chemicals. Physical vapor deposition of Cu thin films was done on large-format single crystal substrate and orientations were confirmed using epitaxial growth and X-ray pole figures. In-situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy was used to deeply gain insight into the relationship between the thin films surface and bulk structures of Cu(100), Cu(111), and Cu (751), while the later exhibited the most activity and selectivity for coupling CC than Cu(100) and Cu(111) for >2e− formation of oxygenate at low over-potential [245]. However, direct CO2 reduction to CH3OH on thin-film electrodeposited cuprous oxide was reported to produce 38% FE and 43 μmol/cm2/h CH3OH yield which is dynamics and the reduction of copper oxides to metallic copper occurred simultaneously during the process [246]. The relationship between the surface chemistry and reaction behavior with respect to the air oxidation and anodization of the Cu electrode was also investigated. The finding suggested that Cu(I) species might play unique roles in the activity and selectivity of the electrode towards CH3OH formation [246]. Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H4 and C2H5OH was reported on copper(I) oxide film in an aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 [221]. The FE of C2H4 and C2H5OH were turned systematically through the changing of overlayer thicknesses deposited. The films with the 1.7–3.6 μm thickness was reported to demonstrate the superior selectivity towards the formation of C2H4 and C2H5OH at −0.99 V vs R.H.E with FE ranging from 34 to 39% for C2H4, 9–16% for C2H5OH and <1% CH4. CO2 reduction on this type of material suppressed the formation of CH4 but led to the enhancement of C2 product formations [221,222,247]. The SEM, XRD, and in-situ Raman spectroscopy studies revealed a rapid reduction of Cu2O films which remained as particles of metallic CuO during CO2 electroreduction. However, the selectivity trends of electroreduction in KHCO3 electrolyte and phosphate buffer suggested that an increased local pH at the electrode surface was not the only factor that enhanced the formation of C2H4 and C2H5OH. Optimization of the surface populations on the edge and step of the electrocatalyst is necessary for facilitating the CO2 dissociation, and also, the dimerization of the intermediates of CHxO to C2H4 and C2H5OH [221]."
14,CuO-derived copper nanoribbon/Cu2O-derived copper nanoparticle,"7.5 CuO-derived copper nanoribbon/Cu2O-derived copper nanoparticle The CuO-derived porous copper nanoribbon arrays have been described to have the selectivity for C2 products including C2H4, C2H6, and C2H5OH with the total FE calculated to be 40% at −0.816 V vs R.H.E under ambient conditions, while the FE of the C1 product was less than 3% under same condition [248]. The increase in selectivity towards the C2 products was also ascribed to the absence of the CH4 formation while the suppression of the C1 products was ascribed to the presence of the larger number of grain boundary and surface defects on the CuO-derived copper nanoribbon array electrodes. However, the CO2 activation was found to occur at the surface of the Cu, whereas the presence of the copper oxide layers was suggested to result from copper and water interaction occurring in the process of post-analysis [248]. Similarly, the Cu2O-derived copper nanoparticles as a material system were studied for the CO2 electroreduction [249] to produce HCs. Cu2O film thickness was found to be responsible for the selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction in comparison with the initial crystal orientations. However, the Cu2O self-reduction appears to be favored in relation to the reduction of CO2 and/or water splitting. Whereas, the electrocatalysts behaviors were ascribed to be due to the layer thicknesses, local pH surface, thus responsible for HC selectivity such as ethylene. This brought about a suggestion that new routes for ethylene selectivity via electroreduction of CO2 are possible by having the right combination of electrolyte, pH, and optimum density number and the appropriate copper nanoparticle sizes. The distribution of the products (Fig. 12a) [249], current densities as a function of the concentration of the electrolytes (Fig. 12b) [249], CO2 pressure (Fig. 12c) [249], and FE of the products against time plot as shown in the Fig. 12d–f [249]."
15,Oxide derived Cu,"7.6 Oxide derived Cu The tuning of the oxide-derived CuxZn catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 was reported by [250]. The selectivity of CO2 electroreduction was demonstrated towards the formation of the ethanol which can also be tuned through the introduction of the co-catalyst to create an in situ mobile CO reactant source. The oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts (CuxZn) were prepared with different amounts of Zn dopants including Cu, Cu10Zn, Cu4Zn, and Cu2Zn at ambient conditions while the aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 was used as the electrolyte. It was found that; varying the amount of Zn in the CuxZn, the selectivity C2H5OH vs. C2H4 formation (which was defined by the ratio of their FE tuned by a factor of approximately 12.5) with 29.1% FE C2H5OH production observed to be higher on Cu4Zn at −1.05 V vs R.H.E and steady-state current density of −8.2 mA/cm2 which is electrochemically stable for 5 h of C2H5OH production. The FE and total current densities of other catalysts were also shown in Fig. 13A–F and L respectively [250]. Thus, the significant impact of Zn as CO-producing sites for CO2 electroreduction was investigated on the bimetallic Cu/Ni and Cu/Ag electrocatalysts. Operando Raman spectroscopy studies revealed the reduction of the as-deposited Cu-based oxide films to the metallic states during the electroreduction of CO2. At this, only signals associated with the CO adsorbed on the Cu sites were recorded. This showed that the reduction of CO2 probably occurred on the metallic sites rather than on the metal oxides (Fig. 13G–J) [250]. Based on this, a two-site mechanism was proposed for rationalizing the selectivity CO2 electroreduction to C2H5OH as shown in Fig. 13K [250]. Similar work was also reported for the reduction of the onset potential on CuRu bimetallic (with 200 mV lower) than on bare Cu particles with HCs products including acetate, ethane, ethanol, ethylene, propanol, and CO detected [251] as shown the Fig. 14 . The previous investigation on the oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) electrocatalyst has revealed its ability for the conversion of CO2 to formic acid and CO at a moderate potential of 0.5 V vs R.H.E [118] with an improved selectivity which is a result of catalytic active site binding strongly to CO [118,252,253]. Some studies have recently revealed that nanostructured morphology oxides-derived Cu electrocatalysts synthesized via electrodeposition or plasma activation notably enhanced the performances of the electrocatalysts to convert CO2 to HCs at the high current density and low overpotentials [217,224]. For example, Cu electrocatalysts were prepared by Mistry et al. [217] using the plasma method. Their findings revealed that the activity and selectivity of the electrocatalysts were significantly enhanced. This was ascribed to the stability of the oxide layers (Cu2O) forming on the Cu foil surfaces during the plasma treatment process. Though the reaction mechanism is still under investigation, this was the first attempt to supply the stability evidence of Cu+ during the reduction of CO2 using both in-situ and ex-situ oprando approaches, thus confirming the vital roles of Cu+ in the selective reduction. The catalytic performance of the oxide-derived copper decorated with Sn was reported [254] for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO with the FE >90% and 1.0 mA/cm2. Current density over the potential ranges of 0.4 to 0.8 V was reported. The FE of CO was reported to be dependent on the amount of the electrodeposited Sn on the OD-Cu such that the HER was favored when increasing the amount of Sn , thereby, decreasing the current density. Investigation via XRD pointed out that the alloy of both Sn and Cu better explained the high selectivity of CO, unlike the monometallic Sn and Cu. DFT calculation was employed to propose the Sn replacement with the Cu on the OD-Cu surface, thereby, leading to SnCu alloys formation [254] which was later confirmed by the operando spectroscopic technique. Similar work was reported by Zhao et al. [51] on decorated CuxO nanowire with Sn. The author also established that introduction of gold to the hybrid of CuxO–Sn-NP electrocatalyst increases the activity of the electrocatalyst. Fig. 15 presents the variation in the performances of the electrocatalysts; OD-Cu–Sn and CuxO–Sn-NP alloys which were consequently related to the differences in electrocatalyst structures. The OD-Cu–Sn alloys have the homogenous structures; therefore, the distributions of the Sn-NP in the oxide-derived Cu nanowires are not uniform [51,52]. Studies have also shown that the electrodeposition of In, Sn, Ag and Au onto the Cu substrates (OD-Cu) could improve the electrocatalytic performance and the new electrocatalysts comprise the properties of the electrodeposited layers and the substrates [52]."
16,Mixed oxide catalysts,"7.7 Mixed oxide catalysts Iron‑copper (FeCu) mixed oxide catalyst comprising of CuO and CuFeO2 has been reported to reduce the CO2 electrochemically to acetate with FE of 80% (CuO) and 76% (CuFeO2) using Ar-purged, phosphate-buffered and NaHCO3 electrolytes respectively [255]. The study revealed that formate production competes over the existed mixed structure, thus, favored by increasing the concentration of Cu relative to Fe. Also, the selectivity of the electrocatalyst towards either acetate (which is the primary product) or formate is a function of the iron‑copper atomic ratio represented as Fe:Cu, thereby favoring the acetate production at a ratio of 1:3, but increasing the Cu concentration relative to Fe concentration from 1:3 to 0:5, and 0:1. The formate formation became more predominant suggesting that; varying the atomic fractions of Fe:Cu could facilitate the tuning of the catalytic selectivity from acetate to formate. Moreover, mixed Cu states in anodized copper (AN-Cu)-Cu(OH)2 electrocatalyst was employed and reported to have a good catalytic activity and selectivity towards ethylene production with FE reaching 38.1% at −1.08 V vs R.H.E [256]. The long term catalyst testing over 30 h revealed that (AN-Cu)-Cu(OH)2 showed an obvious catalyst deactivation over this period. The SEM image of AN-Cu is shown (Fig. 16a) [256]. Interestingly, controlling its structure is highly possible by monitoring the reaction time. It was also observed that Cu(OH)2 reduced to the metallic Cu when the catalysis occurred leading to the oxidation of some copper after the completion of the reaction, therefore, mixtures of Cu and oxidized Cu were generated (Fig. 16b) [257]."
17,Cu − metal alloys,"7.8 Cu − metal alloys Metal alloys such as AuCu, AuPd, CuPt and AgCu have been reported to demonstrate higher efficiency towards C1 products through the stabilization of the vital intermediates [135]. The effects of alloy towards the formation of two or more carbon products appeared too complex than the C1 products [258]. For instance, the product distribution in the bimetallic system containing the CuAg was easily controlled through tuning the surface ratio of Ag and Cu where the surface that is rich in Cu favored the formation of HCs , whereas the one rich in Ag was CO dominated. This, therefore, highlighted the significant function of the atomic ratio in such a system [259,260]. Geometric effects instigated by the arrangement of the local atoms affect the intermediate strength, for example, Kim et al., (2014) [261] prepared the self-assembly nanoalloys including; AuCu, Au3Cu and AuCu3, and also pure Au, AuNP and CuNP that have uniform sizes. The d-band center was found to increase with the concentration of Au, whereas, the pure Au possessed the most suitable binding strengths to the intermediate in the CO2 conversion to CO in agreement with the experimental turnover rate for CO and earlier calculation [262]. However, Au3Cu presented the highest activity for the formation of CO, indicating that d-band is not the only reason but also the arrangement of the atoms in the alloy played a vital role. The alloy of CuAg was reported to exhibit approximately 60% FE for the formation of C2H4 (Fig. 17A&B) by turning the Ag loading and the morphology [263]. The Ag active sites promoted the formation of CO, while the optimal accessibility of the CO intermediates helped the coupling of CC in the adjacent Cu. Whereas, Ag was believed to act as a promoter for Cu2O formation during the synthesis of CuAg (Fig. 17C) thereby improving the C2H4 efficiency. Tensile and compressive surface strains as a result of the mismatching lattice between the shell and subsurface layer in the alloy can influence the adsorptions of the reactive intermediates. [264–268]. CuAg alloy was reported to enhance the selectivity of multiple carbon products over the pure Cu. The incorporation of Ag to Cu was observed to cause the compressive strain in the Cu atom, leading to a valency band structural shifts and oxophilicity of Cu which thereby altered the adsorption of species intermediates [269]. The electrocatalyst activity dependence on the shell thickness was also studied on the overlayer Cu deposited on the Pt electrode. Increasing the Cu overlayer can generate better selectivity towards CH4 but increase selectivity can be achieved by a rapid decrease in the thickness of Cu [270]. In addition to the altering intrinsic electronic structures, pattern mixings of metal components in nanoalloy have been reported to influence the electrocatalytic activities in the CO2 electroreduction by geometry effects [271]. Therefore, ordering, disordering and phase separation structuring are the main pattern of mixings as presented in Fig. 18 [272]. CuPd nanoalloy of different types was fabricated and the ordered CuPd was found to exhibit the highest FE (i.e. 75%) for the formation of CO while the Cu3Pd and phase-separated CuPd demonstrated the highest FE towards C2H5OH and C2H4 respectively [272]. In terms of their positions of the d-band centers, the phase-separated CuPd gave the lowest, and also the weakest binding ability towards CO based on respective surface valency bands photoemission spectra. Their study suggests that the arrangement of CuPd alloy geometry overweighed the electronic structures when determining the electrocatalytic activities. Some other interesting works were reported by other authors focusing on ordering Au-Cu-NP with 80% FE [273] and biphasic boundary of Ag-Cu2O electrocatalysts for the C2H5OH formation [274]. Many other works on copper-based electrocatalyst have been investigated [216,275–282] where they all pointed out to the distinctiveness of Cu owing to the ability to unify the high H2-overpotential properties, low operation costs in aqueous electrolytes and low overpotentials in CO2 reductions. Interestingly, Cu is the only element that features the information about the C–C–bonds and product formations that originate from transferring two or more electrons [98,136]. The pioneering research on CO2 was carried out on mercury electrodes by Paik [283] and Hori [284]. Although, the first Cu-catalysed reduction of CO2 was reported in 1985 by Hori [127]. In summary, in term of the products of CO2 reduction using Cu-based electrocatalysts, ethene remains one product of meticulous interests due to its economic values as chemical feedstocks which exceed its heating values. The following decades have witnessed great number of publications on the Cu-based electrodes including copper electrodes [143,167,172,225,285–289], Cu oxide electrodes [118,217,290] oxide-supported Cu electrocatalysts [249,285,291,292], Cu-based MOF electrocatalysts [177,293,294], halide-derived Cu electrocatalysts [289,295–297], Cu-containing perovskites [298], Cu-based alloys [299], molecular Cu complexes [169,300,301], etc. The co-catalyst such as pyridine called Pd electrode was recently transformed into Cu-based systems [302]. Developing efficient electrocatalysts in this field necessitates a consistent and reliable model to understand the relationship between the electrocatalytic properties, reaction intermediates, and the products. Therefore, understanding such a reaction mechanism is vital in making the electroreduction of CO2 a technological applicable and valid. In attempt to tackle this, many authors have adopted surface science methodologies [217,219,303,304], DFT calculations [30,161,190,198,207,208,222,237,305], in-situ oprando spectroscopy [123,221,303], etc. Despite notable successes on these methods, there are still limited attempt to study the reactivity of the certain modeled compound [306] as the numerous works in this field majorly focused on the formation of ethanol, ethene, and formate, whereas the major scheme of the reaction that covers all the products remain a big challenge. Table 3 : presents the detailed lists of Cu-based electrocatalyst materials, current densities, products, FEs and their electrochemical conditions based on the electrolytes used and the potential."
18,New mechanistic insights on the Cu electrodes,"Numerous benchmark activities of Cu-based electrodes have been reported on C1 C4 products since the advent of CO2 electroduction on Cu by Hori group [156]. The products formed and respective FE include:- Hori et al., 2002: C2H4 (46%), C2H5OH (19%) and C3H7OH (2%) [157], Li and Kanan 2012: CO (45%) and HCOO− (33%) [118], Manthiram et al., 2014: CH4 (76%) [332], Rasul et al., 2015: CO (85%) [191], Kas et al., 2016: CO (73%) [333], Mistry et al., 2016: C2H4 (60%) [217], Bertheussen et al., 2016: C2H5OH (43%) [306], Dai et al., 2017: CO (92%) [334], Weng et al., 2018: CH4 (66%) [335], Dinh et al., 2018 C2H4 (70%) [336], Hoang et al., 2018: C2H4 (60%) and C2H5OH (25%) [263], Kim et al., 2019: C2H4 (70%) [337], Zhu et al., 2019: CH3COO− (48%) and C2H5OH (32%) [338], Luc et al., 2019: CH3COO− (48%) [339], Zhuang et al., 2018: C3H7OH (21%) [340], Lee et al., 2015: C3H7OH (9%) and C4H10 (1%) [341], Jiang et al., 2018: C2H4 (32%), C2H5OH (13%) and C3H7OH (15%) [342], etc. It can be seen here that substantial progresses were made on the C1 C2 products while the C3 – C4 products suffer from relatively low selectivity. The next paragraphs provide some new insights into mechanistic studies on the Cu electrodes. Firstly, to furtherance the realities of the C1 and C2 products formation on the Cu electrodes from CO2 electroreduction, new reaction pathways leading to the formation of CH4 and C2H4 which are different from the literature mechanisms were proposed [343]. The reduction of smaller C1 and C2 organic molecules that contained oxygen were used for the identification of the possible reaction intermediates. An online mass spectrometer was employed to follow the consumption and formation of intermediates as a function of potential. The pathway for the formation of C1 product showed a likeness of CHOads as the main intermediate to break the CO bond, thereby, leading to the CH4 formation (Fig. 19 ). Whereas, the pathway for the formation of C2 product , suggested that CO dimer is firstly formed which is followed by the enediolate or surface-bonded enediol or oxametallacycle formation. This further explained the selectivity of the pathway for C2 to form C2H4 (Fig. 19). This new mechanism stands unique and consistent with the experimental data available. Kuhl et al., 2012 [143] reported the new insights of CO2 electroreduction on the metallic Cu surface which involves the use of customized electrochemical cell, and the study involved a wider range of potentials. Surprisingly, 16 different products of CO2 electroreduction on the metallic Cu were obtained; which comprised 11 existing products and 5 new products were observed. This bypassed the reported work in the field [143]. A wider range of C1 to C3 products was observed. The investigations about the potential-dependent of the products' turnover frequency including the information about the reaction mechanisms (Fig. 20 ) were reported. The pathway for the formation of carbon multi-products involves the enol-like surface intermediate, thereby accounted for the selectivity of 11 different C2 + oxygenated products including alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and ketones [143]. Plasma treatment was employed recently to fabricate a superior oxygen-derived copper electrocatalyst [217] coupled with the synergistic amalgamation of advanced operando, in-situ and ex-situ techniques. These methods revealed the mechanisms behind the OD-Cu electrocatalyst. A facile method via plasma technique rapidly oxidized Cu foil, resulting in oxide with stable layers and unique structural surfaces. The plasma oxidized Cu electrocatalyst achieved a reduction at lower onset potentials for the formation of C2H4, CO and formate, with C2H4 achieving an outstanding 60% selectivity at 0.90 V vs. R.H.E. and suppressed the CH4 formation. In addition, operando XAFs and STEM-EDS confirmed that these oxides were astoundingly stable against the CO2 reduction with substantial amounts of oxides, and therefore, dissolved the remaining oxygen after 1 h reaction at 0.91 vs R.H.E. [217]. Recently, the OD-Cu catalyst was reported to have 3 various kinds of sites for coupling CC products: firstly, the production of acetate and ethanol, secondly, ethylene, and thirdly the one that leads to the formation of 1-propanol [344]. No indication of the product-specific site was observed on the polycrystalline Cu and oriented Cu (100) and (111) surfaces. Therefore, it was observed that isotopic composition analysis could lead to the *COOH adsorption energy as the descriptor for the selectivity of the products of a specified active site [344]. The critical roles of subsurface oxide in the activation of CO2 by the Cu (111) surface was reported previously for the formation of the chemisorbed CO2 - the first step in the CO2 reduction [345]. A combination of ambient XPS experiment and DFT calculations revealed the essential first step in CO2 activation on the surface of the Cu and highlighted the significant roles of H2O and copper suboxide [345]."
19,Roles of the catalyst supports,"The role of electrocatalyst supports on the Cu-based materials is an important aspect to achieve a significant and better activity as well as the selectivity of the products of the CO2RR. Over the past years, numerous efforts have been devoted to the models that would further enhance the support materials, this in turn has helped to design and optimize some novel electrocatalyst systems [188]. Example of common supporting materials includes carbon black [346,347], CNT [231,348,349], inorganic metal oxides [350], graphene oxide (GO) [351,352], etc. The unique functions of the catalyst supports include improvement of the dispersion of Cu electrocatalysts, enhancement of the active sites to achieve efficient electroreduction, provision of good electrical conductivities of the carbon materials, strong interactions between the metal NPs, etc. [346,347,353–355]. The Pd2Cu NPs supported on Al2O3, SiO2, P25 and CeO2 for the CO2RR have been reported to exhibit significant selectivity towards C2 and C3 alcohols with CeO2 demonstrated the highest activity [356]. The ability of P25 was reported by another author to facilitate the hydrogenation of CO2 to produce C2 alcohol [357]. The activity of CuO in capturing CO2 was reported to have a higher FE than the unsupported carbon black [358]. It was noted that support materials with enough area would boost the C2 and C3 products on densely-packed NPs [151]. Lum et al., 2016 showed that electrodeposited Cu on GO and pure graphite gave better activity than on the glassy carbon due to the NPs of Cu deposition at the defect present on the layers of graphene [359]. Different Cu substrates that can be used as the supports for the Cu electrocatalysts include Cu- plate, foil and mesh. Gas diffusion layer (GDL) is another important support widely used in the CO2RR owing to its gas and/or electrolytes penetrability [272]. Achieving this required electrocatalyst immobilization onto the porous substrates with the larger surface areas called GDL which plays a dual role including (i) GDL allows the convenient transportation of materials between the electrocatalyst and (ii) serves as flow channels while maintaining the adequate communication existing between the electrocatalyst and current collectors [360–362]. Polymer-based GDL was fabricated to improve the stability and activity of the Cu catalyst; leading to the 76% FE for the formation of ethylene at −0.55 V vs R.H.E [241,285,336]. Over the years, limited studies have focused on the effects of support on the CO2RR. The Cu nanoparticle supported on the needle shape N-doped carbon was reported to demonstrate a higher selectivity towards the formation of C2H5OH at a high overpotential with FE of 63% at −1.2 V vs R.H.E [182]. A similar finding was reported for Cu particle supported by a butterfly wing-derived carbon framework for the production of C2H4 [363]. Many other authors have reported the significant roles of supports in the electrocatalyst selectivity towards the product formation [364,365]. To achieve more enhance and better performance of the Cu-based electrocatalyst, the choice of the support with a higher surface area that permits liquid and gas penetration must be taken into consideration. It is also important to mention here that proper understanding of other important components such as the impacts of ionomer material and support on the CO2 reduction using Cu is imperative. Determination of the optimal ionomer such as Nafion® contents in the catalyst ink formulation is important [366] for efficient electrocatalytic performance."
20,Challenges and future prospect,"Globally, CO2 remains limitless resources having the potentiality of producing different useful chemicals and fuels including urea, methanol, formic acid, etc. To date, only scanty technologies are available at the doorstep of industrial recognitions. This means that extensive, deep-insight and realistic researches are seriously required to meet the technological utilization; such that CO2 is not only to be reduced on the lab scale, but also on the industrial scale. This would not only drastically reduced CO2 emission but also promote the conservation fossil fuel reservoirs. Copper-based electrocatalysts have increasingly attracted frequent considerations over the year due to its ability to produce numerous hydrocarbons and alcohols with higher FEs. Yet, despite remarkable successes on the utilization of Cu-based electrocatalysts, their actual mechanisms still awaiting a progressive breakthrough, though, numerous studies unveiled the possible reaction processes. Some new mechanistic insights into the new mechanisms have been suggested in this review for both single and multiple carbon products. Again, in spite of the unique electrochemical performances of the Cu-based electrocatalysts to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbon and alcohols, they still suffer from the poisoning problem from the trace elements present in the electrolytes. Catalytic alloying, surface modifications and cell potentials modulation are thereby recommended to enhance the copper electrodes performances; through delaying of the onset deactivations, though a permanent solution is required to completely alleviate this problem. Two or more carbon products from the electroreduction of CO2 are fuels or chemicals of high values and the effective reduction of CO2 to these chemicals is also greatly important. Our survey of literature on the CO2 reduction shows that Cu-based electrocatalysts are unique materials to form multi-carbon products [2,148,217,221,223,277,342,367–371]. Examples include; Cu- nanoparticles, nanocubes and nanoclusters [148,223,236,342], OD-Cu [221,367], Plasma-activated Cu [217,277], Boron-doped Cu [372], Cu2S–Cu core-shell [368], Strained AgCu [269,369], etc. Observation shows that the reports on the multi-carbon products are very scanty in comparison with the electroreduction of CO2 to the single carbon chemicals. This could be attributed to the challenges in the exploration of the electrochemical system that could facilitate the transfer of protons with lower overpotential [338]. This will be an appealing area of the electrochemical system for the reduction of CO2 to the multiple carbon products to be explored. Achieving an industrial scale catalytic implementation remains a major challenge. To meet up with the expectations and realities of industrial applications, there is a need to develop and apply a new Cu-based material that is not only stable but also possesses a higher activity, selectivity and must be able to withstand long-term tests which are scarce in the literature. From the literature surveyed, it was observed that the reaction by-products and intermediates have the ability to block or poison the catalyst active sites which may, in turn, result in the deactivation of the catalyst. Though, some works have reported the realization of CH3OH but the continuous and steady generation of such product at a higher current density remain a dream expecting to come to reality. Up till today, only a few attempts have been made on the applications of new Cu-based materials for the CO2 electroreduction to alcohol (e.g CH3OH) because most of the electrocatalysts found in the literature though, revealed moderate activities but show low products selectivity, thus, leading to the formation of the products that are not desirable. Therefore, superior techniques for the activation of CO2 molecules at low overpotential which should aim at the new complex electrocatalysts and assemblies through the use of hybrid Cu-based electrocatalysts, Cu-based nanostructures, or Cu-based MOFs. These are expected not only to reduce the overpotential but also tune the surface area of the electrodes, electrocatalyst morphology, active sites, the porosity of the supporting layers and thereby, facilitating the diffusion pathway. In this way, creating an active site that is accessible for the electrocatalysts. This will further fasten the reaction kinetics, effective proton, and electron conductions. However, developing a new electrolyte that is able to address the HER (which is ever competing with the desired product formation) is also needed to be taking into consideration. Optimizing the cell or electrode configurations for such system/material including the membrane assembly for separating cell compartments should be looked into. This is because the structure of the electrodes remains one of the factors that determine the enhancement of the current density and transfer of CO2 into the electrode surfaces in the system. Also, novel electrodes and reactors e.g. GDE waterproof, liquid flow cell and polymer electrode membrane cell are recommended to be adopted for boosting the production rate of the electrochemical reduction reactions to meet the commercial expectation for the current density of >200 mA/cm2. It should be noted that several inconsistencies in the electrocatalytic activities are usually noticed when electrocatalyst is applied to the full cell test [259]. It is, therefore, suggested that further systematic investigation be focused on the need to minimize the gaps between the half- and full- cell device applications in order to speed up the electrochemical reduction from the laboratory scale tests to the practical realization. The CO2 energetic issues should also be taken into consideration by comparing the process with the gas products (e.g. synthesis gas and ethylene) obtained from the industrial processes. Nevertheless, these two products consume drastically energy, though not consider as the major industrial concerns since they are significant chemicals produced by the industries. CO2 is not a high-value product of wider industrial application, but its conversion process is energy-demanding, opposes the economic, and thereby considered unfavorable. For example, the costs of capturing, transporting, separating and purifying CO2 are gigantic. Marketing size limitations, lower incentives investment, industrial commitment problems for improving CO2 -based chemical and insufficient socioeconomically driving force to enhance its utilization. Currently, only very limited technologies have industrial applications; implying that intensive efforts are required to investigate the practicability of such realistic technology. Finally, the environmental utilization of CO2 and its health impacts have not been well investigated. The reason for this could be attributed to immature technologies. Therefore, researches in this area are needed since the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere can pose dramatic negative impacts on the environment. Exposure to such high concentrations of CO2 can cause death [373–375]."
21,Conclusions,"Globally, seeking green and sustainable energy sources and energy carriers that satisfy economic development demands is an urgent need. Fossil fuels from energy sources: natural gas, coal, and petroleum are not sustainable due to their severe reserved depletions and serious environmental damages triggered by their usages. As revealed in this article, several parameters are needed to be simultaneously optimized to achieve the reality of efficient continuous flow of CO2 electroreduction not only to the hydrocarbon products but also to alcohols preferably methanol and ethanol. To achieve this, the influences of temperature and pressure which significantly affect the electrocatalyst surfaces (another variable itself) should be taking into consideration if the expectation regarding the selectivity and the current density will be met. Moreover, the computational/theoretical modelling is expected to also help in designing the electrolyzer configurations such that reactor performances would be simulated numerically to extricate the flow rates and channel geometry effects on the conversion of CO2 and its consumption rates. Proper investigation in the vapor phases can also excavate the underlying opportunities to the utilization of the exhaust fume (because of their richness in the H2O and CO2) from the industries as feedstocks for the generation of solar fuels."
