0,Introduction,"H2-production from CH4 and CO2 over a cheap heterogeneous catalyst opens the door for efficient conversion of two gases that cause global warming; development of cheap catalyst systems cuts down the cost of H2 production. This reaction is popularly known as dry reforming of methane (DRM). The reaction routes encompass the following steps [1] (1) Carbon dioxide is dissociated into CO and oxygen atom over the catalyst surface. Further, CO is liberated out. (2) CH4 is dissociated into chemisorbed radicals CH(4- x) and adsorbed xH (where x = 1–4). (3) Adsorbed oxygen and chemisorbed radicals CH4- x interacts and forms adsorbed CO and adsorbed H. Further CO is liberated out. (4) Adsorbed hydrogen at adjacent site meets and liberated H2. Overall, the dry reforming reaction (Eq. (5)) is highly endothermic and so it requires high temperature conditions (600–800 °C). (1) CO2 → CO ↑+ O* (2) CH4 → CH(4-x)* + x H*; x = 1–4 (3) CH(4-x)* + O*→ CO↑ + (4-x)H* ; x = 1–4 (4) H*+H*+H*+H* → 2H2↑ (5) CH4 + CO2 → 2CO↑ + 2H2 ↑ ΔH = 247 kJ/mol CH4 can be dissociated over Ni, Pt, Ru and Rh catalyst [2–5]. In search of a cheap metal precursor Ni is a good choice. However, at high reaction condition it undergoes serious aggregation which results in loss of catalytic activity. ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 support systems can hold catalytic active Ni at high reaction temperature condition. Anchoring effect of Zr4+ species for Ni dispersion together with the redox nature of ZrO2 support make it specific than nonreducible SiO2 and Al2O3 support [6–9]. However, ZrO2 has serious phase transition issue at high temperature reaction conditions [10]. Yttrium oxide is white solid having high melting point. The protective oxide coating of yttrium develops its remarkable resistance against air up to 1000 °C [11]. The vacancies in zirconia can be easily compensated for by substitution with yttrium [12]. Addition of Yttria to zirconia prevents the phase transition of zirconia. Yttrium in ZrO2 is also known for high oxygen ion conductivity, marked improvement in bending strength, and shock resistance [13,14]. Altogether, yttria-stabilized zirconia system seems be a good support for high temperature DRM reaction. The catalytic role of yttria-stabilized zirconia is well recognized. The acid-base sites of yttria-stabilized zirconia was found to be responsible for olefination and aldol condensation of alcohol respectively [15]. The fast diffusion of oxygen in conjunction with rapid oxygen activation at extrinsic oxygen vacancies in the yttria-zirconia surface induces partial oxidation of methane [16]. In supported metal systems, Pt nanoparticles supported on YSZ was found to promote alkane deep oxidation by involvement of ionic O2− species of lattice [17–21]. Propane combustion by isotopic label 18O2 over Pt/YSZ system showed C16O2 species as main product which clearly indicated the role of lattice oxygen (16O2−) in the reaction. Mobility of O2− ionic species in Pt/YSZ has claimed superior performance towards CO oxidation than Al2O3 and C [22]. Kasra Nikooyeh et al. studied the CH4: H2 feed over Ni/YSZ catalyst towards CH4 decomposition and removal of carbon deposit form catalyst surface [23]. In a DFT study, Cadi-Essadek et al. showed the extent of interaction of CO2 and hydrogen at the interface of Ni/ YSZ (111) [24]. 75%Ni/YSZ catalyst system was found highly active in CO2 methanation having 91% CH4 yield with 99% CH4 selectivity at 230 °C [25]. So, it would be interesting to observe hydrogen producing capability of CH4: CO2 feed over yttria-zirconia supported Nickel catalyst system. Definitely, the hydrogen generation starts from the decomposition of CH4 over catalytic active Ni sites. From earlier reports, it seems that the produced H2 may be engaged further in hydrogenation of CO2 (CO2+H2 → CH4 + H2O) or hydrogenation of carbon deposit (C + H2 → CH4) or reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2+ H2 → CO + H2O) which may substantially lower the H2 yield [26,27]. Herein, we have prepared yttria-zirconia supported Ni catalyst systems and carried out dry reforming reaction for hydrogen generation. To understand the physiochemical property of surface, we have characterized the catalyst by x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, the spent catalysts are characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. A fine correlation of characterization results and catalytic activity is found. The whole study will definitely advance our understanding for designing an industrially suitable catalyst for hydrogen production through dry reforming of methane."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (98%, Alfa Aesar), zirconia (gifted by KAGAKU DAIICHI KOGYO CO. LTD Osaka), yttria (obtained from China), deionized water, crucible, and crusher (mortar and pestle)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation An impregnation method was used for the preparation of Ni catalysts supported over stabilized yttria zirconia. The two components of the support zirconia and yttria are mixed together mechanically. Different amounts of yttria (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 wt.%) were used in the support mixing. The Ni metal was acquired from nickel nitrate hexahydrate. The 5 wt.% loading of Ni was retained in all samples. The right quantity of the Nickel nitrate hexahydrate was weighed and put in 0.03 L of purified water; then the Yttria-Zirconia support was placed in it. The mix was agitated while heating close to 85 °C for 180 min. Afterwards, a furnace at 120 °C was used to dry the samples overnight before calcination at 700 °C for 180 min. Catalysts were referred as Ni-ZrO2, Ni-xY-ZrO2 (x = 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.%). The surface parameters (surface area, pore volume and pore diameter) of catalyst are shown in supporting information Table S1),"
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction 0.1 g of catalyst at reaction temperature of 700 °C is packed in a tubular stainless-steel reactor. It is activated under H2 flow for 1 hour at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The mixture of CH4, CO2 and N2 gases were fed at 30, 30, 10 ml/minute with space velocity 42,000 ml/h gcat respectively. The effluent was examined by GC quipped with molecular sieve 5A and Porapak Q column and TCD detector. H2 yield% and H2/CO ratio is determined by the following expressions: H 2 Yield % = Mole of H 2 in Product 2 × mol of C H 4 in × 100 H 2 C O = Moles of H 2 produced Moles of CO produced"

6,Results,
7,Catalytic activity,"3.1 Catalytic activity H2 yields from dry reforming of methane over different catalyst at 700 °C during 420minutes time on stream and at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1 (A) and (B). The large difference/increase in H2 yield in every catalyst is observed at a temperature between 650 and 700 °C. For zirconia supported Nickel catalyst (5Ni-ZrO2) operated at 700 °C, the H2 yield is 67% which dropped to 46% in 420-minutes time on stream. Upon adding Yttria to zirconia as a support, the initial H2 yield is lower (61%) but remained almost constant up to 420-minutes time on stream, indicating promising yttria-zirconia supported Nickel. With increased yttria in the zirconia support, the H2 yield increased. Over Ni-10Y-ZrO2, the H2 yield dropped from 65% to 57% in 420-minutes time on stream. Incorporation of 15% yttrium in the support seemed to be optimum. Ni-15Y-ZrO2 as well as Ni-20Y-ZrO2 catalyst system shows initial H2 yield of 67%. The H2 yield dropped for both catalysts to about 64.4% at 210 min. After 210 min, the H2 yield for Ni-15Y-ZrO2 dropped to 63.6% compared to 61.2% for Ni-20Y-ZrO2. Overall, it can be said that Ni-15Y-ZrO2 and Ni-20Y-ZrO2 catalyst systems are equally efficient initially but in longer run Ni-15Y-ZrO2 is better. Upon increasing reaction temperature, the H2 yields of Ni-15Y-ZrO2 reached about 78% at 800 °C, whereas for Ni-20Y-ZrO2, it reached 69% only. Higher H2 yields trend at higher temperature indicated the endothermic nature of DRM reaction. H2/CO ratio of Ni-ZrO2, Ni-5Y-ZrO2, Ni-10Y-ZrO2, Ni-15Y-ZrO2 and Ni-20Y-ZrO2 are less than 1 in 420-minutes time of stream (Supporting information Fig. S3)."
8,Characterization results,"3.2 Characterization results The XRD profiles of ZrO2 and Ni-ZrO2 is shown in Fig. 2 (A) whereas Ni-xY-ZrO2 (x = 0, 5, 10, and 15) is shown in Fig. 2(B) and Ni-xY-ZrO2 (x = 15, 20) is shown in Supporting information Fig. S4. ZrO2 support has monoclinic phases (JCPDS reference no. 00-036-0420; 01-072-0597). After dispersion of Ni over ZrO2, the peak of cubic NiO is noticed at 2θ angle 37.12° and 43.26° (JCPDS reference no. 01-078-0423), crystallinity of monoclinic phase has got down and tetragonal phase is yet to appear (JCPDS reference no. 01-079-1764). Most of the peaks of tetragonal peaks are merged with monoclinic peak except the peak at 30.16°. Addition of Y2O3 to ZrO2 support brought the phases of tetragonal yttrium zirconium oxide (JCPDS reference no. 00-048-0224; at 2θ = 30.19 o, 35.08 o, 50.35 o, 54.01 o, 59.88 o, 62.69 o) and cubic Yttrium oxides (JCPDS reference no. 01-083-0927; at 2θ = 24.03 o, 31.50 o, 34.11 o, 50.35 o, 57.17 o, 62.69 o, 65.55 o, 71.11 o). Upon adding 20 wt% Y2O3, new additional peaks of yttrium oxides appeared at 2θ=29.11 o, 48.46 o and 57.50 o (JCPDS reference no. 01-073-1334). The surface area, pore size, pore volume, and crystalline Size of NiO of Ni-xY-ZrO2 (x = 0, 5,10,15,20) catalyst systems are shown in Supporting information Table S1. After yttrium addition, the crystalline size of NiO is found to 18–22 nm whereas in Ni-ZrO2 it is 36.8 nm. The surface area is improved to trice and pore volume to twice up to 15wt% yttrium incorporation. XRD of the spent catalysts showed valuable information about metallic nickel phase and carbon related phases (Fig. 2C). Over the spent Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, metallic Ni phase at 2θ = 44.4° (JCPDS reference no. 00-001-1258), Graphitic carbon phase at 2θ = 26° (JCPDS reference no. 00-001-0640) and ZrC phase (merged with monoclinic ZrO2 phase) at 2θ = 38.4° (JCPDS reference no. 00-001-1050) are found. It indicates that graphitic carbon which is formed after decomposition of CH4 at Ni-Zr interface [27] may react with ZrO2 support and forms highly thermal stable ZrC phases. Interestingly, yttria promoted spent catalyst systems don't show such ZrC phase but shows graphitic carbon phase at 2θ = 26° and 42.71° (JCPDS reference no. 00-002-0456). It indicates that presence of yttrium inhibits the reaction between graphitic carbon and ZrO2. So, graphitic carbon is formed in place of ZrC in yattria promoted Ni-xY-ZrO2 (x = 5, 10, 15, 20) catalyst system. As the proportion of Yattria is increased, the graphitic carbon peak intensity decreases. In the spent Yttrium-Zirconia supported Ni catalyst systems, the crystalline size of Ni is found to 13.9–18.5 nm whereas in the spent Ni-ZrO2 it is 24.6 nm (Supporting information Table S1). To understand the different interaction of metal oxide with each other and the interaction of CO2 with catalyst surface, FTIR spectra of different catalyst samples are carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 3 (A) and (B). The Infrared (IR) band at 748 cm−1, and 500 cm−1 are attributed to stretching vibration of Zr-O. After incorporating Y2O3 in support ZrO2, the band intensity of 748 cm−1 decreases which indicates perturbation of Zr-O band due to introduction of heteroatom [28–30]. In all catalyst samples, the IR band about 3425 cm−1 for stretching vibration of OH, 1625 cm−1 for bending vibration of OH and 2334 cm−1 for vibration of physically adsorbed CO2 gases are found [31,32]. The peak about 1050 cm−1 for absorption of HCO3 and about 1087 cm−1 for bidentate carbonate and band at 1384 cm−1 and 1517–1530 cm−1 for unidentate carbonate are noticed [15,29,33–35]. Apart from these, two weak bands related to bi-coordinated formate (stabilized by the formation of two M-O bond) are also found. One peak at 2850 cm−1 is for stretching vibration of CH and another at 2925 cm−1 for combination of asymmetric stretching of COO and bending vibration of CH bond [36]. After yttria loading IR band unidentate carbonate deepened. It is noticeable that at 15%Y loading, IR bands for unidentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate, and formate species are found prominently. To understand the Ni environment and electron transition, Ultraviolet-visible spectra and band gap are shown in Fig. 4 (A) and (B) respectively. It is reported in literature that pure ZrO2 has UV bands at 226 nm and 280 nm for charge transition O2− to Zr+4 [37,38]. After Ni dispersion over ZrO2, UV band about 280 nm is intensified. It is a charge transfer band from O2− to octahedral Ni+2 (O2−→Ni2+) [39,40]. Apart from charge transition bands, d-d transition bands are also noticed over ZrO2 supported Ni catalyst. The band about 377 nm and 410 nm is attributed to the d-d transition from 3A2g(F) to 3T1g(P) state of Ni+2 in an octahedral environment, whereas the band about 718 nm is for d-d transition from 3A2g(F) state to 3T1g(F) state of the Ni+2 octahedral environment [38,41–43]. Overall, octahedral coordination of Ni+2 in solid phase is confirmed. The band gap between valance band and conduction band of ZrO2 supported Ni catalyst is found at 3.42 eV. Just after the introduction of Y2O3 in ZrO2 support, the band gap rises to 3.47 eV. As Y2O3 is increased in support, d-d transition band faded continuously; this indicates the perturbation in electron transfer in different energy state of d orbital due to the addition of new metal oxide in the catalyst system. Energy band gap study indicates that with increasing Y proportion the band gap decreases smoothly. Ni-10Y-ZrO2, Ni-15Y-ZrO2, and Ni-20Y-ZrO2 show 3.46 eV, 3.41 eV, and 3.40 eV respectively. The CO2 adsorption capacity as well as the basic profile of the catalyst can be understood by CO2-TPD profile as shown in Fig. 5 . All catalyst systems are able to adsorb CO2 at its different basic sites. The CO2 desorption profile shows peak about 100 °C for weak basic sites/surface hydroxyl, peak in the temperature range 120–200 °C for intermediate strength-basic sites/bidentate carbonates, peak in the temperature range 250 −400 °C for strong basic sites/isolated O2− species and peak at a high temperature for unidentate carbonates [44,45]. Interestingly, with increasing the proportion of Yttrium with ZrO2 as support, strong basic sites/isolated O2 − species regions are growing. It should be noticeable that Ni-15Y-ZrO2 catalyst is populated with all types of basic sites which provide opportunity to adsorb wide population of CO2 over the catalyst surface. To understand the catalyst deactivation factor, the amount of carbon deposit present on spent catalyst is studied by O2-Temperature Programmed Oxidation (O2-TPO) and result is shown in Fig. 6 . O2-TPO is carried out by 10%O2 in Ar over the spent Ni-5Y-ZrO2. It shows a major peak at 550 °C for moderately oxidizable β-carbon species [46,47]. As Yttrium portion is increased in ZrO2 as support, lower intensity peaks are observed. It indicates the presence of lower amount of carbon deposit over the catalyst surface at higher Yttria presence in the support. That means over Y containing system, carbon deposit formed during the reaction is oxidized by CO2 as well as with lattice oxygen of yttria-zirconia support. This result is also supported by TGA results (Supporting Information Fig. S5). To understand the type of oxygen participated in carbon deposit oxidation during the reaction, XPS O(1 s) spectra of Ni-ZrO2, Ni-15Y-ZrO2 and spent Ni-15Y-ZrO2 are taken and shown in Fig. 7 . Ni-ZrO2 has peaks at 529.3 eV and 532.4 eV [47]. The earlier one is attributed to lattice oxygen whereas later one is for oxygen which is related to adsorbed water. Interestingly after the addition of yttrium with ZrO2 as support (Ni-15Y-ZrO2), a new peak at 537.7 eV for oxygen (O2) coverage at surface appeared [48]. It clearly indicates the enrichment of oxygen layer over catalyst surface after addition of Yttrium. Interestingly O(1 s) XPS spectra of spent Ni-15Y3-ZrO2 catalyst system doesn't show the binding energy related to lattice oxygen and O2 covered layer due to possible utilization of these oxide species in carbon deposit oxidation during dry reforming reaction. Additionally, spent Ni-15Y-ZrO2 shows a diffuse peak in the lower bonding energy which indicates the rise of covalence character of M-O-M′ bond after the reaction."
9,Discussion,"Previous thermodynamic equilibrium studies on dry reforming of methane via Gibbs free energy showed that DRM reaction (CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 +2CO) is feasible at high temperature (≥ 643 °C) [46,49]. The thermal cracking of methane (CH4 → C + 2H2) is also feasible in this temperature range. After ≥ 703 °C, CO2 gasification reaction (C + CO2 → 2CO) which adds CO concentration becomes feasible. So, in all catalyst systems, the large difference/increase in H2 yield is observed at a temperature between 650 and 700 °C. One thing is also noticeable that the H2/CO ratio is found less than 1 for all catalyst systems in longer time on stream (after 420-minute time on stream) due to the increase of CO concentration compared to H2 concentration by parallel reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) and carbon gasification reaction (C + H2O → CO+H2) in the same temperature range [50]. CO2-TPD profile of zirconia supported nickel catalyst shows the presence of basic hydroxyl (weak sites) and O2− species (strong basic sites) over the surface. IR spectrum shows the presence of physically adsorbed CO2, monodentate and bidentate carboxylate species even at normal pressure and temperature. It indicates that zirconia supported Ni catalyst system is capable of interacting with CO2. UV spectra show the presence of Ni+2 in octahedral environment having a band gap of 3.42 eV. Before reaction, catalyst is activated in the stream of H2 for reduction of Ni+2 to metallic Ni which is known for catalyst active sites for CH4 decomposition into carbon and hydrogen. XRD of the spent Ni/ZrO2 shows the presence of graphitic carbon and thermally stable ZrC phases. So, it can be said that zirconia supported nickel catalyst system is capable of decomposing the CH4 into carbon and H2, absorption of CO2 at its basic sites and thereafter oxidation of carbon deposit. However, shading of catalytic active sites by thermally stable ZrC phase causes a drop in hydrogen yield from 67% to 46% within 420 min. After the addition of 5% yttria in zirconia as support, tetragonal yttrium zirconium oxide and yttrium oxide phases stabilizes the support at high temperature reaction. Strong basic site/O2− species grows slightly. XRD of yttria promoted spent catalyst system has shown absence of thermally stable ZrC phases and presence of decomposable graphitic carbon in large excess. Higher amounts of oxidizing species over a more stabilized support may wash away the carbon deposit more precisely through oxidation process. So, H2 yield remains around 50% after 420 min which is better than Ni-ZrO2 catalyst (46% H2 yield after 420 min). On 10% yttrium addition apart from the support thermal stability, density of monodentate carboxylate species as strong basic site/O2− species grow pronounceably over the catalyst surface. O2-TPO, TGA and XRD of spent catalyst systems indicate sharp drop of carbon deposit over the catalyst surface. Clearly this surface is able to oxidize carbon deposit (which is formed after CH4 decomposition) by either CO2 (adsorbed at different basic sites) or lattice oxygen followed by replenishment of lattice oxygen by the adsorbed CO2. It caused high and more consistent H2 yields as it shows 65% H2 yields initially which drops to 57% after 420 min of reaction. 15% yttrium addition brings optimum changes over the catalyst surface in favour of higher and consistent hydrogen yields. IR spectra indicate that it has sharp and deepened peaks for bicarbonate as well as bidentate carbonate species. UV band study shows less band gap 3.41 eV which is lower than band gap of Ni-ZrO2 catalyst. The CO2-TPD profile shows wide range of CO2 adsorption basic sites in which strong basic sites/ O2− species intensity is maximum than rest yttrium loading. O2-TPO profile shows again a sharp drop of carbon deposit on catalyst surface. O2-TPO, TGA and XRD of spent catalyst show that with increasing yttrium loading, carbon deposit decreased. It indicates the involvement of lattice oxygen in carbon deposit oxidation. Previously, it was also found that lattice oxygen becomes more mobile in yttria-zirconia system [16]. Further, O (1 s) XPS spectra shows enrichment of surface by adsorbed oxygen in yttria-zirconia supported nickel catalyst system. O (1 s) XPS spectra of spent catalyst shows loss of lattice oxygen O2− as well as adsorbed oxygen peaks. It clearly indicates the role of lattice oxygen during the reaction. That means that in yttria-zirconia system, lattice oxygen oxidizes the carbon deposit and later the loss of lattice oxygen is overcome by adsorbed CO2. Overall, CH4 decomposition over stabilized Ni surface, adsorption of CO2 on wide range of basic site, low energy band gap for electron transition, involvement of mobile lattice oxygen for instant oxidation of carbon deposit pivots the path of highest hydrogen yield 67.5% which drops down to 63.7% up to 420-minute time on stream. On increasing the reaction temperature up to 800 °C, high H2 yield up to ~78% is achieved in favour of endothermic nature of dry reforming reaction. 20% yttria loading in support ZrO2 seems to be quite efficient as its catalytic performance is comparable with 15% yttria loading. It has less intensity bicarbonate species (as shown in IR spectra at 1050 cm−1) but spent catalyst has least amount of carbon deposit over catalyst surface, indicating more oxidizing capacity. H2-yield of Ni-20Y-ZrO2 up to the 210 min is close to that of Ni-15Y-ZrO2. However, after 210 min, it may be possible that excess yttria in Ni-20Y-ZrO2 may oxidize the metallic Ni again to Ni+2 by their mobile oxygen which may affect the CH4 decomposition capability resulting in less H2 yield. Even at high reaction temperature 800 °C, where all catalysts show fast rise in H2 yield, Ni-20Y-ZrO2 catalyst system shows a lesser rise of H2 yields of 69% only. Table 1 shows a comparison of catalytic activity in terms of H2 yield over different catalyst system and different reaction conditions."
10,Conclusion,"Ni-ZrO2 catalyst system is efficient in hydrogen production but due to a shading of catalytic active sites by thermally stable ZrC phase, the H2 yield drops down rapidly from 67% to 46% within 420 min. Yttrium promoted catalyst has decomposable graphitic carbon than the thermally stable ZrC in unpromoted catalyst. With increasing yttrium proportion in support, carbon deposit is decreased through oxidation by lattice oxygen. Ni-10Y-ZrO2 surface are enriched with monodentate carboxylate species as well as strong basic sites/O2− species which results into high H2 yield which drops down slowly from 65.5% to 57% in 420 min. Ni-15Y-ZrO2 brings all optimum changes over catalyst surface which ensures high and consistent H2 yield. It has wide range of basic sites for CO2 adsorption (as bicarbonate, monodentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate) and highest intensity of O2− species. Consumption of lattice oxygen and surface oxygen after the reaction is clearly observed in XPS of fresh and spent Ni-15Y-ZrO2. Decomposition of CH4 over stabilized Ni, oxidation of carbon deposit by lattice oxygen and thereafter replenishment of oxygen vacancy by CO2 pivots the path of highest and most consistent H2 yield (67.5%) which drops slowly to 63.7% during 420 min. DRM reaction (endothermic reaction) favors high reaction temperature. At 800 °C, this catalyst system shows rapid rise of H2 yield up to ~78%. Ni-20Y-ZrO2 catalyst activity is more or less same until 210 min (half time of total TOS) but further oxidation of metallic Ni by excess yttria may affect the CH4 decomposition which reflects in lower H2 yield after 210 min. Even at high reaction temperature up to 800 °C, it doesn't show steep rise of H2 yield."
