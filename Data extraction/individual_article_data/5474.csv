0,Introduction,"Biorefineries are facilities for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass, which can tackle the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide [1]. Succinic acid is recognised as a future platform chemical [2] that can substitute mallic acid [3] and maleic anhydride C4 platform [4]. It is a bio-derived building block from renewable resources that can be transformed into a number of industrial chemicals: 1,4-butanediol, γ-butyrolactone, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, succinimide, succinic esters, maleic acid/maleic anhydride and others [3]. Direct downstream catalysis of succinic acid in the filtered aqueous fermentation broth allows the production of valuable derivatives without the need to isolate pure succinic acid. Integration of succinic acid and ethanol production has a potential application in a corn or barley biorefinery [5]. The production of succinic acid could achieve 20 000-30 000 tons per year. Economical and technological feasibility leads to produce more valuable chemicals using succinic acid as a raw feedstock [4]. Catalytic hydrogenation of succinic acid was developed using metal catalysts, mainly palladium [6–11] and ruthenium [12–14]. Diversity of the products could be obtained in hydrogenation catalysed by selective bimetallic catalysts, such as Ru-Co [15] and rhenium Pt-Re [16], Pd-Re [9,17], Ru-Re [18,19], Re/C [4], Re/MC-H2SO4 supported catalysts [20] capable to reduce carboxylic and carbonyl group. Modifications in physical and chemical properties of catalysts i.e. Pd–5FeOx/C [21], Pd/AX alumina xerogel [22] and Re-Pd/TiO2 [11] changed catalytical activity to convert a cheap biomass-derived succinic acid into other compounds responding to increased succinic acid production in the biorefinery process [2,23]. Hydrogenation of biogenic carboxylic acids: levulinic acid (LA) and itaconic acid (IA) was performed with Ruthenium/TriPhos system [24]. Hydrogenation led to the corresponding lactones, diols, and cyclic ethers showing a very promising potential for highly selective hydrogenation/dehydration pathways in the conversion of biogenic platform chemicals. 18-h reactions with hydrogen pressure p(H2)=100bar; 160°C of LA, yielded a 95% 1,4-pentanediol. Use of an acidic additive, such as the ionic liquid allowed to modify selectivity of the hydrogenation to 73% of 1,4-pentanediol with an increased yield towards γ-valerolactone (from 3 to 22%). The aim of this study was to participate in the catalytic hydrogenation for biogenic dicarboxylic acids valorisation by choosing succinic acid due to its high feasibility for a valuable conversion towards many industrial products and selecting process to be executed in not reported yet conditions, such as high-pressure CO2 and acidic, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid media."
1,Results and discussion,"The suitability of succinic acid as a platform chemical is based on the ease of its biotechnological production and on the huge variety of chemicals that can be produced from it by the chemical conversion. This work provides a “one-pot” biorefinery process that transforms biomass-derived dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid in high pressure carbon dioxide-ionic liquid media into 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6–dione. Up to date, the synthesis of 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6–dione was reported as a hazardous, three step time demanding process that can be performed at only laboratory scale. Additionally, hazardous by-products or unreacted substrates could contaminate the final product [25]. Such disadvantages can be avoided with a novel method of hydrogenation proposed in this study from a biomass-derived succinic acid in high-pressure CO2/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid media. Supply of carbon dioxide (CO2) is needed in fermentation broth for succinic acid production [26]. CO2 is present in many microorganisms’ molecular mechanisms, such as the Krebs cycle (citric acid chain) where it is produced. Succinic acid existing both in the Krebs cycle and in the electron transport chain can be therefore easily converted by redox chemical reactions. As it is commonly known, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is the most intensively used solvent due to its low critical point (Pc =73bar,Tc =304K), non-toxicity, inertness and non-flammability, while remaining an inexpensive and environmentally benign, and easily removed. CO2 known as a primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, can be used in the invented method as a renewable resource. A “one-pot” synthesis from biomass-derived succinic acid with a specific acid ionic liquid matrix, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, used to increase solubility of acid in a CO2-expanded liquid [27,28], can suit as an example to overcome the problem of common hazardous known synthesis of 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6–dione. This can be the goal of the future scale up process. The presented work suggests that the biorefinery concept to transform biogenic acid into valuable product in a catalytic selective, CO2-expanded liquid process is most likely to be combined in one facility. The method of synthesis of 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6–dione presented in Fig. 1 can be recognised as safe for the environment due to the use of non-toxic, non-flammable, “solvent-free”, inexpensive and environmentally friendly CO2 comparing to the known hazardous method employing VOCs. 9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione is a compound that has a promising application. The product of the developed method can be used as a building block in the synthesis of V-shaped heteroaromatic host molecules. 9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione suits for production of thia-substituted diquinoline derivatives. Such molecules have found application in creating clathrate structures with a function as lattice inclusion hosts. Those structures are able to transport biopharmaceutics, genes and proteins inside organisms, including human body [29]. In this work, the use of palladium catalyst for the production of 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6–dione from IL based biogenic succinic acid by hydrogenation is described. Literature described operation conditions [24] were tested using palladium on alumina catalyst. Selection of heterogeneous catalyst was directed by beneficial use of heterogeneous over homogeneous catalyst coming from to the costs combined with the catalyst recovery in the presence of ionic liquid as a reaction additive highlighted by Professor Arno Behr. Keeping in mind factors [24]: 100bar of H2 and 160°C in an 18-h reaction which might give certain result, initially, lower pressure of H2 followed by addition of CO2 until a total pressure of 180bar was applied. Following economical and advantageous aspects of heterogeneous catalysis over homogeneous catalysis advertised by Professor A. Behr, 5wt% Pd/alumina was chosen (11,2μmol) and an acidic IL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([bmim][HSO4]) was added. Parameters, such as 160°C and 18h of the reaction were kept in this study. Carbon dioxide was used as a medium for hydrogenation of succinic acid to eliminate difficulties with mass transfer limitation. Supercritical carbon dioxide was considered as an ideal medium for hydrogenation due to H2 complete miscibility with CO2. No results were obtained under these conditions for low pressure of H2 (20bar) (run 1 Table 1 ). Therefore, the study was focused on increasing the partial pressure of H2 (40bar and 60bar, run 2 and 3 Table 1) that resulted in production of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione and ethanol. Peaks were assigned by GC–MS for each single reaction and pure substance calibration [30]. Reaction with increased hydrogen pressure of 60bar compared to 40bar, produced 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione more selectively (91.9% to 73%) with a halved conversion (52.18% to 27.32%). It is worth mentioning that lower hydrogen pressure of the reaction sought to direct the selectivity to ≅27% of ethanol showing promising biorefinery concept of a cheap and available feedstock of succinic acid utilisation to ethanol interesting for biorefinery. Similar formation of ethanol competitively occurred together in hydrogenation of succinic acid at 60bar and 240°C was reported with selectivity of 30% to alcohol [12–14,20]. Taking into consideration the high selectivity of the process towards 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione with 60bar of hydrogen, acidity parameter was tested on the results with increased hydrogen pressure to 100bar similarly to Leitner's work [24]. Water was added (additive 20wt%) allowing to execute the reaction in an acidic system of scCO2/H20 at 60bar of H2 and 100bar of H2. Improved formation of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione was observed compared to water-free conditions (run 1–3 Table 1). Operation at lower 60bar of H2 (run 4 Table 1) allowed to produce more (97.1% to 96.5%) than at 100bar of H2 (run 5 Table 1) keeping the conversion of succinic acid at level of 52% similarly to water-free conditions with lower 40bar of H2 (run 2 Table 1). Increased selectivity and conversion in hydrogenation of succinic acid in scCO2/H2O system is in a good agreement with literature, such as selective and highly efficient oxidation of sulfides in scCO2/H2O system [30]. Increase in acidity of the reaction system with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate and scCO2 by addition of water improved selectivity towards production of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione to >97% with >52% conversion. The peak of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione product was obtained at retention time 57.8±0.1min for constant conditions together with MS spectrum and obtained 1H and 13C NMR spectra were presented in Fig. 2 . Analysing the results obtained within this study, a 97% 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione formation seems to be the best result of the performed transformations of succinic acid at mild conditions (60bar of hydrogen). Dense CO2 is known to enhance the hydrogen availability in the IL and reduce viscosity [31]. A higher CO2 pressure in the system will increase H2 solubility, lowering diffusional limitations and thus facilitating reaction. This effect was possibly enhanced by increased acidity of the IL by water that might result in improved reagents’ miscibility and accessibility of the reaction mixture to the active metal in the vicinity of the catalyst facilitating the production of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione. Similar positive influence of the acidity in the co-solvent added on hydrogenation yield was reported in the catalytic performance of the Rh catalysed hydrogenation of β-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives in scCO2 [32,33]. Acidity of the reaction system was reported to be important in the catalytic performance of Pd on alumina catalyst in the hydrogenation of succinic acid [22]. The abovementioned achievements, led the study to test anhydrous conditions of the system 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate and a CO2-expanded liquid, to could see how pronounced is the effect of acidity in the transformation of succinic acid. For that reason, similar reaction with anhydrous MgSO4 added to the system was studied. Magnesium sulfate was chosen as the most suitable hygroscopic substance, because of sulfate anion which coincided with ionic liquid's anion. The reaction executed with anhydrous conditions provided higher conversion rate of succinic acid and allowed for >80% selectivity towards 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione (run 6 Table 1). After obtaining this higher conversion of succinic acid, study was focused on increasing accessibility of the catalytic system and reaction mixture of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate and scCO2 to succinic acid. Therefore, the reaction with milled succinic acid was performed. Nevertheless, very similar results in terms of conversion and selectivity like in the previously performed reaction (run 7 Table 1) were obtained. The TEM images presented in Fig. 3 presents only visually detected changes in structure of succinic acid used in the reaction as received and milled. The visible differences in succinic acid crystal's size and its concentration were expected to find influence for the hydrogenation conversion. Milled substrate (Image 2 in Fig. 3) obtained bigger surface of succinic acid crystals that could improve the solubility of reagent in the IL matrix and the effectiveness of joint between the catalyst and the substrate. Milling did not improve accessibility of the succinic acid in the catalytic system to affect the performance of the reaction. The similar result of the process performed with original and milled succinic acid drove to the conclusion that the macromolecular area of the reaction phenomena takes place on the catalyst surface with the succinic acid dissolved in the {scCO2 +IL} matrix sufficient for a minimum of succinic acid solubility. To complete this work, the pressure was increased to 100bar of hydrogen (run 8 Table 1) in anhydrous reaction. The main product was produced in >96% but at decreased conversion to 34.6% from 76.5% (run 7 Table 1). The increase in hydrogen pressure by 40bar independently of water (run 5 Table 1) or water-free (run 8 Table 1) system was responsible for lowering the conversion (run 5 and run 8 Table 1). I this study, a CO2-expanded liquid/IL assisted process of a biogenic succinic acid hydrogenation is a novel process towards 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione. The possible explanation of this phenomena by step by step lowering oxidation state of sulfur atom is presented in Fig. 4 . Sulfur atom on VI oxygenation state starts to be reduced and carbon-sulfur and sulfur–sulfur bonds can be formed. After reduction of disulfide bond, the carbon-sulfur-carbon bond can be formed and 9-thiabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,6-dione (compound 3 in Fig. 1) can be produced at the final stage. Summarizing, it can be expected that surface of palladium catalyst facilitates chain of redox reactions occurring in the reaction. Hydrogen sulfate anion can form sulfur-palladium (S-Pd) links [34], which can be responsible for inicial electron transport to sulfur atom and creation of the bond between sulfur and β-carbon from succinic acid molecule. Afterwards palladium causes a shift of sulfur oxidation state which is consistent with some removal of electron density from sulfur bonds."
2,Material and methods,
3,Chemicals,"3.1 Chemicals The origin of the chemicals were as follows: the catalyst, palladium on alumina, 5wt% powder, (PubChem Substance ID 24852341, Sigma Aldrich Chemicals); succinic acid (CAS Number 110-15-6, Sigma Aldrich Chemicals, purity ≥99.0%) and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (CAS Number 7487-88-9, Sigma Aldrich Chemicals, purity ≥97%). The ionic liquid,1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, [bmim][HSO4] was purchased from Iolitec (>95wt%) and purified under vacuum for 48h. Doubly distilled and degassed water was used as a reagent."
4,Experimental procedure,"3.2 Experimental procedure The reaction was performed in a high-pressure system with a PARR reactor. The schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 5 . The apparatus is composed mainly of a 25mL Parr Company stainless steel reactor − Series 4591 Micro Reactor Systems. The reactor PTFE 350°C with a removable head, split-ring closure with 6 bolts and attached with the heating jacket was equipped in temperature measurement part − fixed thermocouple. The highest temperature available to reach equals to 350°C and the highest pressure in 350°C equals to 345bar. Inside the reactor, the special stirring mixer with gas entrainment impeller was installed to obtain maximum dispersion inside a matrix. The speed of the stirrer creates a vacuum at the tip of the impeller and the shape of gas entrainment impeller allowed to obtain continuous reaction mixture recirculation from the head space into the bottom. The reaction system was occupied with an extra Parr Transducer model PDM. Catalyst − palladium on alumina followed by 5wt% as a powder (0.0238g), succinic acid as a solid (1.18g) and matrix of ionic liquid − 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (4mL) were introduced to the reactor. The amount of catalyst was calculated to achieve 1:1000 metal/succinic acid molar ratio. After charging and sealing, the reactor was deoxygenated under vacuum and 20–100bar of H2 were admitted at room temperature. The reactor temperature was increased to 160°C and CO2 was admitted until the system reached 170bar of total pressure. The reaction mixture was heated to 160°C and stirred 18h. After reaction, the reactor was slowly cooled until it reached room temperature and the system was depressurised into an expansion vessel. Each reaction was repeated at least thrice to confirm a good repeatability of the results. Post-reaction broth was recovered from the reactor, diluted with known volume of n-hexane and intensively mixed, then the heterogeneous catalyst was separated using filtration method. The organic phase was analysed by GC–MS and HPLC for 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione selectivity and succinic acid conversion. Ionic liquid and ethanol were separated by water extraction [35] with four portions of 4mL, followed by extraction with tri-n-octylamine dissolved in n-hexane [36] to remove succinic acid from organic phase, which afterwards was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The organic solvent was filtered and evaporated with a rotary evaporator. Obtained yellow product, left to solidify, was analysed by NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C). Isolated yield of the purified product was 55%. The isolated reagents exhibited the corresponding properties: 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione: melting point: 140–141°C, 1H NMR (400,13MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 2.29–2.32 (m, 4H), 2.40–2.52 (m, 4H), 4.18 (t, 2H). 13C NMR (100,61MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 30.08 (s), 38,82 (s), 47.77 (s), 205,90 (s), succinic acid: melting point: 183–184°C, 1H NMR (400,13MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 1.56 (s, 4H). 13C NMR (100,61MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 28.87 (s), 173.83 (s), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate: NMR (400,13MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 0.97 (t, 3H), 1.39 (m, 2H), 1.88 (m, 2H), 4.08 (s, 3H), 4.30 (t, 2H), 7.16 (s, 1H), 7.18 (s, 1H), 10.23 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (100,61MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 13.35 (s), 19.15 (s), 30.92 (s), 36.13 (s), 49.26 (s), 122.51 (s), 123.91 (s), 136.59 (s). For succinic acid conversion was calculated and for products each selectivity according to following equations [19], where coefficient K=0.5 for ethanol and K=2 for 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione according to stoichiometry of the reaction (2mol of succinic acid − 1mol of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione): succinic acid conversion = mole of reacted succinic acid mole of supplied succinic acid product selectivity = K ⋅ mole of formed product mole of reacted succinic acid Taking into consideration that the ionic liquid contains only methyl and butyl alkyl chains, it is expected that ethanol can be formed from succinic acid with stoichiometry: 1mol succinic acid − 2mol of ethanol. Ethanol was already formed in a liquid phase hydrogenation of succinic acid as highlighted by study of Song and co-workers [12–14,20]. The forms of succinic acid between crystal and milled were controlled by optical technique − transmission electron microscopy. The results, the shape and the range of obtained crystals were presented in Fig. 3. GC–MS analyses for products were performed using gas chromatograph model Agilent 6890N coupled with an electro ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) model Thermo DSQ. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a DB-Wax capillary column (30m x 0.25mm x 0.25μm film thickness) using helium as the carrier gas at 1.0mL/min in a constant flow rate mode. The injector port was 250°C. The oven temperature was maintained at 40°C, increased by 3°C/min to 220°C and held at this temperature for 10min. The temperature for EI-MS was 200°C. The acceptance criterion of qualification was retention time within 1.5% compared with standards analysed in the same batch. To detect the succinic acid conversion high performance liquid chromatography analyses were performed on ion chromatograph Dionex, model ICS3000 equipped with a photodiode arrays ICS series. The wavelength was set to 210nm and the oven temperature at 30°C. Separation was achieved using mobile phase as a 10 mN H2SO4 with the flow rate 0,6mL/min and the injection volume 25μL."
5,Conclusions,"The described process combines use of a “greenhouse gas”, carbon dioxide with a terrestrial biomass feedstock in a novel strategy for a selective production of chemicals, such as succinic acid from renewable raw materials with a future perspective in biomedical applications of supramolecular systems based on host-guest interactions [29]. The method described herein proves that succinic acid can be selectively transformed to 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione by palladium commercial heterogeneous catalyst with a specific ionic liquid by a simple and straightforward method. A new environmentally friendly, one-pot method of synthesis of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione opens a perspective in a commercialization of biomass-derived succinic acid without risk of explosion. This process can open excellent perspectives for future applications by development towards ethanol production within a biorefinery concept with a closed cycle from succinic acid produced in biorefinery towards ethanol, as well as by providing a host building block molecule that can be used in expansion in a field of nanomedicine, biomedicine and to newly design supramolecular systems."
