0,Introduction,"Alcohols, a kind of renewable resources, has been used as basic material for the production of cosmetics, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and as additives in several industrial products. Therefore, the catalytic hydrogenation reaction of esters, ketones and aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols products had been gained considerable interest from the academic and industrial researchers because of the superb catalytic selectivity and clean using of coal [1–4]. Generally, alcohols were produced in the industrial manufacture by fermentation, ethylene hydration and indirect conversion of syngas. Among these methods, the ethylene hydration and the indirect conversion of syngas were widely used in the industrial production of alcohol [2,5,6]. However, water could be produced in the reaction due to the non-ideal selectivity and the crude feedstock which came from the industrial scraps. The separation cost maybe high due to the formation of azeotrope or the relatively immature of separation technology. Thus, in order to obtain down-stream products or high value-added products, the subsequent hydrogenation process would be carried out in the water-containing reaction system. Therefore, insight into the effect of water on ester hydrogenation is a necessary issue. Meanwhile, it’s worth to mentioning that, the impact of water content on the performance of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was intensively investigated for cobalt-based catalysts [7–10]. And the effect of biomass-derived syngas impurity elements on cobalt catalyst had also been explored in FTS [11]. Furthermore, the effect of water on the CO2 hydrogenation to alcohols (C2-C4) was also reported and confirmed the excellent synergistic effect between the water and catalyst. [12] Shen et al. had found that the addition of appropriate amount of water could promote the conversion of acetone to isopropanol over Ni/MgAlO catalyst [13]. Dumesic and co-workers had showed that the adding of low concentrations of water (5 wt%) to the THF solvent could dramatically change the reaction rates and products selectivity for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis processes over Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. [14] In methanol production over copper catalysts, the water was naturally explained as the common intermediate [15]. Even so, based on the knowledge of the authors, the impact of water on the ester hydrogenation was not systematic researched so far up to now. Since, the reported works just focused on the simple ideal reaction condition which was completely different from the industrial application. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between Cu° and Cu+ had a great influence on the hydrogenation performance of ester hydrogenation reaction [16,17]. Wang and his team found the Cu+ sites adsorbed the methoxy and acyl species, while the decomposition of H2 occurred on the Cu° sites by methyl acetate hydrogenation [16]. And the balancing effect of Cu+ sites and Cu° sites played an important role in improving the catalytic performance. Published paper also showed that the Cu° of the reduced Cu/SiO2 catalyst can be oxidized to Cu+ by methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and dimethyl oxalate [17]. And Cu+ can also be reduced back to Cu° under reaction conditions containing H2. Therefore, the dynamic cycle between Cu° and Cu+ was existed during ester hydrogenation. So it maybe had a big impact on valences of copper, if the water existed in hydrogenation reaction. In this paper, ethyl acetate was selected as the probe reaction to investigate the influence of water on the ester hydrogenation performance. Meanwhile, taking in our account the advantages of Cu-based catalyst and its high selectivity towards the hydrogenation reaction of CO bond as well as its comparatively low hydrogenation inactivity of the CC bond in ester hydrogenation reaction, Cu/SiO2 catalysts were selected and used. The obtained catalytic hydrogenation and characterization results were correlated to reveal the effect of water on the hydrogenation reaction of ester using Cu/SiO2 catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Silica (Aerosil 200, Degussa) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company, Ltd, AR, and utilized as received."
3,Synthesis of Cu/SiO2 catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu/SiO2 catalyst Incipient-wetness impregnation method was employed to synthesize Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The nominal copper loading was 25%. Specifically, 6.88 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dispersed in 30 ml deionized water and then added into 5.0 g SiO2 to form a slurry. After aging for 1 h, the mixture was dried at 80 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the produced precipitate catalyst was calcined in furnace at 400 °C for 4 h and then pelletized, shed and sieved to 40–60 meshes. The catalysts characterization tools, the details of hydrogenation reaction test, the in-situ DRIFT and DFT calculation are provided in the supplementary materials."
4,Result and discussion,
5,Characterization of the catalyst before reaction,"3.1 Characterization of the catalyst before reaction XRD, N2O titration, FT-IR and TPR were performed to analyze the physicochemical property of the Cu/SiO2 (Fig. 1 ). A prominent peak at 2θ = 22° was corresponding to the amorphous silica (see Fig. 1a) [3,4]. And copper species mainly existed in the form of copper oxide (PDF#45-0937) [4,18]. Additionally, Scherrer formula was employed to calculate the crystal size of copper species, as shown in Table 1 . N2O titration is implemented to calculate the specific surface area (SCu), dispersion (DCu) and volume-surface diameter of metallic Cu (dCu), and the result are summarized in Table 1. TPR characterization is performed before and after N2O oxidation and are shown in Fig. 1b. From Table 1, it was found that the DCu, SCu and dCu of catalyst are 8.34 %, 56.31 m2 g-1 and 12.02 nm, respectively. Fig. 1c shows FT-IR spectra of catalyst. From the Fig. 1c, it can be clearly seen that an absorption peaks at 800 cm-1 and 1100 cm-1 which corresponding to νSiO asymmetric band and asymmetric stretching band of SiO2, respectively [3,18,21]. Besides, the weak vibrating peak at 987 cm-1 was corresponding to the surface of SiO groups [ 22,23]. There was no vibrating peak about chrysocolla observed, suggesting the catalyst did not contain any phases related to chrysocolla. The result of H2-TPR could be observed from Fig. 1d. It was found that a main reduction peak was located at 276 °C which assigned to the reduction of Cu species surface. Meanwhile, additional shoulder centred at 333 °C, assigned to the reduction of bulk copper species, was existed for Cu/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting that the particle size of catalyst was large [18]."
6,Catalytic results,"3.2 Catalytic results The catalytic activity of Cu/SiO2 catalysts was evaluated to study the effect of water on the hydrogenation of ethyl acetate (Fig. 2 ). From the Fig. 2, it was found that the conversion ratio of ethyl acetate reached above 95% and there was no deactivation observed within 100 h, when the reaction occurred in absence of any water. This result showed that Cu/SiO2 catalyst possessed a good hydrogenation performance. However, when the reaction occurred in presence of water, the conversion of ethyl acetate is decreased significantly. More precisely, only a maximum value of 20% conversion is obtained, moreover, the conversion ratio is decreased with the reaction time. The reaction equations in our system was showed in supplementary materials (Equation S1 and S2), and found the main product was ethanol and by-product was ethane. Fortunately, the water had no effect on the ethanol selectivity, which was unchanged, despite the presence of water (Figure S2). In order to understand the influence of water on ethyl acetate hydrogenation, a blank reactions with bare SiO2 was performed. However, it was found that just the existence of SiO2 was no any reactivity for our reaction system. Furthermore, the switch experiment about reaction condition with or without water was performed and the relevant results are presented in Fig. 3 . From the Fig. 3, it can be seen that the ethyl acetate conversion ratio is suddenly decreased when pure ethyl acetate is replaced by ethyl acetate with 5 wt% of water. More precisely, the conversion of ethyl acetate was above 95% at step 1, but the conversion is significantly decreased (less than 30%) when feedstock was replaced by ethyl acetate containing 5 wt% of water (step 2). However, when the feedstock was switched to pure ethyl acetate again (step 3), the conversion ratio is increased to 83 %, which was lower than the initial conversion (step 1). For the step 4 (ethyl acetate containing 5 wt% water), the conversion was sharply decreased again, while it increased again at step 5 (pure ethyl acetate). From the obtained results in Fig. 3, we can understand that the deactivation of catalyst caused by water is partially reversible. Furthermore, it was observed that the catalyst still remained its activities when pure ethyl acetate as raw material is used (step 1, 3, 5); while, in case of presence of 5 wt% water, the conversion is decreased slowly (step 2, 4). The conversion ratio of ethyl acetate hydrogenation under the reaction conditions with or without of water content is fitted linearly, and the results and relevant parameters of the fitting were shown in Fig. 3. From the built-in table, the slopes of the two fitting lines were basically the same, which were -0.146 and -0.141, respectively. This indicated that the two lines were basically parallel. Combined with the experimental data, it could be concluded that the slow of deactivation of the catalyst under the two reaction conditions was caused by the same factor. In other words, the catalyst deactivation which caused by water could be divided into two forms: first, the water led to the catalytic activity fall off a cliff (step 1 to step 2 and step 3 to step 4), which could be partially recovered after the removal of water; second, gradual inactivation of the catalyst (step 1, 3, 5 and step 2, 4) caused by the water, which was irreversible. The subsequent characterizations would be used to confirm the factors of inactivation of Cu/SiO2 catalyst caused by water."
7,Characterization of the catalyst after reaction,"3.3 Characterization of the catalyst after reaction Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of Cu/SiO2 catalyst after reaction under the two different reaction conditions of presence and absence of water. A comparatively high intensity diffraction peak at 43.3° with two other weak peaks at 50.4° and 74.1° are observed and assigned to metallic Cu species (JCPDS 04-0836). [18,24] Additionally, a weak diffraction peak at 37° is corresponding to Cu2O phase (JCPDS 05-0667), [18,24] disclosing that Cu+ was existed after reaction. The crystallite size of Cu was calculated by Scherer formula (see Table 1). In comparison with the crystallite size of Cu before reaction, it could be found that the particles size is increased after reaction at both cases of reaction conditions. However, from Table 1, it can be found that the presence of water just had a little effect on the particle size compared with that in case of absence of water. The morphology of the spent catalyst was monitored by TEM, as shown in Fig. 5 . The area with black dots are identified to the Cu species and the light grey area are fixed as silica material. From Fig. 5, it can be observed that the sintering phenomenon of Fig. 5b was more serious than that of Fig. 5a. Furthermore, SEM-EDS mapping analysis of the spent catalysts was supplied to further show the change of dispersion (Figure S3). From the Figure S3, it was found that the dispersion of copper (Figure S3b) was obvious decreased in comparison with that of Figure S3a, suggesting that water promoted the growth of the catalyst particles due to its large surface tension. [25–27] Meanwhile, the ICP characterization was performed to measure the loading amount of copper after and before the hydrogenation reaction. It was found that the loadings of copper were 26.6% (BR), 25.1% (AR) and 22.3% (ARW), which suggesting that the existence of water worked to promoted the leaching process to copper species in the catalyst. In view of particle growth and the leaching of copper were irreversible, the grain growth of the particles as well as the leaching process of copper may be the reason for the obtained slowly reduction in the catalytic activity. However, these two factors are not the main reason for the obtained significantly deactivation properties of the catalyst. From Fig. 4, it can be observed clearly that the phase of the catalyst did not change after reaction in case of presence of water, suggesting that the water did not accelerate the oxidation of the catalyst. Furthermore, Cu 2p XPS spectra of Cu/SiO2 catalyst after reaction was performed to compare with the valence state of copper on catalyst surface. From Fig. 6 , it was found that the peak intensity of catalyst after reaction in case of absence of water is stronger than the another case with water in the catalyst, which proposing that the content and dispersion of surface copper was smaller for catalyst at condition with water due to the particle growth. The binding energy at 932.5 eV and 952.3 eV are assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of Cu0 or Cu+, respectively. [2,28] The obtained results here confirmed that unobvious satellite peaks corresponding to CuO could be observed, indicating that the water didn’t seriously affected or oxidized Cu0 or Cu+ to Cu2+. Above all, the oxidization effect had almost little influence on the catalyst deactivation. As mentioned above, the presence of water during the hydrogenation reaction caused a slowly deactivation properties to the catalyst due to the growth, leaching and oxidation of copper species. However, the reason of the obtained suddenly and substantial deactivation properties was not clear and misunderstood. Therefore, an in-situ DRIFT spectra and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculation were performed to find the reason of substantial inactivation of the catalyst."
8,In situ DRIFT experiment and DFT calculation,"3.4 In situ DRIFT experiment and DFT calculation The in-situ DRIFT experiment is carried out for Cu/SiO2 catalyst, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . At first, Cu/SiO2 catalyst (30 mg) was in-situ reduced (300 °C, 1 °C/min and pure H2) and the temperature is kept constant for 30 min. After reduction, the temperature is lowered to 260 °C at argon atmosphere and scanned background. Then, ethyl acetate was inserted into the in-situ cell using Ar gas bubbling, and spectrum is scanned one minute apart (black line). As could be observed from Fig. 7, when the ethyl acetate was introduced for 15 minutes, a saturation state of ethyl acetate adsorption on the catalyst surface is reached. Therefore, the adsorption of ethyl acetate is stopped at 16 minutes and the water is introduced into the in-situ cell using Ar gas bubbling. Similarly, the spectra are scanned for 1 min apart (red line). The result showed the absorption peak of ethyl acetate is disappeared rapidly, indicating that the ethyl acetate adsorbing on the catalyst surface was speedily replaced by water. Specifically, the peak of ethyl acetate at 1750 cm-1, which is corresponding to CO and belong to ethyl acetate; [29] [30], so its integral area could reflect the content of ethyl acetate. When water is introduced to the reaction vessel, its integral area is decreased 87.4 % in one minute. Therefore, it could be inferred that water was easier to substitute the adsorption of ethyl acetate on the catalyst surface. In other word, water may be preferably adsorbed on catalyst surface in comparison with ethyl acetate. Combined with the hydrogenation performance (Fig. 3), the competitive adsorption between ethyl acetate and water may be the main reason for the obtained substantial deactivation of catalyst. Furthermore, DFT calculation was performed to confirm it. Figure S4 shows the most possible adsorption status of ethyl acetate and water on Cu (1 1 1) and Cu2O (1 1 1) and the relevant calculated results by DFT are summarized in Table 2 . The bond length of Cu+ O (O came from water) and CO adsorbing on Cu° and Cu+ are measured, and the results are shown in Figure S4 and Table 3 . From Table 2, it was found that the adsorption heat of ethyl acetate (-0.13 eV) and water (−0.21 eV) on Cu (1 1 1) is less than that on Cu2O (1 1 1), indicating that ethyl acetate and water are more inclined to adsorb on Cu+ surface. Previous results showed that the Cu+ sites adsorbed the methoxy and acyl species on its surface, [16] and our calculation also showed ethyl acetate were preferentially adsorbed on Cu+ surface. At the same time, the calculated results indicated that the adsorption heat of water was greater than −1.50 eV, whatever the adsorption methods it took. However, it was different case for ethyl acetate. Precisely, the adsorption heat of ethyl acetate could reach −1.74 eV, only when ethyl acetate adsorbed on a single Cu+ of Cu2O (1 1 1) by CO (Figure S4h), indicating that competitive adsorption with water maybe occur by this adsorption method. The adsorption heat of other adsorption methods, like in Figure S4f (−0.74 eV) and Figure S4g (−0.88 eV), were much lower than the adsorption heat of water. These results suggested that water was easier to absorb on Cu+ in comparison with ethyl acetate under the same condition. Meanwhile, it was found that only when CO adsorbed on a single Cu+, the bond length of CO had a big change that the bond length of CO increased from 1.25 Å to 2.22 Å (Table 3). This result indicated that this adsorption status lead to the instability of CO bond, which was benefit for dissociation of CO. Combined with experiment and the performed in-situ DRIFT results, it could be concluded that the reason of sudden and substantial deactivation of Cu/SiO2 catalyst was the competitive adsorption between water and ethyl acetate, which water was preferential adsorbed on Cu+ surface. From Table 2, it was found that the adsorption heat of water on Cu+ was similar, which are larger than −1.50 eV; and the bond lengths of Cu+ O were almost unchanged before and after calculation, as shown in Table 3, which are smaller than 2.5 Å. These results suggested that the adsorption of water is belong to chemisorption process. [30] Combined with our experimental results that water led to catalyst deactivation rather than acceleration and the ethanol selectivity was not change, suggesting water did not participate hydrogenation reaction. In Figure S4d and S4d1, we put OH− and H+ on the Cu2O surface respectively in the initial structure to represent the dissociation adsorption of H2O, but obtained only H2O molecule adsorbed on the surface in the final optimized structure. These results illustrated that in our reaction system adsorption of water molecule only occupied Cu+ sites and could also release at reaction temperature. It hindered hydrogenation of ethyl acetate by competing adsorption on the Cu+ active sites."
9,Conclusion,"Hydrogenation of ethyl acetate was chosen as probe reaction to investigate the influence of water on Cu/SiO2 catalysts including structure, hydrogenation performance and deactivation mechanism. The results had demonstrated that the water just affected the catalytic activity of ester hydrogenation, and the competitive adsorption between ethyl acetate and water will occur on Cu+ surface at reaction condition. The main reasons of catalyst deactivation caused by water were competitive adsorption. The water preferentially adsorbed on Cu+ surface in comparison with ethyl acetate, which led to hydrogenation conversion of ethyl acetate decrease quickly. Although the water could be released easily from Cu+ surface at reaction temperature, the hydrogenation conversion just could be partial recovered when water was removed due to the growth, leaching and oxidation of copper species caused by water. This work provided a factual basis for the effect of water on ester hydrogenation reaction, which would have a positive effect on industrial production."
