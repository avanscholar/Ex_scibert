0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has potential as a clean and sustainable energy carrier, and hydrogen production from bio-oil reforming has attracted much attention worldwide over the last decade. Since Chornet et al. [1] first proposed the concept of catalytic steam reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates in 1996, much of the literature has focused on bio-oil reforming. Many of these studies have used model compounds such as acetic acid, acetone and alcohol as the feed materials, and few studies have investigated actual bio-oil components. However, steam reforming of actual bio-oil components has encountered serious problems with catalyst deactivation and low hydrogen yields compared to reforming of model compounds. To solve these problems, the processes of partial oxidation and auto-thermal reforming of bio-oil have been studied [2–5]. Thermodynamic analysis and preliminary experimental studies indicate these methods could eliminate carbon deposition on the catalysts, but the hydrogen yield would be substantially reduced because of the amount of oxygen needed in the inlet streams. Dumesic et al. [6] demonstrated that hydrogen could be produced from sugars and alcohols at about 500 K and moderate pressure in a single-reactor aqueous-phase reforming process using a platinum-based catalyst. The sugars were converted to hydrogen (volume fraction 50%) and gaseous alkanes, and the conversion efficiency of the feedstock reached 100%. The only products in the gas phase were hydrogen and carbon dioxide when low molecular weight compounds such as methanol and ethylene glycol were used as the feedstocks. Among these three hydrogen production routes, aqueous phase reforming is currently the most attractive method because it eliminates the need to vaporized both water and the oxygenated hydrocarbon and it occurs at temperatures and pressures where the water-gas shift reaction is favorable [7]. The aqueous phase reforming technology presented by Dumesic et al. could be used for hydrogen production from biomass-based materials, with fructose and polyols as feedstocks. However it is not clear how much hydrogen could be produced by this method with bio-oil feedstock. Bio-oil is a liquid product that can be produced by biomass pyrolysis at high temperatures (>770 K). It is a complex mixture of more than 300 highly oxygenated compounds and can contain up to 50% (mass fraction) water. Consequently, bio-oil aqueous phase reforming will probably be complex [8]. The high oxygen content and low heating value of bio-oil are a bottleneck in commercialization of the biomass pyrolysis process. Obviously, hydrogen is a higher grade fuel than bio-oil and can be used for many applications, and research on aqueous phase reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production may provide new applications for liquid products of biomass pyrolysis. Because of this, and to provide basic data for further experimental studies, thermodynamic analysis of aqueous phase reforming of three model compounds in bio-oil for hydrogen production was performed in this work. Gibbs free energy minimization was employed, and the influences of temperature (340–660 K) and the pressure ratio P sys / P H 2 O (0.1–2.0) on the selectivity of H2 and CH4, formation of solid carbon, and conversion of model compounds were calculated. The impact of CaO and O2 addition on H2, CO2, CH4, solid carbon, CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 formation in aqueous phase reforming were investigated."
1,Methods,
2,Research objectives and calculation conditions,"2.1 Research objectives and calculation conditions The competition reactions and equilibrium composition of H2, CO, CH4 are very important in analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of the aqueous phase reforming process. Methanation is one of the most important side reactions in aqueous phase reforming [6], and we investigated reforming with and without methanation and the influence on the hydrogen selectivity. In the steam reforming process carbon deposition, which can quickly deactivate the catalysts, is very common [9,10]. Although carbon deposition on the catalysts was eliminated by dynamic means, the formation of solid carbon under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions needs to be considered. Consequently, formation of solid carbon was incorporated in the thermodynamic calculation. Experimental analysis of aqueous phase catalytic reforming of polyols by Cortright et al. [6] and Xie et al. [11] showed that the total molar fraction of C2–C3 hydrocarbons was often <2%, and the majority of the gaseous products were H2, CH4, CO, CO2. Thermodynamic calculations by Luo et al. [12,13] only considered H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and the calculation in this paper also only considered these gaseous products plus gas-phase water. The combination of oxidation in aqueous phase reforming with/without methanation was analyzed thermodynamically by Luo et al. [13], and the molar ratio of oxygen/glycerol appeared to be the dominant factor controlling the H2 and CO content in the gas phase. However, no further information about solid carbon formation was given in their paper. Sorption enhanced hydrogen production in the steam reforming process has been widely investigated since Carvill et al. first raised the prospect in 1996 [14]. Experimental [15–17] and thermodynamic investigations [18–20] have demonstrated that hydrogen production is enhanced in the presence of CaO as an absorbent, and this could be attributed to a change in the water–gas shift reaction toward further hydrogen production [21–23]. However, the behavior of aqueous phase reforming with carbon dioxide capture is not well understood. Based on the above facts, bio-oil model compounds (BMCs) and water was selected as the reactant materials in the present study. The products BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite), CH4, CaO, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 were taken into account in the thermodynamic analysis, and the following six cases were considered separately: Case 1) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite), CH4 Case 2) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite) Case 3) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2 Case 4) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite), CH4, CaO, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 Case 5) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite), O2 Case 6) BMCs, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, C (graphite), O2, CaO, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 Case 1 includes the complete set of compounds involved in the reforming reaction with methanation and carbon formation. In Case 2, the methanation reaction was eliminated, and both methanation and carbon formation were excluded in Case 3. Carbon dioxide capture was considered in the thermodynamic equilibrium analysis for aqueous phase reforming in Case 4. Case 5 was similar to Case 2 but with O2 addition. Both sorption-enhanced hydrogen production and oxidation without methanation were considered in the aqueous phase reforming in Case 6. Low molecular weight acids and alcohols such as methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol in bio-oil were selected as the BMCs. Usually, a proportional mass of water is added when pre-treating bio-oil to produce a water-soluble fraction of bio-oil that contains 90% (mass fraction) water. However, the carbon deposition behavior in aqueous phase reforming is more notable with higher inlet concentrations of the model compounds, and the inlet amount-of-substance fraction of the BMCs was maintained at 10% to make analysis of the formation of solid carbon convenient. The lower limit of the reaction temperature in the aqueous phase reforming system is 340 K, and the upper limit one is slightly higher than the critical temperature of water. In this study, the temperature range for the thermodynamic calculations was 340–660 K. One of the basic characteristics of aqueous phase reforming is that the pre-existing H2O in the system is liquid, which means the system pressure needs to be kept above the saturation vapor pressure at the reaction temperature. An established method [12] was used to substitute the reaction pressure with a pressure ratio, P sys / P H 2 O , where P sys is the pressure of system and P H 2 O is the saturation vapor pressure at the reaction temperature. The H2O will obviously be in liquid form with P sys / P H 2 O > 1.0, so the upper limit of P sys / P H 2 O was set at 2.0. Conversely, H2O will be in gas form with P sys / P H 2 O < 1.0, because the reaction rates of the gas–gas and gas–solid reactions are usually greater than those of the liquid–liquid and liquid–solid reactions when the system pressure is lower than saturation vapor pressure. Therefore, the lower limit of P sys / P H 2 O was set at 0.1. The influence of CO2 capture and oxidation in the aqueous phase reforming on the equilibrium concentrations of H2, CH4, CO2, C and the formation of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 was investigated using amount-of-substance ratios of CaO/BMCs and O2/BMCs between 0 and 3.0."
3,Gibbs free energy minimization,"2.2 Gibbs free energy minimization An equation of state was selected for its simplicity and sufficient accuracy in describing the thermodynamic properties of a fluid. The Peng–Robinson equation of state is a simple formula with a P–V–T relationship, and it performs as well as or better than the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation in all the cases tested, and is advantageous in the prediction of liquid phase densities [24]. Consequently, it is extensively used in gas–liquid equilibrium calculations at moderate or high system pressures [10,12,25]. The functional form of the Peng–Robinson equation of state of a pure fluid can be expressed as follows [24]: (1) P = RT V − b − a V ( V + b ) + b ( V − b ) where a is a measure of the intermolecular attraction force, and b is related to the size of the molecule. When Eq. (1) is applied at the critical point, the following equations are obtained: (2) a ( T c ) = 0.45724 R 2 T c 2 P c (3) b ( T c ) = 0.07780 R T c P c At temperature other than the critical, these equations are in the following form: (4) a ( T ) = a ( T c ) α ( T r , ω ) (5) b ( T ) = b ( T c ) where α(Tr , ω) is a dimensionless function of the reduced temperature and acentric factor and is equal to one at the critical temperature. At temperatures lower than the critical point the following equation is used: (6) α ( T r , ω ) = ( 1 + m ( 1 − T r 1 / 2 ) ) where, (7) m = 0.37464 + 1.54226 ω − 0.26992 ω 2 At temperatures higher than the critical point, Eq. (6) gives unrealistic results. The boundary conditions are that attraction between the molecules should be absent at very high temperatures, and α reduces asymptotically to zero. Boston and Mathias derived the following alternative function for temperatures higher than critical point: (8) α ( T r , ω ) = { exp [ c ( 1 − T r d ) ] } 2 (9) d = 1 + m / 2 , c = 1 − 1 / d Based on the van der Waals classical rule of mixtures, the mixture parameters am and bm can be written as follows [24]: (10) b m = ∑ i = 1 N y i b i (11) a m = ∑ i = 1 N ∑ j = 1 N y i y j a ij To increase the calculation accuracy, the binary interaction coefficient δ ij can be introduced to Eq. (11) as follows: (12) a ij = ( 1 − δ ij ) a i 1 / 2 a j 1 / 2 When i = j, δ ij = 0, and when i≠j, δ ij is an empirically determined binary interaction for species i and species j, and its value usually can be obtained by fitting the experimental data of mixtures. Eq. (1) can be rewritten as follows [24]: (13) Z 3 − ( 1 − B ) Z 2 + ( A − 3 B 2 − 2 B ) Z − ( AB − B 2 − B 3 ) = 0 where, (13a) A = a m P R 2 T 2 (13b) B = b m P RT (13c) Z = PV RT . According to the expression of the fugacity coefficient of species i (14) ln φ ^ i = 1 RT ∫ ∞ V t [ RT V t − ( ∂ P ∂ n i ) T , V t , n j ( j ≠ i ) ] d V t − ln Z Using the Peng–Robinson equation of state to represent the fluid phase, the fugacity coefficient of species i in a mixture can be calculated from the following equation: (15) ln φ ^ i = b i b m ( Z − 1 ) − ln ( Z − B ) + A 2 2 B [ b i b m − 2 a m ∑ j = 1 N y i a ij ] ln ( Z + ( 2 + 1 ) B Z − ( 2 − 1 ) B ) To solve the problems of phase equilibrium and chemical equilibrium in a series of chemical reactions, balanced thermodynamic calculations of complex reaction system include the equilibrium constant method, relaxation method, and Gibbs free energy minimization method [26]. Among these methods, the Gibbs free energy minimization method is believed to be an effective way to determine the equilibrium compositions of each component in a complex system [27]. As the system reaches equilibrium at the appropriate temperature and pressure, Gibbs free energy minimization can be used directly to determine the equilibrium composition of each component in the mixture. The main benefit of the Gibbs free energy minimization is that there is no need to check the specific information for each reaction in the system. The total Gibbs free energy of the system is equal to the sum of the standard Gibbs free energies of all the pure components and that of the mixed system at equilibrium. This can be expressed as follows: (16) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ i = ∑ n i G i o + RT ∑ n i ln f ^ i f i o The minimum value of Eq. (16) can be obtained by finding the set of ni that minimizes Gt at constant T and P. This minimization is subject to the constraints of elemental balance of all reactants in the mixture. (17) ∑ i n i a ik = A k k = 1 , 2 ⋯ , M The combination function ψ can be constructed using the Lagrange multiplier method as follows: (18) ψ = G t + ∑ k = 1 M λ k a i k The minimum value of the combination function ψ is equal to the primitive function Gt . In Eq. (18), the Lagrange multiplier λk is constant, and its value can be calculated. For reaction equilibria in the system, if f ^ i = y i ϕ ^ i P , f i o = P o , and G i o = Δ G f i o , and derivation of the combination function ψ with respect to ni is zero, then this equation can be written as follows: (19) ∂ ψ ∂ n i = ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i o + RT ln y i ϕ ^ i P P o + ∑ k = 1 M λ k a i k ) = 0 Constraint of Eq. (17) gives a set of (N + M) equations, thus the values of ni and λk can be obtained under the minimization condition. When carbon (graphite) formation and CaO are considered in the reaction system [9,10], then the equilibrium condition is given by the following equation: (20) ∑ i = 1 N − 2 n i ( Δ G f i o + RT ln y i ϕ ^ i P P o + ∑ k λ k a i k ) + ( n c Δ G f C ( s ) o ) + ( n CaO Δ G f C a O ( s ) o ) = 0 The constraints are the same as Eq. (17). The Aspen Plus 11.1 software (Aspen Technology, Inc, Burlington, MA) was used for the thermodynamic calculations, and the RGibbs reactor was selected for the calculations with the Peng–Robinson Boston-Mathias Extrapolation. The solid phase is not included in the phase equilibrium calculation as the RGibbs reactor deals with the equilibria of gas–liquid reactions involved with the solid phase. The RGibbs reactor can be used to calculate the chemical equilibria between any number of conventional solid components and the fluid phases."
4,"Definition of selectivity, conversion, carbon formation, and normalized variation","2.3 Definition of selectivity, conversion, carbon formation, and normalized variation Aqueous phase reforming of the three model compounds can be described by the following reactions: (21) C H 3 OH + H 2 O → C O 2 + 3 H 2 (22) C H 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 (23) C H 2 OHC H 2 OH + 2 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 5 H 2 Selectivity of the products (Si ) is defined as follows: (24) S i = M i ∑ i M i × 100 % where Mi is the outlet molar flow rate of H2, CO, CO2, or CH4 in the gas phase, and steam is ignored in the gas phase products. Eqs. 21–23 show that the maximum stoichiometric hydrogen selectivity of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol are 75.00%, 66.67%, and 71.43%, respectively. Conversion of the model compounds (C) is defined as follows: (25) C = M in − M out M in × 100 % where M in is the molar flow rate of each model compounds at the inlet, and M out is the molar flow rate of each model compound at the outlet. Carbon formation (Cs ) is defined by the following equation: (26) C s = C out M in where C out is the molar flow rate of solid carbon at the outlet. Finally, the normalized variation used in Cases 4, 5 and 6 is defined as follows: (27) N v = M i R M × M in × 100 % where Mi is the molar flow rate of species i at the outlet, RM is a constant of the stoichiometric coefficient of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 related to the inlet model compound. For example, if Mi is the molar flow rate of H2, RM is equal to 3, 4 and 5 for methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol reforming, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,"The thermodynamic equilibria were investigated for aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol with amount-of-substance fractions of 10% in water (or steam) at various temperatures (340–660 K) and pressure ratios ( P sys / P H 2 O = 0.1–2.0). The CH4 selectivity, H2 selectivity, carbon formation, and conversion of the model compounds were analyzed in detail. The effect of oxygen addition and sorption-enhanced reforming on hydrogen selectivity and carbon formation were studied at 500 K and 2.90 MPa."
6,CH4 selectivity,"3.1 CH4 selectivity The CH4 selectivity in the gas phase was predicted thermodynamically as a function of the temperature and P sys / P H 2 O in aqueous phase reforming of the three model compounds in Case 1 (Fig. 1 ). The CH4 selectivity obviously decreased as the temperature increased and increased at higher system pressures. At 340 K and 0.06 MPa, the maximum values of the CH4 selectivity were 74.85%, 49.96%, and 62.44% for reforming of methanol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol, respectively. Formation of CH4 occurs through the BCM’s thermal decomposition to C, CO and H2, which are mildly endothermic, (28) C H 3 OH → C + H 2 O + H 2 (29) C H 3 COOH → 2 C + 2 H 2 O (30) C H 2 OHC H 2 OH → 2 C + 2 H 2 O + H 2 followed by the recombination of C with H2 into CH4 (exothermic): (31) C + H 2 → C H 4 Formation of CH4 may also occurs through the following reactions [6,9]: (32) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O (33) CO + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O The reactions in Eqs. 32 and 33 are exothermic, which implies that formation of CH4 is thermodynamically unfavorable at higher temperatures. An increase in the system pressure because of a decrease in the volume will shift the two methanation reactions to the right-hand side and increase CH4 production. Consequently, the CH4 selectivity in the gas phase will increase with either a decrease in the temperature or an increase in the system pressure. The CH4 selectivity in Case 1 (Fig. 1) for reforming of methanol (72.83%), acetic acid (49.37%), and ethylene glycol (61.62%) at 500 K and P sys / P H 2 O = 1.1 (system pressure = 2.90 MPa) were similar to the thermodynamic equilibrium values. This is undesirable for hydrogen production because the CH4 formation reactions need to consume hydrogen in the system, and a highly selective catalyst is needed to suppress the methanation reaction during kinetic investigation of the aqueous phase reforming process."
7,Carbon formation,"3.2 Carbon formation Carbon formation was not observed in aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol in Case 1. The thermodynamic results of carbon formation in Case 2 were investigated as a function of the temperature and P sys / P H 2 O (Fig. 2 ). Carbon formed over the entire range of temperature and pressure conditions investigated. For example, 0.999, 1.940, and 1.999 mol of solid carbon were generated at 500 K and 2.90 MPa from reforming of methanol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol, respectively. However, in practice, carbon formation was not detected by Cortright et al. [6], and there may be many reasons for this. First, the carbon formation process is a rate controlled reaction rather than an equilibrium controlled reaction, and the reaction progress is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium state under the operating conditions of kinetic experiments. Second, the carbon formation process depends on the structure of the catalyst, the shape of reactor, and on the type of reactants and their inlet concentrations. These kinetic factors can effectively decrease the amount of carbon formation. Eqs. 28–30 may be involved in the formation of solid carbon. These are dehydration reactions of methanol (Eq. (28)), acetic acid (Eq. (29)), and ethylene glycol (Eq. (30)). All these reactions are endothermic, which means that similar trends are observed for the amount of solid carbon formed as a function of the temperature in reforming of these compounds. The formation of solid carbon in the system may also occur through reactions between gas products [9]: (34) CO + H 2 → C + H 2 O (35) C O 2 + 2 H 2 → C + 2 H 2 O (36) C H 4 → C + 2 H 2 the reactions in Eqs. (34),(35) are exothermic and thermodynamically favored at low temperatures, while the reaction in Eq. (36) is thermodynamically unfavorable at low temperatures and its contribution to carbon formation is very small. Both methanation and solid carbon formation consume hydrogen, which decreases the hydrogen selectivity. This indicates that these reactions need to be suppressed for successful hydrogen production during kinetic investigations."
8,H2 selectivity,"3.3 H2 selectivity Fig. 3 shows the changes of H2 selectivity for aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol at 340–660 K and with P sys / P H 2 O of 0.1–2.0 in Cases 1, 2 and 3. In Case 1 (Fig. 3a-1, b-1 and c-1) both higher temperatures and lower system pressures increased the equilibrium hydrogen selectivity for reforming of the three model compounds. At 340–500 K and with P sys / P H 2 O of 1.0–2.0 the influence of temperature and pressure on hydrogen selectivity was not large. At 660 K and 2.21 MPa, the maximum hydrogen selectivity in reforming of methanol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol reached 25.33%, 12.11%, and 14.03%, respectively. However, the CH4 selectivity was much higher than the hydrogen selectivity under the same operating conditions, with results of 49.65% (methanol), 40.89% (acetic acid), and 50.20% (ethylene glycol). This indicates that the methanation reaction is thermodynamically more favorable than hydrogen production in Case 1. In Case 2 (Fig. 3a-2, b-2 and c-2) the equilibrium hydrogen selectivity decreased at higher temperatures and increased at higher system pressures. This implies that the mechanism of hydrogen production in Case 2 is different from that in Case 1. The reforming process at 500 K and 2.90 MPa can be described as follows. It was found in Section 3.2 that 99.9% of methanol, 97.0% of acetic acid and 99.9% of ethylene glycol reacted to form solid carbon via the reactions in Eqs. 28–30, and the remainder of these feedstocks formed hydrogen by aqueous phase reforming via the reactions in Eqs. 21–23. The hydrogen produced in acetic acid reforming comes from aqueous phase reforming, while in methanol or ethylene glycol reforming the vast majority of hydrogen is generated from the carbon formation reaction. Consequently, at 500 K and 2.90 MPa, the hydrogen selectivity of methanol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol reforming are 99.92%, 66.67%, and 99.90%, respectively. These results are very similar to the thermodynamic equilibrium hydrogen selectivity of 100% (methanol), 66.67% (acetic acid), and 100% (ethylene glycol). The reactions in Eqs. 28–30 show that all the H atoms contained in the acetic acid form water, while each mole of methanol or ethylene glycol will generate 1 mol of hydrogen. Because only 3.0% of the acetic acid took part in the aqueous phase reforming reaction, processing of acid acetic yields 0.12 mol of hydrogen per mole of acetic acid, which is far less than the hydrogen yield from methanol or ethylene glycol reforming. In Case 3 (Fig. 3a-3, b-3 and c-3) the changes in hydrogen selectivity were monitored after suppression of the methanation and carbon formation reactions. The hydrogen selectivity decreased with increasing temperature. The system pressure did not greatly influence the hydrogen selectivity at temperatures <460 K. At >460 K the hydrogen selectivity of acetic reforming increased slowly with increasing pressure, and the hydrogen selectivity of methanol and ethylene glycol reforming decreased with increasing pressure. At 500 K and 2.90 MPa, the hydrogen selectivity of aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol were 74.98%, 66.64%, and 71.38%, respectively. These results were similar to the maximum stoichiometric hydrogen selectivity of 75.00% (methanol), 66.67% (acetic acid), and 71.43% (ethylene glycol). In Case 3 (data not shown in Fig. 3), the amount-of-substance fraction of water at the outlet decreased with the stoichiometric ratio as shown in Eqs. 21–23. This is a result of the aqueous phase reforming process, where each mole of methanol, acetic acid, or ethylene glycol consumes one, two, or 2 mol of water, respectively."
9,Conversion of model compounds,"3.4 Conversion of model compounds The thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of each of the feedstocks was >99.99% over the investigated temperature and pressure conditions in Cases 1 and 2, and a figure for these results is not given because the change was very small. This result implies that the conversion can easily reach 100% in a kinetic experimental study if a robust catalyst with good performance is chosen. However, most of carbon atoms in the feedstocks formed solid carbon in Case 2. The thermodynamic equilibrium conversion without methanation or carbon formation is shown in Fig. 4 . The conversions of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol slightly decreased as the pressure increased. The decrease in acetic acid conversion (99.80%–43.72%) was more than that observed for methanol (remained at >99.43%) or ethylene glycol (remained at >99.99%) when the pressure was increased from 0.26 MPa to 5.28 MPa. These results indicate that suppression of methanation will allow formation of solid carbon in the system. Consequently, if control of both the methanation and carbon formation reactions during aqueous phase reforming decreases the conversion of the feedstocks, a different solution is required to balance the control of carbon formation, suppression of methanation and promotion of conversion of feedstocks. An earlier experimental study of steam reforming of ethanol showed that use of Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst reduced the amount of carbon formation and suppressed the methanation reaction [28]. However, the behavior of aqueous phase catalytic reforming of low molecular weight alcohols and acids in bio-oil at low temperature and moderate pressure (e.g. 500 K and 2.90 MPa) needs to be investigated further."
10,Sorption-enhanced reforming,"3.5 Sorption-enhanced reforming Sorption-enhanced reforming promotes the reversible water–gas shift reaction toward further hydrogen production by removing CO2 from the product gases, and will force the equilibrium towards higher hydrogen production in the steam reforming process [14,21–23]. In this section, the influence of CaO addition on H2 production in the aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol was investigated at 500 K and 2.90 MPa with the molar flow rate of CaO regulated at 0–1.5 times that of the inlet model compounds. The side reaction of methanation was taken into account. The formation of H2, CH4, CO2, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 was monitored as a function of the molar ratio of CaO/BMCs (Fig. 5 ). In the following discussion, reforming of methanol is used as an example. The normalized change in CO2 concentration decreased sharply from 25.55% to 1.18% as the molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH increased from 0 to 0.25 and all the input CaO reacted with CO2 to form CaCO3 (Fig. 5a). With further increases in the molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH, the CO2 concentration in the gas phase decreased slowly to zero. When the molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH was greater than 0.34, the Ca(OH)2 concentration gradually increased from zero and the CaCO3 concentration decreased correspondingly. The trends for H2 concentration can be divided into the following stages: 1) a slow increase from 0.74% to 1.57% as the CaO/CH3OH molar ratio increased from 0 to 0.25; 2) a rapid increase to 11.33% as the molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH increased from 0.25 to 0.34; and 3) a constant value (11.33%) with any further increases in the CaO/CH3OH molar ratio above 0.34. The trends for CH4 were the opposite to those of H2. This indicates that the mechanism of sorption-enhanced hydrogen production in aqueous phase reforming may be affected by promotion of the reversible water–gas shift reaction toward further hydrogen production by CO2 capture, which is similar to the steam reforming process, and suppression of methanation, which facilities the aqueous phase reforming reaction. Under the operating range investigated in this section, the majority of the increase in H2 resulted from the suppression of methanation. Importantly, no carbon formation was observed during the addition of CaO. As mentioned earlier, aqueous phase reforming of methanol with a CaO/CH3OH molar ratio >0.34 will result in formation of Ca(OH)2. Compared with CaCO3, the presence of Ca(OH)2 in the system is a desirable pre-pretreatment (hydration) since it is known to allow the capacity for carbonation of the CaO to increase dramatically and is used as a regeneration step for the CaO sorbent. Consequently, the optimum molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH in aqueous phase reforming process needs to be chosen to maximize H2 production and to operate at temperatures/pressures above the decomposition of Ca(OH)2 to CaO (since the formation of Ca(OH)2 cannot be avoided). Therefore, the optimum molar ratio of CaO/CH3OH should slightly lower than 0.34 in the experimental investigations. Comparison of Fig. 5a, b and c shows that the trends for H2, CH4, CO2 and formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 are quite similar. The optimum molar ratios of CaO/CH3COOH and CaO/CH2OHCH2OH should be slightly lower than 1.09 and 0.86, respectively."
11,Oxygen addition,"3.6 Oxygen addition Previous studies have indicated that the formation of solid carbon during steam reforming could be reduced by addition of a set amount of O2 to the reactor [2–5,29–32]. Consequently, the influence of O2 addition on the behavior of aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol at 500 K and 2.90 MPa was investigated. The molar flow rate of O2 was regulated at 0–3.0 times that of the inlet model compounds, and methanation was not considered. The changes in H2, CO2, and solid carbon were monitored as a function of the molar ratio of O2/BMCs (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 suggests that, in aqueous phase reforming of methanol and ethylene glycol, the reaction between O2 and H2 is thermodynamically more favorable than the reaction between O2 and solid carbon. A higher molar ratio of O2/CH3OH and O2/CH2OHCH2OH will lead to rapid consumption of H2 in the system, and as the molar ratio increased from 0 to 0.5, the H2 variation decreased from a maximum value to near zero. With further increases in the molar ratio the solid carbon variation decreased and concentration of CO2 in the gas phase increased. Consumption of H2 and solid carbon in aqueous phase reforming of acetic acid occurs simultaneously, but the consumption of H2 is much faster than that of solid carbon. As the amount of solid carbon reduced by 50%, the H2 variation decreased from 33.38% to 1.44% for methanol reforming, from 3.02% to 0.79% for acetic acid reforming, and from 20.04% to 0.72% for ethylene glycol reforming. These results are undesirable for hydrogen production in aqueous phase reforming. The influence of both the CO2 sorbent and oxygen addition on aqueous phase reforming equilibrium concentrations of the products was investigated further. The molar ratio of O2 and the inlet model compounds was maintained at 1.0, and the molar flow rate of CaO was regulated at 0–3.0 times that of the inlet model compounds. The variations in H2, CO2, and solid carbon, and formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 were monitored as a function of the molar ratio of CaO/BMCs (Fig. 7 ). Comparison of the equilibrium normalized changes in Cases 5 and 6 shows that in Case 6 the addition of CaO and O2 reduced formation of solid carbon and increased H2 production. As the amount-of-substance ratio of CaO/BMCs increased, formation of solid carbon decreased from the maximum value to zero and the normalized variation in H2 rapidly increased to a maximum and then remained relatively constant. The change in the normalized variation in H2 in this Case was much greater than that in Case 4. The maximum normalized variations in H2 in Case 6 for reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol were 33.33%, 50.00% and 60.00%, respectively. The normalized variation in H2 may increase in this case through suppression of the reactions in Eq. (28) to Eq. (31) and Eq. (34) to Eq. (36) because of carbon dioxide capture, and promotion of the aqueous phase reforming reactions in Eq. (21) to Eq. (23). The different increases observed in the normalized variation in H2 for the three feedstocks may be partly because of the stabilized inlet O2 concentration in the equilibrium calculation. A molar ratio of O2/BMCs of 1.0 may not be optimum for reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol, and it should be studied in further kinetic experiments."
12,Conclusions,"With methanation and solid carbon formation taken into consideration in aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol, the maximum H2 selectivity reaches only 10% under the temperature and pressure conditions investigated. However, at 500 K and P sys / P H 2 O = 1.1 (system pressure = 2.90 MPa) the CH4 selectivity reached maximum values of 72.83%, 49.37% and 61.62% for reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol, respectively. These results are very similar to the maximum stoichiometric methane selectivity of 74.85% (methanol), 49.96% (acetic acid) and 62.44% (ethylene glycol). The maximum H2 selectivity increased when methanation was suppressed, and H2 was mainly produced directly by cracking reactions of the feedstocks rather than through the aqueous phase reforming reaction. Consequently, each mole of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol will form 0.999, 1.940 and 1.999 mol of solid carbon at 500 K and P sys / P H 2 O = 1.1, respectively, which is undesirable. Without methanation or solid carbon formation in the reforming process at 500 K and 2.90 MPa, the H2 selectivity reached 74.98%, 66.64% and 71.38% for methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol, respectively. These results are similar to the maximum stoichiometric hydrogen selectivity of 75.00% (methanol), 66.67% (acetic acid) and 71.43% (ethylene glycol). Conversion of each of the three model compounds was >99%. At 500 K and 2.90 MPa, as the molar ratio of CaO/BMCs increased, the normalized variation in H2 increased and that for CH4 decreased correspondingly. Carbon formation was not observed during the sorption-enhanced reforming process, and the optimum molar ratios of CaO/CH3OH, CaO/CH3COOH and CaO/CH2OHCH2OH were slightly lower than 0.34, 1.09 and 0.86, respectively. At 500 K and 2.90 MPa, formation of solid carbon can be effectively suppressed by addition of a set amount of O2 to the system. However, this will be at the expense of H2 production. The combination of oxidation and CO2 capture in the aqueous phase reforming of methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol rapidly increased the normalized variation in H2 to 33.33%, 50.00% and 60.00%, respectively, when the O2/BMCs molar ratio was regulated at 1.0. The formation of solid carbon decreased to zero simultaneously. Control of carbon formation, suppression of methanation and promotion of the conversion of feedstock require further balancing in kinetic studies of aqueous phase reforming. Consequently, further experimental studies are required to investigate the aqueous phase reforming behavior of low molecular weight alcohols and acids in bio-oil at low temperatures and moderate pressures (e.g. 2.90 MPa and 500 K)."
