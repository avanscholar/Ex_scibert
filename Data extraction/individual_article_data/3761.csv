0,Introduction,"With increasing global energy demand and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels, exploiting clean and sustainable energy alternatives have attracted significant research attention [1,2]. Owing to advantages including a similar carbon number to diesel oil, low pollution, and renewable and readily available, vegetable oil (VO) and waste food oil (WFO) are considered potential candidates for raw materials to produce green diesel [2–5]. The key process in the conversion of VO or WFO to green diesel is reducing the oxygen content of the oils [4–6]. Deoxygenation of oxygen-containing bio-oils takes place via three pathways: direct hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) [6–8], decarboxylation/decarbonylation(HDC) [9,10], and hydrogenolysis [2,3]. Generally, hydrodeoxygenation reactions produce water (direct HDO) [11,12], CO2 (decarboxylation), and CO (decarbonylation) in addition to the desired hydrocarbon compounds [13,14]. For the HDO reaction of bio-oils, sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 [1,11] or CoMo/Al2O3 [8] catalysts are most commonly used because the active sites can be provided by coordinatively unsaturated sulfur anion vacancies [15]. However, these sulfided catalysts frequently deactivate due to the gradual loss of sulfur from the catalyst and/or oxidation of the active phase resulting from the high oxygen (>30 wt%) and low sulfur (<3 wt%) contents of the bio-oil feedstocks [16,17]. Therefore, some research has focused on the development of non-sulfided catalysts for upgrading bio-oils. Yakovlev et al. prepared reduced supported Ni-based catalysts for HDO of biodiesel [18]. Complete conversion of the biodiesel was achieved in the temperature range of 280–330 °C, and the obtained alkanes yield was approximately 70%. Copper incorporation was shown to facilitate the reduction of nickel oxide and prevent methanization of the oxy-organics. Wang et al. prepared reduced NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of aldehydes [19]. These reduced catalysts could achieve a higher aldehyde conversion and alcohol yield than their sulfided counterparts. In another study, hydrogenation of various components of bio-oils, including sugars, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, and carboxylic acids, was conducted over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst at temperatures of 120–160 °C. The results showed that the hydrogenation reaction significantly increased alkyl and methoxy/hydroxyl carbons, reduced the acidity, density, and viscosity, and improved the overall thermal stability of the bio-oil [20]. These results demonstrate that sulfur-free reduced catalysts are successful in removing oxygen from bio-oils. It is thought that the reduced NiMo catalysts represented as Ni–Mo–O structures possess catalytic behavior analogous to that of Ni–Mo–S catalysts [21]. However, only little research has been done to reveal the structure–activity relationship of these reduced catalysts. Stearic acid (SA) is not only a component of VO and WFO, but is also the primary hydrolysis product of triglyceride-based oils. This work has focused on the catalytic conversion of SA to fuel oil over H2-reduced NiMo catalysts. The effects of reduction temperature, reaction pressure, and the use of a hydrogen-donor (tetralin) on the conversion and product distribution were investigated. Furthermore, the reaction pathway of SA over the reduced catalyst was elucidated. This investigation will be useful for developing new process routes to produce green diesel from renewable biomass resources such as VO and WFO."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials γ-Al2O3 and H-type β-zeolite (Si/Al = 25) were purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Corporation, Tianjin, China. Stearic acid (analytical grade, Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China), dodecane (>99%, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and tetralin (99%, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.) were used as received. The feedstock (stearic acid) composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC), and the feedstock contained 94.2% stearic acid, 3.4% eicosanoic acid, 2.0% palmitic acid, and 0.4% oleic acid."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation First, the Hβ-Al2O3 composite support (denoted as support) was prepared by mechanically mixing γ-Al2O3 and β-zeolite with deionized water at a γ-Al2O3/β-zeolite mass ratio of 3:2. The mixed suspension was then evaporated at 80 °C to remove the water, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 5 h. Next, the oxidized NiMo catalyst (denoted as Cox) was prepared. The desired amounts of Ni(NO3)2·5H2O, (NH4)2MoO4·12H2O, and KNO3 were dissolved in deionized water to form a metallic salt solution. The Hβ-Al2O3 support was then mixed with the metallic salt solution, and the mixture was rotary evaporated at 80 °C to remove water. The resultant solid sample was calcined at 450 °C for 5 h. The atomic ratio of Ni:Mo was 3:7, and the total mass fraction of NiO and MoO3 in the catalyst was 20%. Finally, the reduced NiMo catalysts (denoted as Cre) were obtained through reduction of the Cox at different temperatures (400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C) for 5 h with H2 in a quartz tube reactor (H2 flow rate: 75 mL/min). The resultant catalysts formed at different reduction temperatures are denoted as T400, T450, T500, T550, and T600, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The obtained catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, SmartLab3, Agilent, USA) with Cu Kα monochromatized radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Diffraction patterns were recorded for an angle range of 5°–80°. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (SBET), average pore diameter (Dpore), and total pore volume (VTotal) of the catalysts were measured using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K on a Quantachrome 2200e instrument (Florida, USA). All samples were degassed at 200 °C for 10 h. The volumes of mesopores (VMeso) and micropores (VMicro) were calculated from the desorption branch by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) method, respectively. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed in a DAS-7000 adsorption instrument (Hunan Huasi Instrument Co. Ltd., China). The samples (0.05 g) were purged with argon gas before TPR. The analysis was carried out using a 5% H2/Ar air stream, and samples were heated from 50 °C to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a quartz tube reactor equipped with a residual gas analyzer (RGA, RGA200, Agilent). Prior to the adsorption experiments, the samples (0.25 g) were purged at 200 °C for 2 h in a He flow. Upon cooling to 100 °C, the samples were saturated with a NH3 flow for 1 h, and the physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging with He gas for 1 h. The NH3 desorption was performed by heating the sample from 50 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C/min in He. The desorbed NH3 was analyzed on-line with the RGA. The acidity was calculated according to the method described in our previous study [22]."
5,Hydrotreating process,"2.4 Hydrotreating process Hydrogenation experiments were carried out in a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with an electromagnetically driven stirrer. For each run, 2.0 g of SA, 12.0 g of dodecane, and 0.15 g of catalyst were placed in the reactor. After displacing the air by purging with H2, the reactor was pressurized with H2 to a certain pressure. The reactor was then heated to 380 °C while stirring at 200 rpm, and afterwards, more hydrogen was added to reach final desired pressure (0.1–4 MPa). After reacting for 4 h, the reactor was cooled to 60 °C. The gas product was collected and analyzed by off-line GC. The liquid product and catalyst were recovered from the reactor and separated through filtration. The catalyst was washed with ethanol and then dried at 50 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis The liquid products were first methyl esterified according to standard method GB/T 17376-2008. Then, the components in the products were analyzed qualitatively by GC–MS (GC7820A, MS 5977E, Agilent) and quantitatively by GC-FID (9792II, FULI, China). For the GC–MS analyses, a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used with He as the carrier gas. The temperature program for the oven was as follows: an initial isothermal hold at 60 °C for 5 min, followed by heating to 300 °C at 10 °C/min, after which the temperature was held constant at 300 °C for 5 min. The GC-FID analyses used a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm); the oven temperature program was the same as that used in the GC–MS analyses. The gaseous hydrocarbon products were analyzed with an off-line gas chromatograph (GC, FULI-9790II, China) equipped with a FID detector and a HP-PLOT/Q column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 40.0 μm). A GC equipped with a packed column (TDX-01, 2 m × 3 mm × 0D) and connected to a RGA unit was used to separate and analyze the inorganic gaseous products (CO, CO2, and H2). The following oven temperature program was used: an initial isothermal hold at 60 °C for 5 min, followed by heating to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, after which the temperature was held constant at 240 °C for 15 min. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using standard gases (CH4, C2H4, C2H2, C2H6, C3H8, C3H4, C3H6, C4H8, C4H10, CO, CO2, and He as the balance gas). The SA conversion (CON), isomerization (ISO), and selectivity (S) of products were used to evaluate the efficiency of the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation. CON, ISO, and S were calculated using the following equations: (1) C O N ( % ) = ϖ 1 − ϖ 2 ϖ 1 × 100 % (2) I S O ( % ) = ϖ 3 ϖ A l k a n e s + ϖ A l k e n e s × 100 % (3) S ( % ) = ϖ x ϖ 1 − ϖ 2 × 100 % where ω1 is the total content of all compounds in the GC analysis; ω2 is the content of methyl stearate; ω3 is the total content of all isomerized hydrocarbons(isomers) including ≤C16, C17, and C18 products; and ωx is the content of ≤C16, C17, and C18 hydrocarbons in the liquid product."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD spectra for the different catalysts are presented in Fig.1 . The peaks at around 2θ = 7.9° and 22.5° are assigned to the Hβ-zeolite phase, while the peaks at around 2θ = 37.3°, 45.6° and 67.2° are associated with the γ-Al2O3 phase [9,23]. No marked difference is observed in the peak intensity of the support for all catalysts, indicating that the skeleton structure of Hβ-Al2O3 is stable under the reduction conditions. The broad peak at 2θ = 62.3° observed for Cox is attributed to the NiO (220) phase which become weaker in the reduced catalysts [24]. The peaks at around 2θ = 12.1°, 31.3°, 32.3°, 39.6° and 51.9° are associated with the MoO3 phase, while the peaks at around 2θ = 14.4°, 21.4°, 26.8°, 28.8° and 44.3° are associated with the MoO2 phase [22]. For the Cre catalysts, the MoO3 and MoO2 peaks clearly become weaker, indicating that the crystallinity and particle size of MoO2 and MoO3 decrease significantly [16,25]. In other words, the dispersity of the metal active sites is significantly improved by reduction treatment. The N2-physisorption results for the catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The average pore diameters range from 6.83 nm to 8.50 nm, indicating that the obtained catalysts are mesopore-predominant materials. The SBET and VTotal of the Hβ-Al2O3 support are 279.2 m2/g and 0.594 cm3/g, respectively. Compared to the Hβ-Al2O3 support, the SBET and VTotal of the Cox reduced by 20.66% and 34.34%, respectively. This is likely a result of partial pore blockage in the support by Ni and Mo species crystallites derived from the impregnation process [26,27]. In addition, as the reduction temperature increases, the SBET, VTotal, VMeso, and VMicro of the Cre catalysts initially increase and then decrease, reaching a maximum at 450 °C. This indicates that an appropriate increase in the reduction temperature is useful for improving the porous properties; however, an excessively high reduction temperature, e.g., 600 °C, likely causes extensive sintering of the metal active components [26], thus leading to blockage of the pores in the support. Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms for the Hβ-Al2O3 support and different catalysts. All of the NiMo catalysts exhibited typical type III isotherms according to the IUPAC (2015) classification, as well as the adsorption-desorption hysteresis loops commonly found in mesoporous materials [28]. The H2-TPR profiles of the Hβ-Al2O3 support, Cox, T450, and T600 are shown in Fig. 3 . The support exhibits a flat and broad reduction peak, indicating that no reducible species exist in the support. For Cox, the reduction peaks at around 490 °C (T1) and 545 °C (T2) are attributed to the reduction of polymolybdate and multilayered Mo oxides to MoO2 species. The broad peak at around 700 °C (T3) is due to the reduction of microcrystalline MoO3 to MoO2 and the complete reduction of Mo4+ species to Mo° [29,30]. The reduction of Ni oxide likely overlaps with the reduction of the Mo species and appears in the 500–570 °C range [29]. For T450, the broad and mild reduction peak at about 315 °C (T4) could be due to the reduction of amorphous polymolybdate Mo oxides which were formed during the rapid cooling process after H2 reduction treatment [31]. A new Ni-Mo-O species could be developed in the reduction treatment, and its reduction peak likely overlaps with the reduction of the amorphous polymolybdate Mo species at T4 [30]. For T600, the reduction peaks (T4 and T5) shift to a slightly higher temperature range (from 300 to 400 °C) compared to T450, indicating that the deep reduction at 600 °C leads to the formation of a Ni-Mo-O species which has strong interaction with support. The peak intensity of T3 becomes weaker than for T450, indicating that there is fewer reducible species in T600. The NH3-TPD profiles for the support and catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The acidities of weak, medium, and strong acids were estimated from the peak areas derived from a Gaussian fitting of the NH3-TPD profiles in the temperature ranges of 50–190 °C, 190–400 °C, and >400 °C, respectively [22,32]. The results are summarized in Table 2 . In contrast with composite support, the total acidity and the acidity of strong acid sites in Cox decrease, while the acidities of weak and medium acid sites increase. The total acidity of the catalysts increases slightly, whereas the acidity of weak acid sites decreases after undergoing further reduction treatment. The higher reduction temperature of 600 °C also somewhat promotes the formation of strong acid sites. The results show that the loading of metal active components and the reduction treatment significantly affected the acidic properties of the catalysts. During the impregnation and calcination processes, isomorphous substitution of the framework aluminum in the support by Ni and Mo atoms occurs, which leads to the loss of framework aluminum and the formation of new Brønsted and Lewis acid sites [30,33]. This could be responsible for the change in acidity caused by loading Ni and Mo atoms on the support. As observed in the XRD analysis (Fig. 1), the reduction treatment caused a sharp decrease in MoO2 and MoO3 crystallinity in the catalysts. Therefore, the dispersity of metal atoms and the interaction between the support and metal atoms was improved. This would thus expose more acid sites, including Brønsted acid (Al–OH, Mo–OH) and Lewis acid (Niδ+ and Moδ+) sites on the surface of the reduced catalysts [34]."
9,Hydrotreating reaction,"3.2 Hydrotreating reaction The catalytic performance of the reduced catalysts was evaluated at 380 °C under H2 at a pressure of 3 MPa for 4 h with dodecane as solvent, and the results were compared with those obtained with the Hβ-Al2O3 support and Cox. The reaction products were recovered as liquid and gas fractions (Fig.5 ). Hydrotreating SA over all the investigated catalysts yielded mainly hydrocarbon compounds and a small amount of oxygenated chemicals in the liquid product. The main hydrocarbon compounds included heptadecane (C17), octadecane (C18) and some lighter hydrocarbons (≤C16) such as pentadecane (C15) and hexadecane (C16). It is suggested that C18 results from the HDO reaction, C17 derives from the decarboxylation or decarbonylation (HDC) reaction, and the lighter hydrocarbons (≤C16) result from the hydrogenolysis reaction [1,18,35]. As Fig. 5(a) shows, the SA conversions with the Hβ-Al2O3 support and Cox are 22.9% and 64.3%, respectively. Compared to the support and Cox, the SA conversions increase significantly with the reduced catalysts, and reach a maximum value of nearly 100% at 450 °C. This indicates that the deoxygenation activities of the catalysts were significantly improved by the reduction treatment. As indicated by the H2-TPR analysis, more reducible Mo and Ni species (amorphous Ni) were formed in the reduced catalysts. This accelerated the activation of H atoms, and consequently enhanced the SA conversion. However, a temperature which is too high could cause extensive sintering of the metal active sites, and thus lead to a decrease in SA conversion. The reduced catalysts achieved a higher selectivity to C18, which was probably due to the role of Mo. Mo is the main active compound in the catalysts. Moδ+ sites have a large positive charge, and thus more easily combine with the oxygen in SA, leading to a greater catalytic activity toward HDO [22,30]. Furthermore, the better dispersity of metal active sites in the reduced catalysts enhanced the role of Mo, and thus further promoted the formation of C18 hydrocarbons. A reduction temperature of 450 °C appears to be optimal for controlling the favorable dispersity of metal active sites, Moδ+ valence states, and oxygen anion vacancies to maximize SA conversion [19,30]. It is noted that when the Hβ-Al2O3 support is used for catalytic hydrogenation of SA, low conversion and high selectivity to light hydrocarbons (≤C16) results compared to other NiMo-loaded catalysts. The absence of metal active sites in the support causes this low SA conversion. The formation of light hydrocarbons via the hydrogenolysis reaction is primarily attributed to the strong acidic properties of the support (see Table 2). In addition, among the Cox and all Cre catalysts, the selectivity to ≤C16 was similar, indicating that the chemical state (oxidation state or reduced state) of the metal active compounds has no significant effect on the hydrogenolysis reaction. The hydrogenolysis reaction which preferentially produces lighter hydrocarbons is mainly dominated by the acidity of the catalyst and the reaction temperature. The components in the liquid products were further categorized, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b). Except for the Hβ-Al2O3 support, the selectivity to alkanes and alkenes in the liquid products with the other catalysts was similar: approximately 88% and 7.5%, respectively. The similar alkane selectivity for Cox and Cre indicates that the formation of alkane hydrocarbons is strongly dependent on the number of metal active sites, rather than on its chemical state. The content of isomerized products was low with all catalysts (1.5–3.2%), which is probably related to the low acidity of the catalysts. In addition, the lack of metal active sites led to low deoxygenation and hydrogenation activity with the support, consequently producing more alkenes and oxygenated products (indicated by “others” in Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 5(c) shows the gaseous product distribution with different catalysts. Compared to the Hβ-Al2O3 support, more gaseous products, mainly CO2, ethane, propane, and butane, are formed over the reduced catalysts, particularly those reduced at temperatures in the range of 400–500 °C. This is probably because the hydrogenolysis reaction occurred simultaneously when SA was converted into hydrocarbons via the HDO and HDC reaction pathways [30,36]. T400 produced a higher gas yield than the other reduced catalysts, which was likely due to the presence of Mo5+ in T400. Mo5+ is considered to be an active site for the hydrogenolysis reaction, and its content likely decreased as the reduction temperature increased [30]. Mo5+ was not detected by XRD, possibly as a result of its high dispersion and amorphous structure. T450 achieved the highest conversion and selectivity to alkanes, and thus is the most effective catalyst for hydrogenation of SA. Thus, T450 was used for the subsequent experiments. The obtained results were also compared to those with conventional sulfided catalysts. The results are shown in Table 3 . Arora group and Ojagh group carried out hydrodeoxygenation of oleic acid over the conventional NiMoS/Al2O3 catalyst in a batch autoclave [37,38]. The two studies achieved complete conversion of oleic acid at 320–325 °C, and the hydrogenated products contained 60–67% C17 and 20–22% C18 hydrocarbons. In our previous study, stearic acid was hydrogenated over NiMo/β-zeolite-γ-Al2O3 sulfided catalysts [22]. A complete conversion of stearic acid was achieved at 350 °C, and the liquid product contained 52% C17 and 21% C18 hydrocarbons. Thus, compared to sulfided catalysts, the hydrogenation of fatty acid over the reduced catalyst, e.g., T450, used in this study produced more C18, indicating that the deoxygenation mechanism had transformed from HDC to HDO. The reduced catalysts have a Ni–Mo–O structure, which may cause catalytic behavior similar to that of Ni–Mo–S catalysts [21]. However, the reduced state of the active metals can accelerate the activation of H atoms, consequently promoting the HDO reaction."
10,Effects of H2 pressure,"3.3 Effects of H2 pressure The effect of H2 pressure on catalytic performance was investigated at 380 °C for 4 h over T450 with dodecane as solvent. The conversion as well as the liquid and gaseous product distributions are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6(a) shows that the SA conversion increases from 69.6% to 100% with an increase in H2 pressure from 1.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa. Meanwhile, the selectivity to C18 hydrocarbons increases with increasing H2 pressure, whereas the selectivity to C17 decreases. This is mainly attributed to the change in deoxygenation pathway (the HDO pathway is promoted, and HDC pathways are inhibited). Under higher H2 pressures, metal oxides are reduced by H2, more oxygen vacancies are created, and the vacancies are then filled with oxygen atoms from the feed molecules, i.e., the activation of feed molecules is enhanced. Additionally, activation of the adsorbed hydrogen is promoted on the Moδ+ sites. The adsorbed feed molecules subsequently react with the activated H from Moδ+ sites to form deoxygenated products, e.g., C18 hydrocarbons. It is noted that at 0.1 MPa, the selectivity to C17 hydrocarbons is 59.1%, which is much higher than that at 3 MPa (20.0%). This indicates that the decarboxylation reaction tends to occur at lower H2 pressures. This is in agreement with the results reported in a previous study [18], in which the highest selectivity to C17 was obtained by treating rapeseed oil over a reduced Ni-Cu/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst at 330 °C under a H2 pressure of 1.0 MPa. As shown in Fig. 6(b), when the H2 pressure increases from 1.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa, the selectivity to alkanes increases from 64.3% to 95.6%, whereas the selectivity to alkenes and oxygen-containing compounds decreases. This indicates that the high H2 pressure is helpful to finish the hydrogenation reaction of SA, and more alkenes and oxygen-containing compounds (as intermediate products) are further hydrogenated to form stable alkane hydrocarbons. In addition, a low ISO of less than 2.1% was obtained with the present reaction conditions, which is likely associated with the low acidity of T450. ISO increased slightly with increasing H2 pressure, indicating that high H2 pressure contributes to the isomerization reaction of the hydrogenated products. Fig. 6(c) shows the gaseous product distribution that results from hydrotreating SA under different H2 pressures over T450. With increasing H2 pressure, the yields of CO, CO2, C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10 increase significantly, indicating that the hydrogenolysis and HDC reactions are substantially promoted by raising the H2 pressure. In addition, more methane is formed under H2 pressures higher than 2 MPa, which is probably a result of the further reaction between CO2 and H2. The above analysis demonstrates that raising the H2 pressure helps to promote SA conversion via HDO, HDC, and hydrogenolysis reaction pathways, and particularly improves the HDO reaction."
11,Effects of solvent,"3.4 Effects of solvent Our previous study revealed that tetralin effectively exerted a hydrogen-donating activity and accelerated the catalytic hydrogenation reaction of SA at a low H2 pressure with sulfided NiMo catalysts [22]. In this study, the effects of using tetralin as a solvent on the catalytic hydrogenation of SA over the H2-reduced NiMo/Hβ-Al2O3 (T450) were investigated at 380 °C for 4 h under H2 or N2 atmospheres at 2 MPa. As a reference, dodecane was also used as a solvent, and the experiments were carried out under the same conditions as with tetralin. It was found that when tetralin was used, some aromatic compounds such as naphthalene, decahydronaphthalene and 1-ethenyl-3-ethyl-benzene, were present in products. However, when dodecane was used, these aromatic compounds were absent (Table 6). This indicates that these aromatic compounds in products mainly derive from tetralin. The other aliphatic compounds such as alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and aldehydes are the main products deriving from stearic acid. Therefore, the product selectivities in present study were calculated from peak area in the GC–MS analysis, which excluded tetralin-derived products. The comparative results are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 7 , and show that compared to dodecane, tetralin always produces lower selectivity to lighter hydrocarbons (≤C16) and a lower gas yield under the same gas atmosphere. This indicates that using tetralin as a solvent can effectively inhibit the cracking (hydrogenolysis) reaction of SA. When the same solvent is used, the H2 atmosphere produces lower selectivity to ≤C16 than N2, suggesting that the H2 atmosphere significantly contributes to restraining the cracking (hydrogenolysis) reaction of SA. Additionally, both dodecane and tetralin achieve higher C18 selectivity in H2 than in N2, indicating that the presence of H2 helps promote the HDO reaction. Tetralin yields a higher selectivity to C18 in H2 (62.9%), and a higher selectivity to C17 in N2 (68.1%), indicating that tetralin plays an important role in accelerating the HDO reaction in the presence of H2, and in promoting the HDC reaction in the absence of H2.These results demonstrate that the reaction atmosphere and solvent significantly affect the deoxygenation reaction pathway of SA. Compared to dodecane, tetralin could produce a stronger adsorption to stearic acid through dipolar interaction, which might inhibit the adsorption of stearic acid to the surface of catalyst. The equilibrium state between tetralin-released H and molecular H2 would restrain dissolving H2 in tetralin. These factors might be responsible for the lower SA conversion in tetralin than in dodecane. Table 5 lists the content of tetralin-derived compounds in liquid product from different gas atmospheres. The contents were estimated from the peak areas in the GC–MS analysis, which excluded stearic acid-derived products. Naphthalene and decahydronaphthalene are present in the liquid products formed under the two reaction atmospheres. Naphthalene is produced by releasing active hydrogen from tetralin, while decahydronaphthalene is formed by absorbing active hydrogen with tetralin. Tetralin can also be decomposed to 1-ethenyl-3-ethyl-benzene [22,41]. The composition indicates that the H-donating and H-absorbing actions of tetralin occur simultaneously in the two atmospheres. More naphthalene is formed in the H2 atmosphere, indicating that tetralin has a better H-donating capacity in the H2 atmosphere."
12,Reaction pathway,"3.5 Reaction pathway Table 6 lists the composition of liquid products yielded from the catalytic hydrogenation of SA over T450 at 380 °C under H2 at 3 MPa for different reaction times. The results reveal that the products mainly contain saturated C18 and C17 hydrocarbons with a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons, lighter hydrocarbons, and fatty alcohols. As the reaction time increases, the selectivity to alkenes and alcohols first increases and then decreases, indicating that these are intermediate products. Combined with the results of previous research, the reaction path for SA is concluded, as shown in Fig. 8 . As a whole, SA undergoes HDO, HDC, and hydrogenolysis reaction mechanisms. The HDO reaction yields C18-aldehydes, C18-alcohols and, ultimately, C18-alkanes. The decarbonylation reaction yields C17-alkenes, which can be further hydrogenated to form C17-alkanes, while the decarboxylation reaction yields C17-alkanes directly. The intermediate product, octadecanal, from the HDO reaction can be converted to C17-alkenes via the decarbonylation reaction. In addition, normal hydrocarbons undergo further isomerization [13,30,33]. The presence of CO2 and CO in the gaseous products confirms the occurrence of these reactions. The hydrogenolysis reaction leads to the formation of C9–C16 liquid compounds and micromolecule organic gas products. Some heavier compounds such as eicosane and docosane are produced as a result of the oligomerization of intermediates."
13,Conclusions,"The catalytic hydrogenation of SA was conducted on H2-reduced NiMo/Hβ-Al2O3 catalysts. The catalytic activities were compared with those obtained with the Hβ-Al2O3 composite support and the oxidized NiMo catalyst. In the tested reduction temperature range (400–600 °C), T450 achieved the highest conversion (close to 100%), which was much higher than the results obtained over the composite support (22.9%) and Cox (64.3%). XRD and H2-TPR analysis indicated that reduction treatment contributed to production of more reducible metal species and improvement of the dispersity of metal active sites, consequently leading to high hydrodeoxygenation activity. Furthermore, the effects of H2 pressure and hydrogen-donor (tetralin) on the catalytic hydrogenation activity of reduced catalyst were investigated. Higher H2 pressure promoted SA conversion and the formation of C18 hydrocarbons. Tetralin played an important role to accelerate HDO reaction in the presence of H2, and to promote HDC reaction and suppress hydrogenolysis reaction in the absence of H2. Three reaction routes for SA conversion such as HDO, HDC and hydrogenolysis were discussed, largely based the experimental data."
