0,Introduction,"The semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to the corresponding enols is an important step in the industrial production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances, and flavors [1,2]. As their name suggests, enols contain C=C and C–OH units and are widely used as nucleophiles in couplings with carbonyl electrophiles to form C–C bonds. For example, cis-2-butene-1,4-diol (cis-BED) is an intermediate in the syntheses of endosulfan, vitamin A, and vitamin B6 and is also used as a monomer to generate poly(2-butenediol), an unsaturated telechelic polyether diol [3–5]. The synthesis of vitamin E involves enols such as 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE), linalool, and isophytol [6], while cis-3-hexen-1-ol, an important intermediate with a strong grass flavor, is widely used in the production of daily chemicals and edible flavors [7]. Generally, these enols are produced by the selective hydrogenation of alkynols over metal-based catalysts under mild conditions. Table 1 lists the typical pathways of alkynol (including 3-hexyn-1-ol, 3-phenyl-2- propyn-1-ol, 2-butyne-1,4-diol (BYD), 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (MBY), 1,1-diphenyl-2-propyn-1-ol, and dehydroisophytol (DIP)) hydrogenation to enols. In this transformation, control over the hydrogenation degree and the prevention of C≡C bonds over-hydrogenation to C–C bonds are of key importance for achieving high enol yields. Generally, factors determining the selectivity of C≡C bonds semi-hydrogenation over heterogeneous catalysts can be divided into thermodynamic and mechanistic ones (Scheme 1) [1,8,9]. When the hydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyne is favored over that of the adsorbed alkene (K 2 » K 4), mechanistic selectivity is dominant. On the other hand, thermodynamic selectivity refers to the ability of a metal to preferentially adsorb the alkyne in the presence of the alkene (k 1/k −1 » k 3/k −3) and thus disfavor the over-hydrogenation of the former to the corresponding alkane. However, for the hydrogenation of alkynes over metal catalysts, K 4 is usually higher than K 2, and selectivity for alkenes is mainly attributed to thermodynamic factors. The use of surface engineering to design catalysts favoring the adsorption of alkynes over that of alkenes allows for highly selective alkyne-to-alkene hydrogenation. In addition to ensuring the selective semi-hydrogenation of C≡C bonds in alkynols, one should also suppress their hydrogenolysis or hydrodeoxygenation to prevent the cleavage of C–OH bonds. Therefore, the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is a crucial step toward the highly selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols under mild conditions. The last decades have witnessed a surge of interest in the design of highly active and selective catalysts for alkynol hydrogenation. Typically, the Lindlar catalyst (Pd-Pb/CaCO3) was investigated for this reaction and was shown to be highly efficient because of the modification of Pd properties via Pb doping [10–12]. Unfortunately, to obtain high-purity products for fine chemical and pharmaceutical production, the catalyst poison needs to be completely removed. Recently, several kinds of active metal (including Pd-, Pt-, and Ni-based) catalysts have been developed. However, in view of their intrinsic hydrogenation properties, these catalysts present relatively low enol selectivities. To increase this selectivity, researchers have designed bimetallic catalysts (alloys or intermetallics), in which a second metal (e.g., Bi, Zn, or In) with a higher electron density is used to modify the electronic properties of the primary active metal [13–15]. Supports such as metal oxides, carbon materials, porous polymers, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) also play an important role in the selective hydrogenation of alkynols, as the specific reaction environments created by the confinement and modification effects of the metal-support interfaces inhibit over-hydrogenation and prevent the leaching of metal nanoparticles (NPs) [16–20]. .In addition, the selective hydrogenation of alkynols is usually carried out in hydrothermal environments and therefore requires highly water-resistant catalysts. Thus, another important research direction for alkynol semi-hydrogenation is the stabilization of the corresponding catalysts [21]. The development of fine chemicals toward up-market, differentiation, and high-added-value has resulted in an increasing number of publications related to the selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols. Although several reviews on the use of nanocatalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes refer to the concept of selective alkynol hydrogenation, this subject has not been specifically reviewed in the recent decades [9,22]. Herein, we focus on the design of highly selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of typical alkynols (Table 1). The hydrogenation reactions are catalogued based on the metal-based catalyst, its intrinsic metal active sites, promoter (second metal, organic ligand, and stabilizer), and the nature of the support. A combination of catalytic reaction kinetics with theoretical calculations is used to elucidate the decisive factors for achieving selective alkynol hydrogenation. Additionally, ways of developing new catalysts for this transformation and improving their stability are discussed, and a method of designing highly efficient and selective catalysts based on the characteristics of aqueous-phase alkynol hydrogenation is proposed."
1,Selective hydrogenation of alkynols over noble metal catalysts,"A number of noble metal (e.g., Pd, Pt, and Au) catalysts with high activities for selective alkynol hydrogenation have been designed to date. To favor enol formation, one can generally tune the geometric/electronic structure, chemical state, and noble metal and support morphology and thus control the adsorption, activation, and desorption behaviors of reactants and intermediates to promote the selective hydrogenation of C≡C bonds to C=C bonds and inhibit the cleavage of alkynol C–OH bonds. The outstanding and interesting results recently obtained for such noble metal catalysts are discussed in the following sections."
2,Pd-based catalysts,"2.1 Pd-based catalysts As the d-band width of a metal directly affects its capacity to adsorb unsaturated chemical bonds (according to semi-empirical methods), Pd-based catalysts with an optimal d-band width are highly efficient for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols and are highly valued in both academia and industry [23]. The modification and isolation of active sites through selective poisoning is an effective strategy of enhancing the selectivity of Pd-based catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols [24,25]. Rode et al. [11] reviewed the design of catalysts systems (including colloidal and supported Pd NPs) for BYD hydrogenation. Herein, we mainly describe the effects of surfactants, additives, and supports of monometallic Pd catalysts as well as the influence of the synergistic effects of Pd-based bimetallic catalysts (alloys and intermetallics) on the selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols, with the typical results of such hydrogenation summarized in Table 2 . 2.1.1 Monometallic Pd catalysts In 1950, Lindlar, a chemist at Roche, invented a classical heterogeneous catalyst that comprises 5 wt% Pd on porous CaCO3 treated with various forms of Pb and quinoline [12] and has been widely applied in the selective hydrogenation of various alkynes to cis-alkenes. In this catalytic system, metallic Pd as the active component is modified and separated via the addition of additives and the introduction of a second metal to maximize selectivity for alkyne semi-hydrogenation. Both classical and modified Lindlar catalysts have been developed for the catalytic hydrogenation of alkynols. Rode et al. systematically investigated the role of ammonia in enhancing the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BED [26], achieving an almost 100% selectivity for the 1% Pd/CaCO3-NH3 system, which was attributed to the competitive adsorption of ammonia on the Pd surface along with the substrates. As in the case of organic additives, the introduction of Pb into the catalytic system to block or isolate Pd surface sites is another strategy of enhancing the selectivity for enols in alkynol semi-hydrogenation. Wang et al. [15] probed the performance of a commercial Lindlar catalyst (PdPb/CaCO3) for the hydrogenation of pure MBY, achieving a highly efficient hydrogenation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 8034 h−1, although a sharp selectivity decrease was observed at the late conversion stage (~93% at 99% conversion). Despite the fact that industrial Lindlar catalysts can achieve highly selective alkynol hydrogenation, the introduction of Pb and additives leads to a severe activity decrease and environmental pollution. Given the importance of enols for the production of fine chemicals such as vitamins and drugs, which should possess high purity, the design of Pb-free catalysts to overcome the selectivity-activity paradox remains a great challenge. Particle size, exposed crystal face, and dispersed state are the major factors affecting the selective alkynol hydrogenation over monometallic Pd-based catalysts. The selectivity for enols can be enhanced via the introduction of surfactants (poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), sulfobetaine (SB12), and hexadecyl(2-hy- droxyethyl)dimethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (HHDMA)) as stabilizers during the preparation of Pd colloid catalysts [10,12,27–33]. Independent of the support, these monometallic precursors can be optimized by variation of particle size, composition, and structure. Furthermore, the active Pd metal surface may be shielded against poisons by a protective shell, and dopants may be used to enhance catalytic performance. Kiwi-Minsker et al. [27] synthesized uniform Pd nanocrystals with cubic, octahedral, and cuboctahedral shapes via a colloidal technique using PVP as a stabilizer and tested their catalytic performance for MBY hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 1 , two types of active sites (those on planes and at edges) were involved in catalysis, with reactivity depending on the coordination number of Pd atoms. At-edge atoms were four times less active in semi-hydrogenation than in-plane atoms, while selectivity was related to the fraction of edge sites. Kinetic simulations pointed toward 3–5-nm cubic nanocrystals as the optimal catalyst for achieving the highest MBE yield. In addition, the effect of Pd NP size on the catalytic response was ascribed to the contributions of Pd electronic surface modification, fraction of Pdplane active sites, and steric effects [28]. Previously, we also found that the performance of Pd NPs for the selective hydrogenation of BYD is mainly determined by their size and shape, showing that hydrogenation on Pd{111} is faster than that on Pd{100}. All Pd nanocrystals stabilized by PVP showed higher selectivity for BED, which could reach 96% (Table 2) [29]. Rode et al. [10] reported that the hydrogenation of BYD over a PVP-stabilized Pd/C catalyst was 10-fold faster than that over a conventional Pd catalyst. The presence of PVP resulted in the uniform dispersion of 3–5-nm Pd NPs on the carbon support and inhibited inactivation by substrate-derived poisons to enhance long-term-stability. In addition, the steric effect of stabilizers plays an important role in determining the selectivity for target product formation over Pd-based colloid catalysts. In the semi-hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol over Pb(SBn)/CaCO3, the selectivity for leaf alcohol formation increased with the increasing length of the sulfobetaine alkyl chain [30], being maximal (~95%) for C10- and C12-substituted sulfobetaines. Together with collaborators, chemists at BASF have developed and commercialized a novel supported ligand-modified Pd-based catalyst (NanoSelectTM) in which HHDMA is used as an additive with stabilizing and reducing functionalities, helping to isolate the active site and tune the catalyst energy landscape [12,31–33]. The intrinsic selectivity of these catalysts has been demonstrated for the hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol and MBY, respectively. The results suggest that these catalysts can replace the classical Lindlar catalyst and thus offer a significant environmental benefit. Therefore, the design of surfactant-stabilized Pd-based nanocatalysts as a new type of heterogeneous catalysts may be a promising strategy for the synthesis of fine chemicals. In addition to the use of Pd colloids, the modification of Pd monometallic catalysts through the tuning of special preparation methods and support (e.g., carbon material, oxide, MOF, and polymer) features is another strategy to achieve the highly selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols. Generally, supported monometallic Pd-based catalysts exhibit a special hydrogen storage performance during non-high-temperature liquid-phase hydrogenation. For instance, fully selective hydrogenation of BYD to cis-BED at low conversions could be realized over Pd/C [10], although further hydrogenation led to a wide variety of products such as 2- isopropoxytetrahydrofuran and butane, neither of which had previously been associated with this reaction system. To enhance hydrogenation selectivity, researchers have developed structured Pd catalysts suitable for three-phase reactions using active carbon fibers (ACF) as supports. The special physicochemical properties of ACF such as high specific surface area, high plasticity, and excellent liquid fluidity allowed the active component (Pd) to be evenly dispersed on the support (dispersion degree = 43%) and thus resulted in a 97% selectivity for BED at conversions of up to 80% during the liquid-phase hydrogenation of BYD [34]. In multiple reuse experiments performed in a batch reactor, Pd/ACF presented high stability. Lee et al. [37] exploited the Mott-Schottky effect to design a Pd-nanocube@N-doped carbon catalyst that presented higher reactivity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of 3-phenyl-2-propyn-1-ol to (Z)-cinnamyl alcohol than surface-modified catalysts. This high selectivity was attributed to the high concentration of holes doped in Pd nanocubes, which weakened the interaction of enols on Pd sites and prevented further hydrogenation. Pd NPs supported by oxides with hierarchical porosities and special functional groups have also been widely applied in the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols [38–50]. The formation of interfaces between Pd NPs and oxide supports and the introduction of organic groups allow one to tune the adsorption of substrates and intermediates on the catalyst surface and thus realize chemoselective hydrogenation. Nakanishi et al. [39] took full advantage of the Si–H bonds of hierarchically porous silica to anchor polymethylhydrosiloxane and reduce Pd ions. The thus prepared Pd@GPMHS40 catalyst maintained a 90% selectivity for leaf alcohol at a 50% conversion of 3-hexyn-1-ol (Fig. 2 ). The grafted polymer improved reactant diffusion by suppressing the adverse effects of silanol groups. Besides, the presence of Pd plane surfaces greatly promoted cis-enol formation/desorption to achieve high chemoselectivity. Pd@MonoSil-ArSO3, prepared by the post-grafting of sulfonic groups and the in situ growth of Pd NPs, presented remarkable conversion, selectivity, and resistance in a continuous-flow catalytic partial hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol under very mild conditions, providing a good compromise between product purity and productivity and helping to avoid the use of additives to achieve satisfactory selectivity [40]. Recently, we have found that a Schiff base-modified Pd catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of BYD to BED (Fig. 3 ) [41], achieving a 95.2% BYD conversion and an almost quantitative BED selectivity under mild conditions (50 °C, 2 MPa H2, 4 h, no additives). This good performance was attributed to the strong metal-support interaction derived from the coordination of nitrogen sites (Schiff base) to Pd NPs. In addition, the Pb-free, porous metal oxide-stabilized Pd NP catalysts (Pd/Al2O3, Pd/Mg(Al)O derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs), Pd@bimodal porous titania, and a Pd/Fe-Co-Ni LDH composite (Fig. 4 )) have also been developed for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols. In these catalysts, Pd NPs strongly interact with the support and undergo a deep electronic structure modification, which decreases the heat of enol adsorption on active sites and thus significantly improves the selectivity for enols [42–49]. Reducible metal oxides (Cu2O, ZnO, and In2O3) have also been used as supports to disperse Pd NPs for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols. In this case, the support was partially reduced, and the combination of the thus formed metal with Pd to form alloys or intermetallics [15,36,50,51] altered the geometric and electronic structures of Pd and tuned the selective hydrogenation properties. Detailed information on this topic is provided in the part dealing with Pd-based bimetallic catalysts. The steric hindrance effect allows one to regulate the distribution of the products of stereoselective alkynol hydrogenation by tuning the pore structure of oxide supports. Galarneau et al. [40] reported that Pd NPs supported on a pore-flow-through silica (Pd-MonoSil) could be implemented as a microreactor for the selective hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol, achieving a conversion of 85% and moderate selectivity for cis-3-hexen-1-ol during 7-h stability testing. The substrate conversion and selectivity for the target product could be readily controlled by independent adjustment of hydrogen and substrate flow rates. A similar phenomenon was observed for a Pd@bimodal porous titania monolith catalyst [47]. The flexibility of this monolithic microreactor opens a new perspective for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols in the continuous-flow mode. In addition to inorganic oxide–supported Pd NPs, polymer-supported ones have also been evaluated as alkynol hydrogenation catalysts [53–56] and achieved high selectivity, which was ascribed to the polymer-induced modification of the geometric/electronic properties of Pd centers and the steric hindrance effects of the polymer network. Resins functionalized with amino groups (FCN) or carboxylic groups (OFP) were found to be promising supports for Pd-based BYD-to-BED hydrogenation catalysts [53,54]. Barbaro et al. [56] developed an unconventional polymeric borate macroporous monolith-supported Pd NP (Pd@MonoBor) catalyst (Fig. 5 ) well suited for the selective hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol to leaf alcohol (selectivity of 94.5% at a conversion of 99.5%) at 1.5 bar of H2 and room temperature. This high performance was attributed to the strategic combination of non-coordinating and chemically inert borate functional groups in the polymer. In the absence of toxic contaminants, this catalyst could be applied in green industrial production processes. MOFs are a new class of porous coordination polymers constructed by the coordination of metal ions/clusters with organic bridging ligands and can be used as supports to modify and functionalize metallic particles by conventional chemistry strategies and thus enhance their capability for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols [57–59]. A Pd/MOF-5 catalyst achieved 95% selectivity for cis-BED at a BYD conversion of 95% [57]. The network organic ligand nature, the host–guest properties enabling a donor–acceptor interaction with the substrate, and the Pd dispersion remarkably enhanced the performance for selective hydrogenation. In our previous work, Pd@MIL-101(Cr) was demonstrated to be an efficient BYD hydrogenation catalyst with excellent activity, stability, and selectivity (>94% BED) [58]. In addition, highly dispersed Pd NPs supported by ZIF-8 were prepared by exploiting the strong adsorption of PVP on ZIF-8. As shown in Fig. 6 , because of the edge site blocking by ZIF-8 and the assistance of the N-containing organic ligand in ZIF-8, the monometallic PVP-Pd@ZIF-8 catalyst showed a high selectivity for cis-BED formation during BYD hydrogenation (97.5% selectivity at 99.7% conversion) [59]. These satisfactory results demonstrate a good way of tuning the selectivity for target product formation via the use of the coordination effect. However, the enhancement of the hydrothermal stability of MOF-supported catalysts during their application in aqueous systems remains challenging. 2.1.2 Pd-based bimetallic catalysts Alloys or intermetallics containing elemental Ag, Cu, Zn, Bi, In, Pb, etc. and other transition metals usually exhibit catalytic properties and long-term stability superior to those of their monometallic counterparts. Pd-based bimetallic systems have been systematically investigated as catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols [14,15,30,38,60–71]. The introduction of a second metal allows one to significantly tune the geometric and electronic structure of metallic Pd and thus increase the selectivity for enols and initial stability. Above, we introduced the classical Lindlar catalyst (PdPb/CaCO3) in which Pb as a second metal blocks or isolates the surface sites of Pd to increase the selectivity for enol formation during the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols [15,26]. To design Pb-free Pd bimetallic catalysts, Kiwi-Minsker et al. [60] investigated the effect of Ag and Cu on the selectivity of a Pd-based catalyst in DIP hydrogenation. The dilution of surface Pd sites by Ag (Cu) and the modification of Pd electronic properties resulted in a significant increase in isophytol selectivity (97% at 99% conversion). However, a conversion of only 28% with an enol selectivity of 98% was observed for the hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-2-propyn-1-ol over PdCu/CNTs (3 bar, 3 h). A pressure increase to 6 bar allowed for a quantitative alkynol conversion at the expense of decreasing enol selectivity to 77% [61]. Ibhadon et al. [63] prepared a bimetallic PdBi/SiO2 catalyst by poisoning a Pd-based catalyst with Bi followed by reduction at high temperature and probed the effect of Bi addition on the performance for selective MBY hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 7 , particle sintering and the formation of intermetallics reduced the catalytic activity. However, the selectivity for MBE significantly increased because of the reduction of enol adsorption energy, which agreed with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Subsequently, a capillary reactor wall-coated with a Pd-Bi/TiO2 catalyst was developed, achieving an efficient solvent-free semi-hydrogenation of MBY (MBE yield = 90% at 70 °C and a liquid flow rate of 40 μL min−1) [64]. Kiwi-Minsker et al. [65] investigated the effect of K and Na doping on the performance of Pd NPs stabilized within hyper-cross-linked polystyrene catalysts for selective MBY hydrogenation (Fig. 8 ). The interactions of alkali metal ions with the surface of Pd NPs resulted in the isolation of Pd sites and thus increased both the activity (~ 1.7-fold) and selectivity for MBE formation (up to ~99.5%). In the previous section, we reviewed metal oxide–supported Pd NPs as selective alkynol hydrogenation catalysts in which Pd-based bimetallic active sites could be designed under an H2 atmosphere based on the concept of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI). As shown in Fig. 9 , Pd/ZnO catalysts with different β-PdZn alloy contents were synthesized via the deposition of ex situ generated Pd colloids followed by thermal treatment in H2 at various temperatures and then used for the continuous gas-phase hydrogenation of MBY [50]. The formation of a β-PdZn alloy significantly increased the selectivity for MBE (90% at 30% conversion), whereas the catalytic activity strongly depended on the PdZn/Pd δ− molar ratio of the modified surface. At a similar PdZn alloy content, Pd-Zn/Al2O3 presented a two-fold increase in the rate of MBY consumption vs. the Pd/ZnO catalyst when high enol selectivity was maintained, which was attributed to hydrogen spillover [66]. The beneficial effect of the PdZn alloy phase promoted the continuous production of commercially important enols. Wang et al. found that the introduction of biomass-derived hydrophilic nitrogen-doped carbon into ZnO promoted catalyst dispersion in aqueous media to ensure better mass transfer [67]. Compared with the intermetallic PdZn/ZnO catalyst, PdZn/CN@ZnO displayed an almost six-fold higher TOF while retaining high selectivity for the semi-hydrogenation of MBY in an aqueous solution. The selectivity increase upon the transformation of Pd particles to the PdZn intermetallic was ascribed to the concomitant decrease in the amount of corner and edge Pd atoms. Moreover, the ability of the isolation effect and electronic structure modification of PdZn alloy/intermetallic compounds to invoke the selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols was also found for PdZn/TiO2 and Pd/ZnO/SMF catalysts [14,68,69]. The introduction of stable supports improved the dispersion of active Pd-based bimetallic NPs, thus increasing activity and stability and helping to preserve the selectivity for target enols. Wang et al. [15] reported that a Pd-In/In2O3 catalyst designed based on the SMSI concept achieved high activity and good enol selectivity during the semi-hydrogenation of MBY in ethanol. As shown in Fig. 10 , the reaction on Pd-In/In2O3-250 was 5.5 times faster than that on the Lindlar catalyst. The selectivity for MBE was well maintained throughout the process. The SMSI allowed the metallic Pd active sites (edge and corner atoms) to be selectively poisoned and thus enabled the significant inhibition of over-hydrogenation. Recently, Pd3In/TiO2 and Pd3Sn/TiO2 nanocatalysts have been confirmed to exhibit enhanced performance for the liquid-phase semi- hydrogenation of MBY [70,71]. Therefore, considering the advantages of intermetallics (isolation effect, electronic effect, steric effect, and stability), the design of effective supported Pd-based intermetallic NPs to achieve the highly efficient semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols is a task of high significance."
3,Pt-based catalysts,"2.2 Pt-based catalysts Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for selective hydrogenation, including the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. However, reports on the application of these catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols are less abundant than for Pd-based catalysts, which is attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of metallic Pt. According to the influence of d-band width on the capacity of a given metal to adsorb unsaturated chemical bonds, metallic Pt is a weaker adsorbent than metallic Pd, which may influence selective hydrogenation properties. Table 3 summaries the activities of selected Pt-based catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of BYD, showing that as in the case of Pd-based catalysts, the nature of the support also strongly influences the selectivity, stability, and activity of Pt-based catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of BYD to BED. Rode et al. [72] systematically investigated the catalytic properties of CaCO3-supported Pt NPs [72] for the hydrogenation of BYD in batch and fixed-bed reactors, showing that a mixture of BED and BDO was obtained in both cases. However, in the presence of ammonia, BED was almost exclusively obtained in the batch reactor, which was ascribed to the fact that the introduction of ammonia may tune the adsorption of carbine and carbine-type intermediates to increase BED selectivity [72]. Subsequently, the authors investigated the influence of alkali metal doping on the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts for BYD hydrogenation [73], revealing that BED selectivity was highest (>99%) for the Cs-doped catalyst. Thus, the increase in the basicity of alkali-doped catalysts was held responsible for the concomitant increase in Pt electron density, desorption rate, and BED selectivity. This phenomenon was similar to that observed for alkali metal-doped Pd-based catalysts [65]. In addition, a Cu-doped Pt-based catalyst (Pt-Cu/Cu x Fe y O@C) also presented good performance [74], achieving a quantitative BYD conversion and a BED selectivity of 96.1% at an active center Pt to substrate mass ratio of 1:2000. Previously, we used one-step encapsulation to prepare a Pd@ZIF-8 catalyst that exhibited good activity and excellent selectivity for BYD hydrogenation, thus avoiding the addition of other active agents and stabilizers and outperforming Pt/SBA-15 and Pt nano-sol catalysts [75]. As shown in Fig. 11 , the Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst featured BED selectivities of up to 94% at conversions of up to 100% in the hydrogenation of BYD in an aqueous solution. ZIF-8, which comprises Zn2+ and N-containing organic ligands, enabled the active component (Pt NPs) to be evenly dispersed on the support. Therefore, the good catalytic performance was mainly attributed to the modification of the ZIF-8 support by Pt NPs. Recently, researchers have used bovine bone as a natural, renewable, and abundant support for Pt NPs, achieving a high catalytic performance with ~100% conversion and 83% BED selectivity. Drelinkiewicz et al. [78] used polymers (polyaniline and poly(4-vinylpyridine)) as promising supports for the stabilization of highly dispersed Pt NPs to provide more active sites for BYD hydrogenation. Further insights into the active sites of Pt-based catalysts for BYD hydrogenation were provided by HRTEM and XAFS characterizations of a Pt/SiC catalyst. As shown in Fig. 12 , Pt x O y clusters in as-calcined Pt/SiC were in situ converted to reduced Pt0 species during hydrogenation [76]. Metallic Pt NPs (diameter = 2–3 nm) supported on SiC were the active sites for BED formation through the selective hydrogenation of BYD."
4,Other noble metal catalysts,"2.3 Other noble metal catalysts Au- and Rh-based materials were investigated as catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols, and the activity and target products were found to be different from those observed for Pd- and Pt-based catalysts. Cárdenas-Lizana et al. [50] prepared a Au/Al2O3 catalyst by adding HAuCl4 to Al2O3 and compared its catalytic performance for MBY hydrogenation to those of Pd/ZnO, Lindlar, and Pd/CuO catalysts, revealing that the activity of the Au catalyst was correlated with its particle size. Although Au/Al2O3 could maintain enol selectivity, it was less active than Pd-based catalysts, and its activity could be increased via the introduction of other active metals. Párvulescu et al. [81] investigated the catalytic performance of Pd NPs, Au NPs, and PdAu alloy colloids embedded into a silica support for the semi-hydrogenation of 3-hexyn-1-ol, showing that the PdAu alloy colloid was the most effective catalyst, featuring a 3-hexen-1-ol selectivity of 100%. This result illustrated the effective role of alloying, while the addition of Pd enhanced the regional selectivity of the embedded Au/SiO2 colloids. Based on the design model of selective semi-hydrogenation catalysts for surface lattice engineering, Xiong and co-workers [62] grew an ultrathin atomic layer of AuPd on Au nanocrystals to afford a Au@AuPd nanocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 13 , this catalyst was applied to MBY hydrogenation, achieving an MBE selectivity of 98.9% at a conversion of 98.2%. As the active center of hydrogenation, Pd atoms easily bind hydrogen to afford Pd-H moieties, which makes it difficult to complete the semi-hydrogenation of MBY. However, in the structure of the Au@AuPd catalyst, Pd NPs were evenly distributed on the surface of Au and combined with it to form PdAu alloys. Control over Pd active sites allowed hydrogen coverage on the surface, metal H-binding capacity, and substrate adsorption to be balanced and thus helped to significantly improve catalyst activity and selectivity for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols. Therefore, the authors concluded that optimal nanocatalysts with high activity and semi-hydrogenation selectivity can be obtained by manipulation of metal-alkynol interactions. In addition to Au-based catalysts, some researchers also investigated Rh-, Ru-, and Ir-based catalysts for selective alkynol hydrogenation. However, Musolino et al. [82] reported that Rh/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 significantly promote the over- hydrogenation and geometric isomerization of C=C bonds, which is not conducive to the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BED. Thus, ways of increasing the activity of noble metal catalysts and preventing the isomerization of C=C bonds (there are cis- and trans- isomers in enols) and the side reactions involving other functional groups (C−OH) during alkynol hydrogenation are still highly sought after. Overall, various noble metal catalysts (especially Pd- and Pt-based ones) have been developed for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols, and some showed excellent performance with good recyclability and stability. However, the cost of noble metal catalysts limits their industrial applications. In addition, the low hydrothermal stability of noble metal catalysts is another challenge, as the selective hydrogenation of alkynols is commonly performed is an aqueous phase."
5,Selective hydrogenation of alkynols over non-noble metal catalysts,
6,Ni-based catalysts,"3.1 Ni-based catalysts As typical non-noble metal catalysts, Ni-based ones have attracted much attention due to their low cost and moderate activity. Table 4 summarizes the Ni-based catalysts used for the selective hydrogenation of BYD. The presented data show that for Raney Ni and monometallic Ni-based catalysts, the main product is BDO (total hydrogenation product), while the introduction of a second metal (Cu or Si) can strongly affect the product distribution and increase the selectivity for BED. Raney Ni, invented by Murray Raney in the 1920s, has a spongy porous skeleton and is therefore more active than bulk Ni, finding numerous applications in hydrogenation reactions. Tanielyan and co-workers [83,84] systematically researched the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BDO over Raney Ni in batch reactor, CSTR, and fixed-bed reactors, revealing that hydrogenation under batch conditions comprised four stages. As shown in Fig. 14 , BYD hydrogenation took place through a complex set of parallel and consecutive reactions generating key intermediates in each of the four stages. The main product formed initially (cis-BED) subsequently took part in three parallel reactions, namely hydrogenation to BDO, isomerization to trans-BED, and the formation of γ-HALD. Finally, trans-BED was mostly engaged in further hydrogenation to BDO, and surprisingly, in the formation of n-butanol (BOL) as the main byproduct. The accumulated γ-HALD was slowly hydrogenated to BDO. Similar results were obtained by Pyatnitsyna et al. [85,86]. When the same reaction was carried out in a CSTR reactor, the only detected products were BAD and BOL [83], whereas in a fixed-bed reactor, the selectivity for BAD strongly depended on the reaction conditions such as temperature, contact time, and liquid feed pH [84]. To achieve a highly selective hydrogenation of BYD to BED, a Raney Ni-Si catalyst was prepared by treating Raney Ni with silane based on the concept of metal silicide usage in catalysis [87]. As shown in Fig. 15 , the conversion of BYD over Raney Ni-Si was lower than that over Raney Ni, while BED selectivity significantly increased with increasing contact time. Typically, BED selectivity reached 80.4% at 84.8% conversion over Raney 350-NiSi x at 90 °C, 3 MPa H2, and a contact time of 11.6 gcat h mol−1 [88]. This behavior was ascribed to the reduction of BYD adsorption intensity on the catalyst surface due to Si doping and the inhibition of BED over-hydrogenation due to the formation of nickel silicides on the surface of Raney Ni. Such inexpensive Raney Ni-Si materials are promising alternatives to traditional Lindlar-type catalysts. Furthermore, the above work provides a general strategy of metal-based catalyst modification by Si doping for boosting semi-hydrogenation performance. In addition to Raney Ni-based catalysts, researchers have also investigated supported mono- and bimetallic Ni NPs catalysts. Luna and co-workers systematically studied the selective hydrogenation of BYD over Ni catalysts supported on thirteen different materials, revealing that catalytic performance was greatly affected by the textural and/or acid-base properties of the support. AlPO4 was found to be an adequate support component for Ni NPs to obtain appropriate activity and selectivity for the semi-hydrogenation of BYD [89]. As shown in Table 4, a 92.5% BED selectivity was achieved over Ni/AlPO4-P, with the initial rates of triple and double bond hydrogenation equaling 10.30 and 40.29 μmol s−1 g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the introduction Cu as a second metal to form a NiCu alloy significantly increased BED selectivity (97.9%). Ma and co-workers observed the same synergistic effect for the introduction of Fe into a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, showing that this doping enhanced the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BED because of the varied metal-support interactions, active site dispersion, and the formation of NiFe2O4 [90]. The yield of cis-BED as an intermediate decreased in the order of Ni-3Fe/Al2O3 (92.0%) > Ni-7Fe/Al2O3 (83.8%) > Ni-1Fe/Al2O3 (83.1%) > Ni-5Fe/Al2O3 (81.3%) > Ni-9Fe/Al2O3 (65.7%) > Ni/Al2O3 (51.2%). Fig. 16 shows the results of stability testing for Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-3Fe/Al2O3 catalysts, demonstrating that after seven cycles, Ni-3Fe/Al2O3 still exhibited high selectivity and conversion that were much higher than those of Ni/Al2O3. However, the stability of Ni-3Fe/Al2O3 left much room for improvement. Remarkably different from AlPO4-supported Ni catalysts, Al2O3- and Al2O3-SiO2-supported Ni catalysts featured a significantly different product distribution in the selective hydrogenation of BYD [91]. The introduction of SiO2 into Ni/Al2O3 promoted the over-hydrogenation of BYD to BDO, achieving a BDO selectivity of 75.2% and a BED selectivity of 19.5%. Zhao et al. [92] developed a phyllosilicate-derived bimetallic NiCu@SiO2 catalyst with a three-center-synergy effect. As shown in Fig. 17 , the special phyllosilicate structure could remarkably enhance the active metal dispersion and reliably confine the Ni NPs on the interface to increase hydrogenation activity and structural stability. However, the main product of direct 3-h BYD hydrogenation over the optimal 9Ni1Cu@SiO2 catalyst in batch mode was BDO (yield > 90.5%). The formation of Ni-Cu alloys as non-selective active sites possibly boosted the adsorption ability/activity of C≡C and C=C bonds, resulting in over-hydrogenation. In addition, the acidic sites of Ni phyllosilicates may withdraw electron density from the terminal C–OH group of the adsorbed BED intermediate and thus significantly favor BDO formation. In addition to the activity of Ni-based catalysts and their selectivity for target products in the selective hydrogenation of BYD, the stability of these catalysts also needs improvement. Zhao et al. [21] investigated the deactivation of a Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst in the hydrogenation of crude BYD, revealing that the catalyst showed a slow activity decay during 2140-h operation. Analysis of spent catalyst structure revealed that deposits of carbonaceous species covered the active Ni and blocked the catalyst mesopores, which led to deactivation. The catalyst could be regenerated by direct reduction with H2 or by combined oxidation-reduction. However, as the high temperatures used for these treatments promoted the aggregation of Ni NPs, the catalytic activity was not fully recovered. Therefore, the design of highly efficient and stable Ni-based catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols under milder conditions remains challenging."
7,New catalytic materials,"The recent advances in catalyst design and development resulted in the emergence of new catalysts based on traditional materials. Wood and co-workers [93] developed a novel biologically supported noble metal catalyst (BioPd) for the semi-hydrogenation of BYD to BED, achieving a higher BED selectivity than in the case of conventional 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3. The BED selectivity of a similarly prepared BioPt catalyst was slightly superior to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 18 ) [80]. The above findings were ascribed to the fact that the bacterial matrix may partial block the defect sites of Pt NPs and thus enhance the selectivity for BED formation. In addition, when most of the biomass was chemically removed from the terraces of Pt NPs, the rate of reactions occurring on the resulting catalyst as well as its BED selectivity greatly increased. Such biogenic materials, featuring metal sites cleverly modified by bacteria from metal-waste-bearing solutions but lacking toxic heavy metals, may be promising alternatives to Lindlar catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols."
8,Comparison of metal-based catalysts,"To date, hundreds of metal-based catalysts have been developed for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols. Fig. 19 summarizes the most promising of such catalysts and presents their BED selectivities and activities (TOFs) [10,11,34,43,46,52,56,68,72,73,88], revealing that compared to other catalysts (including Pt- and Ni-based ones), Pd-based catalysts present superior performances. The presented data suggest that the specific activity and BED selectivity of Pd-based catalysts strongly depends on the nature of their support and the modification of active centers (e.g., by ligands and metal oxides). As Pb-free alternatives to the Lindlar catalyst, supported ligand-modified Pd catalysts such as PVP-Pd/C show excellent activity and high selectivity, which is mainly attributed to the isolation of active sites and the electronic effects of ligands adsorbed thereon. In addition, the acid-base properties of the oxide support play an important role in determining catalyst activity, e.g., Pd NPs on supports with lower isoelectric points show higher activity (e.g., the activity of Pd/SiO2/SMF is much higher than that of Pd/ZnO/SMF). On the other hand, considering the formation of PdZn intermetallics in Pd/ZnO/SMF into consideration, one concludes that the SMSI between metal NPs and oxides also affect the selectivity for intermediate formation from the viewpoint of electronic modification. Therefore, ligand-modified Pd NPs supported on a reductive metal oxide combining the geometric and electronic effects with the steric effect are promising catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols."
9,Mechanism,"The mechanism of alkynol semi-hydrogenation is usually described in terms of its elementary reactions and is believed to involve parallel and consecutive isomerization as well as hydrogenation reactions, which afford cis-enols and saturated alcohols along with other side products. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the relationship between different elementary reactions. Generally, the hydrogenation of alkynols as typical alkynes follows the “rake” mechanism (Scheme 1) [1], although the effects of other groups (e.g., C–OH and Ph–C) should also be considered. The product distribution strongly depends on the characteristics of alkynol adsorption on the catalyst. Thus, to gain a deep understanding of alkynol hydrogenation, one should study its microscopic and macroscopic reaction dynamics. Taking BYD as an example, hydrogenation involves the sequential addition of hydrogen to unsaturated bonds (C≡C and C=C) to form sub-saturated (BED) or fully saturated (BDO) products. In this process, metal NPs play a major role in the decomposition of H2 and promote the formation of intermediates with C=C and/or C–C bonds. However, unlike alkynes, alkynols contain C–OH groups, which may influence the adsorption and hydrogenation of alkynol C≡C bonds. In particular, alkynol C–OH bonds readily undergo hydrogenolysis in the presence of acidic catalyst sites, which leads to low selectivity for enols. Tanielyan et al. conducted a detailed analysis of BYD hydrogenation kinetics by considering several reaction paths and identified three characteristic stages for batch-mode hydrogenation (Fig. 20 ) [83]. Initially, BYD was mainly converted to cis-BED by semi-hydrogenation. After most of BYD had been hydrogenated, cis-BED began to be hydrogenated to BDO and underwent isomerization into trans-BED and 4-hydroxybutanal. Subsequently, the side products were slowly converted to BDO and n-BOL. Therefore, to achieve high enol selectivity in alkynol hydrogenation, one should invoke the thermodynamic factor (Scheme 1) and suppress the over-hydrogenation of enol C=C bonds. If the target product is an alkanol, one should design a catalyst capable of highly efficient hydrogenation and suppress the hydrogenolysis of alkanol C–OH groups. Generally, the selectivity for target products in alkynol hydrogenation greatly depends on the relationship between the electronic and geometric structures of the catalyst and substrates in the adsorption process. Gui et al. observed a red shift in the stretching mode of the C≡C bonds of BYD adsorbed on Pt(111) by electron energy loss spectroscopy, ascribing this shift to a change in bond order from triple to double during adsorption [94]. Holtze et al. [95] observed a similar shift for the adsorption of BYD on Au due to the interaction between one of the C–OH groups and surface atoms, suggesting that this may account for the occurrence of side reactions in the hydrogenation of BYD over Au-based catalysts. Sakamoto et al. [96] systematically investigated BYD adsorbed on Ni (111) and Ni (100) model cluster surfaces by density functional theory (DFT), revealing significant differences between these surfaces in terms of BYD geometry and adsorption energy. Fig. 21 shows that the adsorption energy in the natural electron configuration (Δn NEC) was derived from the 2s orbital of carbon atoms rather than from the corresponding 2p orbital. In addition, the short-range strong interaction due to a triple bond and the long-range weak interaction due to oxygen atoms were clarified. Thus, Ni-based materials were concluded to be promising catalysts for the hydrogenation of alkynols, and advanced characterizations and DFT calculations were concluded to provide certain guidance for the design of these catalysts. In addition, Ferrante et al. [97] investigated alkynol hydrogenation on a Pd cluster by DFT. Fig. 22 shows the mechanism of BYD hydrogenation on the Pd9(H)2 cluster. The energy barrier for alkynol hydrogenation was lower than that for enol hydrogenation. The intermediate enol adsorbed on the Pd9 cluster was more stable than the parent alkynol. In addition, small Pd clusters were found to selectively promote the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols, which inspired us to design a suitable Pd-based catalyst with small particles (even Pd single atoms) for the above transformation."
10,Conclusions and perspectives,"Herein, we systematically reviewed the progress in the selective hydrogenation of alkynols over noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts and provided an in-depth analysis of the structure and properties of catalysts ranging from the classical Lindlar catalyst and Raney Ni to bio-metal composites. Moreover, the insights provided by advanced characterization technologies, theoretical calculations, and experimental results were used to discuss the mechanism of the selective alkynol hydrogenation. The activity of the related catalysts as well as their stability and selectivity for target products were shown to be determined by the intrinsic metal active sites, promoters (second metals, organic ligands, and stabilizers), and the nature of supports (pore structure, acid-base properties, and SMSI). The following conclusions were drawn. Among all noble metal catalysts, Pd-based ones present the highest efficiency and selectivity for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynols to enols. The addition of stabilizers and inhibitors can improve selectivity for intermediates, while the concomitant poisoning of Pd active sites decreases catalytic activity to some extent. In particular, the introduction of a second metal (e.g., Zn, In, and Cu) allows one to tune the geometric and electronic structures of metallic Pd and thus modify the adsorption of substrates and intermediates and inhibit over-hydrogenation. Compared with traditional Lindlar-type catalysts, such Pd-based alloys or intermetallics can be extensively used for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols, as such doping enhances selectivity for enols while avoiding the hazards associated with toxic additives. Ni-based materials as alternatives to noble metal catalysts can achieve the highly selective hydrogenation of alkynols to enols or alkanols. Up to now, Raney Ni has been used for the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BDO in fixed-bed reactors on an industrial scale, although the employed reaction conditions are harsher (30 MPa H2) than those used for noble metal catalysts. The distribution of products formed during the Ni-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkynols strongly depends on the introduction of promoters and the acidity of supports. In addition, the hydrothermal stability of Ni-based catalysts should be increased, as the deposition of carbonaceous species covers the active Ni and blocks catalyst mesopores. Although the selective hydrogenation of alkynols has been extensively researched in both academia and industry, certain white spots (especially those pertaining to the structure-property relationships of catalysts and the reaction mechanism) still remain. The development of in situ characterization technologies and theoretical calculations should help us to understand the mechanism of the selective catalytic hydrogenation of alkynols and guide the design of highly efficient and selective catalysts based on hydrogenation characteristics. As the products derived from alkynols are mainly used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors (monomers), they should be highly pure. Therefore, it is vital to choose highly efficient catalysts without introducing toxic additives. Catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynols in aqueous or alcoholic phases should be stable under these hydrothermal conditions. In particular, hydrothermal stability can be enhanced by the introduction of a water-resistant carrier or by strengthening the metal-support interaction through anchoring and coating to inhibit the aggregation and leaching of metal NPs. The selective hydrogenation of alkynols with short carbon chains (e.g., BYD and MBY) has been extensively researched. However, only few reports deal with the selective hydrogenation of alkynols with long carbon chains (e.g., dehydroisophytol), although this transformation is of high importance for pharmaceutical synthesis. The steric effects of substrates can be used to design special catalysts with the required pore structure. Although the selective hydrogenation of BYD to BDO is suited for continuous industrial production, most alkynol hydrogenations are intermittent operations. Given the increasing market demand for enols, continuous operation will be an inevitable trend to obtain high-quality products."
