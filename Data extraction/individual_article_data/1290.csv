0,Introduction,"At present, due to the depletion of fossil resources, and the need to reduce greenhouse gases, the demand for alternative resources for the catalytic thermochemical conversion of syngas (CO+H2) to higher alcohols (STA) from renewable resources such as biomass is growing (Kim et al., 2017; Luk et al., 2016). The higher alcohols (CnH2n+1OH, n≥2) could be used as chemical intermediates, feedstocks, alternative fuels for vehicles, fuel additives for octane or cetane enhancement, promote complete combustion or reduce polluted emissions (Dorokhov et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012). Therefore, over the past few decades, many attempts have been made to develop a new approach for higher alcohols synthesis. The synthesis of higher alcohols includes carbon-chain growth via carbon-carbon coupling and alcohol production through CO insertion by hydrogenation (Wang et al., 2015a; Zhong et al., 2016). A catalyst plays a very critical role in the synthesis of higher alcohols. A typical metal Ru-based catalyst has shown high activities for the synthesis of ethanol and selectivity of C2 oxygenates via CO hydrogenation (Abdelsayed et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Prieto et al., 2011; Surisetty et al., 2010). However, the high cost of Ru had limited its large-scale application and commercialization in syngas conversion (Mei et al., 2010; Villanueva Perales et al., 2011). As an alternative to non-noble-metal catalysts, hydrodesulfurization Mo-based catalysts (Liakakou et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2013), methanol synthesis catalysts (Surisetty et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2015), and modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts (Lu et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2016) based on Co have been proposed for STA from syngas. Among these catalysts, Cu-Co based catalysts are considered the most promising catalysts with high C2+OH selectivity and mild reaction conditions (Ding et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2013), in which Cu assists in the non-dissociative activation of CO for CO insertion and subsequent alcohol formation, while Co acts as active sites for the dissociation of CO to form surface alkyl groups (Wang et al., 2013). It has been reported that the synergistic effects between Co and Cu play an important role in higher alcohols synthesis. However, the majority of alkanes, negligible oxygenates and water gas conversion are formed over the Cu-Co based catalysts by CO hydrogenation. This results in higher alcohol selectivity with a wide carbon number distribution, which restricts their use in industrial applications (Chen et al., 2017). Mesoporous composite materials have been drawing increasing attention due to their controllable morphologies, nanosized channels, functionalizable surface functional groups and excellent performance for adsorption (Chai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015b). They also display high specific surface areas, high thermal stability and hydrothermal stability. Mesoporous composites had good application potential as supports. Joo et al. reported that mesoporous SiO2 coated Pt catalysts showed higher catalytic activity than the uncoated sample (Joo et al., 2009). Liu et al. found that ZrO2 assists in the reduction of Co2+ species to metallic cobalt for CO hydrogenation, and ZrO2-promoted catalysts show increased selectivity for ethanol (Liu et al., 2016). Alkalis can neutralize the acid on the catalyst surface and are considered to be indispensable for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas on alkali-modified Cu-Co-based catalysts (Heracleous et al., 2013; Yong et al., 2017). In this study, we prepared a CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst by incipient wetness impregnation for the synthesis of higher alcohols from biomass-based syngas. A mesoporous ZrO2-SiO2 composite was used as the support, and the active particles were bimetallic CoCu with alkali metal K. The mesoscopic structure, crystal structure, pore structure and TEM images of the catalysts were analyzed. The CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst with the modification of ZrO2 and added alkali metal had greater activity and selectivity for higher alcohols. The carbon deposition and life of the catalyst were studied, and a catalyst with a high life was obtained."
1,Experimental section,
2,Experimental reagents,"2.1 Experimental reagents Pluronic F127 was purchased from Sigma, and tetraethyl silicate (≥99.0 wt%) was purchased from Aladdin. Copper nitrate trihydrate (≥99.0 wt%), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (≥99.0 wt%), potassium acetate (99.5 wt%), zirconium nitrate pentahydrate (99.9 wt%), methanol (≥99.9 wt%), ethanol (≥99.8 wt%), n-propanol (≥99.9 wt%), isopropanol (≥99.9 wt%), n-butanol (≥99.9 wt%), and isobutanol (≥99.8 wt%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ltd (Table 1 ). All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Deionized water was used in all experiments. Wheat straw was collected from a farm in Henan province, China."
3,Preparation of mesoporous composite catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of mesoporous composite catalyst In a typical preparation, 1.0 g of F127 was dissolved in 20.0 g of ethanol, and then 2.08 g of tetraethyl silicate and 0.43 g of zirconium nitrate pentahydrate were added dropwise at 40 °C under stirring for 1 h to obtain a uniform transparent solution. The ethanol was evaporated to dry at room temperature, and the solution was heated at 100 °C for 24 h. The material was ground into powder and calcined at 600 °C in the nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h to obtain the mesoporous ZrO2-SiO2 composite. In a typical production, 19.0 g of Cu(NO3)2•3H2O, 24.8 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O and 2.6 g of CH3COOK was dissolved in deionized H2O (200 ml) to obtain a clear solution. Impregnation was performed by the addition of 100 g of fresh mesoporous ZrO2-SiO2. Water was removed by vacuum evaporation below 50 °C. After impregnation, the sample was calcined in air at 100 °C for 8 h and then at 400 °C for 8 h (heating rate: 100 °C/h), resulting in CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2. Co1Cu3K/ZrO2-SiO2 and Co3Cu1K/ZrO2-SiO2 were prepared by the same method, the addition amount of Cu(NO3)2•3H2O and Co(NO3)2•6H2O were calculated according to the mass fraction (Fig. 1 )."
4,Experimental device,"2.3 Experimental device The technology of the experimental system is shown in Fig. 2 . The system includes a wheat straw gasification device, gas filter, higher alcohols synthesis reactor, liquid fuel collection system, distillation device, and purification device. The syngas generating higher alcohols reactor used a tubular higher-pressure fixed-bed reactor, and the outside was a heating furnace equipped with a temperature-measuring and temperature-control device. The process for producing higher alcohols from biomass syngas was as follows: the catalyst was loaded into the constant temperature zone of the reactor, and the reactor was connected to the system to ensure that the device was sealed. The gas line was connected to the high-pressure nitrogen, the reactor pressure was adjusted to 3.0 MPa, and the hermeticity of the device was checked using the soap bubbles. Under the condition of good airtightness of the instrument, biomass-based syngas was introduced into the stainless steel tubular fixed-bed reactor after passing through the pressure reducing valve and the mass flow meter. The reaction gas was heated by the furnace to the reaction temperature. Then the gas entered the reactor for the alcohol synthesis reaction. Liquid products were collected in a cold trap. Liquid products were separated on an OV-101 column with an FID. Gaseous hydrocarbons were separated through a Porapack-Q column. Gas effluents were analyzed using a Carbo sieve packed column with TCD. The CO conversion rate was calculated as the mole percentage of carbon monoxide converted to products: (1) X c o m o l % = C O i n - C O o u t C O i n × 100 % Space-time yield (STY) was calculated as the weight of desired products (such as alcohols) generated per unit volume of catalyst and per unit time (2) S T Y g m L c a t - 1 h - 1 = w e i g h t o f a l c o h o l s p r o d u c e d g v o l u m e o f c a t a l y s t m L × h The Anderson-Schulz-Flory (A-S-F) distribution describes the alcohol chain length distribution. That is, if the alcohol chain was formed step wise by insertion or addition of C1 intermediates with constant growth probability (α), then the chain length distribution is given by the A-S-F distribution. The equation can be expressed as follows: (3) W n n = ( 1 - α ) 2 a n - 1 → ln V n n = n ln α + c"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preparation of biomass syngas,"3.1 Preparation of biomass syngas The wheat straw was heated to 1100 °C for high temperature cracking after continuous pyrolysis at 500 °C. When the temperature of the gas rose above 1000 °C, tar, charcoal and other macromolecular substances, in the biomass pyrolysis gas will undergo a rapid cracking reaction, a part of the pyrolysis gas was rapidly reacted with pure oxygen. And the long-chain macromolecular structure will decompose in a very short time, forming small hydrocarbon molecules, as well as CH4, H2, CO, CO2, and other gases. When the temperature was higher than 1000 °C, the cracking reaction had essentially completed. Finally, a crude pyrolysis gas suitable for use in synthesizing liquid fuels was produced (Table 2 ). The crude syngas was subjected to reforming and low temperature conversion to obtain better syngas components, and the syngas was then catalytically synthesized to produce the target product of higher alcohols."
7,Catalyst characterisation,"3.2 Catalyst characterisation 3.2.1 X-ray diffraction analysis Fig. 3 shows the small angle X-ray diffractogram and wide-angle XRD of the CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that ZrO2-SiO2 had three well-resolved diffraction peaks at 0.83°, 1.43° and 1.66°, with a ratio of 1/d of 1∶ 3 ∶2, which were attributed to the characteristic diffraction peaks of the 100, 110, and 200 reflections of highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry with space group P6mm, indicating that the ZrO2-SiO2 had a highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructure. Fig. 3B shows that the diffraction peak of ZrO2-SiO2 was broad and diffuse, which was attributed to the amorphous structure of the support. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.1°, 31.0°, 36.7°, 45.2°, 59.1° and 65.2° were observed for the catalyst, which corresponded to the different crystal faces of Co3O4(Ali et al., 2011; Xiaomin et al., 2015). According to the Scherrer formula, the average particle diameter of the Co species was 8.5 nm. Diffraction peaks from Cu were not observed in the XRD data, indicating that Cu was highly dispersed within the channels of the catalyst structure. 3.2.2 N2 adsorption-desorption characteristics Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution for the CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4A shows a typical IV adsorption isotherm with obvious capillary condensation and H1-type hysteresis loop at P/P0 = 0.8˜1.0, indicating that the CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst had a highly ordered mesoscopic structure with straight, open-ended cylindrical channels. As shown in Fig. 4B, the catalyst had a pore size of approximately 7 nm˜8 nm. Modification with ZrO2 and impregnation with active particles such as Co and Cu did not change the mesomorphology of the mesoporous SiO2. 3.2.3 Transmission electron microscopy characterization results TEM images of the CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst showed a typical striped pattern, arranged regularly. The black stripes were the hole walls, and the white stripes were the channels of the catalyst. The ordered arrangement of the channels indicated that the catalyst had a typical two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructure, which is consistent with the small angle XRD characterization. The small black spots observed in the TEM images were the active nanoparticles. The active particles were well dispersed without obvious aggregation (Fig. 5 )."
8,Catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation,"3.3 Catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation Table 3 compares the effects of different active components and different Co/Cu ratios on the performance of the catalyst for synthesis of higher alcohols. The addition of an appropriate amount of alkali metal K promoter could increase the CO hydrogenation conversion rate (from 15.7%–24.8%) and the space-time yield of alcohols (from 21.3 mg/gcat•h to 103.1 mg/mgcat•h). In addition, the alkali metal K promoter also increased the C2+alcohol selectivity (from 23.1 mol% to 33.5 mol%). This is because the alkali metal K could neutralize the surface acidity of the catalyst, thereby inhibiting further dehydration of alcohols and carbon deposition. The addition of ZrO2 can further increase the yield of CO hydrogenation (from 15.7%–23.6%) and the space-time yield of alcohol (from 21.3 mg/gcat•h to 101.2 mg/gcat•h). ZrO2 is a metal oxide with acidic, basic, and redox properties and is a P-type semiconductor, which is prone to produce oxygen holes. Modification with ZrO2 could effectively weaken the surface acidity, further inhibiting the dehydration of alcohol and the formation of carbon deposits. Table 3 shows that the Co3Cu1/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst had the highest CO conversion rate, but the product is mainly composed of alkane, which shows that cobalt is an active element in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalyst and has higher CO dissociation and hydrogenation activity. The CO conversion rate of the Co1Cu3/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst is lower, and the main product is methanol, which shows that Cu is the active element in the methanol synthesis catalyst. The conversion rate of CO decreased significantly with increasing of copper content in the three groups of catalysts. The main reason was that the surface energy of copper (1.934 J/m2) was smaller than the surface energy of cobalt (2.709 J/m2) (Edelstein et al., 1999), which made the surface of the support more easily enriched in copper atoms. A large amount of copper covers the active site of cobalt (Su et al., 2014). Cobalt had a high CO dissociation activity, and the decrease in the amount of the surface Co active site directly leads to the decrease in CO dissociation, which in turn leads to the decrease in CO conversion rate. At the same time, the addition of copper significantly increases the selectivity of CO to alcohols, because the addition of copper produces non-dissociated activated CO. The increase of the CoCu bimetallic active center also increases the likelihood of non-dissociate CO insertion, thereby increasing the selectivity of the C2+alcohols. When the molar ratio of Co/Cu = 1/1, the activity and selectivity of higher alcohols synthesis was greatest. The Co2Cu2/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst had the highest space-time yield of alcohols (208.1 mg/mgcat•h) and the C2+alcohol selectivity (42%)."
9,Distribution of A-S-F (Anderson-Shulz-Flory) of alcohols,"3.4 Distribution of A-S-F (Anderson-Shulz-Flory) of alcohols The A-S-F distribution of the higher alcoholsynthesis from biomass syngas with different compositions was calculated by the distribution of the alcohols in the reaction products (Peng et al., 2016). All of the alcohol products of the reaction including methanol, as shown in Fig. 6 , corresponded well to the A-S-F distribution relationship. The carbon chain growth factor α calculated from this distribution changes only with the change of the reaction system and did not change with the carbon number of the product. The addition of alkali metal K could increase the α value (the variation of α = 41.2%). The modification of ZrO2 could also increase the α value (the variation of α = 35.3%). Adding alkali metal K and modifying ZrO2 at the same time, the carbon chain growth factor α value increases (the variation of α = 52.9%). As the content of Co increases, the α value increases (the variation of α = 70.6%), indicating that Co is conductive to the growth of carbon-carbon chains."
10,Carbon deposition of catalyst,"3.5 Carbon deposition of catalyst Fig. 7 shows the thermogravimetric, micro-commercial thermograviogram and thermal analysis curves for the CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst after catalytic CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. The catalyst had a significant weight loss peak at 100 °Cand a weight loss of 1.1%, indicating that the catalyst contained approximately 1% of the free water or crystal water. The initial temperature of carbon combustion at which loss of mass occurs, Ti, was approximately 300 °C, the temperature at which loss of mass ceases, Tf, was approximately 600 °C, and the weight loss was 2.5%. Corresponding to the thermal analysis curves in Fig. 7, there was an exothermic peak in the temperature, which is the burning peak of carbon. This indicates that the catalyst will produce a small amount of carbon deposition in the reaction of catalyzing CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols and approximately 2.5% of carbon deposition will not block the pores."
11,The life test of the catalyst,"3.6 The life test of the catalyst The catalytic performance with the influence of reaction time was investigated under a temperature of 200 °C, pressure of 3 MPa, space velocity 1200 h−1. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . The single-pass conversion rate of CO hydrogenation decreased from 44.7% to 28.9% with the extension of reaction time in Fig. 8. The selectivity of hydrocarbons and alcohols did not change significantly. As the catalyst activity decreased, the space-time yield of the target product showed a downward trend. After 1000 h of reaction time, the space-time yield of the alcohols was 175.4 g(Lh)−1. As the reaction time was prolonged, the distribution of higher alcohols did not change significantly, and it was found that the catalyst exhibited good stability when it was continuously operated for 1000 h."
12,Conclusions,"For the preparation of higher alcohols from biomass synthesis gas, the CO conversion rate is low, the life of the catalyst is short, and the selectivity of C2+OH needs to be further improved. The mesoporous composite catalyst CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 was prepared by the impregnation method and the multi-solvent self-assembly method. The effect of the catalyst composition on the performance of the catalyst was investigated. 1) The CoCuK/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst had a highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructure, and the active particles were dispersed in the mesopores. After the reaction, the carbon deposition was approximately 2.5%, and the very weak carbon deposition did not block the pores. 2) The addition of alkali metal promoter K and modified ZrO2 could further improve the conversion of CO and the space-time yield of alcohols. Adjusting the ratio of copper to cobalt had a great influence on the activity of the catalyst and the selectivity of the products. The 2%Co-2%Cu catalyst exhibited the best CO conversion and selectivity to the target product. 3) After the 1000 h life test, the catalyst showed good catalytic activity and stability and possessed the conditions needed for further industrial application."
