0,Introduction,"Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is a well-known subtropical and tropical fruit in the world mainly due to its high nutritional value and attractive flavor (Lin, Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2018; Lin, Li et al., 2020). It is rich in nutrients including polysaccharides which can bring health benefits to humans (Yang, Jiang, Shi, Chen, & Ashraf, 2011; Bai et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2013; Rong et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2012). However, longan is rapidly perishable during storage, which is caused by pericarp browning, fruit decay, pulp softening, and pulp breakdown (Chen et al., 2015; Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2019, 2016). In particular, the pulp breakdown can lead to the loss in nutrients and nutritional value, the difficulty in commercialization and long-distance transportation, and the shortening of shelf life (Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2019, 2020b; Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2020). Consequently, to alleviate the quality deterioration of longan fruit, it is critical to explicate the mechanisms of pulp breakdown in longans during storage. Tissue softening is usually due to the structural damage of cell wall, especially the decomposition of polysaccharides that are the chief composition of cell wall (Brummell, 2006). Polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin can be decomposed via the catalysis of the enzymes-associated with cell wall decomposition, which primarily include pectinesterase (PE), β-galactosidase (β-Gal), xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET), cellulase (Cx), and polygalacturonase (PG) (Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). Moreover, previous studies have elucidated that the enhanced activities of these enzymes and the declined amounts of cell wall polysaccharides might lead to softening and shorten the storage time of postharvest fresh fruits like Younai plums (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018), apricots (Fan et al., 2018, 2019), and apples (Wei et al., 2010). Thus, a better understanding of the cell wall polysaccharide metabolism in postharvest longan fruit may provide a new method for controlling longan pulp breakdown. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous in fresh fruits, but they are harmless when ROS at a normal level. However, during the process of fruit senescence or under stress, the level of ROS in fresh fruits may exceed a certain threshold, which can damage biological macromolecules and promote cell death, and thus, stimulate senescence and cut down storage life of fresh fruits (Chen, Hung, Chen, Lin, & Lin, 2019; Lin et al., 2014, 2016, 2017, Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2019, Lin, Lin et al., 2020). Evidences indicated that hydroxyl radical, one kind of ROS, was involved in cellular wall disassembly, and then triggered pulp softening of bananas (Cheng et al., 2018) and pulp breakdown of mulberries (Chen, Cao, Gao, Fang, & Li, 2016). Also, it indicated that pulp breakdown of longans was triggered by hydroxyl radical, but postponed by L-cysteine hydrochloride, a ROS scavenger (Duan et al., 2011). Additionally, our preliminary works have illuminated that hydrogen peroxide, the most stable and facile ROS, could accelerate breakdown occurrence in the pulp of postharvest fresh longans (Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2019, 2020b; Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2020). However, there is a lack of research on the role of cell wall polysaccharide metabolism in hydrogen peroxide-promoted breakdown occurrence in the pulp of postharvest longans. The present work evaluated the influences of hydrogen peroxide on the pulp firmness, the gene transcription levels and the activities of corresponding enzymes-associated with the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides, and the amounts of cell wall polysaccharides in the pulp of harvested fresh longans. This work intended to explicate the role of cell wall polysaccharide metabolism in ROS-induced breakdown occurrence in the pulp of postharvest fresh longan fruit. Additionally, the result of this work would provide the scientific basis for alleviating pulp breakdown, delaying the decline of storability and extending the storage-life of fresh longans by regulating the production of ROS."

4,Materials and treatments,"2.3 Materials and treatments ‘Fuyan’ longan fruit at commercially ripening stage with light yellow of pericarp appearance color, were gathered from Nan’an Nanjin Longan Orchard, Fujian, China. The tested longans were selected and soaked in the solution of 1.96 mmol L−1 (that is 60 g/L) hydrogen peroxide, which was diluted 5 times from 30 % (m/v) hydrogen peroxide, and distilled water (control group), then stockpiled at 80 % relative humidity and 15 °C for ten days. The detailed postharvest handling procedures were described in our prior works (Supplementary material: Materials and treatments; Lin, Lin, Chen et al., 2019). Every two days of storage, 3 bags of longans (N = 150) from each group were taken for assaying the following parameters of cell wall metabolism during storage."
5,Determination methods,"2.4 Determination methods 2.4.1 Longan pulp firmness The modified methods of Hampson et al. (2014), Wang and Long (2015) were applied to estimate the longan pulp firmness using FirmTechⅡFruit Firmness Tester (BioWorks, Inc., Wamego, Kansas, United States). The compression rate of 13 mm s−1, the maximum compression force (300 g) and minimum compression force (20 g) were set in this experiment. An individual longan pulp (20 total), which the pericarp of longan fruit was removed, was placed on the turntable of Firmness Tester, then compressed at the equator of longan pulp. The unit of longan pulp firmness was denoted as g mm−1. 2.4.2 Longan pulp cell wall materials and polysaccharides contents Cell wall materials (CWM), polysaccharides in cell wall of longan pulp including cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin fractions such as water-soluble pectin (WSP), covalent-soluble pectin (CSP), and ionic-soluble pectin (ISP), were separated and measured in the light of the detailed protocol of our prior work (Supplementary material: The methods of assaying longan pulp cell wall materials and cell wall polysaccharide contents; Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). The units of CWM and polysaccharides amounts were displayed as g kg −1. 2.4.3 Longan pulp cell wall-degrading enzymes activities Longan pulp tissues (5 g from 10 fruit) were used to extract and measure activities of β-Gal, XET, Cx, PG, and PE based on the detailed protocol of our prior work (Supplementary material: The methods of assaying longan pulp cell wall-degrading enzyme activities; Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). The protein amount of the above longan pulp extraction including enzymes of cell wall-disassembly was measured by the protocol of Bradford (1976). The units of β-Gal, XET, Cx, PG, and PE activities were displayed as U mg−1 protein. 2.4.4 Longan pulp RNA isolation and the relative gene expressions of cell wall polysaccharide-disassembling related gene analysis Total RNA was isolated from longan pulp using TransZol Up Plus RNA Kit on the basis of the manufacturer’s instruction. One microgram of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA via applying TaKaRa PrimeScript™RT reagent Kit. Based on the sequence information on longan genome (GIGADB DATASETs, http://gigadb.org) and NCBI database, the full-length of DlXET, DlPE, DlPG, Dlβ-Gal, and DlCx were cloned and sequenced. Primer 3 web (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/) was used to design gene specific primers, and the Table 2 displayed the gene specific primers in this work. qRT-PCR was conducted with QuantStudio5 Applied Biosystems using TaKaRa’s TB Green™ Premix Ex Taq™ kit. DlACTIN was used as the reference gene. The cycle threshold (Ct) value comparing with DlACTIN was applied to normalize all reactions. The expression levels of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling-related genes (DlXET, DlPE, DlPG, Dlβ-Gal, and DlCx) were calculated based on the reference of Livak and Schmittgen (2001)."
6,Statistical analyses,"2.5 Statistical analyses The above parameters were measured three times. Mean ± standard error (n = 3) was used to present the values in figures. The data were analyzed by ANOVA (analysis of variance) and t-test using SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). The asterisks expressed extremely notable discrepancy (**: P < 0.01) or notable discrepancy (*: P < 0.05) between the control samples and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans on the same storage day, separately."
7,Results,
8,Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in pulp firmness in postharvest longans,"3.1 Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in pulp firmness in postharvest longans Fig. 1 demonstrated that the pulp firmness of the control and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans dropped quickly with the extended storage. In comparison with control longans, a lower pulp firmness was shown in hydrogen peroxide-treated samples during storage, with a remarkable (P < 0.05) discrepancy from 4 to 10 d of storage. These data demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide could obviously accelerate longan pulp softening, thereby promote quality deterioration of postharvest longans."
9,Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in the contents of cell wall polysaccharides in postharvest longans,"3.2 Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in the contents of cell wall polysaccharides in postharvest longans The contents of CWM (Fig. 2 A), CSP (Fig. 2B), ISP (Fig. 2C) in the pulp of the control and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans showed a gradual declination with the storage time progressed. In comparison with control fruit, during storage, lower contents of those substances were illustrated in hydrogen peroxide-treated longans, with a remarkable (P < 0.05) discrepancy during 4–10 d, 6–10 d, and 2–10 d of storage, separately. Fig. 2D illustrated that WSP amount in the pulp of the control and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans increased with the extension of storage time. Compared with control samples, the amount of pulp WSP in hydrogen peroxide treated-longans maintained at a higher level, with a remarkable (P < 0.05) discrepancy from 6 to 10 d of storage. As displayed in Fig. 2E, the pulp cellulose amount in control samples showed a gradual declination with the extended storage time. However, the cellulose amount in pulp of hydrogen peroxide treated-longans decreased slowly within the first four storage days, and quickly decreased from 4 d to 6 d of storage, thereafter slowly declined. The statistical results revealed that the pulp cellulose amount in hydrogen peroxide-treated group was obviously (P < 0.01) lower than the control group during 6–10 d of storage. As illustrated in Fig. 2F, pulp hemicellulose amount in the control and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans declined with the extension of storage time. Significance analysis illustrated that, in contrast with the control samples, a significant lower (P < 0.05) hemicellulose amount was shown in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group from 4 to 10 d of storage, except day 8 (Fig. 2F). The above data demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide could significantly accelerate the degradations of cell wall polysaccharides (CWM, CSP, ISP, hemicellulose and cellulose) in pulp of harvested fresh longans."
10,Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharide degradation in postharvest longans,"3.3 Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharide degradation in postharvest longans Fig. 3 A showed that the pulp XET activity in control longans raised gradually within 0–10 d of storage. However, the XET activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group increased quickly during the storage 0–8 d, followed by a slight decline within the storage 8–10 d. The statistical results exhibited that the XET activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher than the control longans during 0–10 d of storage, with a remarkable (P < 0.01) discrepancy from 6 to 10 d of storage. Fig. 3B exhibited that the pulp PE activity in control longans raised quickly during the storage 0–8 d, then dropped rapidly after eight days of storage. While the PE activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group increased rapidly within 0–8 d of storage, but gradually decreased thereafter. The statistical results displayed that, during storage, the PE activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher than control samples, with conspicuous (P < 0.05) discrepancy within 4–10 d of storage. Fig. 3C displayed that PG activity in pulp of control samples raised quickly within storage 0–6 d, followed by a slight enhancement. However, PG activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group increased speedily during the storage 0–8 d, followed by a quick decrement. The statistical results showed that the PG activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher than control samples during storage, with conspicuous (P < 0.05) discrepancy within 4–10 d of storage. Fig. 3D illustrated that β-Gal activity in pulp of control samples enhanced rapidly during the storage 0–2 d, raised slowly from 2 d to 4 d, raised quickly from 4 d to 6 d, followed by a slow declination. However, the activity of β-Gal in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group raised rapidly from 0 d to 2 d, raised slowly from 2 d to 4 d, increased sharply from 4 to 6 d, and decreased quickly from 6 d to 10 d. The statistical results displayed that the pulp β-Gal activity in hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher than control samples during storage, with conspicuous (P < 0.05) discrepancy during storage 2–10 d. Fig. 3E showed that Cx activity in the pulp of control fruit raised gradually during storage 0–4 d, raised quickly from 4 d to 6 d, but slowly declined thereafter. However, the Cx activity in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group raised speedily during the storage 0–8 d, followed by a slow decrement. The statistical results displayed that, in comparison with control longans, hydrogen peroxide-treated group maintained higher pulp Cx activity throughout the entire storage time, with conspicuous (P < 0.05) discrepancy from 2 d to 10 d of storage except day 6. The above data demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide could notably enhance the activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharide degradation such as PG, PE, β-Gal, Cx and XET in pulp of harvested fresh longans."
11,Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in expressions of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling related genes in postharvest longans,"3.4 Hydrogen peroxide-caused changes in expressions of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling related genes in postharvest longans The expression level of DlXET in longan pulp of control group slightly up-regulated during 0–4 d of storage, slightly down-regulated from 4 d to 6 d, and rapidly up-regulated after six days of storage (Fig. 4 A). However, the expression level of DlXET in the pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group slowly up-regulated during 0–6 of storage, rapidly up-regulated from 6 d to 8 d, and gradually up-regulated after eight days of storage. Contrasted with the control longans, the expression level of DlXET in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher throughout the entire storage time, and presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression level of DlXET within 6–10 d of storage (Fig. 4A). According to Fig. 4B, the expression level of DlPE in longan pulp of the control group gradually up-regulated with the extension of storage time (0 ∼ 8 d), followed by a slight decrement. However, the expression level of DlPE in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group quickly up-regulated within 0–6 d of storage, and slowly up-regulated after six days of storage. Contrasted with the control longans, the expression level of DlPE in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated longans was higher throughout the entire storage time, and presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression level of DlPE during 4–10 d of storage. Fig. 4C exhibited that the expression level of DlPG in longan pulp of the control group gradually up-regulated with the extension of storage time (0 ∼ 6 d), followed by a rapid increment. However, the expression level of DlPG in the pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group gradually up-regulated during storage 0–4 d, sharply up-regulated from 4 d to 6 d, and slowly up-regulated after six days of storage. Contrasted with the control longans, the expression level of DlPG in the pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher throughout the entire storage days, and presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression level of DlPG during 4–10 d of storage. Fig. 4D illustrated that the expression level of Dlβ-Gal in the pulp of the control and hydrogen peroxide-treated longans gradually up-regulated before two days of storage, but slightly down-regulated during storage 2–4 d, and then rapidly up-regulated after four days of storage. Contrasted with the control longans, the expression level of Dlβ-Gal in the pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher throughout the entire storage time, and presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression level of Dlβ-Gal during 6–10 d of storage. Fig. 4E exhibited that the expression level of DlCx in longan pulp of the control group quickly up-regulated before two days of storage, then slowly up-regulated during storage 2–6 d, but gradually down-regulated after six days of storage. However, the expression level of DlCx in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group sharply up-regulated before six days of storage, quickly down-regulated during storage 6–8 d, and gradually up-regulated after eight days of storage. Contrasted with control samples, the expression level of DlCx in pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated group was higher throughout the entire storage days, with conspicuous (P < 0.05) discrepancy during storage 4–10 d except storage day 6. The above data demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide could remarkably up-regulate the expression levels of cell wall-degrading-related genes (DlPG, DlPE, Dlβ-Gal, DlCx, and DlXET) in the pulp of postharvest longans."
12,Discussion,
13,Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the compositions of cell wall polysaccharides and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans,"4.1 Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the compositions of cell wall polysaccharides and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans The structure of cell wall contributes to the agglutination, rigidity and firmness of fruit. Polysaccharides, such as pectic substances (CSP, ISP, and WSP), hemicellulose and cellulose, are the crucial composition of cell wall, therefore, their alteration determine the firmness of fruit (Broxterman & Schols, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2012, 2018; Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang, Zhao, Lai, Chen, & Yang, 2018, 2019). Generally, during storage, the decomposition of cell wall polysaccharides is featured by the decrements in the contents of CSP, ISP, hemicellulose and cellulose, but an increment of the WSP content (Fan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Consequently, alleviating the decomposition of cell wall polysaccharides is important for maintaining the firmness of postharvest fruit. The present work demonstrated that the pulp breakdown index (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) and pulp WSP content (Fig. 2D) in the control fruit raised with the prolonging of storage time. Meantime, during storage, the firmness of longan pulp (Fig. 1), the contents of CWM, CSP, ISP, cellulose and hemicellulose (Fig. 2A–C, E–F) decreased speedily. Correlation analysis displayed that the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) had a clear negative connection with the decreased pulp firmness (Fig. 1A), with correlation coefficient r value of -0.959. Moreover, the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) also had notably negative correlations with the decreased contents of pulp CWM, CSP, ISP, cellulose and hemicellulose (Fig. 2A–C, E–F) in the control fruit, with correlation coefficient r of -0.959, -0.972, -0.974, -0.955, and -0.951, separately. Additionally, the decreased longan pulp firmness (Fig. 1A) had noticeably positive correlations with the declined contents of CWM, CSP, ISP, cellulose and hemicellulose (Fig. 2A–C, E–F) in the pulp of control samples, with correlation coefficient r of 0.936, 0.991, 0.950, 0.990, and 0.954, separately. Moreover, the raised WSP content (Fig. 2D) was in a noticeably positive correlation with the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1), but had an obvious negative correlation with the declined pulp firmness (Fig. 1A) in the pulp of control samples, with correlation coefficient r of 0.900 and -0.958, separately. These data revealed that that the pulp breakdown development and pulp softening in postharvest longans were associated with the decomposition of cell wall polysaccharides, which displayed the decreased contents of CWM, CSP, ISP, cellulose and hemicellulose, but the enhanced content of WSP. These findings agreed with previous studies that reported that the declined contents of CSP, ISP, hemicelluloses and cellulose as well as the enhanced content of WSP were related to the aggravated softening and the decreased firmness in postharvest fresh fruits like blueberries (Chen, Hung, Chen, & Lin, 2017), apricots (Fan et al., 2019), persimmons (Wang et al., 2020) and Younai plums (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018). In addition, contrasted to the control samples, during storage, hydrogen peroxide-treated group maintained higher levels of pulp breakdown index (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) and pulp WSP content (Fig. 2D), but lower pulp firmness and contents of pulp CWM, CSP, ISP, cellulose and hemicellulose (Figs. 1, 2A–C, E–F). These findings suggested that hydrogen peroxide accelerated pulp breakdown occurrence and the reduction of pulp firmness in postharvest fresh longans, which was because hydrogen peroxide promoted the breakdown of cell wall polysaccharides, resulting in the accelerated declinations of CWM, CSP, ISP, hemicellulose and cellulose, as well as the accelerated increase of WSP content."
14,Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharides degradation and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans,"4.2 Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharides degradation and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans The alterations in polysaccharides compositions in plant cell wall are regulated by cell wall-degrading enzymes including PE, PG, β-Gal, Cx, and XET, but they play different roles in the decomposition of polysaccharides in plant cell wall (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). Pectin possess methyl esterified derivatives of galacturonic acid, the chief role of PE is to eliminate the group of hydroxyethyl or methoxyl in pectinic acid, and generate pectic acid (Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). Meanwhile, PG participates in the generation of galacturonic acid from pectic acid (Nunes, Saraiva, & Coimbra, 2008). Furthermore, β-Gal also acts a main function on the decomposition of pectic substance (Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). β-Gal can catalyze β-1, 4-galactan bond as well as eliminate galactose residue in pectin side chain (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018). The present work demonstrated that, during 0–8 d of storage, the raised activities of PE and PG (Fig. 3B–C) in the pulp of control samples had a clear negative correlation with the declined longan pulp firmness (Fig. 1A) with correlation coefficient r of -0.928 and -0.942, separately. Additionally, they had remarkably positive correlations with the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) with correlation coefficient r of 0.971 and 0.922, separately. Moreover, they had remarkably negative correlations with the decreased amount of pulp CSP (Fig. 2B) with correlation coefficient r of -0.966 and -0.954, separately. Also, they had notably negative correlations with the declined amount of pulp ISP (Fig. 2C) with correlation coefficient r of -0.910 and -0.840, separately. Whereas, they had an obviously positive correlation with the raised amount of pulp WSP (Fig. 2D) with correlation coefficient r of 0.923 and 0.981, separately. During 0–6 d of storage, the raised β-Gal activity (Fig. 3D) in pulp of control samples also had an extremely negative correlation with the declined longan pulp firmness (Fig. 1A), but had a notably positive correlation with the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1), with correlation coefficient r value of -0.954 and 0.984, separately. Meanwhile, it had notably negative correlations with the declined amount of pulp CSP (Fig. 2B) and ISP (Fig. 2C) with correlation coefficient r of -0.995 and -0.856, separately. Whereas, it had an exceedingly positive correlation with the raised amount of pulp WSP (Fig. 2D) with correlation coefficient r value of 0.993. Above data illustrated that the developments of pulp breakdown and pulp softening in harvested fresh longans were connected with the decomposition of polysaccharides in cell wall such as CSP and ISP via the action of β-Gal, PG and PE, which manifested the raised β-Gal, PG and PE activities, the decreased amounts of CSP and ISP, but the raised content of WSP, and consequently manifested the raised index of pulp breakdown and the decreased pulp firmness. These findings accorded with prior investigations, which displayed that the enhancements of β-Gal, PG and PE activities did not help to maintain fruit firmness, but accelerated softening development and reduced the storage quality in postharvest fresh fruits like pears (Chen, Sun et al., 2017), apples (Wei et al., 2010), persimmons (Wang et al., 2020), apricots (Fan et al., 2019) and Younai plums (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018). In addition, contrasted to the control samples, during storage, hydrogen peroxide-treated group maintained higher levels of pulp breakdown index (Supplementary material: Fig. S1), lower pulp firmness (Fig. 1), higher levels of pulp PE, PG, and β-Gal activities (Fig. 3B–D), lower contents of pulp CSP and ISP (Fig. 2B–C), but higher amount of pulp WSP (Fig. 2D). These data indicated that the decreased pulp firmness, the accelerated pulp softening, and pulp breakdown occurrence in hydrogen peroxide-treated longans were result from hydrogen peroxide-promoted decomposition of CSP and ISP via the action of the increased PE, PG and β-Gal activities. Cx is considered to act on the decomposition of hemicelluloses and cellulose (Shi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Xyloglucan belongs to hemicellulose polysaccharide in plant cell wall. XET plays a pivotal function in the disengage of xyloglucan chain linking cellulose micro-fibrils, which can induce the irreparable breakdown of xyloglucan chain, thereby cause the firmness reduction and the softening occurrence in postharvest fresh fruit (Zhong et al., 2008; Zhou, Baumann, Brumer, & Teeri, 2006). Thus, XET also participates in the de-polymerization and decomposition of hemicelluloses and cellulose in harvested fresh fruit during softening development. For control samples, during storage 0–6 d, correlation analyses displayed that the raised activity of pulp Cx (Fig. 3E) showed remarkably negative correlations with the declined contents of pulp cellulose (Fig. 2E) and hemicelluloses (Fig. 2F), with correlation coefficient r of -0.963 and -0.821, separately. Additionally, the raised activity of pulp Cx (Fig. 3E) in control samples exhibited an exceedingly negative correlation with the reduced pulp firmness (Fig. 1A), with correlation coefficient r of -0.995, but had a notably positive correlation with the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1), with correlation coefficient r value of 0.965. Furthermore, during 0–8 d of storage, the raised activity of pulp XET (Fig. 3A) in control samples had notably negative correlations with the declined amounts of pulp cellulose (Fig. 2E) and hemicelluloses (Fig. 2F), with correlation coefficient r of -0.992 and -0.930, separately. Also, it had an exceedingly negative correlation with the declined longan pulp firmness (Fig. 1A) with correlation coefficient r value of -0.960, but had a notably positive correlations with the raised index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) with correlation coefficient r value of 0.981. These data illustrated that the pulp breakdown development and pulp softening in postharvest longans were associated with the de-polymerization and decomposition of hemicelluloses and cellulose via the action of Cx and XET, which displayed raised activities of Cx and XET, the decreased contents of hemicelluloses and cellulose. Above results accorded with previous reports, in which indicated that the raised activities of Cx and XET might result in the de-polymerization and decomposition of cellulose and hemicelluloses, which led to the softening development and firmness reduction in postharvest fresh fruits like blueberries (Chen, Hung et al., 2017), persimmons (Wang et al., 2020), pears (Chen, Sun et al., 2017) and Younai plums (Lin, Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2018). Furthermore, contrasted to the control fruit, during postharvest storage, hydrogen peroxide-treated group maintained higher levels of pulp breakdown index (Supplementary material: Fig. S1), lower pulp firmness (Fig. 1), higher pulp Cx and XET activities (Fig. 3E), lower contents of pulp cellulose and hemicelluloses (Fig. 2E, F). These data indicated that hydrogen peroxide accelerated pulp softening, decreased the pulp firmness and pulp breakdown occurrence in harvested fresh longans, which were associated with hydrogen peroxide-accelerated de-polymerization and decomposition of hemicelluloses and cellulose via the action of enhanced Cx and XET activities."
15,Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the expressions of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling-related genes and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans,"4.3 Hydrogen peroxide-caused alterations in the expressions of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling-related genes and their connections with the pulp breakdown and pulp softening in postharvest longans Apart from the activities of polysaccharides-degrading enzymes in cell wall, the expression levels of corresponding genes are also significant for modulating the structure and composition of cell wall, which influence the tissue softening and firmness of postharvest fresh fruit (Wei et al., 2010). The transcription level of the DlPE, DlPG and Dlβ-Gal is closely associated with PE, PG and β-Gal activity, separately, which may influence the pectic substance decomposition in postharvest fresh fruit (Fan et al., 2018; Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019). DlXET and DlCx may be the main genes adjusting the activity of XET and Cx, separately, which can affect the hemicelluloses and cellulose decomposition in postharvest fresh fruit (Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2019). In addition, DlXET also catalyzes the transglycosylation of xyloglucan (Lin, Lin, Lin et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2008). The present work demonstrated that, contrasted to control samples, hydrogen peroxide-treated longans manifested higher expression levels of DlXET, DlPE, DlPG, Dlβ-Gal and DlCx (Fig. 4A–E), a higher index of pulp breakdown (Supplementary material: Fig. S1) and higher XET, PE, PG, β-Gal and Cx activities (Fig. 3A–E), but lower contents of cell wall polysaccharides composition (Fig. 2A–C, 2E–F). The above data revealed that hydrogen peroxide induced the up-regulated expressions of DlXET, DlPE, DlPG, Dlβ-Gal and DlCx to enhance XET, PE, PG, β-Gal and Cx activities in the pulp of harvested longans, which resulted in the decreased contents of cell wall polysaccharides, in turn, led to the promoted softening, the decreased firmness and the expedited breakdown occurrence in the pulp of harvested fresh longans. Above findings were unanimous with prior investigations, in which reported that the expressions of cell wall polysaccharide-disassembling-related genes (PG, PE, β-Gal and Cx) were associated with the tissue softening and firmness of harvested grapefruit (Shi et al., 2019). Also, these results agreed with the work of Fan et al. (2018), in which reported that the higher expression levels of cell wall polysaccharides-disassembling-related genes like PG, PE, and β-Gal were important for regulating tissue softening and firmness, thereby shortening the shelf life and decreasing marketing acceptance of postharvest apricot. Based on the above findings, the potential mechanism of hydrogen peroxide-expedited pulp softening and pulp breakdown occurrence of longans was illustrated in Fig. 5 , indicating that this process was regulated via the metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides. However, the molecular mechanism of hydrogen peroxide-induced pulp softening and pulp breakdown occurrence of longans is still unclear. Thus, it is necessary to further reveal the molecular mechanism of hydrogen peroxide-induced pulp softening and pulp breakdown occurrence of longans via the analyses of comparative metabolomics and transcriptome. In practice, the treatment of exogenous ROS scavengers, for example, ascorbic acid, L-cysteine hydrochloride or propyl gallate, might be used to suppress ROS production of in harvested fresh longans, and thus, enhance storability of fresh longans and retard longan pulp breakdown occurrence. However, the potential mechanisms of ROS scavengers-suppressing the pulp breakdown development and enhancing the storability of harvested fresh longans should be further investigated."
16,Conclusions,"The treatment of hydrogen peroxide induced the pulp breakdown and reduced the pulp firmness in longans, which were related to the metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides. The decreased firmness and the accelerated breakdown in the pulp of hydrogen peroxide-treated longans were because hydrogen peroxide up-regulated the expression levels of cell wall polysaccharides degradation-related genes (DlXET, DlPE, DlPG, Dlβ-Gal, and DlCx), and enhanced the activities of enzymes-associated with cell wall polysaccharide degradation such as XET, PE, PG, β-Gal and Cx, which could accelerate the decomposition of polysaccharides (CWM, ISP, CSP, hemicellulose, and cellulose) and the damage of structure in longan pulp cell wall, thereby, expedite the decrease of pulp firmness as well as the developments of pulp breakdown and pulp softening in harvested fresh longans."
