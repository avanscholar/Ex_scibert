0,Introduction,"The maximal relative contribution to the total cellular hydrogen peroxide production from various subcellular fractions of rat liver have been approximated as 15%, 45%, 35%, and 5% for mitochondria, microsomes, peroxisomes, and cytosolic enzymes, respectively [1]. Up to 2% of oxygen consumed by rat liver or pigeon heart mitochondria respiring in State 4 is converted to hydrogen peroxide, and this amount is drastically decreased at State 3 or upon uncoupling [2,3]. Thus under certain physiologically relevant conditions mitochondria are thought to contribute significantly to the steady-state level of hydrogen peroxide in cells [4–6]. About half of the total ROS (superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide) produced by heart mitochondria at high NADH/NAD+ ratio can be accounted for as being generated by the respiratory chain components (complex I and complex III) [7,8]. The rest is produced by soluble enzymes of the matrix, mostly by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) [8–11]. Inside-out bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) essentially free of other than the respiratory chain ROS generators catalyze superoxide production during coupled respiration with either NADH or succinate at the rate corresponding to about 0.1% of oxygen consumed by cytochrome oxidase [12]. Inhibitory analysis suggests that the major part of superoxide produced by the respiratory chain (up to 70%) is generated by complex I [12]. Mammalian complex I is a gigantic iron–sulfur-flavo-lipoprotein composed of 44–45 different subunits [13,14] bearing at least ten redox components (FMN, eight iron–sulfur clusters, bound ubiquinone) [15]. As a component of the respiratory chain, the enzyme catalyzes reversible proton-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreduction, thus operating as an energy-transducing device (coupling site 1) [15]. All known redox components are buried in the hydrophilic domain of the enzyme exposed to the matrix space [16,17]. The mechanism of ROS production by complex I is of considerable interest because cellular oxidative stress is conventionally believed to be a major cause of a number of pathologies and the aging process [18–20]. Besides their biomedical importance, studies on ROS production by complex I may provide information on the arrangement and reactivity of its specific redox components. Which particular component(s) in the NADH-ubiquinone region of the respiratory chain directly interact(s) with oxygen is still debated: NAD•-radical [21], FMN [22–25], ubisemiquinone [26], and iron–sulfur clusters N-1a [27] or N-2 [28] have been suggested as the species involved in ROS production. Also, a single site [25], two-sites [29], and dynamically shifted two sites/species [30] models have been proposed by different research groups. An interesting feature of superoxide generation catalyzed by complex I bound to the coupling membrane in the presence of either NADH or succinate (via energy-linked reverse electron transfer) is that the reaction is strongly inhibited if the concentration of NADH increases above “optimal” with an apparent “K i” in the μmolar range [12]. When hydrogen peroxide production was detected as ROS produced by complex I in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD), less inhibition by elevated NADH was observed. We thought that this apparent discrepancy could be explained if both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are produced by complex I, and only the former process is inhibited by high concentrations of NADH. This paper describes experiments supporting this hypothesis. The effects of guanidine, a ligand known to strongly stimulate NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity of the enzyme [31,32] and to increase the flavin radical seen in complex I [33], on ROS production are also described. Possible mechanisms (sites) of complex I-oxygen interaction are discussed."
1,Materials and methods,"Bovine heart SMP were prepared [34], coupled by treatment with oligomycin, and activated [35] according to published protocols. Bovine heart complex I was purified according to Hatefi et al. [36]. All the assays were done at 30°C. Protein content was determined by the biuret procedure. Trypsin-treated SMP were prepared as follows. Ten mg of trypsin was dissolved in 0.5ml of the standard reaction mixture (see below), and 0.44ml of this solution was added to 4ml of SMP (22mg/ml) suspended in the same medium (0.1mg of trypsin per mg of SMP protein). The mixture was incubated on ice for 30min. Trypsin inhibitor (44mg of protein) was then added and incubated for 10min. The mixture was diluted to 80ml, and the SMP were sedimented (1h at 30 000g), washed with 80ml of the standard mixture, suspended in 3ml of the same medium, and stored as 0.25ml samples in liquid nitrogen. Hydrogen peroxide formation was measured photometrically with Amplex Red (20μM) as a formation of resorufin, ε 572 =54mM−1 ∙cm−1 [37], in standard reaction mixture composed of 0.25M sucrose, 50mM Tris-Cl (pH8.0), and 0.2mM EDTA, supplemented with 5μM rotenone (if indicated), horseradish peroxidase (HP, 2 units/ml), and bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD, 6 units/ml). Superoxide production was monitored as SOD-sensitive acetylated cytochrome c (10μM) reduction at 550nm (ε 550 =20mM−1 ∙cm−1) [38]. Increasing cytochrome c concentration up to 30μM did not increase its SOD-sensitive reduction, but it did increase the SOD-insensitive reaction. SOD-insensitive components of acetylated cytochrome c reduction during aerobic oxidation of succinate or NADH were less than 25%. Addition of rotenone decreased the SOD-insensitive fraction of NADH-supported cytochrome c reduction to 5–7%. The amount of H2O2 determined by Amplex Red assay is the sum of the specifically produced H2O2 plus H2O2 resulting from dismutation (SOD-catalyzed and spontaneous) of two specifically produced superoxide radicals. We noted that some samples of HP display superoxide dismutase activity (intrinsic or due to contaminations), which might result in overestimation of the specific H2O2 production if both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide were the reaction products. Thus, the specific hydrogen peroxide-producing activity H2O2(specific) was calculated as follows: H 2 O 2 ( specific ) = H 2 O 2 ( total ) – 2 O 2 • ¯ where H2O2(total) is the amount of hydrogen peroxide assayed with Amplex Red in the presence of SOD, and O 2 • ¯ is the amount of superoxide determined as SOD-sensitive acetylated cytochrome c reduction. It has been shown that under certain conditions HP is capable of NADH oxidation-related ROS production in the process which is prevented by SOD [39]. Thus the experiments were conducted to assure that no undesired, catalyzed by any other than complex I preparation ROS production proceeded during the assays under the conditions employed. Fig. 1A demonstrates that no resorufin formation occurred during assay period unless total (superoxide plus hydrogen peroxide) ROS production was initiated by the addition of SMP. The reaction proceeded as zero-order process and the rates were calculated as the slope of actual tracings. When very low NADH concentrations were used, the registration curve deviated from linearity in time-dependent manner due to NADH decrease and NAD+ increase. However, the initial slope of the actual registration curve could be easily determined if proper amount of the enzyme and time resolution scale were used. Fig. 1B shows analogous representative control experiments where SOD-sensitive acetylated cytochrome c reduction was assayed as a measure of complex I catalyzed superoxide production. NADH:acceptor oxidoreductase activities were determined in the standard reaction mixture supplemented with the proper electron acceptor as a decrease in NADH absorption at 340nm (ε 340 =6.2mM−1 ∙cm−1) or as a decrease in ferricyanide absorption at 420nm (ε 420 =1.0mM−1 ∙cm−1). The specific activities are expressed as 2ē-equivalents, i.e. the amount of NADH oxidized. The results presented are average values of at least three independent assays. Amplex Red was from AnaSpec, Inc. (U.S.A.); fine chemicals: nucleotides; trypsin (type XIII from bovine pancreas); trypsin inhibitor (type II-S from soybean); horseradish peroxidase (type II); SOD from bovine erythrocytes; partially acetylated cytochrome c from equine heart; alcohol dehydrogenase from bakers yeast; Q1; and inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich (U.S.A.). Other chemicals of highest purity available were from local suppliers."
2,Results,
3,Experimental system,"3.1 Experimental system Inside-out bovine heart SMP and complex I purified according to Hatefi's procedure were used throughout this study, and total hydrogen peroxide production in the presence of superoxide dismutase measured by Amplex Red assay or superoxide production measured as SOD-sensitive acetylated cytochrome c reduction were used to quantify the total and particular species of ROS. It has been shown that a considerable fraction of NADH-supported H2O2 formation by permeabilized heart mitochondria can be accounted for by hydrogen peroxide generation by DLDH located in matrix [7,8], hence it seemed worthwhile to determine whether SMP prepared by our routine procedure [34,35] contain any DLDH either as contamination or as intrinsic membrane-bound form of the enzyme. DLDH activity is known to be very sensitive to trypsinolysis [40], and tryptic digestion was used to detect possible presence of DLDH activity in our standard SMP. The data presented in Table 1 show that: (i) SMP indeed contain some lipoamide reductase activity, which was completely destroyed by controlled tryptic digestion; (ii) in the absence of activating ammonium [41], the contribution from DLDH to the NADH-supported hydrogen peroxide formation determined as the activity insensitive to NADH-OH, a specific inhibitor of complex I [42], was less than 10%; (iii) under the conditions employed (see Materials and methods section) tryptic digestion did not significantly affect complex I activity. Separate experiments showed that tryptic digestion resulted in a decrease in coupling efficiency. The respiratory control ratio with NADH as the substrate before and after trypsin treatment was 8.3 and 3.3, respectively. The data shown in Table 1 proved that the standard SMP as prepared in our laboratory are a simple and reliable system for studies on ROS production mediated by the respiratory chain components only. Further experiments were done using the standard SMP (no treatment by trypsin)."
4,H2O2 and O 2 • ¯ generation by membrane-bound and purified complex I,"3.2 H2O2 and O 2 • ¯ generation by membrane-bound and purified complex I The total NADH-supported ROS production catalyzed by rotenone-treated SMP at optimal (for superoxide generation) NADH concentration (50μM) was about 4nmol NADH oxidized/min per mg of protein, the activity corresponding to about 0.25% of their catalytic capacities in the respiratory chain-mediated NADH oxidase activity. The membrane-bound (SMP) and purified complex I were capable of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation, and partitioning of either species was dependent on NADH concentration. Fig. 2 summarizes the data on NADH dependence of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by SMP and purified complex I in the presence of rotenone, conditions where any reduced component of complex I could mediate one- or two-electron reduction of oxygen, except for bulk ubiquinol and N-2-associated semiquinones. The pattern shown in Fig. 2A (superoxide production) agrees with previously reported data [12] on inhibitory effect of high NADH concentrations, whereas essentially no inhibition was seen when hydrogen peroxide production was determined in the same concentration range of NADH (Fig. 2B). The data shown in Fig. 2, panels B and C, may appear contradictory: no hydrogen peroxide formation at NADH concentration below 3μM is documented in panel C, whereas a hyperbola-like curve for the same activity is shown in panel B. This apparent inconsistency is clarified by the more detailed titration pattern for low NADH concentration range as shown in Fig. 3 . At low NADH (≤3μM) only superoxide was produced, whereas more than 60% of the total reaction product appeared as hydrogen peroxide at higher (≥50μM) NADH concentrations. The same pattern was seen for purified complex I (Fig. 2D) suggesting that under the conditions employed no other than complex I enzymes contributed to the overall ROS production by the SMP. Complex I, an intrinsic component of the proton motive force-generating respiratory chain, is capable of rotenone- and uncoupler-inhibited ROS production when bulk ubiquinol provided by complex II during coupled succinate oxidation serves as the substrates for energy-dependent quinol:oxygen oxidoreduction [43] (energy-linked reverse electron transfer [44]). This reaction is of particular interest for studies on complex I-catalyzed ROS production because it proceeds under conditions where the active FMN-containing substrate-binding site of the enzyme is free of nucleotides. Table 2 shows relative contribution of the reaction products to ROS formation during coupled respiration with succinate and NADH. Both superoxide (about 65%) and hydrogen peroxide (about 35%) were produced during the reverse operation of complex I (line 1). An improvement in coupling efficiency by BSA significantly increased, as expected, total ROS production and, more interestingly, changed the proportion between the reaction products (line 2). Almost the same total ROS production was seen during succinate- (reverse) and NADH-supported (forward) operation of complex I (line 2 and 3). Rotenone stimulated the NADH-supported reaction and also increased the relative contribution of hydrogen peroxide. A general pattern emerging from the data shown in Table 2 is that the higher reduction level of complex I was reached the higher the rate of total ROS production was seen and the larger relative contribution of hydrogen peroxide was observed."
5,Redox titration of NADH-supported ROS generation,"3.3 Redox titration of NADH-supported ROS generation To gain further insight into quantitative aspects H2O2 and O 2 • ¯ as the reaction product, the specific rates of generation of each species as a function of NAD+/NADH ratio were measured (Fig. 4 ). The optimal (for superoxide production) concentration of (NAD+ + NADH) pool (50μM, see Fig. 2A) was used in the titration experiments. H2O2 production was significantly more sensitive to an increase in NAD+/NADH ratio than that of superoxide formation: half-maximal rates of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide were observed at NAD+/NADH ratios of 0.13 and 0.33, respectively. The titration curve for H2O2 production satisfactory fitted the Nernst equation corresponding to apparent midpoint potential of a two-electron donor with midpoint potential of −347mV (Fig. 4A, closed circles). The titration curve for superoxide production could not be fitted by the Nernst equation (Fig. 4B, closed circles). Note should be made that the data shown in Fig. 4 are certainly not classical redox titration curves. The dissociation constants for oxidized and reduced NAD binding to the oxidized and reduced enzyme are the parameters that, in addition to true redox equilibrium, determine the concentration of the enzyme capable of uni- or divalent reoxidation by oxygen. These binding constants were shown to be dependent on the reduction of the enzyme [45]."
6,Effect of guanidine on complex I-mediated ROS production,"3.4 Effect of guanidine on complex I-mediated ROS production We have claimed previously that guanidine increases NADH-supported superoxide production [12] similar to its stimulatory effect on the NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity [31,32]. This phenomenon was further investigated. Three-fold increase in NADH-supported superoxide production by complex I in SMP was observed at high (saturating) guanidine chloride concentration (Fig. 5A). An increase in ROS production depends hyperbolically on guanidine concentrations with half-maximal stimulation at 20mM (results not shown). Three samples of guanidine chloride obtained from different suppliers showed identical effects. The stimulation was not due to the well-known general chaotropic properties of guanidine salts: guanidine isothiocyanate showed the same effect as did the chloride salt. A guanidine derivative, metformin, an antidiabetic drug that is known to inhibit complex I activity [46] at 50mM concentration, showed only weak (1.4-fold) stimulation on the NADH-supported superoxide production catalyzed by the membrane-bound complex I (SMP) in the presence of rotenone. Guanidine changed neither overall NADH oxidase nor NADH:quinone reductase activities, whereas it altered complex I reactivity with artificial electron acceptors and oxygen (Table 3 ). It inhibited NADH:HAR reductase and stimulated ferricyanide reduction and ROS production. The same stimulation (3-fold) of ferricyanide and oxygen univalent reduction was evident, whereas a smaller increase in H2O2 production (1.5-fold) was observed (Table 3 and Fig. 5). We were unable to evaluate the effect of guanidine on rotenone-sensitive succinate-supported ROS production (reverse electron transfer) because guanidine strongly inhibited aerobic succinate-supported NAD+ reduction catalyzed by tightly coupled SMP. The latter phenomenon was, at least partially, due to the inhibitory effect of guanidine on succinate oxidase (Table 3, line 7). Next the effect of guanidine on superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by purified complex I at various NADH concentrations was tested (Fig. 6A–C). Both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide production were stimulated by guanidine. Only superoxide formation was analyzed by the standard kinetic approach, i.e. double-reciprocal plot constructed for very low concentrations of NADH (ascending parts of the curves shown in Fig. 6A). The linear dependencies shown in Fig. 6B suggest that guanidine increased the maximal rate without notable effect on apparent K m NADH. No such simple analysis could be done for hydrogen peroxide formation because the dependence on NADH was not hyperbolic, as is shown in Fig. 3. Finally, the effect of guanidine on the redox dependence of ROS production was assessed (Fig. 4, A and B, open symbols). Guanidine shifted the redox titration curves for both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation to more positive apparent redox potentials. Half-maximal rates of ROS production in the presence of guanidine were at NAD+/NADH ratios of 0.42 for H2O2 and 2.54 for O 2 • ¯ production versus 0.13 for H2O2 and 0.33 for O 2 • ¯ production in the absence of guanidine."
7,Discussion,
8,Experimental system,"4.1 Experimental system The specific activities reported in numerous publications on the mitochondrial ROS production determined either on protein or particular component content basis are highly variable. Besides natural species and tissue specificity [47–49], the type of preparation used for the assays seems to be important. Several experimental systems for studies of ROS generation by complex I are available. Isolated mitochondria generate H2O2 in State 4, i.e. under conditions when the intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotide pool is highly reduced. Quantitative analysis of complex I-mediated superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by intact mitochondria is hampered by the presence of glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins, glutathione peroxidase system, and catalase in the matrix space [50,51]. Also, as noted above, matrix located dehydrogenases, particularly DLDH [7,9–11], significantly contribute to the overall mitochondrial ROS production. Purified preparations of complex I [36,52,53] seem much better suited for studies on its catalytic, particularly ROS-generating activity. However, no simple techniques are available to impose proton motive force for simulation of “physiologically” relevant conditions when purified detergent-dispersed complexes I are used. Also, the detergents used for purification of complex I may alter its catalytic activities [54,55]. To compromise between extremely complex (mitochondria) and simplest well defined (purified complex I) experimental systems, inside-out coupled SMP [34,35] are routinely used in our studies on complex I. Here we showed that our “standard” SMP retain some DLDH activity (Table 1), despite extensive dilution, washing, and Sephadex column filtration during the preparation. This finding is indicative of the presence of membrane-bound DLDH in mitochondria. SMP-bound hydrogen peroxide generating activity was increased 5-fold by ammonium (Table 1), this being qualitatively similar to the phenomenon previously described for the soluble enzyme [11,41]. Whether other properties of the membrane-bound DLDH are the same as those of free soluble protein remains to be established. SMP completely devoid of DLDH activity can be easily prepared (Table 1) and used for DLDH reconstitution studies, which are currently underway in our laboratory. In the absence of activating ammonium, the contribution of other than complex I generating sources to the overall production catalyzed by either standard or trypsin-treated SMP was less than 10% as evident from 90% inhibition by complex I-specific NADH-OH (Table 1)."
9,Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide generation by complex I,"4.2 Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide generation by complex I Both, H2O2 and O 2 • ¯ are produced by complex I, and the partitioning of the reaction products depends on NADH concentration (Fig. 2). Only superoxide was generated by the membrane-bound and purified complex I at low NADH (1–3μM) in a reaction with apparent K m NADH of 0.5μM (data for purified complex I, Fig. 6B), a value that is significantly higher than that (0.05μM, at pH7.5, 32°C) reported for superoxide production by bovine heart complex I purified by a different isolation procedure [24]. Since the rate of ROS production by complex I is much slower than the enzyme capacity in reactions with electron acceptors other than oxygen, it is safe to assume that all its redox components are in true equilibrium during steady-state NADH:oxygen oxidoreduction. The apparent Km for the substrate-electron donor in the reaction catalyzed by any oxidoreductase that contain several linearly arranged redox components depends on thermodynamic gap between the primary electron acceptor and the component reacting with the substrate-oxidant; the larger the gap is, the lower K m is expected to be [56]. Very low apparent K m NADH in ROS generation [24, this paper] as compared with those reported for reactions with other artificial electron acceptors [43] suggests that a component with significantly more positive potential than that of the primary acceptor (FMN) is the actual donor for one-electron reduction of oxygen. The data on the redox titration of superoxide production (Fig. 4B) show that a substantial rate (about 20% of the maximal) was observed at NAD+/NADH ratio as high as 10:1, corresponding to the ambient redox potential of −290mV at pH8.0. This value is much higher than that for the FMN/FMN– couple (about −370mV at pH8.0) in complex I [33]. At present, we are unable to unambiguously identify a component responsible for superoxide production. The iron–sulfur center N-2 seems to be a likely candidate in light of the large thermodynamic gap between the primary electron acceptor (FMN) and the final electron donor (see above). An obvious question arises: what is the explanation for the inhibitory effect of high NADH concentrations on superoxide production if the iron–sulfur cluster located far away from NADH binding site [16,17] is the electron donor? It has been shown recently that eukaryotic complexes I bear an allosteric nucleotide (ATP)-binding site that, when filled, strongly stimulates NADH:HAR reductase activity [57]. We hypothesized that binding of ATP at this site modulates the redox potential of iron–sulfur center N-2 and/or its accessibility for HAR [57] (see a different interpretation of the phenomenon in Ref. [58]). The stimulatory effect of ATP is completely eliminated by increased concentration of NADH, thus suggesting that NADH can bind to complex I at a site different from its conventional “substrate-binding site”. Filling of this “allosteric site” by NADH may alter the redox potential and/or accessibility of N-2 to oxygen. Interestingly, ferricyanide reductase activity of Paracoccus denitrificans NDH-1, a prokaryotic homolog of complex I that is devoid of the allosteric nucleotide binding site [57], shows only weak inhibition by NADH [59]. The proposal on center N-2 as the source of superoxide is in apparent contradiction with the data of Galkin and Brandt, who have shown that a mutation of Yarrowia lipolytica complex I that eliminated the N-2 EPR signal did not inhibit its superoxide generating activity [60]. It should be noted that the mutation may make N-2 EPR-silent though still capable of oxygen reactivity. Also, other than N-2 iron–sulfur center(s), except, perhaps, N-1a with much lower midpoint redox potential [61], can be considered as the potential source of superoxide following the reasoning discussed above. The kinetics and “thermodynamics” of hydrogen peroxide generation were different from those of superoxide production. The difference can be summarized as follows. (i) H2O2 is formed at substantially higher NADH concentrations, and sigmoidal dependence on the substrate concentration is evident (Fig. 3) with half-maximal activity at 25μM (compare with apparent K m NADH of 0.5μM in superoxide production in Fig. 6B). (ii) In contrast to superoxide, hydrogen peroxide generation is essentially insensitive to high NADH concentration. This finding agrees poorly with the proposed explanation of the inhibitory effect of NADH on ROS production as shielding of the enzyme reactive center (presumably FMNH–) by bound nucleotide, thus decreasing its oxygen accessibility [62]. (iii) The redox titration of NADH-supported H2O2 production (Fig. 4A) is well fitted to a Nernst equation for a two-electron/one proton oxidoreduction with ambient (NAD+/NADH) midpoint potential of −347mV at pH8.0, a value substantially more negative than that for superoxide production (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that FMNH− was suggested as the site of superoxide, not hydrogen peroxide, production by the bovine heart complex I purified by an alternative procedure [52]. This proposal was based on the redox profile of superoxide generation fitted to the Nernst equation with ambient (NAD+/NADH) midpoint potential of approximately −360mV at pH8.0 (see Fig. 5 in Ref [24]). Also, it has been noted, in apparent contradiction with the data reported here, that purified bovine heart complex I generates 95% ROS as superoxide, whereas E. coli NDH-1, the prokaryotic homolog of complex I, produces 20% O 2 • ¯ and 80% H2O2 during NADH-supported ROS generation [63]. The reasons for different results reported here and those obtained by others are not clear. Different experimental systems were used: bovine heart SMP and traditional complex I (this paper) and detergent-dispersed pure complex I [24] and SMP [25] prepared by an alternative procedure. Another, perhaps more significant, difference is that ROS production by SMP only at low concentration of NADH (30μM) was analyzed by Pryde and Hirst [25], whereas partitioning of the products depends on NADH concentration (Fig. 2C and D). Both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide productions are sensitive to NAD+ [12] and NAD+/NADH ratio ([8,22,24,25,27] and this paper). On the other hand, NADH oxidase activity catalyzed by complex I is only weakly inhibited (competitively) by NAD+ ( K i NAD + is in millimolar range [43]). A plausible explanation for this apparent discrepancy most likely rests upon overall kinetics of NADH:ubiquinone reduction in the respiratory chain catalyzed by complex I. Reoxidation of iron–sulfur center N-2 is evidently the rate-limiting step during the coupled or uncoupled steady-state NADH oxidase reaction [21,35]. As expected from the redox gap between the FMN/FMNH– and N-2ox/N-2red couples, the N-2 center remains mostly in the reduced form even when FMN is substantially oxidized (by the NAD+/NADH couple), and the activities where FMNH− directly participates are inhibited. In summary, we interpret our data on ROS production by complex I either in forward or reverse electron transfer as the presence of at least two different sites directly reacting with oxygen in complex I located upstream of the rotenone sensitive site: Site 1, most likely fully reduced FMN where oxygen reduction via a two-electron mechanism results in hydrogen peroxide formation, and Site 2, one of the iron–sulfur centers, most likely N-2, where one-electron reduction results in superoxide production. Short note concerning physiological relevance of the data reported worth noting. The concentration of NADH required for half-maximal ROS production (0.5μM and 25μM for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, respectively) are well below the physiologically relevant values. An average content of NADH+NAD+ in heart mitochondria is in a range of 5–7nmol/mg of protein [64–66], the values corresponding to 5–7mM concentration in matrix (assuming 1mg of protein corresponds to approximately 1μl of water [67,68]). Although substantial part of this nucleotide pool may be bound to matrix located dehydrogenase it seems certain that complex I in intact mitochondria is always saturated by either NADH or NAD+. Since superoxide production is inhibited by high physiologically relevant concentrations of NADH and/or NAD+ ([12], this paper), hydrogen peroxide is expected to be the predominant species of ROS generated by complex I."
10,Stimulation of ROS production by guanidine,"4.3 Stimulation of ROS production by guanidine Guanidine has long been known to modulate catalytic activities of complex I [31,32]. In this study, we confirmed the opposite effects of guanidine on HAR (inhibition) and ferricyanide (activation) reductase activities catalyzed by membrane-bound complex I (Table 3), whereas no significant effects on other major catalytic activities, NADH oxidase and quinone reductase, were found. Both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by complex I was activated by guanidine (Table 3). Only the maximal rate was increased with no change in Km NADH when the superoxide production rate hyperbolic dependence on NADH was measured (Fig. 6B). The redox titration curve in the presence of guanidine was shifted to more positive ambient redox potential set up by NAD+/NADH ratio for hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4A and B). This can be interpreted as an increase in the redox potential of the FMN/FMNH– couple resulting from interaction of reduced flavin anion with guanidine cation, as discussed by Sled et al. [33], assuming that FMNH– is the electron donor for hydrogen peroxide production. The stimulatory effect of guanidine on ferricyanide reduction can be explained by an increase in semiquinone fraction observed upon redox titration of complex I [33] if flavin semiquinone participates during the steady-state ferricyanide reduction. Direct interaction of oxygen with complex I is likely a “leakage” reaction, so no specific channels created during evolution to facilitate the accessibility of the enzyme redox component to oxygen exist in the protein structure, in contrast to true oxidases [69,70] or oxygen carrying proteins [71,72]. The existence of at least two leakage “sites” producing different products (H2O2 and O 2 • ¯ ) as evident from the data reported here is not unexpected. Accumulated evidence strongly suggest that FMN is one such site. The reduction of flavin in a FP fragment [73] and in membrane-bound complex I [74] results in drastic change of its binding to the protein, leading to dissociation if the system is properly diluted. Redox-dependent rearrangement of FMN may serve as a driving force for long-distance conformational change of the entire structure of complex I that would change accessibility of iron–sulfur clusters for oxygen that diffuses through the protein. The conformational flexibility of complex I structure is well documented [75–77]."
