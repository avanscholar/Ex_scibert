0,Introduction,"Among all the alternative sources of energy, hydrogen is considered to be one of the best energy carrier. It can be used as a fuel in internal combustion engine or to generate electricity using a fuel cell. At present, hydrogen is produced efficiently in large scale by reforming of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and hydrocarbons of low carbon number [1,2]. Three processes are in use, viz, steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and oxidative reforming [3,4]. The oxidative reforming process which is a combination of endothermic steam reforming (SR) and exothermic catalytic partial oxidation reactions, offers many advantages from the economic and the technical point of view that are not readily available in other two processes. Moreover, the combination of these reactions can improve the reactor temperature control and reduce the formation of hot spots, avoiding catalyst deactivation by sintering or carbon deposition. All these advantages make oxidative steam reforming process suitable for small or medium-scale hydrogen generators. The fuel processor based on this technology is less externally energy-intensive, cost effective and response-dynamic [5–8]. Non- conventional techniques, viz, hydrogen production utilizing solar energy are also being investigated but their commercialization in near future seem unlikely. For the success of hydrogen economy, it is therefore essential that apart from natural gas and naphtha, cheap sources should be explored and suitable technologies be developed. Keeping this in view conversion of heavier hydrocarbons to hydrogen is being investigated across the world. Subramaniana et al. [9] reported the catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons mixtures. The hydrocarbons mixtures comprised of n-octane, i-octane, n-decane, n-hexadecane and naphthalene. They have reported that overall reactivity of these mixtures is not simply an average over the reactivities of constituent molecules. i-Octane is more reactive than n-octane in the mixture at all C/O feed ratios, n-decane is more reactive than n-hexadecane in the mixture only at ratios leaner than the syngas stoichiometry (based on the mixture) and this trend reverses as the C/O feed ratio increases. They also reported that addition of 10 mol% naphthalene to n-decane reduces the reforming efficiency. Kang et al. [10] have reported that in oxidative reforming process the conversion was much lower for aromatics than paraffins with same carbon number because aromatics have more stable structures than paraffins. Also at the same reforming conditions and the performance of poly-aromatics was the worst of all the hydrocarbons used. Hydrogen generation from oxidative steam reforming (OSR), of diesel over molybdenum carbide catalyst at 1158 K has been reported in the literature [11]. It was reported that degree of deactivation due to benzo-thiophene was dependent on the sulfur concentration. They also reported that sulfur poisoning was reversible because regeneration with H2 gases restored catalytic activity of deactivated OSR catalysts. Shekhawat et al. [12] reported the catalytic partial oxidation of n-tetradecane in the presence of sulfur and polynuclear aromatics over three catalysts (Rh/Ce0.56 Zr0.44 O2, Pt/Ce0.56 Zr0.44 O2 and Pt/Al2O3) in a fixed-bed catalytic reactor. They observed that dibezothiophene (1000 ppmw) and 1-methyl-naphthalene (5wt%) decreased hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields. The activities of all the catalysts were partially restored after removing the sulfur compound or aromatics from the feed. Yoon et al. [13] reported the effect of ethylene on carbon formation in diesel reforming. They reported C2H4 was clearly associated with carbon deposition. They have concluded that olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons were the main coke precursors. Kaila et al. [14] reported the oxidative reforming of simulated fuels n-heptane, n-dodecane, toluene, and methylcyclohexane on zirconia-supported Rh and Pt catalysts. They reported that aliphatic hydrocarbons were more reactive than aromatics and oxidative reforming of fuels operated at high temperatures (1173–1273 K) promoted thermal cracking. In the present work we report hydrogen production from vacuum residue (vacuum residue is the crude oil fraction which can not be distilled under vacuum condition and is the bottom product of vacuum distillation column). Vacuum residue could also be a suitable choice for its conversion to hydrogen. Vacuum residue is often used without further treatment as fuel oil or for the production of asphalt [15,16]. The main building blocks which are combined to give the high boiling point compounds in residue are divided into hydrocarbon, heteroatomic, and asphaltene groups. Hydrocarbon groups include aromatic (benzene, naphthalene), hydroaromatic (tetralin), naphthenes (decalin), and paraffin (long chain alkane). Heteroatomic groups contain sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and metal atoms [17,18]. None of the catalytic processes (steam reforming, partial oxidation, oxidative steam reforming, etc.) can be applied probably because of high aromaticity of residue which are coke precursors and forms coke at a temperature (∼ 673 K) much lower that the temperature required for any of the catalytic process (1073–1173 K) to take place for hydrogen production. In the literature, steam gasification of vacuum residue has been described at high temperature (1573–1773 K) [19]. To the best of our knowledge there is no other reported work on the conversion of vacuum residue to hydrogen. Because of complexity, the gasification process does not appear suitable for in-situ generation in small and medium installations (3–5 M3/h). We report a different strategy for small-scale production of hydrogen from vacuum residue in two steps. In the first step the vacuum residue has been partially oxidized and cracked in the liquid phase with ozone at 373–423 K. Ozone being an extremely strong oxidizing agent, cleaves and oxidizes benzene and other aromatic structures including PAHs. Alkenes can also be oxidized with ozone to form alcohol, carbonyl, aldehyde or ketone, or carboxylic acid through formation of molonozide [20,21]. Thus, the ozonation reduces the concentration of aromatics and olefins which are known to be coke precursors. In the second step cracked and oxidized product is converted to hydrogen by oxidative steam reforming process using a catalyst."
1,Experimental,"In the present study, the vacuum residue having the characteristics as shown in Table 1 was used."
2,Step-I Liquid phase oxidation of vacuum residue,"2.1 Step-I Liquid phase oxidation of vacuum residue The liquid phase oxidation of vacuum residue was carried out in a batch process. One hundred ml of vacuum residue was taken into a 500 ml pyrex glass round bottom flask which was placed inside a heating mantle. The desired temperature was maintained through an on-off controller. The reaction temperature was measured with a thermocouple sliding inside a thermocouple well provided in the flask. Ozone was bubbled continuously. Ozone was generated in-situ by subjecting air to a high intensity low wavelength UV radiation. The concentration of generated ozone was 1.2 mg/m3. The reaction was carried out at two different temperatures, i.e. 373 and 423 K and two different ozonation times, viz, 5 & 10 h. Subsequent to the oxidation reaction, the residue was vacuum distilled (∼10−2 bar). The distillation was stopped when waxy substances start appearing in the distillate. The distillation temperature was ∼323 K at the beginning whereas it reached 473∼K at the end of the distillation. For a 100 ml of vacuum residue, a 40 ± 2 ml clear distillate was obtained. Under the same condition, untreated vacuum residue yielded approximately 10 ml of clear distillate which was used as reference for comparison with oxidized distillate. The reference was assigns as sample 1 and ozone oxidized vacuum residue samples at 373 K for 5 and10 h and at 423 K for 5 and10 h were assigned as sample 2, 3, 4 & 5 respectively. The temperature and time of ozone oxidation corresponding to samples are shown in Table 2 . 2.1.1 Analysis of samples Elemental analyses of the reference and oxidized vacuum residue samples have been obtained by a Perkin Elmer CHN analyzer for C, H and N analysis and Optim’X X-ray analyzer for Ni, V and S analysis. Samples were analyzed using Varian Saturn 2000 GC/MS system for identification of compounds. A Wcot fused silica column of length 30 m was used for the separation. The oven temperature program consisted of start up at 308 K (0.5 min) ramp at 20 K/min to 373 K, hold at 373 K for 15 min, again ramp at 1 K/min to 403 K, temperature hold at 403 K for 20 min, then ramp at 2 K/min to 513 K and hold for 40 min. The total analysis time was 168.75 min. The injector temperature was 573 K and high-purity He gas was used as the carrier at a constant flow of 1 ml min−1. The trap temperature was kept at 543 K during analysis. Ionization was realized by electron impact mode. For the product identification, mass detection was performed in mass/charge ratio ranging from 40 to 650. Identification was carried out by comparing the mass spectra, with those from the library of mass spectra (NIST 98, HP Mass Spectral Libraries, 1998). Calorific values were measured using a bomb calorimeter (make Rajdhani Scientific Institute Co., India Model RSB3). ASTM distillations were carried out under atmospheric pressure up to 673 K. For comparison, ASTM distillation of diesel sample was carried out. The functional groups in samples were determined out using FTIR (make Thermoelectron, USA model Nicolet 5700) fitted with a multi bounce attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. Analyses were carried out at room temperature in mid IR range of 4000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Subtraction spectrum of a sample was obtained through omnic software by subtraction of spectrum of reference that of the sample. From this subtraction spectrum it was possible to find out additional peaks appearing on various treatments of the residue."
3,Step-II Oxidative steam reforming,"2.2 Step-II Oxidative steam reforming 2.2.1 Catalyst preparation A high surface area aluminum hydroxide gel was prepared by neutralizing a concentrated solution of aluminum nitrate with ammonia at pH 9 and temperature 303 K. The hydro gel was aged for 24 h and then washed with distilled water until it was free of nitrate ions. Finally, it was dried in oven at 383 K for 8 h and calcined at 1073 K for 8 h to obtain γ-Al2O3 support. The γ-Al2O3 support was crushed and sieved to a particle size 0.20 mm. The lanthanum promoter was introduced into alumina by impregnating alumina with the requisite amount of a dilute aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate [La(NO3)3.6H2O, 99.0% (Central Drug House(P)ltd.] to yield 3 wt. % La2O3 in the final catalyst. This concentration was selected as it has been reported to be optimal in stabilizing the surface area of alumina against sintering [22]. The mixture was then dried over a water bath with continuous stirring and finally dried in oven at 383 K for 8 h and calcined at 1073 K for 8 h. Ceria was then incorporated into lanthana-supported alumina by impregnation with the requisite amount of a dilute solution of Cerium (IV) sulfate tetrahydrate (99+ % Acros Organic) to obtain solids containing 9 wt. % CeO2. Solution of Cerium (IV) sulfate was prepared in concentrated nitric acid. The mixture was then dried over a water bath with continuous stirring and then dried in oven at 383 K for 8 h and subsequently calcined at 873 K for 8 h. Platinum was then incorporated in the stabilized alumina–lanthana–ceria (A–L–C) support. Platinum (2% wt.) was introduced by wet impregnation using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (41.29% Johnson Matthey) in appropriate amount. The mass was dried at 353 K at water bath with continuous stirring and then in oven at 383 K for 8 h and calcined at 873 K for 8 h. 2.2.2 Catalytic activity test Fig. 1 shows the experimental set up used in the present study for the catalytic oxidative steam reforming of sample 3. As discussed below sample 3 had the highest percentage of oxygenated products. All the experiments were performed in a tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 30 mm and length 800 mm). The reactor was kept inside a temperature- controlled tubular electric furnace (Thermolyne, USA 79300). Oxygen and water were added to the Sample 3 into a reactor. Sample 3 and water were injected through calibrated pumps (make-Fluid Metering Inc, USA, Model RHSY) at constant flow rate while oxygen was supplied through a pressurized tank and its flow rate was controlled using a mass flow controller. Double distilled water was used in all the experiments. The water at a calculated rate first entered a pre-vaporizer, kept at a temperature of 423 K approximately. Oxygen also entered the pre-vaporizer. The steam generated was swept away by the oxygen to the reactor and entered at the top. The sample also entered into the reactor at the top. The reactor was filled with inert alumina particles of size 3–4 mm and catalyst were placed on upper most part of the alumina bed. In each test, 1.4 g of fresh catalyst sample was used. The catalyst particles was of size ∼ 4 mm. Catalyst bed was diluted with Al2O3 dp ∼ 4 mm (Al2O3/Catalyst = 6vol) to avoid preferential gas flow path and hot spot in the catalytic bed. Height of the inert alumina particles bed was 200 mm and that of catalyst bed was 40 mm. Before introducing the sample, the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 623 K with 20 ml/min hydrogen flow for 4 h. The temperature of the catalytic bed was monitored with a thermocouple sliding inside a thermocouple well into the catalytic bed. All the data were collected when the temperature reached a steady state value (±5 K). The product gas was allowed to flow through to a water condenser and the flow rate was measured by a wet gas flow meter. The product gas from the condenser was analyzed using an Orsat apparatus for CO, CO2, and O2. A Nucon make GC was used to analyze the gas for H2 and CH4 and other hydrocarbons. Condensates from the reactor were also analyzed by GC. It was observed that in all the experimental runs the condensate contained negligible amount of unconverted hydrocarbons. Therefore the amount of hydrocarbons in the condensate has not been taken into account in subsequent calculations. The % conversion was calculated from the carbon in feed and product gas using the following equation (1) (1) % c o n v e r s i o n = Total number of carbon in CO , CO 2 and CH 4 in product Carbon number in sample"
4,Results and discussion,
5,GCMS analysis,"3.1 GCMS analysis The results of GCMS analysis of different samples are reported in Tables 3 and 4 . The wt % of different types of hydrocarbons is reported in Table 3. The compounds were also categorizing into different carbon number ranges i.e. C5–C10, C11–C15 and C15+ groups with carbon number 5 to 10, 11 to 15 and greater than 15 respectively. Further in each category, the compounds were grouped as aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic. Though some of the heterocyclic compounds (O atom present in ring) are aromatic but during the analysis we consider them as heterocyclic compounds. The identified compound was also analyzed according oxygenated and non-oxygenated compounds. The oxygenated compound were seen to contain different functional groups i.e. alcohol, carbonyl, ether, ester etc.. The relative mass percentage of the individual compound was calculated assuming the same response factor in GCMS, because all the compounds are hydrocarbon and partially oxidized hydrocarbon. An analysis of the table reveals that in ozone oxidized samples (2, 3, 4 & 5) wt% of C15+ aromatic has reduced to zero. The most significant new feature is the formation of heterocyclic compounds which were absent in the reference (sample 1). The data from Table 3 also show that due to ozone oxidation the decrease in wt % of C15+ aromatic is accompanied by the formation of the low molecular aromatic C11–C15 and heterocyclic compounds. It is also observed that ozonation temperature and the time both have significant influences on the product profile. From the results it is seen that ozonation at 423 K is not as effective as 373 K. Since ozonation at 423 K seen to be slow, the effect of time at this temperature (compare samples 4 and 5) is not very significant. It is observed that aromatic content is minimum and the concentration of heterocyclic compounds is maximum when the reaction was carried out at 373 K for 10 h. It is in order to mention that for the reaction time beyond 10 h no significant change in product profile was observed. Also because the residue was highly viscous, it was not becoming possible to bubble ozone at a low temperatures. Table 4 lists the wt % of compounds with different oxygen containing functional groups in samples (2, 3, 4 & 5). Form the Table 4 it is again observed that at the reaction temperature of 373 K and reaction time of 10 h the wt% of oxygen containing compounds is as high as 86%. Any increases in the reaction temperature results in decreases in the weight percent. Therefore, high temperature ozonation of vacuum residue is seem to be non-advantageous as it increases the wt% of aromatics as well as wt% of oxygen containing compound are also less. It is further observed that when the reaction time is increased the weight percent of compounds containing alcohol groups decreases and that of carbonyl containing group increases. Therefore, it is concluded that the ozone oxidation of vacuum residue at 373 K results in the reduction of aromatics compounds and the formation of oxygenated compounds."
6,FTIR analysis,"3.2 FTIR analysis Fig. 2 is a representative subtraction spectrum of the sample 3. Subtraction spectrum of sample 3 was obtained through omnic software by subtraction of spectrum of sample 1 from that of the sample. The various bands and corresponding function groups that appeared on treatment of vacuum residue with ozone have been summarized in Table 5 . The most remarkable feature of the spectrum is the appearance of a broad carbonyl > CO band centered at 1712 and 1770 cm−1. The band at 1712 and 1770 cm−1 are not exclusively associated to the carbonyl groups; it may also be due to carboxyl group [23,24]. The band around 1400 cm−1 may correspond to the –O–H bending vibration of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The strong band at about 1165 cm−1 is compatible with C–O single-bond stretching vibration from γ and δ lactone groups, aromatic and aliphatic ether, and phenols and epoxide structures. The observed distinct broad band at 3382 cm−1 attributes to O–H stretching. The band at about 1047 cm−1 is compatible with SO stretching vibration of sulphoxide structures. The details of result of analysis can be found elsewhere [25]. There we have reported that increasing the ozonation time at 373 K temperature results into changes in the intensities of the observed peaks. On increasing the ozonation time from 5 to 10 h intensities ratio of –O–H to > CO band decrease from 1.66 to 0.95. The decrease in the intensity of the peaks indicates a significantly increased content of carbonyl or carboxylic groups in the sample when time of ozonation increases from 5 to 10 h. It has been also concluded that on ozonation of vacuum residue, first hydroxyl groups are formed which subsequently converts to carbonyl or carboxylic groups. The observation of FTIR supports the conclusion drawn on sample 3 on the basis of GCMS analysis."
7,Elemental analyses,"3.3 Elemental analyses The results of elemental analysis of the samples (1 and 3) are shown in Table 5. The weight percent of oxygen was obtained by difference. The results show significant change in the concentration of oxygen on ozonation. It is also observed that the weight percentages of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur have decreased. The result in the Table 5 clearly shows that the ozonation has resulted into partial oxidation of vacuum residue. Reduction in Ni and V content on ozonation is also observed. It is likely that these metals are associated with heavier molecules which largely remain as residue after ozonation and vacuum distillation (Table 6 )."
8,Calorific value measurements,"3.4 Calorific value measurements The calorific values of sample 1 and 3 were measured as 42.0 and 40.3 kJ/g, respectively. The calorific value of sample 3 is nearly 4% lower than that of sample 1. It is known that partially oxidized hydrocarbons will have lower calorific values compared to hydrocarbons of same carbon number. Therefore the lowering of calorific value is attributed to the partial oxidation of vacuum residue as a result of ozonation."
9,ASTM distillation,"3.5 ASTM distillation Fig. 3 shows the ASTM distillation curves of diesel and sample 3. The initial boiling point of sample 3 is 453 K whereas it is 408 K for diesel. Further up to 573 K 50% of sample 3 gets distilled whereas it is 65% for diesel. It is known that boiling point of hydrocarbon is related with number of carbon in hydrocarbon. As sample 3 contains partially oxidized hydrocarbons also, therefore, a strict comparison may not be possible. However from Fig. 3 it may be concluded that the carbon number of hydrocarbons present in sample 3 corresponds to that of a commercial grade diesel. This observation is significant as it shows that ozonation has resulted into cracking of large hydrocarbons to partly oxidized hydrocarbons having carbon no. as that of commercial grade diesel. It is in order to mention that the breaking of aromatic ring due to ozonation has been reported in the literature [26]. It has been reported that attack of the ozone molecule first leads to the formation of hyroxylated by-products. These hydroxylated compounds are highly susceptible to further ozonation and form of quinoid and subsequently, due to the opening of the aromatic ring form aliphatic products with carbonyl and carboxyl functional group(s). A scheme of ozonation of aromatic is shown in Fig. 4 ."
10,Oxidative steam reforming,"3.6 Oxidative steam reforming The oxidative steam reforming study of sample 3 was carried out at various temperatures with the constant fed rate of reactant (S/C = 4 and O2/C = 0.4) at weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.27 h−1. Where S/C and O2/C is steam to carbon and oxygen to carbon molar ratio. The concentrations of product gases are shown in Fig. 5 . For all conditions examined, the equilibrium mixture comprised primarily of species–hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. No CO was detected in present experimental condition. Sample 3 contains 86% oxygenated hydrocarbons may attribute to the above fact. The other species were present at mole levels less than 1 × 10−5 mol corresponding to less than 0.001 ppm. It is observed that the concentration of hydrogen and CO2 increases while CH4 decreases as the reforming temperature increases from 973 to 1173 K. It may conclude that water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is activated with increasing reaction temperature over 973 K and both the reforming and the WGSR occur simultaneously. This allows produced CH4 to react with steam, increasing production of hydrogen. On further increase of reaction temperature from 1173 to 1273 K concentration of hydrogen drops slightly from 72 to 70%. The slight decrease in H2 concentration may be due to a reverse water gas shift reaction. The characteristic result obtained at 1173 K at which maximum concentration of hydrogen obtained. The above mentioned results led us to study durability of catalyst for the oxidative steam reforming of sample 1(reference material) and sample 3. The reaction was studied at 1123 K and constant feed condition (S/C = 4 and O2/C = 0.4) of reactants. Percentage conversions of sample 1 and sample 3 with time on stream (min) are shown in Fig. 6 . It is observed from the Fig. 6 that sample 3 has better conversion than sample 1. Initially both the samples having same rate of deactivation up to 240 min, but sample 1 deactivated sharply after 240 min. Sample 1 has high sulfur concentration and high aromatic components than sample 3 which favors catalyst poisoning and carbon formation respectively. On the other hand, conversion for sample 3 tends to stabilize at ∼ 70%. Thus, it is clearly seen that a part of vacuum residue could be converted to hydrogen using milder operating conditions described in the paper as a two-stage process."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, vacuum residue was chosen as a carbon source for hydrogen production. It is a cheap material and often used without further treatment as fuel oil or for the production of asphalt. The established catalytic processes i.e. gas phase catalytic steam reforming and catalytic partial oxidation are not suitable for conversion of vacuum residue to the hydrogen because of extensive thermal cracking and coke formation. A two-step process has been described in the paper for sustained production of hydrogen from vacuum residue. In the first process, liquid phase ozonation is carried out at 373 K for 10 h. It resulted into cracking of aromatics and formation of partially oxygenated compounds. A vacuum distillation of the oxidized product yielded a clear distillate of 40 mL per 100 mL of residue. It is seen that the distillate could be converted to hydrogen at temperature 1123 K using catalyst 2wt% Pt/Al2O3-La2O3-CeO2 along with some mitigation of catalyst deactivation."
