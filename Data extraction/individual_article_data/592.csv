0,Introduction,"With the shortage of fossil resources and the aggravation of environmental problems, substantial attention has been paid to the utilization of sustainable resources to provide energy and chemicals [1,2]. As the earth-abundant and easily accessible renewable carbon resource, biomass can be obtained from all organisms, which holds huge potential to partially replace fossil resources to produce valuable carbon-based chemical feedstocks [3–6]. Although the conventional strategies for the conversion of biomass have made great progress, the harsh reaction conditions and high energy consumption are not conducive to sustainable development [7,8]. Within this context, light-driven transformation of biomass and its derivatives is considered as a promising alternative route, as its low consumption and environmental friendliness [5,9]. For meeting the sustainable development, solar-light-driven valorization of biomass-derived alcohols (e.g., furfuryl alcohol [5,10,11] (FOL), benzyl alcohol [9,11–13], and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [10,14,15]) has recently attracted substantial attention. To date, a variety of semiconductor-based materials have been developed to convert alcohols into corresponding carbonyl compounds and H2 [5,9,16–21]. Among these photocatalysts, chalcogenides perform well in this regard because of their suitable bandgap [22,23]. Noticeably, the ternary metal sulfide ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) has received extensive attention in the field of photocatalysis due to its controllable morphology, intrinsic bandgap and stable chemical properties [23]. Nevertheless, resulting from the lack of catalytic active sites and the rapid electron-hole recombination, the photocatalytic activity of blank ZIS still suffers from low conversion efficiency [9,24]. To ameliorate this obstacle, modification of cocatalysts has been shown to be a feasible way to adjust interface redox kinetics and accelerate charge separation, therefore improving the net efficiency of photocatalysis [25,26]. It is currently recognized that noble metals (e.g., Au, Rh, Pd, Pt, etc.) can usually be used as cocatalysts to enhance the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers, while their practical applications are restricted to the scarcity and high price [27–29]. As the earth-abundant, low-cost, low-toxicity and high-efficiency noble-metal-free sulfide-based cocatalysts, MoS2, NiS, WS2, etc., have great promise to replace the noble metals [25,30–34]. Up to now, these sulfide-based cocatalysts have widely applications in hydrogen (H2) evolution [30], carbon dioxide reduction [35], pollutants degradation [36] and selective organic synthesis [31]. However, sulfide-based cocatalysts decorated ZIS has not been reported in furfuryl alcohol oxidation integrated with H2 evolution. In this study, a series of noble-metal-free cocatalysts (MoS2, NiS and WS2) decorated ZIS with flower-like microspheres morphology have been successfully obtained through a facile route combining hydrothermal method and photodeposition method. In an aqueous-phase photoredox system, the as-prepared binary composites can simultaneous exploit photogenerated electrons and holes, fulfilling the oxidation of FOL integrated with H2 evolution. The binary composites show significantly improved photocatalytic performance and the optimal MoS2-ZIS samples obtain approximately 7 times yield of products (furfural and H2) compared with that of blank ZIS. The cocatalyst, as a relay station for electrons, plays a vital role in separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Mechanism researches reveal that the CH(OH)C4H3O radical serves as the pivotal reactive intermediate in the photocatalytic process. We expect that this work can stimulate rational design of sulfide-based photocatalysts toward visible-light-driven production of high-value-added chemicals and clean H2 energy from biomass-derived platform chemicals."

Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) is supplied by J&K Scientific Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Ammonium tetrathiotungstate ((NH4)2WS4) was supplied by Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2, FOL) and furfural (C5H4O2, FAL) were supplied by Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All materials were used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water used in all the experiments was from local sources."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) The blank ZIS was prepared as described previously [37], which is shown in the Supporting Information. 2.2.2 Synthesis of MoS2-ZIS composites The MoS2-ZIS composites were prepared via a facile photodeposition method [38]. In a typical experiment, 40 mg of the prepared ZIS composite was dispersed in a mixture of DI water (32 mL) and EtOH (8 mL) with the addition of different amount of the precursors (NH4)2MoS4. Then, the suspension was irradiated using visible light for 1 h in nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. After that, the products were centrifuged, washed thoroughly by DI water and dried at room temperature in vacuum to finally obtain the MoS2-ZIS composites with different weight ratios (0.5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 5 %) of MoS2. The decoration of other cocatalysts was used the same photodeposition method, apart from the distinction of the precursors. (NiCl2·6H2O/CH3CSNH2 for NiS [25] and (NH4)2WS4 for WS2 [39].)"
4,Photoactivity testing,"2.3 Photoactivity testing The photoactivity tests were conducted based on the previous work with some modifications [9]. Typically, 0.1 mmol FOL, 5 mg photocatalysts, and 10 mL DI water were added into a quartz reactor. The reaction suspension was sonicated and then purged with Ar gas for half an hour. After that, the suspension was irradiated with visible light (λ > 420 nm) by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300D, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) with the light power density of 0.3 W cm−2 measured by a photoradiometer (PL-MW2000, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.). After the reaction, the gas product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A 2014C)). The liquid products were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu HPLC-LC20AT) and gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (Shimadzu GC–MS QP 2020, Q-Exactive). The conversion of FOL was obtained by the following equation [5]: Conversion= n 0 - n FOL n 0 ×100% Where n 0 stands for the initial moles of FOL; n FOL is molar amount of the residual FOL after the photoredox dual reaction. The ratio of electrons and holes, R(e −/h +) consumed in the reaction was calculated using the equation [40]: R e - / h + = n H 2 n FAL Where n H 2 and n FAL are moles of the product H2 and FAL, respectively, after the photoredox dual reaction. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of FAL for the composites was tested under the same reaction conditions except for the different wavelength monochromatic light irradiation (400, 420, 500, 530 and 610 nm). The photoradiometer was employed to measure the photon flux of incident light. The AQY was calculated by equation [40]: AQY = N h N p ×100%= 2× N A ×M×h×c P ×S×λ× t ×100% Where N h stands for the number of reaction holes, Np stands for the number of incident photons, NA is Avogadro constant, M represents for the molar amount of FAL, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, P is the intensity of the irradiation, S stands for the irradiation area, λ is the wavelength of incident light and t is the reaction time."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and morphology,"3.1 Synthesis and morphology The synthesis of a series of sulfide-based cocatalysts decorated ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) composites are schematically shown in Fig. 1 a. The bare ZIS is obtained solvothermally from ZnCl2 and InCl3·4H2O in a mixed solvent of deionized (DI) water and ethanol (EtOH) according to a literature procedure previously reported [37], and the decoration of other cocatalysts onto the surface of ZIS is carried out using corresponding precursors and hole scavenger EtOH with N2 atmosphere. Our initial experiment starts from the decoration of MoS2, a typical transition-metal disulfide compound, which is widely applied in hydrogen (H2) evolution [30]. To obtain morphology information of the MoS2-ZIS hybrids and blank ZIS, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) has been performed. As depicted in Fig. 1b and c, the as-prepared samples exhibit the flower-like microspheres with the radius ranging from 1 to 4 μm. In comparison with blank ZIS (Fig. S1), the photodeposition of MoS2 over the ZIS has little influence on the morphology. Afterward, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) research has been further performed to deeply understand their microscopic morphology and structure properties. Fig. S2 reveals that the flower-like microsphere structure is formed by the aggregation of the disordered nanosheets. Additionally, the successful synthesis of MoS2-ZIS binary composites is further verified by the results of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). In Fig. 1d, the clear lattice fringe of 0.62 nm refers to the (002) planes of MoS2 [38], as well as the lattice fringe of 0.32 nm belongs to the (102) crystal facet of ZIS [9]. We can clearly observe the interface between and MoS2 and ZIS, and the intersecting lattice stripes further authenticate the intimate contact between them. The existence of Mo, S, Zn and In elements in the MoS2-ZIS binary composite is further ascertained in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum (Fig. 1e). Besides, according to the element mapping results (Fig. 1f), all of elements related to ZIS and MoS2 are evenly distributed in the composites, indicating that MoS2 is uniformly loaded onto the surface of ZIS microspheres."
7,Physicochemical properties,"3.2 Physicochemical properties X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to analyze the chemical element compositions and valence states of the as-prepared MoS2-ZIS. The survey spectra (Fig. S3) jointly with the high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 2 a–d) of MoS2-ZIS composites manifest that all elements (Mo, S, Zn and In) associated with ZIS and MoS2 are detected, which is in accordance with the results of EDX and element mapping. Fig. 2a depicts that two peaks at 228.65 eV and 232.05 eV corresponding to the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, which are ascribed to Mo4+ in MoS2 [38]. The spectrum of S 2p can be deconvoluted into two peaks, where the peaks at 161.68 eV and 162.86 eV are corresponded to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, which can be assigned to S2− [38] (Fig. 2b). As sketched in Fig. 2c, the peaks of Zn 2p are centered at 1022.35 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.40 eV (Zn 2p1/2), which belong to Zn2+ [31]. In Fig. 2d, the characteristic peaks with the binding energies of In 3d5/2 at 445.05 eV and In 3d3/2 at around 452.60 eV are attributed to In3+ of ZIS [12]. Noticeably, with the introduction of MoS2, the characteristic element peaks related to ZIS are shifted to higher binding energy, which indicates that a strong electronic interaction between ZIS and MoS2 has been generated [30,31] (Fig. S4). The results as mentioned above clearly confirm the successful synthesis of MoS2-ZIS hybrid composites. To gain more information on the crystal phase structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been performed. In Fig. 2e, the crystallinity phases of the as-prepared ZIS and MoS2-ZIS composites with different weight ratios of MoS2 have been investigated by XRD pattern. The main diffraction characteristic peaks at 2 Theta degrees of 21.58°, 27.69° and 47.17° of blank ZIS (JCPDS No. 65-2030) are detected in all samples, demonstrating that the photodeposition process does not destroy the feature structure of ZIS [9,12]. Because of the low loading weight of MoS2, its corresponding characteristic diffraction peaks cannot be observed in the patterns [25]. In addition, the optical absorption properties of the composites have been measured by the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), as disclosed in Fig. 2f. The bare ZIS shows a strong absorption in visible light with the absorption edge at about 510 nm, which is attributed to its intrinsic bandgap [12]. According to the Kubelka-Munk function [41], the value of ZIS is calculated as 2.53 eV (Fig. S5). In addition, the more contents of the MoS2 leads to an increasing absorption in the visible light region, which is consistent with the color change of the composites, as shown in Fig. S6."
8,Photoredox dual reaction for cooperative FOL conversion and H2 evolution,"3.3 Photoredox dual reaction for cooperative FOL conversion and H2 evolution The photocatalytic activities of blank ZIS and MoS2-ZIS composites have been evaluated via a photoredox dual reaction integrated H2 generation and the oxidation of FOL to furfural (FAL) (Fig. 3 a), which shows enormous potential for the generation of biofuels and becomes one of the few cases of industrial scale production [6,11,14]. After 5 h visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, the photoactivities of blank ZIS and a series of MoS2-ZIS composites with different contents of MoS2 are depicted in Fig. 3b. As we can see, blank ZIS displays a relative low performance for H2 evolution (11.3 μmol) and FAL generation (10.8 μmol). With decoration of cocatalyst MoS2, the photoactivities of binary composites are significantly enhanced. A volcano-type relationship between different contents of MoS2 and the conversion of FOL can be observed. In specific, the optimal photocatalytic performance is found out on the sample of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS (68.8 μmol for H2 evolution and 70.8 μmol for FAL generation), which is approximately 7 times higher than that of blank ZIS. Furthermore, because of the narrow bandgap and suitable band edge position of the sample, FOL would not be mineralized to CO2, but selectively oxidized to FAL, which is further ascertained by the results of the gas chromatography–mass (GC–MS) spectrometry (Fig. S7). Loading an appropriate amount cocatalyst MoS2 onto ZIS can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the photoactivity of the binary composites [25]. Of note, excessive introduction of black MoS2 reduces the photocatalytic performance on the account of the light shielding effect [42]. Besides, according to the yield of the coproduction of H2 and FAL, the ratio of electrons and holes, R(e−/h+), consumed in redox reaction are calculated to be ca. 1.0, indicating a stoichiometric dehydrogenation reaction [40]. It is worth mentioning that the calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composite is closely related to the incident light wavelength and well matches with its DRS spectrum (Fig. 3c). To assess the recyclability and stability of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composites, recycling experiment and long-term reaction test have been carried out. As demonstrated in Fig. 3d, no obvious deactivation phenomenon can be observed over the samples after 4 times cycles, revealing the great stability and recyclability of the binary composites. As depicted in Fig. 3e, the composite can maintain its photostability during the long-term reaction tests, and the conversion of FOL has reached up to 95 % after 9 h visible light irradiation. Additionally, the evolution kinetics of FAL during the reaction process is monitored by the time-dependent high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) analysis chromatogram of the liquid products for the 1 %-MoS2-ZIS hybrids (Fig. S8), which shows the continuous decrease of FOL together with the increase of FAL as the reaction proceeds. In addition, the crystallographic structures of the fresh and used 1 %-MoS2-ZIS have been investigated by XRD and XPS, no significant distinction between them can be detected, as shown in Figs. S9 and S10. These above-mentioned results strongly evidence the excellent photochemical stability of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composites. In order to verify the universality in oxidation of biomass-relevant alcohols of MoS2-ZIS, we have extended the alcohol substrates to benzyl alcohol, 1-phenylethanol and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. As shown by the results in Table S1, the 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composite can efficiently facilitate the conversions from these different alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, to confirm the generality of the cocatalysts decoration strategy, we have also deposited other S-based compounds, such as NiS and WS2, onto the ZIS. According to the results of TEM and XPS (Figs. S11–14), the NiS-ZIS and WS2-ZIS composites have been successfully synthesized. As shown in Fig. S15, both the NiS-ZIS and WS2-ZIS composites not only show the increased photocatalytic performances compared with that of blank ZIS, but also display a similar photocatalytic activity to that of MoS2-ZIS under identical reaction conditions, indicating the generality of the cocatalysts decorated strategy for improving the activity toward such photoredox dual reaction for cooperative FOL conversion and H2 evolution. Notably, compared with previous reports in literatures for photocatalytic oxidation of FOL, we have showed that the best performance has been obtained in our present work, as illustrated in Table S2."
9,The mechanism of photoredox dual reaction and activity improvement,"3.4 The mechanism of photoredox dual reaction and activity improvement To reveal the origin of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the MoS2-ZIS hybrids in comparison with that of bare ZIS, a set of photoelectrochemical tests have been performed, which are intimately related to the separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers [5,43,44]. According to the results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS and blank ZIS (Fig. 4 a), we can find that the introduction of MoS2 into the ZIS can increase the onset overpotential, thus facilitating the reduction of protons to H2. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been performed to investigate the charge transfer resistance at contact interface between work electrolyte and sample [45]. Fig. 4b shows that the Nyquist diagram of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS possesses a smaller semicircle at frequency as compared with blank ZIS, indicating a lower resistance and higher charge transfer efficiency between 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composite and electrolyte, which is in agreement with the results of the cyclic voltammograms (CV) curves (Fig. 4c). In addition, as displayed in Fig. 4d, we can see a higher transient photocurrent response of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS than that of blank ZIS under intermittent light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). In this case, the cocatalyst MoS2 can serve as an electron trap to provide an effective relay station for electron transfer, thereby reducing the recombination of the photogenerated charges and significantly improving the photocurrent density [25]. To in-depth confirm the aforementioned deductions, photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) researches have been conducted as well, which are the reflection of the behavior of the photogenerated charge carriers to some extent [16]. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, the PL spectra of these samples show the alike characteristic emission peaks at ca. 510 nm using excitation wavelength of 360 nm. However, the PL intensity of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS is obviously quenched compared to that of the bare ZIS, illustrating the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is suppressed efficiently [46]. Subsequently, TRPL decay spectra are further performed to study the photogenerated charge carriers transfer dynamics (Fig. 4f). The TRPL results are dependent on a fast component (τ1) originated from the defect states emission, as well as a slow component (τ2) caused by the recombination of free excitons within the samples [12]. Based on the exponential decay kinetics function, the average lifetimes (τa) of charges are calculated (Table S3), which reflects the overall emission decay behavior of the as-prepared samples [47]. As is clearly seen, after decoration of MoS2, the emission lifetime of 1 %-MoS2-ZIS reduces from 8.14 ns to 3.59 ns, more than 2 times as short as that of blank ZIS. The decreased decay lifetime proves that the faster interface charges transfer occurs in MoS2-ZIS composites [25]. The results of PL and TRPL jointly evidence that the cocatalyst MoS2 can receive and lock the photoexcited charge carriers effectively, thereby eliminating the surface charge recombination in space and improving the efficiency of the charge separation. To further study the underlying photoredox dual reaction mechanisms, a set of control experiments have been performed. As manifested in entries 1–3 in Table S4, upon removal of photocatalysts or visible light irradiation, the photoredox dual reaction cannot proceed, strongly demonstrating such reaction is a light-driven photocatalytic process indeed. Next, when replacing the reaction solvent from DI water to acetonitrile (MeCN), the H2 evolution drops sharply (entry 4, Table S4), which can be speculated that the H2 is chiefly from water. Moreover, a series of quenchers have been added into the photoredox reaction system to investigate the active species generated in the reaction process. As shown in entry 5 in Table S4, with the introduction of electrons scavenger (carbon tetrachloride, CCl4), the gas product H2 is significant decreased, illustrating that the electrons are consumed to H2 formation. Instead, when adding triethanolamine (TEOA) as the hole scavenger, the generation of FAL is restrained severely (entry 6, Table S4), which proves that the FOL oxidation reaction is driven by holes. It is well-known that 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) is often employed to capture free radicals. As denoted in entry 7 in Table S4, the photoactivity is greatly decreased, indicating that free radical reactive intermediates are formed in the reaction process. For the purpose of in-depth understanding the detail information of the reactive intermediates in this photoredox system, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique has been carried out to detect the radical intermediates over blank ZIS and 1 %-MoS2-ZIS with scavenger DMPO, whose results are shown in Fig. 5 a. As we can see, both two kinds of samples exhibit six characteristic signal peaks under light irradiation and the nitrogen hyperfine splitting (αN) and hydrogen hyperfine splitting (αH) for the nitroxide nitrogen are, respectively, measured to 16.03 and 22.97 (Fig. 5b), which belong to DMPO–CH(OH)C4H3O [13,48,49]. Of note, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the 1 %-MoS2-ZIS composite is obviously stronger than that of bare ZIS under light irradiation, which indicates that binary composites facilitate the formation of reactive intermediates, therefore further improving the photocatalytic performance. In addition, the CH(OH)C4H3O radical is further confirmed to be the crucial intermediates by the liquid chromatograph-mass (LC–MS) chromatogram (Fig. S16). Upon the basis of the aforementioned discussion, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic FOL conversion to FAL integrated with H2 evolution over cocatalyst decorated ZIS is proposed as the following (Fig. 5c). Under visible light irradiation, the incident light can be absorbed by ZIS component in the composite, owing to its intrinsic semiconductor optical property [50]. Then, the energetic electron and hole pairs are photoexcited over the composites. Next, the photogenerated electrons in the valence band (VB, 1.41 V, Fig. S18) of ZIS are excited to its conduction band (CB, −1.12 V, Fig. S17). Because the Fermi level (EF, −0.22 V, Fig. S19) of the MoS2 is more positive than the CB of ZIS, the MoS2 cocatalyst can act as an electrons trap [25], accepting and localizing the photogenerated electrons from the CB, thereby suppressing the recombination of surface charges. Besides, MoS2 also provides the reactive sites to lower the barrier of H2 evolution because of the unsaturated Mo–S bond [38]. Afterward, the electrons collected on MoS2 surface can easily interact with surface-adsorbed protons to ultimately catalytic H2 evolution. Concurrently, the photogenerated holes in the VB are employed to activate the α-C–H bond of FOL, affording CH(OH)C4H3O radicals and protons. Next, the energetic holes further oxidize the radicals to eventually gain FAL."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we have successfully fabricated a series of noble-metal-free cocatalysts (MoS2, NiS and WS2) surface-modified ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) via combination hydrothermal method with photodeposition method. The as-prepared binary composites exhibit improved photocatalytic activity in a dual-functional reaction system for furfuryl alcohol (FOL) oxidation integrated with H2 evolution compared with bare ZIS. It is worth mentioning that 1 %-MoS2-ZIS obtains the best performance in this dual-functional reaction system compared with previous reports in literatures. The mechanistic studies reveal that the cocatalyst can serve as the relay station for electrons, accepting and localizing the photoexcited electrons from ZIS semiconductor, which boosts the separation of charge carriers and inhibits their recombination, thereby increasing the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, a carbon-centered radical ( CH(OH)C4H3O) has been confirmed as the pivotal reactive intermediate. This work is anticipated to further inspire the reasonable construction of photoredox dual reaction system for efficient valorization of biomass-relevant alcohols coupled with H2 evolution in a cooperative manner."
