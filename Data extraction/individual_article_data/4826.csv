0,Introduction,"Production of biofuels and biochemicals will play a key role for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (Herrera, 2006; Kerr, 2007). But sustainable energy resource and cost-effective conversion technology must be developed to make bio-products competitive with petroleum-based products (Schubert, 2006; Somerville, 2007). Lignocellulosic biomass can serve as an alternative to petrochemical resources, need to meet the rapidly growing demand for fuels and chemicals, because it contains relatively abundant polysaccharides and it is renewable (Huber et al., 2006; Service, 2007). Microbes can ferment lignocellulose derived sugars to produce diversified types of fuels and chemicals (Fischer et al., 2008; Shen and Liao, 2008; Steen et al., 2010). However, cost effective technologies for the separation of polysaccharide from lignin and for the depolymerization of liberated polysaccharides works are still in progress (Galbe and Zacchi, 2007; Merino and Cherry, 2007). The lignocellulose-based platform takes advantage of the ability of plants to generate polysaccharides via photosynthesis, a process that utilizes solar energy and carbon dioxide. Research efforts have focused on genetic engineering to modify the content of cellulose and hemicellulose in plant cell walls (Sticklen, 2008), chemical engineering to improve the efficiency and lower the energy consumption in the pretreatment step (Galbe and Zacchi, 2007), protein engineering to increase the catalytic efficiency of the polysaccharide depolymerizing enzymes cellulase and hemicellulase (Merino and Cherry, 2007), and metabolic engineering to construct robust microbial strains for the conversion of monosaccaharides to the desired biofuel and biochemical products (Stephanopoulos, 2007). A more efficient alternative strategy to the production of biofuels and biochemicals would employ a photosynthetic bacteria based platform, in which photosynthesis and biosynthesis pathways provide the desired products in a single biological system (Lindberg et al., 2009; Atsumi et al., 2009). Cyanobacteria are attractive candidates for the development of such a platform because their genomes are characterized (starting in 1996 with the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) (Kaneko et al., 1996) and they are easily manipulated. To date different cyanobacteria strains have been genetically engineered to produce ""solar biofuels"" and ""solar biochemicals"", exemplified by ethanol in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Deng and Coleman, 1999; Dexter and Fu, 2009), ethylene in Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 (Sakai et al., 1997), isoprene in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Lindberg et al., 2009), and isobutylaldehyde in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Atsumi et al., 2009). There is little doubt that the presence of high energy carbon–carbon and carbon–hydrogen bonds in fatty acids gives these substances potentially broad applications in renewable energy regimes. In addition, long chain alcohols and hydrocarbons are either additives (Rupilius and Ahmad, 2006) or major components of petroleum. Thus, one of the best replacements of oil derived liquid fuels is bio-petroleum. De novo biosynthesis of fatty acyl ethyl esters and fatty alcohols has been achieved by using genetically engineered E. coli and a glucose-based carbon resource platform (Steen et al., 2010). For this purpose, the conversion of hemicellulose to glucose is performed by hemicellulose hydrolases, activities of which are incorporated by including the endoxylanase catalytic domain from Clostridium stercorarium and the xylanase from Bacteroides. The results of this effort demonstrate that a consolidated bioprocess, which includes degradation of renewable biomass and biosynthesis of fatty acyl esters and alcohols into one single genetically engineered microbe, represents a viable methodology for biofuel production. In the studies described below, we have demonstrated the viability of a process, termed a cyanobacteria-based platform targeting fatty acid-based biofuels, which produces biofuels through the use of a consolidated approach that includes photosynthesis and biosynthesis to generate fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons in a single genetically engineered microbe ( Fig. 1)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents 1-Pentadecanol and eicosane were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Other chemicals were from Merck (Germany) or Ameresco (USA). Oligonucleotides and gene synthesis were carried out by Sangon (Shanghai, China). Taq DNA polymerases and all restriction endonucleases were from Fermentas (Canada) or Takara (Japan). The kits used for molecular cloning were from Omega (USA) or Takara (Japan)."
3,Strains and plasmid construction,"2.2 Strains and plasmid construction E. coli strain DH5α was used for cloning. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were generous gifts from Prof. Xudong Xu of Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In this study, all cyanobacteria mutant strains ( Table 1) were constructed by integrating the expressing cassette containing Omega fragment (Prentki et al., 1991), promoter and candidate genes into slr0168 locus which is normally used as a neutral site (Williams, 1988). First, four gene expressing platforms pFQ9R, pFQ20, pXT37a and pXT37b were constructed by inserting the different expressing cassettes without candidate genes into EcoRI site of pKW1188SL, which was derived from pKW1188 and harbored the N- and C-terminal fragments of slr0168. Both pFQ9R and pFQ20 were based on Rubisco promoter (Prbc or Prbcl) followed by XbaI and SmaI sites which were designed for inserting candidate genes. Both pXT37a and pXT37b were based on the promoter of plastocyanin (PpetE) followed by single sites BglII, NdeI, EcoRI and XhoI ( Table 2). Second, different candidate genes were cloned into the designed single sites of these platform plasmids, respectively. The jojoba far gene (See supplementary information) was optimized with codon usage, chemically synthesized and cloned into XbaI/SmaI site of pFQ9R and NdeI/XhoI site of pXT37b, resulting in pXT14 and pXT51, respectively. Mouse far1 (Genebank no. BC007178) and far2 (Genebank no. BC055759) genes were cloned from plasmids pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1 and pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR2 (Cheng and Russell, 2004) by PCR using the primers listed in supplementary Table S1, and subcloned into NdeI/XhoI and NdeI/EcoRI site of pXT37a, resulting in pLY7 and pXT28, respectively. at3g11980 and at3g56700 genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned into NdeI/EcoRI site of pXT37a, resulting in pXT34 and pXT35, respectively. Four acc genes encoding the subunits of acetyl-coA carboxylase were amplified from genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by PCR using the primers listed in supplementary Table S1, cloned together as an accBCDA operon, and subcloned into XbaI/SmaI site of pFQ20 and BglII/XhoI site of pXT37b, respectively, resulting in p20ACC and p37ACC. And pLY2 were constructed by inserting the Omega cassette into EcoRI site of pKW1188SL for using as a control. Fig. 2 shows a general map of plasmid constructed for expressing genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803."
4,Transformation of Synechocystis,"2.3 Transformation of Synechocystis The transformations of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 host cells with plasmids were carried out according to the published procedures (Williams, 1988). Synechocystis cells were grown to exponential phase, harvested, washed twice by fresh BG-11 medium, and finally suspended at a density of 1×109 cellsmL−1. A total of 100μL of the cell suspension was then mixed with plasmid DNA to a final concentration of 20μgmL−1. Next, the mixture of cells and DNA was incubated for 5h at 30°C under illumination of approximately 50μEm−2 s−1, and then spread onto membrane filters resting on BG11 agar plates (without antibiotic) for one day. Finally, the membrane filters were moved onto fresh BG11 agar plates containing spectinomycin (10μgmL−1). After about 1–2 weeks of incubation, single colonies were streaked on plates and grown in the liquid BG11 medium supplemented with spectinomycin (20μgmL−1). Homologous integration of the expressing cassette and complete segregation were confirmed by PCR ( supplementary Fig. S1 and S2 ) using candidate gene specific and slr0168 specific primers ( supplementary Table S1 ). The confirmed Synechocystis mutant strains were used for analysis, including Syn-LY2 which was constructed as a control for production of both fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons in genetically engineered strains (see Table 1)."
5,Growth of cyanobacterial cells,"2.4 Growth of cyanobacterial cells 2.4.1 Normal culture condition Wild-type and mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were grown at 30°C in 500mL flasks containing 300mL of in air-infused BG11 medium (Stanier et al., 1971) under 30–50μEm−2 s−1 of white light. Spectinomycin (20μg mL-1) was added to the medium when needed. 2.4.2 Nitrogen or phosphorus deprivation condition (-N, -P) and high light condition (HL) Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 mutant strain Syn-XT14 were grown under normal condition to the late exponential stage (∼6d, achieving an OD730 of 0.8), harvested by centrifugation, and washed three times with nitrogen- and phosphorus-free BG11 medium. The cells were partitioned to separate flasks containing fresh BG11 medium as control, nitrogen-free or phosphorus-free BG11 medium and fresh BG11 medium under light intensities of 250μEm−2 s−1, respectively, and cultured for 3d before harvesting. 2.4.3 Bubble column photo-bioreactor The simple bubble column photo-bioreactor consists a 575mm×50mm glass column. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells derived from the three mutant strains (Syn-XT34, Syn-XT51 and Syn-XT14) were separately suspended in 500mL of BG11 medium to density of OD730∼0.5, and then grown at 30°C under 50μEm−2 s−1 of white light with air bubbling for 24h, after which the light intensity was adjusted to 100μEm−2 s−1 and the aeration was switched to 5% (v/v) CO2-enriched air."
6,Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),"2.5 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 mutant strains were grown under normal condition to the late exponential stage, and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from 100mL of cell culture using Fungal RNA kit (Omega, USA), and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas, Canada) to eliminate contaminating chromosomal DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR analysis, 1μg total RNA was used to generate cDNA using RevertAidTM M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, Canada), followed by normal PCR with gene-speciﬁc primers listed in supplementary Table S1."
7,Extraction and GC–MS analysis,"2.6 Extraction and GC–MS analysis Synechocystis cells were harvested from 200mL of culture (OD730=1.5–2.0) by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in 10mL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) and then lysed by sonication. The lysate was extracted for 30min at room temperature with 10mL chloroform–methanol (v/v, 2:1). Prior to extraction, 15μg 1-pentadecanol (internal standard for fatty alcohol analysis) or eicosane (internal standard for hydrocarbon analysis) was added to the cell lysate as the internal standard. The organic phase was separated following centrifugation and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 55°C. The solute was dissolved in 1mL of n-hexane and a 1μL aliquot was analyzed by GC–MS using an Agilent 7890A system equipped with a HP-INNOWax (30m×250μm×0.25μm). Helium (constant flow 1mLmin−1) was used as carrier gas. For fatty alcohol analysis, the temperature of the injector was 250°C. The following temperature program was applied: 50°C for 2min, increase of 10°Cmin−1 to 240°C for 5min. For fatty alkane or fatty alkene analysis, the temperature of the injector was 250°C. The following temperature program was applied: 100°C for 2min, increase of 20°Cmin−1 to 240°C for 5min. The internal standard was used to determine product yield, which was reported as the mean based on three independent experiments."
8,Results and discussion,"The formation of fatty alcohol in cultured Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells was determined by using a GC–MS based analysis of organic solvent extracts of cell lysates. The absence of fatty alcohol production in Syn-LY2 which was used as a control strain was confirmed, thus, setting the baseline for fatty alcohol biosynthesis in the genetically engineered strains ( Fig. 3(A)). Genome of the parent strain was manipulated to express a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) under the control of the promoter Prbc or PpetE. The fatty acyl-CoA reductase genes, which were tested for performance in the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 host, were derived from several different organisms (mouse, jojoba and Arabidopsis thaliana) by using PCR for gene amplification or by gene synthesis. The plasmid vectors and engineered strains subsequently generated are listed in Tables 2 and 1. The Synechocystis mutant strains were grown in flasks under normal culture condition and the content and composition of fatty alcohols were analyzed as described in “Materials and Methods"". The three Synechocystis strains (viz. Syn-XT51, Syn-XT34 and Syn-XT14), which express the FAR gene from jojoba or from A. thaliana (At3911980), were shown to produce both hexadecanol and octadecanol (see Fig. 3). And the gene transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (see supplementary Fig S3A). However, the other four strains engineered to express the FAR gene derived from mouse or A. thaliana (At3g56700) did not produce fatty alcohols. The greatest yield of total fatty alcohol, 9.73±2.73μgOD−1 L−1 was observed for the strain Syn-XT14 that contains the jojoba FAR gene under the control of Prbc promoter (see Fig. 4(A)). In order to test if fatty alcohol production by using the Synechocystis mutant strains can be scaled up, three confirmed fatty alcohol-producing strains were grown in bubble column photo-bioreactors with a 5% (v/v) CO2-enriched air flow while monitoring by GC–MS (see Methods section). As the plots given in Figs. 4(B) and (C) show, 12 days later, both the cell density and fatty alcohol yields increase significantly with the cell density reaching a maximum of 137.63±23.26μgL−1 in the case of Syn-XT14. To determine whether the production of fatty alcohols is dependent on culturing time in the stationary phase, the Syn-XT14 mutant strain was grown for 18d in bubble column photo-bioreactors with sampling after 15 and 18d. The results show that cell productivity increases to 176.2±13.59 and 200.44±8.07μgL−1, respectively (see Fig. 4(C)). To investigate the impact of environmental stresses on the production of fatty alcohols, the results of growth of Synechocystis strain Syn-XT14 under various stress conditions were determined. The results, displayed in Fig. 4(D), suggest that no significant change takes place in the production of fatty alcohols by Syn-XT14 mutant cells under nitrogen or phosphorus deprivation conditions. However, the production of fatty alcohols is approximately doubled under high light conditions (250μEm−2 s−1 vs. 30–50μEm−2 s−1). This finding indicates that the production of fatty alcohols in genetically engineered cyanobacteria strains is promoted by light. But high light might induce photoinhibition (Allakhverdiev and Murata, 2004) and fatty alcohol might cause chemical stress. So it will be necessary to enhance cell tolerances to stresses (Nicolaou et al., 2010) in Synechocystis in future study. Cyanobacteria, prokaryotic bacteria possessing a photosynthetic function, have played a key role in evolution. It has been suggested that these bacteria are responsible for the preservation of organic matter found in ancient sediments. The potential geochemical significance of cyanobacteria has attracted the interest of scientists in the exploration of hydrocarbon production (Winters et al., 1969). The early literature contains reports that cyanobacteria, exemplified by Nostoc muscorum, and Trichodesmium erythaeum, can produce a variety of hydrocarbons including long chain (C15–C19) alkanes and alkenes, the most predominant component being heptadecane (Han et al., 1969; Winters et al., 1969). To explore the feasibility of using a cynobacteria-based platform to produce hydrocarbons as biofuels from solar energy and carbon dioxide, we have investigated the characteristics of hydrocarbon production in three representative types of cyanobacterial model strains growing in fresh water, including (1) Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, (2) Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 that are unicellular and (3) Anabaena sp. PCC7120 that is filamentous with formation of heterocysts and has the capability of nitrogen fixation (see Fig. 5). The results show that the total hydrocarbon productivity under normal culture condition is 115.062±36.024μgOD−1 L−1 for Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, 31.713±5.032μgOD−1 L−1 for Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and 93.391±12.8μgOD−1 L−1 for Anabaena sp. PCC7120 (see Fig. 6(A)). Recently, the hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathway in cyanobacteria has just been identified by LS9 company (California, USA) (Schirmer et al., 2010). Their works make sure that fatty acyl-ACP is first converted to fatty aldehyde by a fatty acyl-ACP reductase, and then to hydrocarbon by a fatty aldehyde decaboxylase in cyanobacteria. So, increasing the fatty acyl biosynthetic flux for producing more fatty acyl-ACP might be facilitated to improve the production of hydrocarbon. For this purpose, the acc genes (ACCase), encoding for acetyl-coA carboxylase that catalyzes the first commitment and proposed rate-limiting step of fatty acid biosynthesis (Davis et al., 2000), were cloned as an operon and integrated into the genome of Synechocystis PCC6803, resulting in two mutant strains Syn-37ACC and Syn-20ACC, in which the introduced acc operon was driven by the promoters, PpetE and Prbcl, respectively. And the gene transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (see supplementary Fig S3B). As the results presented in Fig. 6(B) show, an 11% increase of total hydrocarbon production is obtained using Syn-37ACC to 114.863±13.691μgOD−1 L−1 and a 56% for Syn-20ACC to 161.562±10.315μgOD−1 L−1 compared with the negative control strain Syn-LY2. The observations indicate that overexpression of ACCase leads to an enhancement of hydrocarbon production, and a greater amount of hydrocarbons are achieved by using the stronger promoter Prbcl. In E. coli overexpression of ACCase can lead to 100-fold increase of intracellular malonyl-CoA, but only sixfold increase in the rate of fatty acid synthesis (Davis et al., 2000). It indicates that there exists feedback inhibition caused by terminal product in fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Considerable production of free fatty acids can be achieved in a fadD gene-deleted mutant strain of E. coli by overexpression of ACCase and thioesterase which releases the feedback inhibition caused by fatty acyl-ACPs (Lu et al., 2008). So in the case of hydrocarbon production in Synechocystis, further improvement of production might be achieved by releasing feedback inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis in an ACCase expressing strain. And a quantitative analysis method for fatty acid biosynthesis through cell-free system, which has been proved to be effective in E. coli (Liu et al., 2010), will be helpful for optimizing the strategy of genetic modifications in Synechocystis in the future. The composition of hydrocarbons in Anabaena sp. PCC7120 is consistent with those previously reported for filamentous Nostoc muscorum that contain ca. 80% heptadecane and 17% methylated heptadecane and minor amounts of pentadecane and hexadecane (Han et al., 1969). In contrast, both unicellular Synechocystis PCC6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 produce lower percentages of heptadecane (44% and 48%, respectively) compared with Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Also Synechocystis PCC6803 produces 53% 8-heptadecene and minor amounts of pentadecane and hexadecane, while Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 produces 37% pentadecane and 8% 8-heptadecene. Neither of the unicellular cyanobacteria strains produce methylated heptadecane. It has been proposed that 7-methyl and 8-methylheptadecanes in Nostoc muscorum are derived from vaccenic acid (cis-Δ11-C18) (Han et al., 1969). As a result, the absence of vaccenic acid or a specific enzyme that can be functioning in the catalysis of methylation might be the reason why no methylheptadecane is generated in unicellular cyanobacteria. 8-heptadecene can be found in both Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 in this study (Figs. 5 and 6), while not in Schirmer's work (Schirmer et al., 2010). The reason for this might be that HP-INNOWax column with a higher polarity used in this study provided a better resolution of hydrocarbons than HP-5-MS used in Schirmer's work. The formation of different compositions of hydrocarbons in different cyanobacteria strains indicates that much leeway exists to control and regulate the properties of hydrocarbon fuels by choosing different starting cyanobacteria strains or manipulating hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways. In this study, a non-native fatty alcohol producing pathway has been constructed by expressing heterologous FAR genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In addition, the native production of hydrocarbons in three of the most important and generally used genetic model cyanobacteria strains, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120, has been characterized. Potential methods to improve productivity of fatty acid derivatives through genetic modification, physiological regulation and environmental stress induction, were demonstrated. Although the production efficiency described here is still low, the results show the potential of employing cyanobacteria-based platforms to produce fatty acid derivatives, including high-value chemicals (fatty alcohols) and high-energy fuels (hydrocarbons), directly from solar energy and carbon dioxide. Thus, solar energy driven conversion of carbon dioxide to high value chemicals and high-energy fuels through genetic engineering strategies involving photosynthetic microbes, exemplified by cyanobacteria, could become an attractive and significant process for chemical and fuel production."
