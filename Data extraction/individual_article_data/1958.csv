0,Introduction,"Considering the energy security and the global environment, there is an urgent need in developing a clean and renewable energy source. Bioenergy is considered an important form of renewable energy because of its sustainable feature, by growing energy crops from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Currently, production of bio-ethanol and bio-diesel from different energy crops is technologically feasible, although its impacts on global economic and food security issues are debatable. Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier, generating only water when it burns. However, for hydrogen production to meet sustainability requirements, it must be produced from renewable resources. One way to produce hydrogen renewably is through fermentative biohydrogen production from potential renewable materials such as carbohydrate-containing biomass and organic wastes (Li and Fang, 2007). Hydrogen production from anaerobic waste treatment potentially benefits both organic wastes reduction and renewable energy production at the same time, but it also creates challenges because the waste materials usually are composed of a variety of substrates that can be used by different species of microorganisms (Whang et al., 2006; Li and Fang, 2007; Li et al., 2010). Fermentative biohydrogen has been studied for the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (Okamoto et al., 2000), spoiled wheat grains (Kalia et al., 1993), cellulose (Lay, 2001), municipal wastewater and sludge (Kim et al., 2004; Van Ginkel et al., 2005; Cavinato et al., 2011), and food wastes (Kim et al., 2004; Van Ginkel et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008), but results suggest that hydrogen production is more efficient from carbohydrates than other materials (Li and Fang, 2007), indicating that high-carbohydrate wastewaters will bethe most suitable ones for industrial production of hydrogen (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). Besides wastewater compositions and characteristics, another difficulty to the practical application of fermentative biohydrogen production is that conversion yields by known metabolic pathways appear to be limited to a maximum of 4mol of hydrogen per mol of glucose, representing a maximum conversion efficiency of 33% (Gottschalk, 1986; Ljungdahl et al., 1989).This also indicates that the majority of the COD of waste streams remains untreated and other processes, such as methanogenesis, would be necessary. In this study, a two-stage bioprocess was investigated for treating organic residues generated during ethanol fermentation production from rice straw. Current technologies for ethanol fermentation from energy cropscan attain a conversion efficiency of 75–80%, remaining about 20–25% of organic wastes as residues. The main objective of this study was to recover bioenergy in the form of hydrogen and methane while treating ethanol fermentation residues through the two-stage bioprocess. Two bioreactors were continuously operated at different organic loadings to evaluate their performance on reduction of organic wastes and production of hydrogen and methane, respectively. In this article, batch experiments on fermentative biohydrogen production were conducted to evaluate effects of substrate concentration on hydrogen production and metabolism of fermentative biohydrogen from rice straw ethanol fermentation residues. Furthermore, molecular methods were applied to investigate microbial ecology of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the hydrogen bioreactor. Finally, overall bioenergy recovery from the two-stage bioprocess treating rice straw bioethanol residues was evaluated."
1,Methods,
2,Operation of the two-stage bioprocess,"2.1 Operation of the two-stage bioprocess Two bioreactors were operated in this study as a two-stage bioprocess. The first bioreactor, hydrogen fermentation bioreactor, was fed with organic residues obtained from a bioethanol fermentation process using rice straw as substrate. Table 1 summarizes the wastewater characteristics of ethanol fermentation residues investigated in this study. As shown in Table 1, the residues contained a total COD of 23,200mg/L, which consisted of total volatile solid (TVS) (620mg/L), total carbohydrate (5060mg/L), organic acids (3680mg/L of lactate and 3120mg/L of acetate) and alcohols (1760mg/L of ethanol). The following chemicals as growth nutrients (in mg/L) were added to the residues before fed into the hydrogen bioreactor (Lin et al., 2007; Whang et al., 2011): CaCl2·6H2O, 32.32; MgCl2·6H2O, 232.26; KCl, 167.81; MnCl2·4H2O, 63.87; CoCl2·6H2O, 3.87; H3BO3, 0.74; CuCl·2H2O, 0.35; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.33; ZnCl2, 0.27; FeCl2·4H2O, 10.62; sodium thioglycolate, 217.35; KH2PO4, 119. Sodium ammonia (400mg-N/L) and peptone (360mg/L) were added as nitrogen source, and trace amount of resazurin (0.175mg/L) was also added as the redox-status indicator. The second bioreactor, methane fermentation bioreactor, was fed with the effluent collected from the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor. The total volume of hydrogen and methane fermentation bioreactor was 5 and 12L with a working volume of 2 and 8L, respectively. Hydrogen fermentation bioreactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer for mixing, as a mechanic propeller was installed in methane fermentation bioreactor. A completely-mixed condition was achieved for the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor while a gently-mixed condition was applied for the methane fermentation bioreactor at an agitation speed of 15rpm, in order to retain granular sludge in the bioreactor without washout. Both bioreactors were kept in incubators in order to maintain an operational temperature at 35°C. The influent feeds of both bioreactors were stored at 4°C in a refrigerator and continuously fed into the bioreactors using a peristaltic pump. Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and pH were monitored for both bioreactors during operation. The pH values for hydrogen and methane fermentation bioreactors were controlled at 6 and 7, respectively, using a pH controller with addition of 45% H3PO4 and 50% NaOH throughout the experiments. The amount of biogases produced from both bioreactors was measured with a wet-gas flow meter (Shinagawa W-NK-0.5B, Tokyo, Japan).The seeding microorganisms for the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor and the methane fermentation bioreactor were obtained from a lab-scale bioenergy recovery process treating bioethanol residues (Juang et al., 2011). The operational conditions of the hydrogen and methane fermentation bioreactors are summarized in Table 2 , respectively. Based on predetermined operational conditions for hydraulic retention time (HRT) and feed concentration, the volumetric loading rates (VLR) for the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor increased gradually from 19.7 to 46kgCOD/m3/day, while for the methane fermentation bioreactor, the VLR varied between 2.0 and 4.6kgCOD/m3/day."
3,Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests,"2.2 Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests The batched fermentative biohydrogen tests conducted in this study was a modified version of biochemical methane potential test originally developed by Owen et al. (1979). The test was carried out in a series of 1L glass bottles equipped with pH/ORP monitoring and gas collection systems. To each bottle with a liquid working volume of 800mL, predetermined concentrations of bioethanol fermentation residues and biomass sludge taken from the fermentation bioreactor were added as fermentation substrate and seeding sludge, respectively. To prepare the seeding sludge for batch experiments, 1L of examined sludge sample was centrifuged at 6000rpm for 5min. The supernatants were discarded and the solids were resuspended in a 1L glass bottle containing 800mL of the substrate. The bottles were flushed with oxygen free nitrogen gas before capped tightly with rubber septum stoppers. The bottles were incubated at 37°Cin a water bath tank equipped with magnetic stirred machines at a rotational rate of 120rpm. The pH of the mixed liquor was automatically controlled by feeding with either NaOH (10%) or H3PO4 (5%).The total volume of gases produced during fermentation was determined using a gas collection system with water displacement and gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC). Samples were frequently taken throughout the batch experiments for the determination of alcohols and organic acids using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Biogas collected from bioreactors and batches was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2m stainless column was packed with Hayesep Q (60/80mesh) and installed in a 60°C oven. The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were all set at 60°C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15mL/min. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, and sugars were determined using a HPLC (Hitachi D2000 system, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an ICSep COREGEL-87H3 column (7.8×300mm) in a 42°C oven and a RI Range 16× detector. The eluent used was0.008N sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The carbohydrate was analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (Herbert et al., 1971).The pH, Oxidation–Reduction Potential (ORP), NH4 +-N and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to standard methods (APHA, 1995)."
5,DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR),"2.4 DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) The genomic DNA samples in biomass taken from H2 bioreactor were extracted using Ultraclean™ Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Solana Beach, CA). To determine the DNA extraction efficiency, concentrations of DNA were measured with a spectrophotometer NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To amplify approximate 500-bp fragment of [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase functional gene for the clone library analysis, PCR-reactions were performed by using a primer set including a forward primer HydH1f (5′-TTIACITSITGYWSYCCIGSHTGG-3′) and a reverse primer HydH3r (5′-CAICCIYMIGGRCAISNCAT-3′) (Schmidt et al., 2010). The thermal profile used for the amplification was as follows: a hot start at 95°C for 10min, 30cycles of denaturation (45s at 94°C), annealing (45s at 55°C) and extension (90s at 72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 3min."
6,"Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenic analysis","2.5 Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenic analysis PCR products (nearly 600bp) of HydH1f and HydH3r were resolved by gel electrophoresis with 1.6% agarose gel, and meaningful band were cut from the gel to undergo DNA extraction and purification using Gene-Spin™ 1-4-3 DNA Extraction Kit (Protech Technology Enterprise Co., Ltd.). The purified products were ligated to vectors with pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI) and placed at 4°C overnight with the total reaction volume of 10ml containing 2× Rapid Ligation Buffer 5ml, pGEM®-T Easy Vector (50ng) 1ml, T4 DNA Ligase 1ml, and PCR products 3ml. The ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells and incubated at 37°C. About 100 randomly selected clones were used for PCR reaction using the primer set M13F (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′) and M13R (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern analyses, with restriction enzymes Hha I and Taq I, were performed to determine the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers. Plasmids of clones in each OTU were extracted using High-Speed Plasmid Mini Kit (Geneaid) and DNA sequencing reactions were performed using ABI 3100 and 3730 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were aligned with BioEdit software and using the basic local alignment search tool program (BLAST) developed by US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Altschul et al., 1990)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Performance of the Hydrogen fermentation bioreactor,"3.1 Performance of the Hydrogen fermentation bioreactor The experimental results of performance for the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor obtained at different operational conditions are summarized in Table 3 . In general, the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor was able to achieve conversion efficiency for carbohydrate in the range of 64–82% during this study. The highest efficiency of 82% was attained in the Run 2 when the bioreactor was operated at a volumetric loading rate (VLR) of 19.7kgCOD/m3/day. For the operational conditions investigated, the biomass concentrations of the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor seemed to increase with an increased VLR. For the hydrogen production performance obtained, including specific rate and yield, the Run 1–2 was found to be the worst among all investigated conditions, despite that carbohydrate consumption of Run 1–2 was 72%. The soluble metabolites in the effluent of the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor at different conditions are shown in Table 3. It was clear that, in addition to xylose, lactate was completely utilized in all operational conditions. Among these measured metabolites, acetate and butyrate were the major soluble end products in the bioreactor, while ethanol remained the same concentration without observable change."
9,Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests at different S 0/X 0 ratio and X 0,"3.2 Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests at different S 0/X 0 ratio and X 0 Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests were conducted in order to evaluate hydrogen production potential using sludge taken from the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor during the Run 1–2 operation with a minimum hydrogen production performance. Fig. 1 presents the results of accumulative hydrogen production during fermentative biohydrogen batch experiments at different initial substrate-to-biomass ratios (S 0/X 0) and initial biomass concentrations (X 0).During 96h of batch experiments, hydrogen production was observed at S 0/X 0 ratios lower than 40g COD/g VSS, suggesting that Run 1–2 sludge could potentially produce hydrogen from ethanol fermentation residues but optimization of substrate to biomass ratio (or F/M ratio) is required for bioreactor operation. In comparison of hydrogen production of batches, a higher hydrogen production was observed at a higher substrate addition (24000mgCOD/L), but a higher S 0/X 0 ratio also caused a longer lag-phase for hydrogen evolution (Liu and Shen, 2004), especially with a lower initial biomass concentration. This observation agreed with previous studies that increasing the sucrose concentration, hence loading rate, led to a decrease in the hydrogen production of batch (Van Ginkel et al., 2001) and continuous systems (Kyazze et al., 2006)."
10,Metabolism of fermentative biohydrogen from ethanol fermentation residues,"3.3 Metabolism of fermentative biohydrogen from ethanol fermentation residues During anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose and starch, several volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols are produced as major primary metabolites, depending on microorganisms and environments present in the bioreactor (Gottschalk, 1986). According to the metabolic pathways and stoichiometric relationships proposed for anaerobic glucose fermentation, hydrogen production is accompanied with the production of acetate and butyrate, but not with production of formate, propionate, and lactate (Ljungdahl et al., 1989). For the fermentative biohydrogen test of S 0/X 0 =26.7 with X 0 =900mgVSS/L, concentration profiles of xylose and soluble metabolites were monitored during batch experiment as shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2, xylose was rapidly consumed during the first 20h of experiment without any delay, while only little hydrogen production was observed in the first 28h. Accompanied with xylose consumption, noticeable amount of lactate and acetate was produced. Butyrate was also produced but it occurred after 48h of batch experiment. During butyrate production, substantial amount of lactate was consumed with slight acetate consumption, and hydrogen was largely produced at the same period. This pattern did not follow those previously proposed for fermentative hydrogen production from glucose, but it seemed to agree with the pathway that has been discussed for hydrogen production from lactate and acetate. In a bioreactor fed with maltose-containing wastewater, Juang et al. (2011) has observed that maltose consumption was mainly used for production of biomass, lactate, and acetate, while hydrogen and butyrate production involved metabolism of lactate and acetate. Although this occurrence was seldom mentioned for fermentative biohydrogen, lactate and acetate utilization accompanied with butyrate and hydrogen production has been discussed. By feeding kitchen wastes under a thermophilic condition, Lee et al. (2008) conducted batch experiments and observed possible connection between hydrogen production and lactate/acetate utilization. Indeed, previous studies have mentioned that some Clostridium species were able to utilize lactate/acetate to hydrogen (Balows et al., 1992; Jo et al., 2008). By examining isolated Clostridium diolis, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium beijerinckii from slurry solution, Matsumoto and Nishimura (2007) concluded that these species can produce hydrogen from utilization of lactate and acetate. Furthermore, Juang et al. (2011) summarized stoichiometric equations proposed in previous studies and suggested that approximately 1mol of lactate and 0.43–0.5mol of acetate utilization formed 0.5–0.6mol of hydrogen and 0.7–0.83mol of butyrate."
11,The relationship of B/A ratio and hydrogen yield,"3.4 The relationship of B/A ratio and hydrogen yield In Fig. 2, in the batch experiment of S 0/X 0 =26.7mgCOD/mg VSS with X 0 =900mgVSS/L, acetate started to increase after hydrogen production ceased. A considerable decrease in butyrate and ethanol coincided with the increase of acetate. These observations suggest that the acetogenesis may occur in the hydrogen bioreactor during Run 1–2, when the highest acetate and lowest hydrogen were observed. According to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, the acetogenesis was a hydrogen-consuming reaction in which hydrogen was used to reduce carbon dioxide for acetate production (Siriwongrungson et al., 2007; Ohnishi et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). Hussy et al. (2003) studied hydrogen production from wheat starch and observed that hydrogen yield decreased corresponded to an increase of acetate level, indicating that a metabolic shift toward to the acetogenesis occurred. Baghchehsaraeea et al. (2008) studied the effect of heat pretreatment at different temperature on fermentative hydrogen production and also observed a net decrease in hydrogen accompanied with an increase of acetate during batch experiment. Indeed, a loss of the produced gas in the later phase of batch experiments, suggesting that H2 and CO2 were consumed through the acetogenesis. This observation confirmed that an extremely low biogas production observed during Run 1–2 may be attributed to the acetogenesis. The butyrate to acetate ratio (B/A ratio) has been considered an effective indicator for evaluating hydrogen yield, with a higher B/A ratio corresponding to a higher hydrogen yield (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Liu et al., 2011).The correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio found in the hydrogen bioreactor is presented in Fig. 3 . In general, the correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio observed in this study shared the similar trend found in previous studies. Following the metabolism of glucose for fermentative hydrogen production, theoretically, 4mol or 2mol of hydrogen are produced by converting 1mol of glucose to 2mol of acetate or 1mol of butyrate, respectively. The stoichiometry apparently disagrees the correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio observed in many studies. Although this argument can be explained by thermodynamic and metabolic considerations for biohydrogen production (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Liu et al., 2011), the current study provides additional explanations for the commonly observed linkage between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio, especially in systems fed with organic wastes for mixed cultures. Two mechanisms were proposed for the higher hydrogen yield observed at a higher B/A ratio condition in this study. The first mechanism is the metabolism of lactate and acetate for butyrate and hydrogen production observed in the current and previous studies. As summarized in Table 4 , Eqs. 1–3 suggest that consumption of acetate and lactate for production of butyrate and hydrogen can occur in anaerobic fermentation processes, leading to a higher hydrogen yield at a higher B/A ratio condition. Although this mechanism may be rare in the systems fed with pure substrates like glucose, it can happen in systems fed with organic wastes (Lee et al., 2008; Juang et al., 2011; Cavinato et al., 2011). The second mechanism is the H2 and CO2or butyrate consumption for acetate production through the acetogenesis. As shown in Table 4, Eqs. 4 and 5 indicate that production of acetate from consumption of H2 and CO2 or butyrate may take place (Hussy et al., 2003; Baghchehsaraeea et al., 2008), resulting in a lower hydrogen yield at a lower B/A ratio condition. Therefore, in addition to the methanogenesis, the acetogenesis should be avoided in the fermentative biohydrogen systems in order to maintain a high hydrogen production performance."
12,Microbial community of hydrogen-producing bacteriain the bioreactor,"3.5 Microbial community of hydrogen-producing bacteriain the bioreactor Cloning and sequencing of [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase functional gene fragments were performed for the samples taken from the H2 fermentation bioreactor in order to evaluate the microbial ecology of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Among the total 92clones retrieved, one operational taxonomic unit (OTU), representing 64% of the clones retrieved, was identified to be closely related to Clostridium tyrobutyricum JM1 (Jo et al., 2008), with a similarity of 98%. The remaining clones were phylogenetically related to Ethanoligenens harbinense (9.8%), C. perfringens (6.5%), C. botulinum (1.1%), and Parabacteroides distasonis (1.1%), although the similarities were lower than 75%. Therefore, C. tyrobutyricum was considered the major hydrogen-producing bacteria in the hydrogen bioreactor fed with rice straw bioethanol residues.C. tyrobutyricum has been widely reported for its ability of producing hydrogen from utilizing different sugars such as glucose and xylose (Ljungdahl et al., 1989; Balows et al., 1992; Zhu and Yang, 2004; Lin et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011; Whang et al., 2011).It has been considered to be responsible for the cause of fouling or late-blowing of cheese, because its ability of converting lactate to butyrate and H2 in the presence of acetate (Balows et al., 1992). By examining C. tyrobutyricum, Zhu and Yang (2004)have emphasized the importance of several key enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), NAD-independent LDH (iLDH), phosphotransacetylase (PTA), phosphotransbutyrylase (PTB), acetate kinase (AK) and butyratekinase (BK), involving in metabolism of xylose to form fermentation end products such as lactate, butyrate, and acetate. It is likely that C. tyrobutyricumis able to perform a metabolic shift through the above enzymes in a situation where carbohydrate is limited while lactateis available. Indeed, Diez-Gonzalez et al. (1995) has proposed the metabolic pathway of C. acetobutylicum strain P262 for the utilization of lactate and confirmed that acetate is required as an electron acceptor. Although the growth rate of C. acetobutylicum on lactate and acetate (0.05h-1) is much lower than that onglucose (0.67h-1) (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995), the conversion of lactate and acetate to butyrate and hydrogen is thermodynamically favorable (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995; Hashsham et al., 2000; Matsumoto and Nishimura, 2007; Jo et al., 2008)."
13,Performance of the methane fermentation bioreactor and overall bioenergy recovery from the two-stage bioprocesstreating organic residues of ethanol fermentation,"3.6 Performance of the methane fermentation bioreactor and overall bioenergy recovery from the two-stage bioprocesstreating organic residues of ethanol fermentation In the methane fermentation bioreactor, methane-producing microorganisms utilized organic residues in the effluent of the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor and produced methane gas. The experimental results of performance of the methane fermentation bioreactor obtained at different operational conditions are summarized in Table 5 . In general, the methane fermentation bioreactor was able to attain a COD removal efficiency around 75%, with the highest COD removal efficiency of 85% achieved in the Run 1. Indeed, methane gas, being the major product of the biogas produced, accounted for more than 70% in all the experimental runs. In summary, the methanogens enriched in the bioreactor were able to convert organic acids, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, to methane gas, but the VLR for the methane fermentation bioreactor required optimization. The results of electron distribution, in the form of COD, during fermentation processes in the hydrogen and methane fermentation bioreactors were calculated. For the hydrogen and methane fermentation bioreactors treating rice straw bioethanol fermentation residues, around1.3% and 66.1% of COD were recovered as hydrogen and methane gases, respectively. After these two fermentation processes, around 5.9% of COD, in the form of solid COD, were converted to biomass, while 25% of COD remained in the effluent as residues. However, the remaining COD in the effluent of the methane bioreactor included 6.7% of carbohydrate, 10.4% of acetate and 7.3% of propionate, indicating the operational condition of CH4 bioreactor was not optimized and required further improvement."
14,Conclusions,"A two-stage bioprocess was evaluated for recovering hydrogen and methane while treating organic residues generated during rice straw bioethanol fermentation process. Controlling a proper VLR, substrate-to-biomass ratio, or F/M ratio is important to maximizing biohydrogen production. C. tyrobutyricum, the major hydrogen-producing bacteria enriched in the hydrogen bioreactor, is likely utilizing lactate and acetate for biohydrogen production. The occurrence of acetogenesis may reduce the B/A ratio and hydrogen production. Finally, approximately 75% of COD in rice straw bioethanol residues can be removed and among that 1.3% and 66.1% of COD can be recovered in the forms of hydrogen and methane."
