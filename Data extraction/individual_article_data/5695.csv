0,Introduction,"The demand for biomaterials and bioenergy is increasing, due to the exhaustion of fossil energy sources and the deterioration of the environment. And it is necessary to find inexpensive and sustainable liquid fuels that can replace the current petrochemical resources (Lee, Yoshioka, & Shiraishi, 2015). Lignocellulosic biomass which is a composite material predominantly constructed by cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin together with trace extracts and minerals (Yang, Yan, Chen, Zheng, & Liang, 2006), is liquefied to produce fuels and chemicals (Lee, Yoshioka, & Shiraishi, 2015). Liquefaction is an effective technology to convert lignocellulosic biomasses into valuable liquid materials (Li et al., 2015; Lin, Yao, & Shiraishi, 2001). The liquefaction, using suitable liquefying agent and catalyst, is regarded as a potential technology to replace petroleum-based products with biomass, and it has attracted special the attention of researchers all over the world (Breunig, Gebhart, Hornung, Kruse, & Dinjus, 2017). The liquefaction of wood biomass with liquefying agent (phenol or polyhydric alcohol) at atmospheric pressure has been studied extensively and deeply (Lin, Yao, Yoshioka, & Shiraishi, 2004; Pu & Shiraishi, 1993a, 1993b). Various catalysts have been synthesized, such as bifunctional organocatalyst (ES-SO3 − C5H5NH+) (Verma, Jain, & Sain, 2011) and heterogeneous catalysts prepared by grafting highly dispersed Pd-nanoparticles onto amino-functionalized nanocrystalline starch (Verma et al., 2013). However, the research on biomass liquefaction process has always been the focus of their attention. Discernment of the intermediates produced by the liquefaction of cotton cellulose using water and phenol and the related liquefaction process were investigated (Yamada, Ono, Ohara, & Yamaguchi, 1996). From the results analysis, we could conclude that the cellulose was degraded to oligosaccharides at high temperature and humid heat conditions, and then oligosaccharides continued to be decomposed into glucose in the presence of phenol. Moreover, the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was produced after continuous dehydration of glucose. The generation of HMF may cause the reaction with phenol and/or of HMF by itself to form compounds containing furan ring structures. The research on polyhydric alcohols liquefaction of biomass has also made some achievements. Wood processing residues were liquefied at low temperature in the presence of glycerol, diethylene glycol (DEG) and p-toluenesulfonic acid by ultrasound-assisted solvolysis and acidolysis. The liquid products were treated by hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking with various catalysts and studied by Grilc (Grilc, Likozar, & Levec, 2014; Grilc, Likozar, & Levec, 2014; Grilc, Veryasov, Likozar, Jesih, & Levec, 2015). The composition of the liquefied commercial cellulose from linter pulp using ethylene glycol (EG) was discussed by Yamada (Yamada & Ono, 2001). Tests revealed that the cellulose was decomposed in the initial phase of liquefaction to produce lots of EG-glucosides. After that, some glycosides were degraded to levulinates with the liquefaction reaction. In 2007, the degradation mechanism of cellulose was further explored in an acid-catalyzed with ethylene carbonate (EC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Yamada, Aratani, Kubo, & Ono, 2007). Results expressed that the mechanism of solvolysis reaction was the same in the presence of PEG or EC. In 2004, the polyalcohol liquefaction process of cellulose powder, alkali lignin, steamed lignin and mixtures of them was studied (Kobayashi, Asano, Kajiyama, & Tomita, 2004). The results showed the wood was immediately liquefied to convert into soluble in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), then the polymerization took place and the residue insoluble DMF was produced with the prolongation of reaction time. Additionally, the condensation reaction was attributed to the interaction between lignin-degraded aromatic derivant and depolymerized cellulose or because of cellulose nucleophilic substitution caused by phenoxide anion. At present, there are few studies on the non-wood liquefaction process, which need to be further studied. Nowadays, the research on reaction process of non-wood liquefaction is vague and needs to be further studied. In this article, corn stalk was liquefied by 1,2-propylene glycol (PG) and DEG liquefaction with an acid catalyst, and a systematic exploration of characteristics of liquefied bio-oils was performed to provide an efficient process for generating bio-oil from liquefaction of corn stalk and discovered more potential applications in diverse areas. The main idea is to understand the degradation process of corn stalk via the investigation on the liquefaction process of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin directly which were separated from corn stalk, respectively. In addition, the main components, functional groups and organics structure of corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and liquid products followed with liquefaction were characterized by the methods such as FTIR, NMR, GCMS, and TGA. The findings here contribute to understanding the mechanism of the non-wood biomass polyhydric alcohol liquefaction, while also providing theoretical foundation and technical support for the existing related liquefaction technology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn stalk (20- to 80-mesh) was obtained from farmland located in Tianjin, China. It was kept in a desiccator for utilization after drying for 12 h at 105 °C. The main chemical composition of corn stalk used was as follows: lignin, 17.38%; cellulose, 36.89%; hemicellulose, 20.42%; alcohol extract, 13.80%; and ash, 2.43%. The lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose were directly separated from the aforementioned corn stalk powder. The separation process was shown in Scheme 1 (Lv & Wu, 2012). The main chemicals (e.g., concentrated phosphoric acid, PG, DEG, 1, 4-dioxane and pyridine) were analytical purity. The silane reagent (BSTFA 90%, TMCS 10%) and potassium bromide were chromatographic purity. These solvents were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical (China). Acetone-d6, DMSO-d6, and D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (USA)."
3,Liquefaction of samples,"2.2 Liquefaction of samples Corn stalk and its biomass components were liquefied using DEG mixed PG (1:2 ω/ω) based on 5/1 liquid/solid and 10% dosage of phosphoric acid which was catalyst in the high pressure reactor (PARR 4848, USA) under atmospheric pressure. Then the mixture was liquefied under the optimized condition of my experiment of 45 min liquefaction time and 170 °C reaction temperature. After 45 min, the reactor temperature was decreased to 30 °C via the cooling water."
4,Preparation of bio-oil and residue,"2.3 Preparation of bio-oil and residue The resultant after the liquefaction were diluted by an amount in excess of water and 1,4-dioxane mixed liquid (1:4/V:V). The diluted liquefaction products was separated into residue and filtrate by a TGL-20 M high-speed refrigerated centrifuge (Xiangyi centrifuge instrument co. LTD., China). After centrifugation, the concentrate (bio-oil) was prepared after the organic solvent was removed from the supernatant using rotary evaporation at 40 °C. The residue was thoroughly rinsed with recovered 1,4-dioxane and deionized water, and dried to constant weight at 105 °C."
5,Characterization of liquefaction products,"2.4 Characterization of liquefaction products 2.4.1 FTIR measurements In this measurement, KBr film was prepared from a mixture of dried sample and KBr (1:100, ω/ω). Afterwards, transmittance measurements were tested by a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrophotome at the 400–4000 cm−1 wave number. 2.4.2 NMR measurements The 13C solid NMR spectra (13C CP/MAS NMR) of torrefied samples (corn stalk and cellulose), were performed on a VARIAN Infinityplus 300 solid Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer, with a cross-polarization (CP) and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) at room temperature. 1H and 13C NMR analysis were acquired on hemicellulose in D2O solutions and lignin in DMSO-d6 with an AVANCE III 400 M instrument. At room temperature, bio-oil dissolved in Acetone-d6 was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR using Brooke AVANCE III 400 M NMR spectrometer at 125.8 MHz. 2.4.3 GC–MS measurements The solvent of bio-oil (20 mg) was blown dry in nitrogen atmospheres. Subsequently, the sample was put in a vacuum drying oven at 40 °C for 30 min. Then silanization reaction took 45 min at 70 °C after inserting 80 μL pyridine and 150 μL BSTFA-TMCS. And the solution was filtered with 0.22 μL microporous membrane (organic system). Finally, the main components of the treated sample were carried out a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (7890A-5975C, Agilent, USA) with a capillary column (HP-5MS, Agilent, USA) of 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm. 2.4.4 TGA measurements Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of bio-oil (5 mg) was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT650, TA Instruments, USA) from room temperature to 600 ℃ in the heating rate of 10℃/min at nitrogen atmospheres."
6,Results and discussion,
7,FTIR spectra characterization,"3.1 FTIR spectra characterization FTIR spectra of raw materials and liquefaction products from hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and corn stalk were displayed in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1A (b), the absorption signals of hemicellulose glycosyl units were mainly concentrated at 1600-800 cm−1 (Peng & Wu, 2010; Sun, Lawther, & Banks, 1998; Sun, Sun, Fowler, & Baird, 2005). There was a strong C-1 group frequency vibration signal at 898 cm−1 for β-glucosidic bonds between sugar units. At 1163 and 1045 cm−1, the signals were assigned to COC stretching vibration of sugar unit. The broadband observed at 1170-1000 cm−1 was indicated the typical signal of xylan (Teleman, Lundqvist, Tjerneld, Stålbrand, & Dahlman, 2000), which implied that xylose with pyranoid ring structure was the main component of hemicellulose. The signals appeared at 1163, 992, and 3423 cm−1 were attributed to arabinose side chain, bending vibration of xylose C3 H, and vibrational OH stretching of sugar units, respectively. In Fig. 1 A (c), compared with the intensity of the signals for hemicellulose (curve b), the absorption signals of hemicellulose glycosyl units were mainly concentrated at 1600-800 cm−1. These characteristic absorption signals of hemicellulose liquefaction residue (curve c) weakened or even disappeared, indicating that hemicellulose was almost completely liquefied. The strong signal of unconjugated vibrational CO stretching appeared at 1700 cm−1 (Kolsi et al., 2017), indicating that the liquefaction residue contained carbonyl or carboxyl compounds produced by hemicellulose degradation. The FTIR of hemicellulose bio-oil was shown in Fig. 1 A (a), the signal at 1700 cm−1 was originated from the stretching of CO, corresponding to aldehydes, ketones, ester and carboxylic groups. The broadband between 1300 and 950 cm−1 was assigned to C–O stretching and OH bending vibration, which existed in the tertiary, secondary and primary alcohols. Therefore, it was considered that hemicellulose had been degraded to produce bio-oil containing alcohols, acids, ethers, as well as liquefaction residue containing carbonyl or carboxyl groups under this liquefaction condition. Fig. 1 B (b) illustrated the FTIR absorption signal positions of cellulose obtained from corn stalk. Although cellulose and hemicellulose had similar oxygen-containing functional groups, their infrared spectra could show their unique structural characteristics to some extent (Yang, Yan, Chen, Dong, & Zheng, 2007). The bending vibration signal of C1 H appeared at 894 cm−1 and existed in the β-(1→4)-glucosidic bond. At 1058 cm−1, the signal represented CO bending vibration linkage in glucosidic bond. The signal at 1371-1310 cm−1 for stretching of CO or CH, and 1113 cm−1 for stretching vibration of inner ring. The FTIR of cellulose liquefaction residue was illustrated in Fig. 1 B (c) and compared with cellulose (curve b). It was found that the signal intensity at 1317 and 1160 cm−1 weakened or even disappeared, while the other characteristic absorption signals increased after liquefaction. It might be explained that cellulose was not completely liquefied and the liquefaction residue contained unreacted cellulose. The FTIR of bio-oil from cellulose was seen in Fig. 1 B (a), the ether linkage appeared at 1150-950 cm−1. A strong signal at 1710 cm−1 was agreeable with CO stretching. At the same time, CH stretching signal of alkanes at 1458 cm−1 could also be found. It indicated that the bio-oil produced by liquefaction of cellulose mainly contained alcohols, acids, ethers and esters. The significant absorption signals of lignin and its liquefaction products (bio-oil and residue) were presented in Fig. 1 C. Spectra of lignin isolated from corn stalk were shown in Fig. 1 C (b). Strong absorption signals were found in both 1599 and 1508 cm−1, which were characteristics of aromatic skeletal in lignin polymers (Sarkanen, 1971). It indicated that the core of macromolecule did not change clearly in the process of extracting lignin from corn stalk. The signal of syringyl (S) ring appeared at 1122 cm−1. In comparison, the guaiacyl (G) ring signal was only observed at the shoulder of 1170 cm−1. CH signal which was out of plane in p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units was seen at 833 cm−1. It was confirmed that G, S and H units existed in lignin separated from corn stalk. The FTIR of lignin liquefaction residue was displayed in Fig. 1 C (c) and compared with that of lignin (curve b). The characteristic absorption signals of lignin were obviously weakened or even disappeared. The intensity of signal at 1508 and 833 cm−1 was weaker than that of lignin. It suggested that most lignin was liquefied and degraded, and the residue contained included a number of aromatic skeletal and H units. As seen in Fig. 1 C (a), the existence of the absorption signals of lignin bio-oil at 3600-3200 cm−1 for OH stretching, 1550-1490 cm−1 for aromatic skeletal, and 1150-950 cm−1 for COC vibration (Li et al., 2017), which showed that the main components of bio-oil from lignin were alcohols, phenols and ethers. Fig. 1 D showed the FTIR absorption signals of the corn stalk and liquefaction products. OH stretching signals of alcohols and phenols were found at 3600-3200 cm−1 of all samples. The signals at 3000-2800 cm−1 corresponded to the C–H stretching for the alkanes which could also be seen in all samples (Ju et al., 2011; Verma et al., 2013). As could be seen from Fig. 1 D (b), basic signals of typical three components of corn stalk were showed, such as cellulose characteristic signals (3419, 1048, and 894 cm−1), characteristic signals of benzene ring (1620, 1512, 1424, 1250, 830 and 662 cm−1), and carbonyl characteristic signals (1714 cm−1). Compared with the corn stalk curve Fig. 1 D (b), most of the lignin characteristic signals of liquefaction residue curve Fig. 1 D (c) were weakened or even disappeared, but the intensity of signal at 1620 cm−1 increased which was assigned to CO stretching in conjugation to aromatic ring. Furthermore, the signal of glucosidic bond stretching vibrations in residue at 894 cm−1 weakened significantly after liquefaction, indicating that carbohydrates were distinctly changed. However, the remarkable enhancement at 1714 cm−1 corresponding to CO stretching in residue was assigned to the aldehydes, ketones or ester groups linkage to benzene rings and carbohydrates from corn stalks. It might be an explanation that a lot of carbonyl compounds were generated from the degradation of carbohydrates, or the formation of stable structures which were the basic unit of lignin connected by the aldehyde group in the liquefaction. The intensity of the characteristic absorption signals of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose were weakened and even disappeared. It was expounded that most of the biomass components in corn stalk were liquefied during the liquefaction process, and cellulose was more difficult to liquefy than lignin and hemicellulose, which was due to the almost decomposition of hemicellulose and lignin at the initial stage of reaction (Zhang, Pang, Shi, Fu, & Liao, 2012). Liquefaction residues mainly included unreacted cellulose and polycondensates which reacted again after liquefaction degradation of three components. At Fig. 1 D (a), the absorption signal intensity of OH in liquefied bio-oil at 3419 cm−1 was weaker than that of corn stalk (curve b). This was ascribed to the condensation reaction between the hydroxyl groups in the liquefied corn stalk and the acid catalyst and alcohols liquefier to produce water or other small molecules. Compared with the intensity of the signals in corn stalk, the intensity of the absorption signals of the liquefied product weakened or even disappeared at 1714-1374 and 1250-1048 cm−1. However, the strong signal was found at 1008 cm-1. This was mainly attributed to the formation of new substances due to the degradation of the lignin molecules and the gradual decrease in late liquefaction of the polyhydric alcohol liquefaction agents."
8,1H and 13C NMR spectrometry characterization,"3.2 1H and 13C NMR spectrometry characterization 1H NMR spectrometry has regularly been used to characterize the qualitative structure of biomass components. CP/MAS 13C-NMR spectra of cellulose and corn stalk, 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR spectra of hemicellulose and lignin were illustrated in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 A (b) presented the 1H NMR spectra of hemicellulose. The signals of hydrogen atoms in the range of δ 4.5-4.0 ppm were assigned to the β-d-xylose units linked to the C-3 or C-2 of the main chain. The signals at δ 5.34 and 5.24 ppm corresponded to the hydrogen atoms agreeable with α-d-furanoarabinose end groups linked to the C-3 of the xylose group in the main chain. Signal originating from solvent (δ 4.72 ppm) was clearly visible in the spectrum. Moreover, the hydrogen atoms of d-glucuronic acid residues and methyl in the acetic ester group appeared at δ 3.41 and 1.96 ppm, respectively. It indicated that a large number of acetyl groups remain intact in hemicellulose structure after the hemicellulose separation process due to the mild alkali treatment conditions. In addition, the peaks of the δ 3.5-3.0 ppm corresponded to the proton peak of the hemicellulose side chain (arabinose and the xylose), which manifested that branched chain glycosyl group of hemicellulose structure side chains from corn stalk were the α-l-furanoarabinose and the β-d-xylopyranose. The 1H-NMR spectrum of lignin was separated from the corn stalk as shown in Fig. 2 A (c). The chemical shifts of aromatic protons were found at δ 8.0-6.0 ppm for S and G units. In particular, the clear signal at δ 7.50 ppm was ascribed to aromatic and olefin protons in p-ferulic and p-coumaric acids, which were normally observed in grass lignin. Methoxyl protons appeared two obvious signals at δ 3.76 and 3.46 ppm. The proton of carboxyl or aldehyde group performed a weak signal at δ 10.08 ppm. The peaks between δ 1.5 and 0.8 ppm were derived from aliphatic moiety in the lignin fractions (Tejado, Pena, Labidi, Echeverria, & Mondragon, 2007). Additionally, there was a dominant signal at δ 2.53 ppm, which can be assigned to solvent (DMSO-d6). The two small signals at δ 4.93 and 4.40 ppm were in keeping with Hαand Hγ in β-O-4́ linkages, respectively (Lapierre, Lallemand, & Monties, 1982). The CP/MAS 13C-NMR spectra of corn stalk presented signals agreeable with distinguished type carbons in biomass components, of which the structure was presented in Fig. 2 B (d). The signals of carbonyl, aromatic, alkoxy, methoxyl and aliphatic could been observed in the ranges of 200-160, 160-110, 110-60, 57-56 and 46-0 ppm, respectively. The signals at δ 20.84 and 174.25 ppm were attributable to methyl carbons of acetyl units and carbonyl carbons separately in hemicellulose. Signals between 110 and 60 ppm was mainly from cellulose. For instance, at δ 105.20, 74.82 and 72.69 ppm were associated with C-1/2/3/5 (Atichokudomchai, Varavinit, & Chinachoti, 2004) (The carbon in the sample was expressed numerically), while signals at δ 88.11, 84.27, and 64.48 ppm were originated from C-4 (crystalline), C-4 (amorphous), and C-6 (crystalline) of cellulose, respectively (Bardet, Foray, Maron, Goncalves, & Trân, 2004). C-1/4 of S and C-1 of G in etherified and non-etherified structures were indicated by signal at δ 134.41 ppm, while the δ 137.03 ppm was in accordance with its etherified structures. The signal at δ 115.61 ppm was primarily assigned to C-5 of G units in lignin. Besides, the signal of carbon atoms at δ 56.20 ppm was derived from methoxyl in lignin. 13C CPMAS spectrum of the corn stalk cellulose was given in Fig. 2 B (a). The signals of cellulose were predominantly appeared from 110 to 60 ppm. The signals of C-4 carbons at δ 92-82 ppm located in the structure domain of crystalline Iα and Iβ combined with para-crystalline cellulose. As for the C-4 signal of cellulose, the signal at δ 84.13 ppm came from the amorphous cellulose, while the signal peak at δ 88.58 ppm was assigned to crystalline cellulose. Furthermore, the signals at δ 64.81 and 62.73 ppm represented C-6 on crystalline and amorphous cellulose, respectively. Polysaccharide C-4 signals was used to estimate crystallinity of the various samples (Horii, Hirai, & Kitamaru, 1982). The signal at δ 105.03 ppm was attributable to C-1 of cellulose, whereas at δ 74.88 and 72.67 ppm signals were assigned to the overlapping resonance of C-2, C-3 and C-5 (Earl & Vanderhart, 1981; Tang, Wang, & Belton, 2000). 13C NMR spectrum of corn stalk hemicellulose was expressed in Fig. 2 B (b), the strong signals of main β-(1→4)-d-xylopyranose units were observed at δ 101.77, 72.81, 73.78, 76.45 and 63.07 ppm agreeable with C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-5 of the β-d-xylopyranose units, respectively (Lv, Wu, & Rui, 2010). Another group of signals at δ 107.74, 84.85, 80.84, 77.38 and 63.07 ppm respectively belonged to C-1, C-4, C-3, C-2, and C-5 of the α-l-arabinofuranose residues. A weak signal at δ 102.04 ppm was originated from galactose side chain. The signals at δ 96.65, 82.55, 72.31 and 70.92 ppm were due to C-1, C-4, C-3 and C-2 on 4-O-methoxyl group of glucuronic acid residues in xylan. Carboxyl, carbonyl and methoxyl groups of glucuronic acid correspond to signals at δ 181.34, 176.89 and 59.94 ppm, respectively. The signal at δ 23.33 ppm was derived from methyl group of acetyl group, which was very strong and in accord with the high acetyl group content. In addition, the absence of signals which ranged from 170 to 110 ppm in the NMR spectrum suggested that there was no lignin structure in the separation of hemicellulose from corn stalk. Hence, the hemicellulose which was separated from corn stalk was mainly composed of l-arabino-β-(1→4)-d-glucuronoxylan units. There are also a few sugar residues that were attached to the main chain in the form of side chains, such as galactose, glucose and glucuronic acid, which showed the typical characteristics of corn stalk hemicellulose (Peng & Wu, 2010). The 13C NMR spectrum of corn stalk lignin was listed in Fig. 2 B (c). The weak signal at 167.84 ppm represented the carbon in aliphatic carboxyl groups. The β-O-4´ structure (90.0-67.0 and 61.0-57.0 ppm) was an important feature of the lignin structural unit of corn stalk. Particularly, the signals at 84.00, 72.72 and 64.02 ppm were respectively in accordance with C-β, C-α and C-γ. The signals reflected on G unit carbons: 149.81 and 148.07 ppm for etherified C-3; 147.73, 147.51 and 147.29 ppm for etherified C-4; 145.46 and 144.80 ppm for unetherified C-4; 134.87 ppm for etherified C-1; 119.94 ppm for C-6; 114.46 ppm for C-5; 111.62 ppm for C-2, while S unit carbons were revealed at δ 152.86 and 152.43 ppm for C-3 or C-5; δ 147.81, 147.63 and 147.25 ppm for unetherified C-3 or C-5; δ 138.36 ppm for etherified C-4; δ 134.86 ppm for etherified C-1 and δ 104.31 ppm for C-2 or C-6. The H unit was indicated by signals at δ 130.64 ppm for C-2 or C-6, δ 125.54 ppm for C-5 orC-5´, and δ 116.40 ppm for C-3 or C-5. In addition, the signals at δ 115.35 and 56.39 ppm were originated from p-coumarate ester and methoxyl, respectively. Therefore, the structural resonances demonstrated that the lignin separated from corn stalk has a GSH-type of β-O-4 structure. Fig. 3 A represented the 1H-NMR spectrum of bio-oils using corn stalk and its biomass components by acid catalysis and polyol liquefaction. The bio-oils had been registered in acetone-d6 (δ = 2.06 ppm). In Fig. 3 A (a), the integral of all signals in the range of 1.50-0.85 ppm corresponding to the aliphatic moiety in bio-oils from cellulose, was indicative of the great degradation of cellulose. The peaks at 4.71 and 3.37 ppm could be attributed to aromatic protons in β-d-glucose, while sharp signals which were observed between 3.75 and 3.50 ppm showed that the molecular chains of cellulose were broken down by acid catalytic liquefaction, and some glucose units were formed. In other words, most of the cellulose in corn stalk was liquefied, but not completely, during the liquefaction process. Bio-oil from hemicellulose was a very complex mixture system which was observed in Fig. 3 A (b). The proton signals originating from aliphatic compound (δ 1.28-1.01), β-d-xylose (δ 3.27), Cα-H, Cβ-H, and Cγ-H (δ 4.15-4.05), methoxyl group (δ 3.87), and multiple peaks (δ 3.98 and 3.52 ppm) were clearly visible in the spectrum. It demonstrated that the hemicellulose was degraded extremely with treatment of polyhydric alcohols in the presence of phosphoric acid. With the extension of liquefaction time, some of the low molecular weight (LMW) compounds would regenerate and form new substances. The 1H-NMR spectrum of bio-oil from lignin was shown in Fig. 3 A (c). The disappearance of the characteristic signals of lignin at δ 6.05, 5.31, and 4.58 ppm for Hα in β-O-4/β-1, β-5, and β-β/protons in residual xylose, respectively, and δ 4.39 ppm for Hγ in β-O-4 structures, indicated that these bond structures were all broken during the liquefaction process and produced some new LMW compounds to express the degradation of lignin. Hence, lignin was completely liquefied when acid and polyhydric alcohols were used. The proton signals in the range of 3.7-3.5 ppm belonged to methoxyl groups, signals between 1.50 and 0.85 ppm came from hydrocarbons, and signal at 4.88 ppm might originated from aromatic derivatives, it displayed that with the liquefaction reaction, these LMW compounds would regenerate and produce new substances. The 1H-NMR spectrum of corn stalk bio-oil was seen in Fig. 3 A (d). The spectrum showed that plenty of proton signals at δ 4.6-3.0 ppm corresponded to Cα-H, Cβ-H and Cγ-H. The results exhibited that the liquefaction bio-oils from corn stalk had the same structure as that of bio-oils from single biomass component. The relatively multiple signals at 3.60 and 4.09 ppm suggested cellulose and hemicellulose in corn stalk produced β-d-glucose and β-d-xylose (the chemical shift had no signal here without liquefaction), and lignin in corn stalk produced portions on methoxyl linked to the aromatic nucleus under the acid condition. It could be considered that the three components of corn stalk prepared to be β-d-glucose, β-d-xylose and the structure of G-syringl were catalyzed by acid. In addition, the signal resonated in the range of 1.50-0.85 ppm gave rise to aliphatic groups, indicating that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin of corn stalk had a large degradation. The 13C-NMR spectra of bio-oils produced from cellulose (a), hemicellulose (b), lignin (c) and corn stalk (d) during the liquefaction catalyzed by H3PO4 were illustrated in Fig. 3 B. The sharp signal of protons in acetone-d6 appeared at δ 29.19 ppm. 13C-NMR spectrum of liquefied cellulose bio-oils was seen from Fig. 3 B (a). The signal resonated at 160-120 ppm shifts correspond with aromatic units and no signals were observed around this range, which clearly demonstrated that there was no lignin of the separated cellulose. At 110-60 ppm, dense signals were distributed to cellulose and its glucose, indicating that cellulose degradated to oligosaccharides and glucose. The numerous signals were emerged at 80-60 ppm which was assigned to methine carbon of pyranose unit of cellulose. It was well to be reminded that these sharp signals at δ 172.59, 37.51 and 27.64 ppm in the spectra due to C-5, C-4 and C-3 in levulinic acid structure. Therefore, it proved that levulinic acid was generated from glucose via HMF in acidic medium at high temperature (Feather & Harris, 1973). Moreover, there were carbons of alkanes at 40-10 ppm. This was attributed to alkanes though cellulose degradation or reaction of LMW alkanes and polyols. As could be seen from Fig. 3 B (b), a more intense signal was found at 80-60 ppm, which was the characteristic signal of hemicellulose, indicating that the glycosidic linkage of hemicelluloses degraded during the liquefaction of polyols in acid catalysis, but there were a wide variety of glycosyl groups and connections. Thus, hemicellulose degradated to compound oligosaccharides or monosaccharides. The results were consistent with the 1H-NMR of hemicellulose liquefied bio-oils. Theoretically, this was mainly due to the conversion of oligosaccharides into furfural substances in the presence of acids. The signals between 176 and 160 ppm were assignable to the carbon with carboxyl groups, which was caused by the hydrolysis of hemicellulose to sugar, mainly such as uronic acid and xylose. The chemical shift signal at 30-10 ppm was predominantly from alkane. This phenomenon indicated that hemicellulose degraded to alkanes or LMW alkanes. From the chemical shifts 135-130 ppm of the carbon atoms of the aromatic nucleus and the side chain double bonds, the hemicellulose contained a small amount of lignin after separation process. The side chain carbon atom characteristic signals of lignin were not observed at 86.9, 86.2, 85.2, 73.5 and 63.8 ppm in Fig. 3 B (c), which could clearly demonstrate that the lignin was degraded greatly and occurred on the side chain during the liquefaction catalyzed by phosphoric acid. The main reason was that the degradation of lignin was mostly the fracture of ether bonds, and the breakup of the β-O-4 bond was the main channel for liquefaction reaction. The signals at 180-160, 56.3 and 40-0 ppm represented carbon in carboxyl, methoxyl and aliphatic, respectively. It was explained that acids, methoxy groups and LMW alkanes were produced during liquefaction of lignin. There were weak signals in accordance with aromatic carbon in the range from 160 to 110 ppm, while the aliphatic carbon signals were mainly concentrated on 80-60 ppm corresponding to Cα, Cβ and Cγ in β-O-4 structures. It illustrated that the degradation of the lignin was more thorough or even ring-opening reaction. Moreover, new substances and corresponding derivatives were produced in the presence of PG and DEG as liquefying agents and H3PO4 as a catalyst. The 13C-NMR spectra of bio-oil obtained from liquefaction of corn stalk was shown in Fig. 3 B (d). On the whole, Fig. 3 B (d) basically contained the signals of 13C-NMR spectra of bio-oil derived from three components liquefaction. It could be observed that the abundant carbon atoms of acyl and carboxyl groups, aromatics, carbohydrates and aliphatics stemmed from integrating the signals in the ranges of 180-160, 160-120, 110-60 and 40-0 ppm, respectively. However, there was no methoxyl signal at 56.3 ppm which indicated that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin of corn stalk were severely degraded and formed LMW compounds in the process of liquefaction."
9,GC–MS characterization,"3.3 GC–MS characterization Hyphenated techniques such as GC–MS are very effective for the analysis of complicated mixtures and the identification of individual components. The total ion chromatograms (TIC) of bio-oil using corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were exhibited in Fig. S1 (a–d). TIC of the four kinds of bio-oils were similar, and the substances which were detected at the same peak time are basically alike, but the peak heights of the same substance were different, which showed that the content of this substance in bio-oil was very different. This indicated that the chemical components of bio-oils obtained from corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin had some commonalities and differences. The corresponding components and relative information of several types of bio-oil were summarized in Table S1. It expressed that bio-oil had certain commonality in chemical composition. Almost all of the components involved oxygen element, that is to say, there was high oxygen content which was unstable for the bio-oil. Moreover, the chemical groups of organic compounds in bio-oils were similar. However, the chemical substances composing the bio-oil and their respective amounts were different, and so were their molecular weights. The ratio of each TIC suggested unique features. Because of the small peak area and poor matching degree, some chromatographic peaks could not accurately analyze their corresponding compounds. 39, 40, 27 and 41 organic compounds were detected in the bio-oil liquefied from corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin respectively. Subsequently, these results were classified by functional groups so as to analyze and compare, as expressed in Fig. 4 . In general, chemical composition could be divided into several categories, that is, alcohols, phenols, acids, ethers, esters, ketones, alkenes and alkanes. Alcohols (10–30% PG and 25–30% DEG) were the most abundant in the four bio-oils obtained from corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and their relative contents were 70.70%, 89.13%, 98.60% and 82.86%, respectively. Therefore, bio-oils which were rich in hydroxyl groups could be directly applied to the production of agricultural or industrial membranes, polyurethane foam, and polyurethane adhesive. It could be discovered that all the typical bio-oils contained a certain amount of acids and ethers which could deriving from the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose (Zhang, Chang, Wang, & Xu, 2007; Zhang, Zhou, Liu, & Petrus, 2007), so that bio-oils were acidic and corrosive. Furthermore, most of the phenolic compounds, including phenol, 2-tertbutyl-6-methyl-phenol, and 4-[1-(4-Methoxy-phenyl)-1-methyl-ethyl]-phenol, were the second components in bio-oil from corn stalk or lignin which were produced via decomposition of LMW lignin. Aromatic derivatives were primarily derived from lignin depolymerization (Suet-Pin et al., 2011). However, no alkanes were detected in the bio-oils obtained from corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin respectively. The reason was that the bio-oil was silanized before the detection of GCMS."
10,TGA characterization,"3.4 TGA characterization The pyrolysis characteristics, both the derivative of the thermogravimetric (DTG) and thermogravimetric (TG) curves of bio-oils with corn stalk and three components, were exhibited in Fig. 5 (B) and (A), respectively. In Fig. 5 (A), the pyrolysis of corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were composed of four stages. The first stage (30–150 °C) resulting from the removal of water or light oil with carbon number of less than 10 (e.g., naphtha and refinery gas), the mass loss rates of the four bio-oils at this stage were about 40%, 23%, 38% and 28%, respectively. The second stage (150–350 °C) corresponding to pyrolyzation of compounds with a carbon number of 10–25 (e.g., heavy oil, kerosene and diesel oil), at this stage, the mass loss rates of the four bio-oils were about 40%, 60%, 48% and 53% respectively, indicating that the carbon number of most compounds in the three components ranged from 10 to 25. The comparison of mass loss rates of four bio-oils in these two stages showed that the synergistic effect of three components directly promoted liquefaction degradation of corn stalk. The third stage (350–450 °C) ascribing to the pyrolysis of carbon number of 25–35 substances such as lubricating oil and heavy fuel oil, the mass loss rate of the four bio-oils at this stage was low (<5%). The fourth stage (450–600 °C) deriving from the thermal decomposition of wax, gum and bitumen, whose carbon numbers were more than 35, and the mass loss rate of the four bio-oils was less than 5%. The mass loss rate of the four types of bio-oil was about 5%, 6%, 3%, and 8% at 350–600 °C, which showed that bio-oils obtained from liquefaction of lignin contained a small number of compounds whose carbon number was higher than 25. The main reason for the formation of carbonaceous residues was that the substances such as colloids, asphaltenes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil were produced by strong thermal decomposition and condensation. The carbonaceous residue yield of stalk bio-oil was about 15%, which was slightly higher than that of the other three samples (11%). It is attributed to mineral matters and other non-oily substances in corn stalks. Minerals have great potential effects on biomass pyrolysis (Yang et al., 2006). The DTG curve which is the first derivatives of the TGA curve is often plotted to promote defining the pyrolytic reactions. In parallel, the DTG was presented in Fig. 5 (B). The difference of the carbon number of each component in the bio-oil has discrepant boiling points, resulting in variant valley signals. The sharpest valley of bio-oil from corn stalk, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin occurred at 107, 195, 158 and 184 °C, and the corresponding maximum mass loss rate was 0.66, 0.67, 0.81, and 0.60%/°C, respectively. The maximum valley of corn stalk bio-oil demonstrated the significant mass loss due to the light oil components (carbon number less than 10) evaporation in the low temperature range. However, the maximum valley indicated that the intense weight losses of the other three kinds of bio-oils were caused by the low temperature oxidation reactions of a large number of compounds with carbon number of 10–15. In conclusion, the four types of bio-oil contained up to 80% compounds with carbon number less than 25, which could not only refine petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, but also be consistent with GC–MS analysis."
11,Degradation process of corn stalk PG/DEG liquefaction,"3.5 Degradation process of corn stalk PG/DEG liquefaction Cellulose macromolecules, under the action of high temperature and hydrogen-donor solvents (PG/DEG), might dehydrate and COC bond break to form glucan through free radical reaction. Glucan was further dehydrated, isomerized and cracked to produce substances containing CC and CO. With the liquefaction proceeding, the cleavage of CC, CO and OH bonds in glucan was promoted in the effect of free radicals, which resulted in a variety of free radicals, linear ketones, alcohols, acids and other substances. Under the influence of H·, ketones could be further decarbonylated and oxidized to produce acid compounds, which could be esterified with alcohols to form esters. The behavior of glucose and levulinic acid production by PG/DEG system was almost identical to that observed by EC/EG or PEG400/Gly system (Yamada et al., 2007). As shown in Scheme 2 , the liquefaction of cellulose catalyzed by PG/DEG and acid was a complicated reaction. When the liquefaction reaction started, cellulose was degraded to glucose, then it transformed to plenty of PG/DEG-glucosides. Furthermore, glucosides were converted into HMF derivatives. However, considerable HMF derivatives were decomposed and polymerized to produce levulinic acid and insoluble substances during the prolongation of reaction. This view was proved by previous reports (Yamada & Ono, 2001; Yamada et al., 2007). Scheme 3 demonstrated hemicellulose degradation process in polyhydric alcohols liquefaction. On the one hand, hemicellulose could be converted into furfurals via acid catalysis, which were very active because there were a furan ring and an aldehyde group. Polyol free radicals reacted with small intermediate molecules produced by liquefaction of hemicellulose, such as condensation and cyclization, which inhibited the further cracking and liquefaction of small intermediate molecules to form solid or gas products. Thus, small molecular fragments combined with polyol free radicals to form small molecular compounds such as alcohols, acids and ethers. Polyols could condense with degraded LMW substances or LMW substances produced by degradation and conversion under acidic conditions. For example, levulinic acid or glycosides from hemicellulose degradation reacted with polyols to form macromolecule compounds, which was one of the ways to generate polycondensation residues in the later liquefaction stage. On the other hand, it was degraded and formed all kinds of glucosides. After that, lots of glucosides were transformed into furfural derivatives. Finally, these derivatives generated LMW soluble substances and insoluble residues through decomposition and polymerization. As we all know, the β-O-4 phenolic-ether bond was one of the main structural groups in lignin. The ether bonds of some substances in lignin were broken with polyhydric alcohol under phosphoric acid catalysis. Particularly, β-O-4 linkages were cleaved and left a great quantity of phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. The chemical reaction of β-O-4 bond degradation was revealed in Fig. S2. Fig. S3 displayed the polycondensation reaction of degraded lignin and polyhydric alcohols. The esterification or substitution reaction of lignin degradation products and liquefaction agent (DEG/PG) in Cα, Cβ, Cγ and benzene ring produced large molecular esterification products or alkyl-ether with the basic structure of lignin. The behavior of lignin via liquefaction using PG and DEG as the liquefying agent could be clarified from Scheme 4 . At the early stages of the liquefaction, lignin may be degraded and produced abundant fragments by free radical reaction in the presence of high temperature and hydrogen-donor solvent (PG). Subsequently, these polymers formed LMW compounds due to the cleavage of side chain CC, CO and aromatic CO linkage. However, when liquefaction was prolonged, the decomposition of lignin may produce a large number of unstable free radicals, which could be combined with each other or with hydrogen atom of DEG/PG and polymerize into more stable macromolecules. When corn stalk was liquefied, there was a complex relationship of ""promotion"" or ""inhibition"" among its single components (Hosoya, Kawamoto, & Saka, 2007). From the results of various detections and analysis of liquefied products produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and corn stalk, there were the same product structures, which indicated that the three components of corn stalk in the liquefaction of polyols had a ""synergistic"" effect and directly promoted the liquefaction reaction of corn stalk. With the development of the reaction, some intermediates were generated during the degradation of corn stalk in the presence of DEG/PG, and these intermediates gradually had relative stability as time went on. In other words, in the early stage of liquefaction, the three components of corn stalk degraded into low molecular fragments by free radical reaction under the action of high temperature and hydrogen-donor solvent polyhydric alcohols. Subsequently, the chemical bonds such as COC, CO, CC and OH on these fragments were broke by dehydration, isomerization and pyrolysis to form various free radicals and small molecular weight compounds, such as ketones, alcohols, acids, ethers and phenols and so on. Acids produced by decarbonylation and oxidation of ketones under the action of H· could esterify with alcohols to generate esters. In the middle and late stages of the reaction, the liquefaction molecules which producedfrom the degradation of corn stalk in DEG/PG could have different degrees of polycondensation. Some large molecular substances (new residues) which were insoluble in organic solvents were produced, because the condensation reaction of each component inhibited the decomposition of corn stalk. These residues might be derived from the large molecular substances which generated by the reaction lignin, carbohydrate degradation products and liquefying agents at the beginning of the reaction, or from the macromolecule compounds reacted with the small molecules of lignin and saccharides degradation in the late stage of liquefaction, as well as from new polymer compounds produced by reactions between small molecules of lignin or carbohydrate degradation."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, the liquefaction degradation process of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and corn stalk in the presence of PG/DEG and acid catalysis had the similar trends. During the process of reaction, PG and DEG were not only hydrogen-donor solvents but also reagents. When they were used as hydrogen-donor solvents, some main chemical bonds could be broken, leading to the degradation of macromolecules into small molecules. When they were used as reaction reagents, PG/DEG derivatives were formed by the reaction of PG/DEG with some of the degraded small molecules. When they were used as solvents, the PG/DEG derivatives were dissolved and the condensation reaction between small molecules was slowed down or stopped. Hemicellulose and lignin were more easily degraded than cellulose in this liquefaction system. More than 80% of the components of bio-oil respectively obtained from the liquefaction of corn stalk, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose were less than 25 of the carbon number, and 70% alcohols was consisted in the bio-oil. In addition, liquefaction residues from corn stalk were mainly consisted of polycondenstates or derivatives produced by small molecules degraded by three components and the macromoleculars generated in the reaction of degradation products and PG/DEG."
