0,Introduction,"In recent decades, valorization of abundant biomass to platform chemicals and their derivatives has aroused extensive concerns worldwide due to the great potential as a reliable substitute of insufficient fossil resources (Li et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012). Among various biomass-derived molecules, furfural (FFR) and levulinic acid (LA) are the two of most versatile and promising building block chemicals that can be utilized as the frequently-used precursors for the catalytic synthesis of a variety of high value-added chemicals and fuel candidates such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-methylfuran, alkyl levulinates (LEs) and γ-valerolactone (GVL) (Gupta and Kantam, 2019; Jing et al., 2018; Millan et al., 2019; Tiong et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang and Chen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Particularly, the catalytic upgrading of FFR to FA as well as LA to GVL is of great significance because these two products have huge applications in many fields such as energy, chemical and medicine industry. The frequently used method for the efficient synthesis of FA and GVL requires the use of noble (Ru, Pt, and Pd) (Biradar et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2015; Ftouni et al., 2017a, 2016b; Gowda et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2016; F. Liu et al., 2019) or non-noble metal (Cu, Ni, and Co) (Chen et al., 2007; Grilc and Likozar, 2019; Gundekari and Srinivasan, 2017; He et al., 2019; Hirayama et al., 2019; D.W. Liu et al., 2019; Vargas-Hernández et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017) catalysts as well as high-purity hydrogen gas. Nevertheless, several obvious issues regarding the use of pressurized H2 are put forward, such as H2 storage, safety, transportation, solubility, and so on. In addition, H2 is primarily obtained from the reforming of non-renewable natural gas, petroleum or coal resources that gives rise to the critical problem of high-cost (Qi and Horvath, 2012; Yuan et al., 2013). On this basis, some practical alternatives in an economical, efficient and green manner are in great demand. In this sense, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is reported to be a good solution in recent years, where formic acid and lower alcohols already have been developed as sustainable and promising hydrogen donors in biomass hydro-conversion (Amarasekara and Hasan, 2015; Gao et al., 2016; Lin and Lin, 2019; Lomate et al., 2017; Scholz et al., 2014; Villaverde et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2015; Zhang and Chen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). For example, copper catalysts derived from hydrotalcite precursors revealed good transfer hydrogenation activity toward FFR-to-FA transformation by giving a FA yield of 94 % at 200 ℃ in methanol (Zhang and Chen, 2017). Cu–SiO2-Q6 could give the optimal LA conversion and GVL selectivity of 66 % and 81 % using formic acid as the hydrogen source (Lomate et al., 2017). Furthermore, the lower alcohols were preferred as hydrogen donors in comparison with formic acid in some ways related to long-term corrosiveness of equipment. Generally higher temperature is indispensable for reforming process to release H2 when using methanol as the H-donor, while CTH procedure with other alcohols mainly depends on Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction that is completed under mild conditions. As is well known, many acid-base amphoteric materials, especially Zr-containing catalysts, such as Zr(OH)4 (Dong et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), calcined ZrO2 (Chia and Dumesic, 2011; Dong et al., 2017), hydrated zirconia (Tang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014), Zr-Beta zeolite (Bui et al., 2013; Winoto et al., 2019), and amorphous Zr complexes (Li et al., 2017a, 2016b), are shown to be very active for MPV reactions and have been reported as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the transformation of FFR and LEs via the CTH process. Besides, some other catalysts with acid and basic sites such as Al2O3 (López-Asensio et al., 2018), alumina–carbon composite (Kim et al., 2017) and ferrites (He et al., 2018) were also successively explored for the catalytic upgrading of these important biomass-derived platform chemicals in a H-transfer manner. For instance, NiFe2O4 was effective in CTH of FFR to FA with 2-propanol as both hydrogen source and solvent, providing 94 % yield at 180 ℃ after 6 h (He et al., 2018). Kim et al. (2017) found that Al2O3-S(7) with the highest carbon content could afford 95.8 % FA yield after 6 h. Though high conversions and good product yields for FFR/LEs hydrogenation were achieved via MPV reaction, high efficient and easily recoverable catalyst still was highly desirable. Besides, various LEs were frequently applied as the substrates in the previous reported work, while few studies focused on LA-to-GVL transformation in the present H-transfer system in recent years. Herein, a series of magnetic nanoparticles with varied Zr/Fe molar ratios were prepared and examined in the CTH reaction of FFR-to-FA and LA-to-GVL using 2-propanol as both hydrogen source and solvent. A systematic characterization of the catalysts including essential surface properties, magnetic characteristics, surface acid/base density, and morphology structure were conducted. Kinetic study of FFR-to-FA conversion and deep insight to the activity–structure relationship in the present system were discussed. Of the prepared catalysts, Zr1Fe1-300 was capable of working as an efficient catalyst in FFR-to-FA transformation that afforded almost 100 % FA yield in 2 h with the activation energy as low as 50.9 kJ/mol, while Zr1Fe1-150 possessing high surface area and proper acid–base sites was shown to be highly active for GVL production from LA and its esters. The recovery and reutilizations of magnetic catalyst in successive reactions suggested that catalyst maintained good activity and stability after six-time recycling. In addition, plausible mechanisms for FFR-to-FA and LA-to-GVL transformations in the present catalytic system were also put forward."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (FFR, 99 %), furfuryl alcohol (FA, 98 %), methyl levulinate (ML, 99 %), levulinic acid (LA, 99 %), ethyl levulinate (EL, 99 %), γ-valerolactone (GVL, 99 %) and spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles (20 nm, 99 %) were supplied from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Butyl levulinate (BL, 99 %) was purchased by Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China). ZrOCl2·8H2O (98 %) and ammonia water (25∼28 %) were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Isopropyl levulinate (IPL) was self-prepared in laboratory. In detail, 5.8 g LA and 30 g 2-propanol were first placed into a round bottomed flask, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL 98 wt.% H2SO4. Then the esterification reaction was conducted at 70 ℃ for 12 h under vigorous stirring, finally IPL was isolated from the mixtures by silica gel column chromatography using 30 % n-hexane-70 % ethyl acetate as eluting agent. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Magnetic acid−base bifunctional nanocatalysts were synthesized through encapsulating zirconium constituents onto the surface of commercially available spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles. First, ZrOCl2·8H2O and Fe3O4 nanoparticles with Zr/Fe molar ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:9 were added into 50 mL ethanol and vigorously stirred at room temperature. And then concentrated NH3·H2O was added dropwise to regulate the pH value to 12 under vigorous agitation for another 5 h. The resulting precipitate was thoroughly washed with deionized water until residual Cl− was completely removed, based on AgNO3 detection. The precipitate was dried at 80 ℃ overnight, followed by calcining at a heating rate of 2 ℃ min-1 in air flow. Finally, the obtain powder was denoted as ZrxFey-T, where T represented the given calcination temperatures and x/y was Zr/Fe molar ratio. For instance, magnetic sample calcined at 450 ℃ with Zr/Fe molar ratio of 1:3 was designated as Zr1Fe3-450."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was completed on a Panalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a Kratos Ultra system equipped with an Al Kα radiation source. The textural properties were determined from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 ℃ (SI-MP-10, Quantachrome). Before test, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 ℃ for 15 h. The magnetic sample morphology was performed on field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The magnetic characteristics of ZrxFey-T catalysts were measured by VSM (vibrating sample magnetometer; VersaLab, Quantum design) at room temperature. Chemical analysis of catalyst composition and leached metals were measured by a Thermo Elemental ICP-OES spectrometer. The determination of acid density was conducted on automated Quantachrome ChemStar chemisorption analyzer through NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). For each test, the sample was heated up to 300 ℃ at a rate of 10 ℃ min−1 and maintained for 0.5 h in a He flow to remove adsorbed impurities. Then the sample was cooled down to 100 ℃ for NH3 adsorption. After flushing with He to remove physically adsorbed NH3, the TPD data were collected from 100 ℃ to 1000 ℃ in a ramp of 10 ℃ min−1. CO2-TPD test was assessed in a similar method, where NH3 was replaced with CO2 during adsorption procedure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL, Model JEM-2100 F) was conducted for morphological analysis of Zr1Fe1-150 catalyst. Before test, the sample was first demagnetized, and then was dispersed in ethanol solvent. Subsequently, 0.1 mL liquid sample was dropped on 300 mesh copper grid. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) process was performed by using a Model SDT Q 600 instrument over fresh and spent Zr1Fe1-150 in order to identify the amounts of adsorbed organic compounds. In detail, 5 mg sample was introduced for the measurement at temperatures from room temperature up to 900 ℃ with a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in air. TGA test was also carried out by using a similar procedure to identify the catalyst stability, where air was replaced with N2."
5,Procedures for CTH reactions,"2.4 Procedures for CTH reactions In a typical reaction, ZrxFey-T catalyst, substrate, and 2-propanol (15 mL) were placed into stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was flushed with N2 5 times to remove the air and pressurized with 1 MPa N2 before reaction mixture was heated to the predetermined temperature. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and the liquid products recovered from the reaction mixture were further analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Fuli GC 9790II) with a flame ionization detector equipped with a KB-5 capillary column (30.0 m × 0.32 μm × 0.25 μm). Conversion of substrates and yields of target products were quantified using external standard method."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts Fig. 1 gives the XRD patterns of as-prepared ZrxFey-T materials with varied Zr/Fe molar ratios. For all the ZrxFey-T nanoparticles, typical diffraction peaks at 2θ of 30.3°, 35.7°, 43.4°, 53.9°, 57.4° and 63.1° assigned to the reflections of (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes were apparently observed owing to the doping of magnetic Fe3O4 component (ICDD 19-0629) (Asuha et al., 2011). In the cases of Zr1Fe1-T and Zr1Fe3-T obtained at temperatures of 150 ℃ and 300 ℃, broad and weak peak in an angle range from 25° to 40° also suggested the presence of an amorphous structure with respect to Zr species to some extent. Relatively, higher calcination temperature of 450 ℃ facilitated the formation of zirconia in tetragonal phase, where related characteristic peaks at 50.5°, 60.1° and 74.4° could be definitely ascribed to the (112), (121) and (004) diffractions respectively (ICDD 50–1089) (Djurado et al., 2000; Kanade et al., 2008). Evidently, for XRD patterns of Zr1Fe9-T (T = 150, 300, and 450), isolated phase of individual tetragonal zirconia was hardly detectable due to over excess addition of Fe3O4. Saturation magnetization (Ms) of as-prepared ZrxFey-T samples was also investigated through VSM test. As depicted in Fig. S1, all the ZrxFey-T samples revealed good magnetism due to the existence of zero magnetic coercive force and permanent magnetization of Fe3O4 core. Furthermore, continuous increase in Fe/Zr molar ratio resulted in an obvious rise in Ms value that increased from 0.25 to ∼2.25 emu. In this regard, high Fe3O4 usage would be the principle reason for achieving strong magnetism. XPS characterization was conducted to investigate the surface chemical state of magnetic ZrxFey-T materials. Fig. S2A gives the full range XPS spectra of Zr1Fe1-150, Zr1Fe3-300 and Zr1Fe9-450, in which C 1s, O 1s, Fe 2p and Zr 3d species were detected out. Besides, high-resolution scans of Fe 2p and Zr 3d species with different intensity scales as ordinate are present in Figs. S2B, S2C, S2D, S2E and S2F. The binding energy of Zr 3d photoelectron peaks were allocated to 182.3 eV for Zr 3d5/2 line and 184.7 eV for Zr 3d3/2 line separately (Fig. S2B). As shown in Figs. S2D, S2E and S2F, photoelectron the peaks located at the binding energies of 723.4 eV, 709.6 eV, 724.8 eV and 710.9 eV were assigned as Fe(II) 2p1/2, Fe(II) 2p3/2, Fe(III) 2p1/2 and Fe(III) 2p3/2, respectively (Jiang et al., 2012). Furthermore, on the basis of ICP analysis and XPS test, chemical constitutes of prepared samples could be attained to calculate the Zr/Fe molar ratio. As indicated in Table S1, ICP-OES analysis for determining chemical composition was much more reliable and accurate compared with that of XPS test. XPS study is often undertaken to identify surface chemical composition, thus it is seen that the surface Zr/Fe molar ratios were far from the theoretical and actual values. TG analysis in N2 atmosphere is conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of Zr1Fe1-150 prepared at calcination temperature of 150 ℃ (Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 3 , the result revealed an initial marginal weight loss before heating to 200 ℃, which was mainly due to the removal of physisorbed water and surface hydroxyl groups in Zr1Fe1-150. Further significant weight loss was recorded from around 320 ℃ to 800 ℃ owing to the successive removal of intercalated water, implying the structure transformation of amorphous Zr(OH)4 into crystalline zirconia. The aforementioned XRD results also verified the structural change during heating treatment in the preset temperatures. In order to investigate the carbon deposition, we analyzed the fresh and spent Zr1Fe1-150 using TGA technique, which was performed by heating the samples from room temperature to 900 ℃ in air. As observed in Fig. 3, around 4.9 % organic compounds adsorbed on the catalyst surface after being used five times. Figs. 4 and 5 depict the NH3-TPD/CO2-TPD profiles of prepared magnetic samples respectively. Based on the results from TG analysis, integral interval from room temperature to 320 ℃ was employed for calculating the acidity and basicity of ZrxFey-150 and ZrxFey-300, and integral interval from room temperature to 650 ℃ was used for the determination of acidity and basicity of ZrxFey-450 samples. As summarized in Table 1 , commercial Fe3O4 revealed relatively strong acidity compared to ZrxFey-T samples. Among these catalysts, Zr1Fe1-150, Zr1Fe1-450, Zr1Fe9-150 and Zr1Fe9-450 gave better acidity and basicity. In addition, high calcination temperatures resulted in the diminishing of strong acid sites according to NH3-TPD profiles (Fig. 4). Similar results could be observed for the medium to strong basic sites in CO2-TPD profiles, in which the corresponding strength of desorption peaks was significantly weakened for ZrxFey-450 catalysts. The textural properties of ZrxFey-T nanoparticles were evaluated by N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms, and corresponding results including BET surface area, total pore volume and pore diameter are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S3, weak interaction between magnetic samples and N2 in low-pressure region (P/P0: 0∼0.25) was clearly observed, meanwhile, all the ZrxFey-T catalysts revealed type V isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop. In addition, applied calcination temperatures greatly influenced several structural parameters such as BET surface area, total pore volume and pore diameter. As seen from Table 1, it is inferred that higher temperatures would destroy the microporous structures of prepared materials in a certain degree, thus resulting in an obvious decline in BET surface area as well as significant rise in pore diameter (Fig. S4). Besides, with the increase in calcination temperatures from 150 to 450 ℃, the relative pressure of the loop shifted to high-pressure regions gradually, which was in good accord with the increased pore size. In contrast, Zr1Fe1-150 and Zr1Fe1-300 displayed good surface areas and relatively high total pore volumes, which might be helpful for the proceeding of the H-transfer reactions. Through SEM analysis, it is clearly seen from Fig. 6 that spherical nanoparticles resulting from coating Zr constituents on the surface of commercial Fe3O4 were aggregated into honeycomb-like arrangement with abundant pore structure, which would be directly associated with the related catalytic performances in some way of mass transfer. As further verified from TEM analysis (Fig. 7 ), it is obvious that zirconium components were coated on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, thus core-shell structure of these prepared catalysts were clearly formed. However, it is noted that the zirconium components were not homogenously distributed on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, meanwhile, the obtained nanometer-sized particles obviously accumulated together in an irregular form. Furthermore, the mapping of Zr, Fe and O (Figs. 7D, 7E and 7 F) further demonstrated that the zirconium components were coated on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles but in a nonuniform manner."
8,FA production from FFR via CTH process,"3.2 FA production from FFR via CTH process The developed ZrxFey-T catalysts were first investigated for the transfer hydrogenation of FFR with 2-propanol as both the solvent and the hydrogen source (Scheme 1 ), and the results were summarized in Table 1. The prepared ZrxFey-T catalysts (T = 150 and 300) with Zr/Fe molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 revealed relatively good performance towards CTH of FFR into FA, in comparison with that of Zr1Fe9-T. The probable reason was that better surface area, total pore volume and proper acid/base density could be offered in these magnetic materials. Previous literature reported that Zr(OH)4 and calcined zirconia with the same catalyst usage were also shown to be active in FFR conversion via MPV method (Zhang et al., 2018). In contrast, the ZrxFey-T catalysts in the present study were much more effective in the FFR transformation under similar conditions, probably owing to the generated special core-shell structure and proper acid/base density. Notably, commercial Fe3O4 with high acidity revealed weak performance towards FFR-to-FA transformation. After comprehensive consideration, Zr1Fe1-300, Zr1Fe3-150 and Zr1Fe9-300 catalysts were selected for the following experiments and kinetic studies. Fig. 8 shows the influence of reaction temperature (120 ℃, 140 ℃, 160 ℃, and 180 ℃) on FFR conversion as a function of time over the selected magnetic catalysts. In general, all the three catalysts, i.e., Zr1Fe1-300, Zr1Fe3-150 and Zr1Fe9-300, offered excellent FA yield of above 90 % at 160 ℃ and 180 ℃ after around 2 h of reaction. Lower temperatures also favored the production of FA, however, longer time was required to achieve equilibrium state, as indicated in Figs. 8A) 8B and 8C. In comparison, higher reaction temperatures apparently accelerated the transfer hydrogenation of FFR into FA (as confirmed from reaction rate constants (k) in Table 2 and FFR conversion rate), where nearly 100 % FA yield and complete FFR conversion could be attained in 1 h over Zr1Fe1-300 and Zr1Fe3-150. Notably, only slight amounts of byproducts resulted from acid−base sites catalyzed etherification of FA with 2-propanol and/or acetalization of FFR with 2-propanol were detected out, which further demonstrated the high selectivity of FA produced in such a H-transfer system. Furthermore, reaction rate constants (k) at preset temperatures (120 ℃, 140 ℃, 160 ℃, and 180 ℃) were calculated via plotting –ln(1-x) vs time, assuming that the CTH of FFR into FA belonged to a first-order reaction (Fig. 9 and Table 2). Based on the calculated reaction rate constants at different temperatures (Fig. 10 and Table 2), the activation energy (Ea) calculated from Arrhenius plots for FFR transfer hydrogenation over Zr1Fe1-300 was as low as 50.9 kJ/mol, which was much lower than that of Zr1Fe3-150 and Zr1Fe9-300. Moreover, the obtained Ea in this work was close or much lower than those reported in literatures with respect to selective CTH of FFR into FA with similar catalytic systems (Table 3 ). Evidently, the magnetic Zr1Fe1-300 catalyst in this research showed comparable or even high catalytic performance in FFR transfer hydrogenation than in the case of previously reported results, considering the aspects of FFR conversion, FA yield and Ea."
9,GVL production from LA via CTH process,"3.3 GVL production from LA via CTH process In addition to the CTH of FFR, biomass derived hydrolysate LA is also tested for the selective production of GVL over prepared magnetic catalysts in the present system (Scheme 2 ). As shown in Table 1, Zr1Fe1-150 catalyst possessing high surface area and proper acidity/basicity was very active for the production of GVL from LA using 2-propanol as the hydrogen source and solvent, where as high as 96.7 % of GVL yield could be easily attained at 200 ℃ in 1 h of reaction. In comparison, those magnetic catalysts calcined at high temperatures (300 ℃ and 450 ℃), bearing moderate to weak acid/base strength, larger pore diameters as well as lower surface areas, were endowed with undesirable catalytic activity, particularly for Zr1Fe1-450, Zr1Fe3-450 and Zr1Fe9-450 catalysts. It is known that pore diameter and surface area played a crucial role in the mass transfer, which were directly associated with the actual contact between substrate and active sites (Liu et al., 2002). Also, the H-transfer process for LA conversion also depended on the acid‒basic pair sites located on the surface of catalysts. On the other hand, the strong binding of the acid functional group in LA to basic sites on amphoteric ZrxFey-T might diminish the ability of basic active sites (O2−) in a certain degree (Yamaguchi, 1994). Commonly, basic sites were suggested to be active sites for MPV reaction, either by themselves or in a cooperative manner with acid sites leading to concerted direct hydrogen transfer through a six-membered cyclic transition state, so the blocking of basic sites by adsorbed LA would thus cause a drop in catalytic performance (Cohen et al., 2004). Therefore, proper amount of active basic sites is necessary for achieving LA-to-GVL transformation. Fig. 11 depicts the influence of reaction temperature on the transfer hydrogenation of LA as a function of time. Higher temperature favored the rapid conversion of LA into GVL over Zr1Fe1-150 catalyst in the initial stage. It is inferred that esterification reaction between LA and solvent appeared preferentially due to the presence of active acid sites, so certain amount of IPL was detected out during the reaction. At a low temperature of 180 ℃, GVL yield increased gradually with the prolonging of time and reached the equilibrium state in 3∼4 h. Produced intermediate IPL would be further hydrogenated into GVL in the present H-transfer system, thus leading to a significant drop in IPL yield at the extension of reaction time. In the meantime, LA conversion could reach up to nearly 100 % in 1 h (Fig. 11C). As a comparison, high temperatures (200 ℃ and 220 ℃) accelerated the transformation procedure that gave much higher conversion rates, as indicated in Fig. 11C. On the other hand, for reactions conducted at 200 ℃ and 220 ℃, much longer reaction time resulted in a lower GVL yield that might be ascribed to the formation of some byproducts. Therefore, the optimum temperature of 200 ℃ and time of 2 h were suggested for the following experiments. To further optimize the catalytic performance of bifunctional Zr1Fe1-150 catalyst in GVL production, catalyst usage was also discussed as an important parameter in this section. As shown in Fig. 12 , catalyst weight ranging from 65 to 95 mg was introduced for producing GVL from LA at 200 ℃. It is clear that both LA conversion rate and GVL yield increased with the continuous increase of usage, while IPL produced in the initial stage disappeared at a usage of 75 mg. It is inferred that IPL formed from the esterification of LA with 2-propanol could serve as an active intermediate that would be further converted into GVL through Zr1Fe1-150 mediated transfer hydrogenation. Notably, nearly complete conversion and maximum GVL yield of 99.5 % were attained with 75 mg catalyst. However, much higher catalyst loading might lead to the disruption of reaction balance and formation of some condensed byproducts as well. To evaluate the reusability and stability of the magnetic Zr-based materials, Zr1Fe1-150 was subjected to six successive cycles in the CTH reaction of biomass-derived LA with 2-propanol under given conditions (i.e., 200 ℃, catalyst usage 75 mg, 2 h, N2 1 MPa). In a typical run, the used catalyst obtained via magnetic separation was washed with ethanol and deionized water in sequence, dried, and applied for the next run. As clearly depicted in Fig. 13 , Zr1Fe1-150 was reusable over at least five times with maintaining most of its catalytic activity (above 95 %), indicating the excellent stability and durability of Zr1Fe1-150. In the following cycle, only slight decrease in GVL yield (6.6 %) was observed as compared with that of the first cycle. It is suggested that a small amount of accumulated organic compounds might blocked the nano-size pore structures (confirmed by TGA analysis in Fig. 4), thus suppressing the sufficient contact between active sites and LA in a certain degree. In addition, the loss of Zr and Fe constituents was not detected out upon ICP-AES analysis. Hence, the aforementioned results reflected the good reusability of the Zr1Fe1-150. Herein, various biomass‒derived LEs containing carbonyl groups were employed as the feedstock in the present CTH reactions. As shown in Table 4 , good LEs conversion rates (>75 %) and excellent GVL selectivity in a range of 92.2–98.1 % were afforded in 1.5 h of reaction over 75 mg Zr1Fe1-150 catalyst in all cases. The above results strongly verified the outstanding catalytic performance of bifunctional Zr1Fe1-150 in the transfer hydrogenation of these carbonyl molecules, which provided the evidences for the future industrialization application of this magnetic Zr based material in transfer hydrogenations. Plausible reaction mechanisms for the FFR-to-FA and LA-to-GVL transformations over ZrxFey-T catalysts were put forward according to experimental results and previous reports (Chia and Dumesic, 2011; Wang et al., 2014; Winoto et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). For MPV reduction of FFR (Scheme S1), firstly, 2-propanol serving as hydrogen donor adsorbed on the catalyst, and then dissociated to alkoxide A. Next, aldehyde group from FFR molecule fitted with alkoxide A to produce a six-membered ring transition state B. Then, H-transfer reaction occurred to generate intermediate C, followed by the release of acetone to form intermediate D. Finally, 2-propanol participated in the reaction to give the target chemical FA. LA-to-GVL conversion proceeded in a similar manner, except that IPL formed from esterification of LA with 2-propanol would serve as the active substrate (Scheme S2). Besides, cyclization was indispensable for forming GVL, so intramolecular cyclization reaction happened for chemical E produced in step 5."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, bifunctional acid−base Zr-based nanocatalysts with strong magnetism were efficient for transfer hydrogenation of biomass−derived platform molecules FFR and LA by using 2-propanol as both H-donor and solvent, affording almost 100 % yields of FA and GVL with a reaction time of 2 h. Structural characterizations revealed that the prepared magnetic materials have abundant acid−base sites, moderate surface areas and pore sizes, which were associated with the excellent catalytic performance in the present transfer hydrogenation reactions. Preferable result obtained from Zr1Fe1-300 catalyst was associated to a relatively low activation energy of 50.9 kJ/mol with respect to CTH of FFR to FA. Furthermore, the magnetically separated nanocatalyst Zr1Fe1-150 was also capable of converting LA and related alkyl levulinates into GVL in high efficiency via H-transfer manner, which also could be reused at least six times with almost constant catalytic performance. This work provides a green, feasible and simple catalytic system that enables efficient synthesis of value-added biomass derivatives, i.e. FA and GVL."
