0,Introduction,"Global warming, escalating oil prices, depletion of fossil fuels, and the security of energy supply concerns have stimulated global interest in renewable energy sources. Carbon-neutral biobased fuels such as ethanol, butanol, and biodiesel are promising candidates for transportation purposes. Generation of bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass has already reached the industrial scale in countries like the USA and Brazil (RFA, 2013). However, the development of this industry in other countries is limited by feedstock availability due to land and water limitations (IPCC, 2011). Aquatic biomass, including microalgae and macroalgae, are promising alternative biomass sources that have recently become focal (Reith et al., 2005; Roesijadi et al., 2008; Bruton et al., 2009; IEA, 2010; US DOE, 2010). Brown algae, regarded as third generation biomass, offer several advantages over lignocellulosic biomass. They do not require land, fertilizers, or irrigation water for cultivation. In addition, in comparison with lignocellulosic biomass, brown algae have a higher harvest cycle (4–6times/year) and simpler processing requirements due to lack of lignin (Reith et al., 2005; Roesijadi et al., 2008). The culture of seaweed is a growing industry worldwide, with a production of 14.5 million tons (wet weight) worth US$ 7.54 billion in 2007 (FAO, 2009). Therefore, it is anticipated that biofuel production from macroalgae should emerge as a major contributor to sustainable world biofuel production. Mixed alcohols (MAs) can be produced from biomass by biochemical pathways. In the biochemical pathway, MAs are produced through a volatile fatty acid platform (VFAP) or sugar platform (SP). In the VFAP, volatile fatty acids (VFA), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass using a mixed culture bacterial ecosystem. Subsequently, VFAs are hydrogenated to produce MA (Chang et al., 2010; Holtzapple and Granda, 2009; Holtzapple et al., 1999). The SP uses hexose and pentose sugars extracted or converted from plant bodies (Humbird et al., 2011; Aden et al., 2002). Fasahati et al. (2015) evaluated the economics of bioethanol production from brown algae through SP. They calculated a minimum ethanol-selling price of 2.33 and 2.08$/gal at a plant scale of 400,000ton/year dry seaweed for acid thermal hydrolysis and hot water wash pretreatments, respectively. The VFAP is proven to have a higher carbon yield (g alcohol/g dry biomass) in comparison to the SP (Chang et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2009; Qi et al., 2003). This is primarily due to the low release of CO2 during fermentation and the fact that mixed anaerobic bacteria are capable of utilizing all non-lignin parts of biomass, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, whereas in the case of SP, only the carbohydrate portion of the biomass is converted to ethanol. In addition, because of the low release of CO2 during anaerobic fermentation, mixed VFA fermentation provides a higher carbon yield than direct ethanol fermentation using yeast or Zymomonas mobilis (Bolzonella et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2008). Thus, if VFAs can be converted to fuels and chemicals such as ethanol and butanol via economical processes, mixed VFA fermentation could provide a new platform with versatile applications for the production of biofuels. However, effective and energy-efficient separation technologies for dehydration of the aqueous VFAs are a major hurdle to large-scale application. Separation of acetic acid from water using distillation is difficult and energy-intensive due to the close boiling points of water and acetic acid; this leads to a large number of trays in the distillation column to accomplish the separation, which increases the associated costs (Chien et al., 2004). Therefore, in practice, azeotropic rectification has proven useful and can operate either with or without the extraction stage, depending on the acetic acid concentration. The addition of an auxiliary substance may be employed to increase the volatility of the water, and thus, separation can be achieved with lower energy consumption. Therefore, the state-of-the-art technology for recovering acetic acid at concentrations lower than 40wt% involves initial extraction of acetic acid from the aqueous solution with a suitable extraction agent prior to recovery of the pure product during rectification of the azeotropic mixture (De Dietrich, 2014). Recently, pervaporation (PV) has gained attention as a new-generation technology over classical separation processes (Hinchliffe and Porter, 2000). PV requires a vacuum downstream of the membrane to allow separation by partial vaporization through a dense and selective membrane. A variety of membrane materials have been evaluated for possible application in dehydration and recovery of acetic acid, including inorganic membranes (Masuda et al., 2003; Cui et al., 2004; Teli et al., 2007; Asaeda et al., 2005; Sommer and Melin, 2005; Sato et al., 2011), organic membranes (Jullok et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2011), modified PVA membranes (Asman and Sanli, 2003; Isiklan and Sanli, 2005; Huang and Yeom, 1991; Hilmioglu et al., 2001; Alghezawi et al., 2005), charged membranes (Kusumocahyo and Sudoh, 1999; Semenova et al., 1997), PVC membranes (Koops et al., 1993; Okuno et al., 1993), and composite membranes (Lee and Lai, 1994; Wang, 2000; Wang et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2008, 2013; Toti and Aminabhavi, 2004; Zhang et al., 2014). However, despite all the experimental studies, the economics of the application of PV to dehydration of dilute acetic acid streams has not yet been evaluated. Economic assessments are helpful tools for identification of the strengths, weaknesses, and bottlenecks of a process. In this study, the economics of MAs production from brown algae via VFAP were evaluated for the first time. In addition, economic comparison of two alternative VFA recovery methods (i.e., a classical extraction/distillation (case 1) and an integrated PV and extraction/distillation (case 2)) is presented. Based on a thorough literature survey, the state-of-the-art membrane technology for acetic acid dehydration is identified, and Aspen plus v.8.4 software is used to rigorously model the processes. Techno-economic models are developed in order to calculate the MESP of each process, identify the main cost drivers, and to assess the impact of several key parameters on plant economics."
1,Methodology,
2,Process description,"2.1 Process description Mixed alcohols can be produced by hydrogenating volatile fatty acids produced from anaerobic digestion of brown algae. Fig. 1 shows a block flow diagram of the process. The process requires two dehydration units, one for the VFAs and the other for the mixed alcohols. The process is divided into four areas including: Fermentation (A), VFA recovery (B and C), Hydrogenation (D), and MA recovery (E). As shown in Fig. 1, two alternative processes were considered for VFA recovery, i.e., classical extraction/distillation (B) and hybrid PV and extraction/distillation (C). 2.1.1 Anaerobic digestion Brown algae (i.e., Phaeophyceae), the single largest seaweed resource, are considered one of the most likely candidates for energy processing with a yearly production of 9.72 million tons dry weight in 2004 (Roesijadi et al., 2010). Macroalgae generally consist of 85–90% moisture with a high ash content of up to 5% of the wet mass (Roesijadi et al., 2008, 2010). In this study, drying of brown algae to achieve 20% moisture content prior to reaching the plant gates is assumed. The remaining mass consists mainly of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Typical brown algae have a carbohydrate content of greater than 40% with a lipid composition of less than 5% (Reith et al., 2005). The primary carbohydrates in brown algae are as follows: (1) mannitol (a sugar alcohol), (2) laminaran (a β-1,3-linked glucan that also contains mannitol), (3) alginic acid (composed of mannuronic and guluronic acids), and (4) fucoidan (a sulfated fucan that mainly consists of sulfated l-fucose). Generally, the chemical composition of brown algae varies considerably between species and habitats throughout the year (Adams et al., 2011). Brown algae subject to seasonal variation usually accumulate mannitol and laminaran in the light season (i.e., spring to autumn) and consume these stored carbohydrates in the dark season. The availability of polysaccharides and sugar alcohols makes brown algae a good candidate for conversion to biofuels. Additionally, the low lignin content makes these algae suitable for downstream processing via anaerobic digestion or the fermentation process (Horn, 2000). Table 1 lists the composition, elemental analysis, minerals, and heating values for the brown algae Laminaria species (Reith et al., 2005). Anaerobic digestion of biomass involves four stages: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. During hydrolysis, the polymeric structures of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are broken down into simple sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, respectively. In the acidogenesis stage, simple monomers are converted into volatile fatty acids, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Volatile fatty acids are further digested by acetogens to produce mainly acetic acid, as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Finally, the methanogens convert the products from the preceding stages into methane, carbon dioxide, and water (Chynoweth et al., 2001; Gunaseelan, 1997). In order to obtain VFAs as the final product of fermentation, methanogenesis must be prevented by the addition of inhibitors such as iodoform or bromoform. In this study, the addition of iodoform to the slurry at a concentration of 30ppm is considered (Granada et al., 2009). The overall conversion considered in this study is based on the work of Pham et al. (2012). They reported that the VFA yield was in the range of 0.307–0.412g VFA/g dry Laminaria japonica after 5 days of fermentation at 35°C. Therefore, in this study, an average yield of 0.35g VFA/g dry brown algae and 5 days fermentation time were employed. The VFA product distribution reported by Pham et al. (2012) includes a molar fraction of 67% acetic acid, 22% propionic acid, and 11% butyric acid. The stoichiometric reactions considered in this study are presented in Table 2 . The main obstacle to obtain the stoichiometric reactions is the lack of information in the literature regarding the VFA distribution that is individually obtained from each reactant (carbohydrate, protein, and lipid) during fermentation. However, only fermentation of each reactant to obtain the relative distributions would not be reliable since the fermentation of each reactant is affected by the existence and ratios of other reactants (Elbeshbishy and Nakhla, 2012). Therefore, in this study, we assumed that each component has the same molar VFA distribution as that reported by Pham et al. (2012). The stoichiometry reported by Chang et al. (2010) for glucose (reaction (1) of Table 2) was considered as a base reaction and the stoichiometric coefficients were accordingly modified for the chemical composition of other carbohydrates. Cellulose and laminaran are hydrolyzed to produce glucose sugars, which are later digested to produce VFAs. Mannitol and fucoidan are easily extracted from the cell wall of brown algae due to their high solubility (Rowe et al., 2012; Hal and Huijgen, 2014; Percival and Ross, 1950; Black, 1954). Literature studies have reported higher AD digestion rates for carbohydrates of brown algae with the exception of alginate. Biological degradation of alginate is catalyzed by alginate lyases. The alginate lyase activity is reduced by the inhibitory impact of polyphenols and divalent metal ions available in the cell wall of brown algae (Moen et al., 1997a,b). Moen et al. (1997a) reported that dissolved mannitol is entirely consumed within the first 10–12h of fermentation while 13–50% of alginate remains insoluble. Østgaard et al. (1993) investigated carbohydrate degradation and methane production during anaerobic digestion of Laminaria saccharina. Their results showed that mannitol and laminaran were reduced to less than 5% of the initial values within 24–48h after inoculation, whereas 30% of the alginate content was not reacted, even after 30 days. Stoichiometric reactions (6) and (7) in Table 2, as reported by Rajendran et al. (2014) and Humbird et al. (2011) apply to the anaerobic digestion of proteins and lipids to methane, respectively. VFA formation reactions from proteins and lipids were obtained by applying Hess's law to the VFA degradation reactions reported by Wang et al. (1999) (reactions (8–9)) and reactions (6) and (7). A 70% conversion of carbohydrates (excluding alginate) (Østgaard et al., 1993; Moen et al., 1997a,b) and 50% conversion of lipids and proteins were assumed. The conversion of alginate was back calculated to the value of 56.5% in order to obtain 0.35g VFA/g dry brown algae in the fermentation products. The fermentation unit receives 400,000ton/year brown algae (20% moisture) as biomass for VFA production. Fresh water, along with recycled water from the VFA and MA recovery units, is added to the AD reactors. A solids loading of 13wt% is considered in the fermenters, which results in a VFA concentration of 5wt% in the product stream of the fermentation reactors (Pham et al., 2012; Granada et al., 2009). Chilled water is considered as the cooling medium to maintain a constant temperature of 35°C in the AD reactors. The products of the AD reactors are sent to flash drums for separation of H2 and CO2, primarily, as overhead vapors. The solid and liquid products accumulate at the bottom of the flash drums and are separated in a solid/liquid separator. The solid residue (digestate) remaining after fermentation retains a significant amount of nutritive components such as nitrate and phosphate, fibers, and some carbon compounds. Consequently, the digestate can be considered a useful fertilizer. The impact of the digestate selling price on the MESP is studied in the sensitivity analysis. About 20% of the digestate is recycled back to the fermentation reactors as inoculum and a nutrient source. The remaining digestate is considered fertilizer that can be sold on the local market (Dave et al., 2013). The separated liquid stream, which contains mostly water and VFAs, is sent to the VFA recovery unit. 2.1.2 VFA recovery The function of the VFA recovery unit is to dehydrate and recover 97% of incoming VFAs from the fermentation unit. Two possible processes were considered for VFA dehydration and recovery. In the first case (shown as (B) in Fig. 1), the VFAs are recovered using the classical extraction/distillation method. In the second method (shown as (C) in Fig. 1), a hybrid PV and extraction/distillation process is considered for VFA recovery. 2.1.2.1 Extraction/distillation (Case 1) The 5wt% VFA mixture is received as feed to extraction/distillation unit. The main separation equipment in this unit includes the extraction column, rectification column, decanter, and water-stripping column. Several potential extraction agents have been reported for acetic acid extraction. Table 3 shows a selection of extraction agents suitable for the recovery of acetic acid. The energy consumption of the process depends on the vaporization enthalpy of the azeotropic mixture, which in turn is determined by the proportion of water in the azeotrope. Thus, the lowest energy consumption should be achieved with the use of ethyl acetate (EtAc) or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as extraction agents. MTBE was selected as an extractive agent because of its lower boiling point (55°C) and enthalpy of vaporization (322kJ/kg) compared to ethyl acetate (De Dietrich, 2014). The density of the VFA mixture is higher than that of MTBE, and VFA is fed at the top end of the extraction tower. Inside the tower, the VFA mixture flows toward the bottom and in the process releases VFAs to the extraction agent. The extraction ability of MTBE for the VFAs increases in the order: butyric acid>propionic acid>acetic acid (Aspen plus v.8.4). The flow rate of MTBE is manipulated to recover 95% of the incoming acetic acid in the extract phase. The aqueous phase (raffinate) in the extraction tower is saturated with MTBE. Consequently, MTBE is recovered in a downstream stripping tower. Low pressure (LP) steam at 164°C and 6.5atm is used to strip MTBE from the water, and 99% of the MTBE is recovered from the top of the stripping column. The water at the bottom of the stripping column is considered as wastewater from the unit. The extract stream from the extraction column is sent to a rectification column to separate VFA from MTBE. The extraction agent and water accumulate at the top end of the rectification tower and the VFAs accumulate at the bottom of the tower, resulting in a VFA concentration of ∼99.99%. MTBE recovered from the top of the stripping and the rectification columns is condensed and sent to a decanter. The organic-phase containing mostly MTBE is recycled to the extraction column and the water-phase is sent to the stripping column. 2.1.2.2 Hybrid PV and extraction/distillation (Case 2) In case 2, PV is integrated into the extraction/distillation. In the base case, PV increases the concentration of the VFAs from 5% to 10% and the concentrated VFAs are subsequently sent to the extraction/distillation unit. The impact of higher concentrations of VFA in the retentate on the economics of the plant is assessed in the sensitivity analysis. The initial objective of this process integration is to maximize the economics of the plant and to assess the application of state-of-the-art acetic acid dehydration membranes in VFA recovery. An increase of the VFA concentration from 5% to 10% requires removal of ∼50% of the total water flow. Removal of this huge amount of water directly impacts the amount of MTBE required for extracting the VFAs. Consequently, the size and capital costs of the equipment in the extraction/distillation unit would be significantly reduced. In addition, less energy would be required in the reboiler and condenser of the VFA distillation and stripper column. Therefore, it is expected that integration of PV in case 2 should improve the economics of the extraction/distillation over that in case 1. However, the overall superiority of case 2 over case 1 will depend on the offset with the increased costs incurred by the PV process itself. Within the PV unit, the main concern is the high-energy consumption. The PV process requires pumping energy to circulate the feed on the upstream side of the membrane, heating energy to warm the feed, and refrigeration and vacuum energy to lower the energy of water molecules on the downstream side of the membrane (Valentínyia et al., 2013). Economical industrial usage of PV is challenged, however, by the development of a material that exhibits a favorable trade-off between selectivity and permeability and that concurrently exhibits high stability and reliability under hydrothermal conditions. With regard to the operating conditions, the feed temperature has the most significant influence on the trans-membrane flux, followed by the feed flow rate and the partial pressure established at the permeate side (Criscuoli et al., 2008). A high feed temperature increases the molecular mobility, which results in increased flux and reduces the required membrane surface area and hence the module costs. Long-term operation is required to offset the high cost of the membrane and/or module replacement and possible process discontinuation (Castricum et al., 2008). A number of water selective materials have been proposed for use in pervaporation membranes for acetic acid dehydration. Table 4 summarizes the literature survey of PV membranes developed to dehydrate acetic acid. The first class of materials includes organic polymers. Polymeric membranes offer the advantage of lower membrane costs in comparison with zeolite and silica membranes. Nevertheless, utilization of polymeric membranes is limited to the rather lower temperature zone of below 100°C (glass transition temperature) because of their insufficient thermal, mechanical, and chemical resistance (Sato et al., 2011). Zeolite-, ceramic-, and silica-based membranes have better thermal and chemical properties compared with those of polymer membranes (Hoof et al., 2006; Veen et al., 2011; Samei et al., 2013; Campaniello et al., 2004). Such membranes generally have higher permeated flux and selectivity than polymeric membranes. Microporous amorphous silica materials on mesoporous ceramic supports are known to give effective dehydration membranes. The pore diameters of such membranes are typically between 2 and 4Å, similar to the kinetic diameter of small molecules such as water (kinetic diameter 2.96Å) (Dean, 1995; Breck, 1974). Silica membranes combine a high permeability for small molecules with a very low permeability for larger ones (>3Å). Therefore, they are capable of effectively rejecting larger molecules like acetic acid (kinetic diameter, 4.36Å) and the even larger molecules, like propionic acid (kinetic diameter, 5.5Å), are virtually excluded (Chen et al., 2011). Great success has been achieved in the dehydration process using zeolite membranes; however, the stability of these membranes in acidic solutions is one of the major limitations. Commercialized zeolite membranes, most of which are hydrophilic zeolites (such as zeolite A), suffer from dealumination of the zeolite framework in acidic solutions, with consequent degradation of the zeolite structures. Therefore, high-silica zeolites, including zeolite T (Cui et al., 2004), mordenite (MOR) (Sato et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2003), ZSM-5 (Masuda et al., 2003), merlinite (MER) (Nagase et al., 2007), and chabazite (CHA) (Hasegawa et al., 2010) have been developed and applied to acetic acid dehydration with reportedly significant improvements in the stability in acidic solutions. In this study, the membrane developed by Sato et al. (2011) was selected for dehydration of acetic acid. The mordenite membrane, developed for dehydration of acetic acid, has a permeate flux of 10.9kg/m2 h and a selectivity of 500at 130°C (Table 4). In the system employed herein, the 5% VFA stream is initially preheated by the retentate stream and later by the LP steam to reach 130°C before being admitted to the PV membranes. The energy to evaporate the water is obtained from cooling the liquid stream. Thus, reheating between modules is required to re-heat the stream to 130°C. This is achieved with steam-heated heat exchangers. The permeate gases are liquefied by liquid propane at −20°C. The vacuum pumps are considered to keep the pressure constant at 3kPa on the permeate side. The liquefied permeate water is used as a coolant prior to recycling to the fermentation unit. The retentate, in which the VFA content has reached 10%, is sent to the extraction/distillation section for further dehydration to 100%. The description of the extraction/distillation setup corresponds exactly to that explained in Section 2.1.2.1. 2.1.3 Hydrogenation Hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols involves activation of a carbonyl bond and addition of hydrogen to it. The carbonyl group is very stable and difficult to activate (weak polarizability), thus, expensive hydride agents such as LiAlH4 are normally required to reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols. These reactions are not economical and not suitable for industrial use (Yang, 2008; Manyar et al., 2010). Therefore, several alternative processes have been developed for the hydrogenation of VFAs, including catalytic conversion in the vapor phase (Yang, 2008; Kitson and Williams, 1991; Zhang et al., 2013), liquid-phase conversion (Wan et al., 2013; Olcay et al., 2014), hydrogenation of esterified carboxylic acids (Wu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2004), and biochemical conversion (Liu et al., 2014; Munasinghe and Khanal, 2010). Herein, a continuous process developed by Schuster et al. (1985) for synthesis of alcohols via hydrogenation of carboxylic acids was considered as the design basis. This process is a gas-phase process with a high alcohol yield of 97% (Schuster et al., 1985; Zhu and Jones, 2009). The gas-phase hydrogenation requires high pressure and high temperature, where a predominantly cobalt-containing catalyst is used. The reaction temperature and pressure are 290°C and 60bar, respectively. As indicated in the patent of Schuster et al. (1985) liquid acetic acid is extremely aggressive and corrosive, and damages the catalyst. However, acetic acid loses its corrosive character almost completely when it is in the gas-phase. Consequently, the process not only leaves the catalyst undamaged, but also makes it unnecessary to use expensive metals or metal alloys as materials for the reactor or reactor accessories (Zhu and Jones, 2009). The hydrogenation reaction for acetic acid (HOAc) as a representative component of VFAs is: (13) HOAc + 2 H 2 → ethanol + H 2 O Propionic acid and butyric acid follow a similar stoichiometric hydrogenation reaction. Hydrogen, (based on the H2/VFA molar ratio of 2.1:1) is compressed in a multi-stage compressor and sent to the reactor along with the pumped VFAs. A catalyst consumption rate of 0.00046kg catalyst/kg mixed alcohols is considered (Zhu and Jones, 2009). The inlet stream is first preheated by the products from the hydrogenation reactor and later heated by a fired heater to reach 290°C before entering the hydrogenation reactors. The heat from the hydrogenation reaction and the hot effluent of the hydrogenation reactor are used to produce LP steam from the boiler feed water (BFW) and preheat the inlet stream. The products are further cooled to 65.5°C by means of cooling water in case 1 and by means of cold permeate water from the PV unit in case 2 before being sent to the first flash tank. From the first flash tank, 98% of the recovered vapor-phase is compressed in a multi-stage compressor and recycled to the hydrogenation reactor, while the remaining 2% is purged. The bottom stream of the flash drum is further flashed to 2.4bar and sent to the second flash drum (Zhu and Jones, 2009). The vapor from the second flash drum along with purge gases from the first flash drum are used as fuel for the fired heater before the hydrogenation reactor to heat the feed stream to a hydrogenation temperature of up to 290°C. The bottom stream of the second flash drum, which contains 25wt% water, 42wt% ethanol, 19wt% propanol, and 12wt% butanol, is sent to the alcohol recovery unit. 2.1.4 Mixed alcohol recovery using molecular sieves and distillation The mixed alcohol recovery unit has three main blocks, i.e., molecular sieves, an alcohol distillation column, and an azeotropic column. Water forms a homogeneous minimum boiling azeotrope with ethanol and propanol, and a heterogeneous minimum boiling azeotrope with butanol. This makes separation of the mixture very complicated and hard to achieve using distillation. Therefore, water is first removed from the mixed alcohols by molecular sieves, after which, the dried mixed alcohols are sent to the distillation column to separate ethanol from propanol and butanol (Dutta and Phillips, 2009; Phillips, 2007; Phillips et al., 2007). MAs received from the hydrogenation unit are preheated by the bottom products of the alcohol distillation column and are further heated using LP steam for evaporation and superheating to 116°C before being fed to the molecular sieves. Water is removed by the molecular sieves and the dried mixed alcohols are sent to the alcohol distillation column where ethanol is separated from propanol and butanol. To meet the ASTM ethanol fuel specifications, 99% of the incoming ethanol is recovered from the top of the column with a mass purity of 99.5%. Propanol and butanol are recovered from the bottom of the column and are considered co-products of the plant. It is anticipated that the higher alcohols may find use as excellent gasoline additives or gasoline replacements (Phillips, 2007). From the vapor product ethanol, 65% is used to back-flush the molecular sieve drying column during its regeneration (Humbird et al., 2011) and the rest is liquefied as plant ethanol product. The mixture of ethanol and water produced during molecular sieve regeneration is liquefied using cooling water and preheated to 65°C by product ethanol, co-product MA, and the bottoms of the azeotropic column before entering the azeotropic column. Pure water is recovered from the bottom of the column and recycled to the fermentation unit. The top product of the azeotropic column, which contains water and ethanol at the azeotropic point (92.5wt% ethanol), is recycled to the molecular sieves."
3,Process simulation,"The process was simulated in Aspen plus v.8.4 (Aspen Tech, Cambridge, MA). The non-random two liquid NRTL-HOC thermodynamic/activity model was selected as a property package; this model is recommended for processes handling carboxylic acids (Aspen plus v.8.4). The method uses the Hayden-O’Connell equation of state as a vapor-phase model. The chemical composition of brown algae presented in Table 1 is used in this study as the biomass composition. Most of the components are available in the Aspen plus data banks. However, for unavailable components, the physical property database developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is used to define the components (Humbird et al., 2011; Wooley and Putsche, 1996). An efficiency of 80% is considered for the pumps in the simulation. The hydrogenation compressor is modeled as a three-stage centrifugal compressor with 78% polytropic efficiency (Phillips et al., 2007). The hydrogen exits each interstage cooler at 60°C. The molecular sieves and membranes are modeled as component separators in Aspen plus. A calculator block is used to calculate the composition of the permeate based on the specified selectivity and VFA concentration in the retentate. The RadFrac module of Aspen plus is employed for rigorous mathematical analysis of all distillation columns. Design specs within RadFrac are used to achieve the objective purifications and recoveries in each column. Each column design and modeling, in terms of molar split fractions, optimization of utility consumption, and thermal integration of columns, is performed according to Smith (2005). Guidelines regarding the number of stages, type of trays, reflux ratio, column pressure, etc., are extracted from the works of Humbird et al. (2011), Aden et al. (2002), and Phillips et al. (2007)."
4,Heat integration,"3.1 Heat integration Heat integration studies were performed to minimize the utility consumption. Therefore, an inventory of the heat demand and supply within the plant is made and ordered by the temperature range. Hot and cold streams are matched under the following constraints: (1) matches between near streams (same plant section) are preferred, and (2) respective minimum temperature differences of 20°C, 30°C, and 40°C are imposed for liquid–liquid, liquid–gas, and gas–gas heat transfer matches, respectively (Perales et al., 2011). The bottom fractions of the distillation columns are used to preheat the feed streams of the column. The heat of reaction produced in the hydrogenation reactors is used to produce LP steam from the BFW. The cold permeate water of the membranes is used as a coolant before recycling it to the fermentation unit. Appropriate utilities were considered when heating and cooling demands were not satisfied by process-to-process heat transfer. LP steam at 164°C is considered as a means of providing heat. Cooling demands above 40°C are met by cooling water. Cooling below 40°C is only required in the AD fermenters and liquefaction of permeate where chilled water (4–15°C) and liquid propane (−20°C) were used as coolant, respectively."
5,Techno-economic model,"The minimum ethanol-selling price is determined for an nth-plant project cost structure and financing to recover the initial investment plus a 10% rate of return considering 100% equity financing. It is calculated as the selling price of ethanol, which makes the net present value of the project zero after 20 years of plant operation. The economic parameters for the discounted cash flow analysis are shown in Table 5 . The equipment for the process is sized based on the mass and energy balance data generated from the process model. The capital costs of the alcohol separation column, azeotropic column, and molecular sieves are scaled based on NREL's design reports (Humbird et al., 2011; Aden et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 2007). The prices are updated to 2012 dollars using the chemical engineering plant cost index (CEPCI). Table 6 shows a summary of the equipment cost, cost index, and installation factor obtained from NREL's reports. The extraction column, rectification column, and decanter in the VFA recovery unit are selected and designed based on the criteria given by Perry (2007), McCabe and Smith (1993), and Treybal (1951, 1981). The extraction column is designed to utilize an agitated column with 18in. spacing between the plates and 75ft3/ft2 h liquid capacity of combined steams (Perry, 2007; Treybal, 1951, 1981). The distillation columns and stripping column are considered to use sieve trays with a plate spacing of 24in. The maximum permissible velocity (u c) and the column diameter are calculated by considering 0.7 bubbling area/total column area and the physical property of separating the components by using the following equation (McCabe and Smith, 1993): (14) u c = K v ρ L − ρ V ρ V 1 / 2 σ 20 0.2 . Here, ρ L and ρ V are the liquid and vapor density, σ is the surface tension, and K V is an empirical coefficient that was obtained from McCabe and Smith (1993). The decanter is sized based on the empirical equation given by McCabe and Smith (1993) for the separation time (Eq. (15)). A liquid depth of 90% of the tank diameter and a length/diameter ratio of 5:1 are considered in the calculations. (15) t = 100 μ ρ A − ρ B Here, t is the separation time (h), ρ A and ρ B are the densities of the liquids A and B, (kg/m3), and μ is the viscosity of the continuous phase (cP). After sizing the equipment, the cost estimation for the equipment is performed based on a module-costing technique and relations published by Turton et al. (2003). All heat exchangers are assumed to be of the fixed tube type. Centrifugal pumps and compressors are utilized in the design. Stainless steel is the selected construction material for all of the above-mentioned equipment. The price of vacuum pumps is generally estimated based on the equation C RotaryBlower =22,000(HP/10)0.4 for the year 1981 (Ryans and Croll, 1981), where HP is the motor horsepower of the vacuum pump; the CEPCI value for 1981 is 297. The prospective membrane costs can be derived from the 2015 targets of the US-DOE-NETL (2009) for hydrogen production using ceramic and metallic membranes to be roughly 1000$/m2. The durability or membrane lifetime is another uncertainty. The 2015 target of the DOE is 5 years, which is adopted in this study (NETL, 2009; Franz et al., 2014). The membrane costs are calculated by multiplying the membrane costs per m2 by the membrane area required. The total equipment costs for the membrane module, including the casing, sealing, instrumentation, etc., are calculated by applying a 10% overhead rate on the membrane costs. The fixed capital investment (FCI) is calculated by adding the direct and indirect costs. Thus, the total capital investment (TCI) is calculated as the sum of the working capital, land, and FCI. Table 7 presents the cost factors for estimating the direct and indirect costs. The operating costs include the variable operating costs (e.g., processing chemicals) and fixed operating costs (e.g., employee salaries, overhead, maintenance, and insurance). Table 8 shows the basis for fixed and operating cost calculations. The minimum selling price of ethanol is affected by the revenues from the co-products of the plant. These co-products include the digestate, which is the solid residue from AD, and heavier alcohols produced in the plant, i.e., propanol and butanol. The demand for the digestate can be limited in the local market, thereby affecting the selling price. A digestate selling price of 10.4$/ton was projected by Dave et al. (2013). The selling price of the heavier alcohols was assumed as the market price of n-butanol, i.e., 1.15$/kg (Tecnon, 2013). Sensitivity analyses of the selling price of the co-products were performed to predict the impact on the plant economics and MESP."
6,Results and discussion,"Based on the methodology explained in the previous sections, cases 1 and 2 were designed and simulated and the total capital investment was calculated. The simulation results are shown in Table 9 . The results show that case 2 requires less fresh water and therefore, produces less wastewater in comparison to case 1. This is mainly because a major portion of the water is recovered and recycled in the membrane units in case 2. In addition, because the water content of case 2 is much less than that of case 1 in the extraction/distillation unit, less MTBE is wasted in case 2 and less supplementary MTBE is required in comparison to case 1. The higher flow rates in the extraction/distillation unit of case 1 compared to case 2 and the use of the cold permeate stream for cooling in the latter results in much less cooling water requirement of case 2 compared to case 1. However, the LP steam requirement of case 2 is almost twice that of case 1 due to the heating requirements of the membrane unit in case 2. In addition, case 2 has cooling demands of 101Gcal/h refrigeration, which in conjunction with the high steam requirements, makes case 2 very energy intensive in comparison to case 1. The total capital investment and operating costs for each case are shown in Table 10 . The total capital investment (TCI) for case 2 is about 25.2 million dollars more than that of case 1. The capital costs of the process units are identical in both cases, except for the VFA recovery unit. Utilization of the membrane unit in case 2 results in reduced capital costs (less than half) for the extraction and distillation unit of case 2 in comparison to case 1. However, the membrane unit itself has high capital costs, which results in higher total capital costs of VFA recovery for case 2 in comparison to case 1. The maximum price of the membranes should be 300$/m2 in order to make the capital costs of case 2 equal to those of case 1. However, this price range is for polymer membranes and not silica- or zeolite-based membranes. As it is presented in Table 10, the total variable and fixed operating costs for case 2 are much higher than for case 1. Fig. 2 shows the utility cost breakdown for cases 1 and 2. Notably, the steam and refrigerant costs are the main contributors to the total utility costs. Case 2 requires a huge amount of steam in the membrane unit to bring the temperature to 130°C and to provide the required heat for evaporation of water. In addition, a large amount of refrigerant is required to liquefy the vapor permeates on the permeate side and maintain the vacuum. These two parameters result in an annual 39.0 million dollar difference in the total variable operating costs of case 1 versus 2. These results show that vacuum distillation of dilute streams is very energy intensive and unfavorable for acetic acid dehydration and recovery from waste streams. The total fixed operating cost of case 2 is about 3.4million $/year more than that of case 1. This difference between the two cases arises primarily from the higher maintenance cost for replacing the membranes every 5 years for case 2."
7,Minimum ethanol-selling price (MESP),"5.1 Minimum ethanol-selling price (MESP) The minimum ethanol-selling prices were calculated to be 1.24 and 3.61$/gal for case 1 and case 2, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the MESP breakdown for both cases. The higher MESP for case 2 arises primarily from the higher utility consumption and secondarily from the higher capital investments. The utility costs for case 2 are 39.0 million $/year higher than those of case 1. This means that the process would be more sensitive to changes in the price of utilities rather than uncertainty in the capital costs. The MESP determined for case 1 is comparable with the results of Phillips et al. (2007) for indirect gasification and Dutta and Phillips (2009) for direct gasification of lignocellulosic biomass (forest residues). They reported respective MESPs of 1.29 and 1.95$/gal for the indirect and direct gasification processes using their 2007 cost estimations and 2012 performance targets, respectively. The MESP calculated in this study for case 1 (1.24$/gal) shows that ethanol production from brown algae through VFAP can result in cheaper prices for ethanol in comparison to thermochemical bioethanol production from second generation biomass. The MESP calculated for case 1 is also comparable with that reported by Fasahati et al. (2015) for ethanol production from brown algae through SP. They calculated an MESP of 2.08 $/gal at a plant scale of 400,000ton/year dry seaweed for hot water wash (HWW) pretreatment. The TCI and utility cost reported by Fasahati et al. (2015) for HWW is 89.4million$ and 15million$/year, respectively, while for case 1 it is 76.5million$ and 22.7million$/year, respectively. The calculated TCI for SP is $12.9million more expensive compared to VFAP. However, the VFAP requires 7.7million$/year more utility costs. The higher capital cost of SP is mainly because of its expensive saccharification and fermentation reactors and the higher utility cost of VFAP is due to its higher energy requirements for dilute VFA recovery. The revenues from selling heavier alcohols and higher fuel yield obtained by digesting protein and lipid in addition to carbohydrates are the main reasons for obtaining a lower MESP value for VFAP compared to SP."
8,Sensitivity analysis,"5.2 Sensitivity analysis It was of interest to carry out a single-point sensitivity analysis of the techno-economic model to evaluate the impact of key parameters on the MESP. This analysis is aimed to cover and project the inherent uncertainties in some of the key costs and parameters assumed for this study. In the single-point sensitivity analysis, only one parameter is varied at a time, and the impact on the MESP is calculated using the techno-economic model. Figs. 4 and 5 show the results of the sensitivity analysis for cases 1 and 2, respectively. The results of the sensitivity analysis presented in Fig. 4 show that the biomass price, internal rate of return (IRR), and mixed alcohol co-product value have the greatest impact on the MESP for case 1. The largest impact is caused by the biomass price, given that varying the biomass price from 50 to 100$/ton results in variation of the MESP from 0.78 to 2.05$/gal. Similarly, changing the IRR from 15% to 20% results in an increase of the MESP from 1.47 to 1.73$/gal. As expected, because of the significant quantity of mixed alcohol co-product produced by the plant, its valuation has a significant effect on the MESP. Varying the selling price of the mixed alcohol co-product by approximately ±13% of its base value results in a change of the MESP from the base MESP of 1.24–0.86 and 1.62$/L, respectively. Changes in plant life, steam cost, and TCI have an impact on the MESP of less than 0.2$/gal. The digestate selling price has the least impact on the MESP, where a +40% and −60% change in the digestate selling price changes the MESP from 1.28 to 1.18$/gal. Fig. 5 shows that the IRR and biomass price have the highest impact on the MESP for case 2. Respective changes in the IRR of 15% and 20% increase the MESP from the base value of 3.61$/gal to 3.92 and 4.27$/gal. Similarly, a change in the biomass price from 50 to 100$/ton changes the MESP from 3.15 to 4.43$/gal. The selling price of heavier alcohols, refrigerant cost, steam cost, and plant life have an impact on the MESP of between 0.2 and 0.4$/gal. The high impact of the refrigerant and steam costs on the MESP reflects the large utility requirements of case 2. The membrane cost and membrane life have an impact on the MESP of between 0.1 and 0.2$/gal. A ±50% change in the membrane price ($/m2) changes the MESP from the base value of 3.61$/gal to 3.75 and 3.47$/gal, respectively, and a ±40% change in the membrane life changes the MESP to 3.56 and 3.72$/gal, respectively. Similar to case 1, the digestate selling price has the lowest impact on the MESP and a −40% and +60% change in digestate selling price changes the MESP to 3.65 and 3.55$/gal, respectively. 5.2.1 Impact of PV temperature on MESP The permeate flux and selectivity are correlated with the feed temperature of the membranes. Higher temperatures boost the permeate flux, which leads to a smaller membrane area requirement for separation. However, the use of higher temperature increases the heating and cooling demands and utility costs. In addition, the lifetime of a membrane is expected to be shorter at higher temperature than at lower temperature, which economically means higher maintenance costs (El-Bourawi et al., 2006). The economic optimal operating condition depends on the material and type of membrane distillation, changes in the permeate flux and selectivity as a function of temperature, pH, and membrane life (El-Bourawi et al., 2006; Lawson and Lloyd, 1997; Lipnizki et al., 1999). In this study, experimental results reported by Sato et al. (2011) (shown in Table 4) were considered for sensitivity analysis. The temperature, permeate flux, and selectivity were extracted from the data in Table 4. The heat integrations and capital costs were recalculated at each temperature for the membrane unit. The effects of the membrane temperature on the MESP are shown in Fig. 6 . The two main parameters on which variation of the temperature has the highest impact are the fixed capital investment and fixed operating costs. This is mainly due to the requirement for a higher membrane area at lower temperature, which increases the membrane cost and FCI. This, consequently, results in higher labor, maintenance, and property insurance costs, which in turn leads to increased fixed operating costs. The results show that due to the high membrane cost per unit area, a lower temperature (which brings about lower permeate fluxes) is not favorable, and the decreased utility cost at lower temperature does not offset the increased capital costs in this case. 5.2.2 Impact of VFA concentration after membrane unit on MESP In the base case, it was considered that the membrane unit increases the VFA concentration from 5% to 10%. Respective increases in the VFA concentration in the membrane unit from the base value of 5% (w/w) to 10%, 15%, and 20% demand 50%, 70%, and 79% removal of the total water from the feed stream. Removal of such significant amounts of water facilitates the recovery of VFAs at the extraction/distillation unit and reduces the amount of extractive agent (MTBE) required for VFA recovery, which consequently leads to smaller equipment size and lower capital costs for the extraction/distillation unit. Furthermore, less energy would be required in the reboiler and the condenser of the distillation column. However, removing this amount of water at the membrane unit requires a larger membrane area and higher steam and refrigerant consumption for heating the feed and for condensation of the permeates. In order to assess the impact of this parameter on the MESP, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the VFA concentration after the membrane unit in which the concentration of VFA in the retentate stream was increased from the base value of 10–15% and 20%. The equipment for the membrane and extraction/distillation units was resized and the capital costs were recalculated at each concentration. Table 11 shows the changes in the capital costs and the energy requirements of the membrane and extraction/distillation units. Fig. 7 also shows the changes in the MESP as a function of the VFA concentration in the retentate. As expected, increasing the VFA concentration reduces the capital and energy costs of the extraction/distillation unit. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the FCI is largely similar, irrespective of the VFA concentration. This means that the increased capital cost for the membrane unit due to the larger membrane area required is compensated by the decreased capital cost for the extraction/distillation unit. However, the increased cost of utility for the membrane unit is much larger than the decreased energy consumption in the extraction/distillation unit. Therefore, the sum of the total capital and energy costs of both units increases from 10% to 20%. The results of this section show that a higher concentration of VFA in the retentate does not improve the economics of the plant in terms of the MESP. 5.2.3 Impact of solids loading on MESP The experimental studies on VFA production from biomass have reported a VFA concentration of 5wt% in fermentation products (Pham et al., 2012; Granada et al., 2009). This concentration requires a solids loading of 13wt% in fermentation reactors. Results of this study showed that VFA recovery from dilute streams consumes large amounts of energy and results in the highest capital costs compared to other units. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the impact of solids loading in fermentation reactors on the economics of the process. The analysis was performed only on case 1 because of its better economics in comparison to case 2. The solids loading were changed from 13% to 16% and 20% in the simulation, which resulted in a water flowrate reduction from 332,000 to 120,000 and 85,400kg/h, respectively. It was assumed that changes in solids loading do not affect the performance of the fermenting bacteria. Capital costs were recalculated for the VFA recovery unit based on the simulation results. The capital costs decreased from $16.16 million for the base case (13% solids loading) to $5.65 and $5.0 million for 16% and 20% solids loadings, respectively. The utility costs of the plant also decreased from 22.7million $/year in the base case to 16.0 and 15.0 million $/year for 16% and 20% solids loadings, respectively. As a result, the MESP was reduced from 1.24$/gal for the base case to 0.70 and 0.62$/gal for 16% and 20% solids loadings, respectively. The results show that higher solids loading can favorably contribute to the plant economics. However, further experimental studies are required to assess the impact of a higher solids loading on the performance of fermenting bacteria. 5.2.4 Impact of hydrogen recovery on MESP The hydrogenation of VFAs to alcohols requires 1,006kg/h of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced as side products of anaerobic digestion of brown algae. Therefore, part of the hydrogen requirements of the process can be obtained from the vapors of the fermentation reactors using pressure swing absorption (PSA). The impact of hydrogen recovery is assessed (only for case 1) by adding a PSA unit to the process. The PSA was simulated based on a study by Spath et al. (2005). The vapors from the fermenters are compressed in a two-stage isentropic compressor to 25atm with an interstage cooling to 60°C. The compressed gases are further cooled to 40°C by cooling water and entrained liquids are removed in a knock out drum. The gases received by the PSA unit must contain at least 70mol% hydrogen. Purification of streams more dilute than this decreases the product purity and recovery of hydrogen (Mann, 1995). The concentration of hydrogen in the fermenter gases prior to the PSA is 66mol%. Therefore, part of the PSA hydrogen product stream is recycled back into the PSA feed. For a 70mol% hydrogen PSA feed, a hydrogen recovery rate of 85% is typical, with a product purity of 99.9vol% (Spath et al., 2005). The results of the simulation are used to update the techno-economic model and calculate the MESP. About 476kg/h hydrogen is recovered using PSA, which is equal to 47% of the plant requirements. The capital cost of the PSA unit is scaled from the capital cost report by Spath et al. (2005) (Table 6) and calculated to be $6,687,000. The MESP for 85% hydrogen recovery is calculated to be 1.18$/gal, which shows a 0.06$/gal decrease from the base value of case 1 (1.24$/gal). The results show that the addition of a hydrogen recovery unit could improve the economics of the plant. Therefore, integration of a PSA unit into the plant is recommended."
9,Conclusion,"Herein, the economics of bioethanol production from brown algae via anaerobic digestion of brown algae followed by hydrogenation was evaluated for the first time. Two alternative processes were considered for VFA recovery, namely, the classical extraction/distillation (case 1) and the hybrid PV and extraction/distillation (case 2). The MESPs for cases 1 and 2 were calculated to be 1.24 and 3.61$/gal, respectively. The results showed that the hybrid process (case 2) is not economically favorable over the classical extraction/distillation process, primarily because of the high utility costs of the PV process that are required for recovering VFAs from the dilute stream, as well as the expensive membrane costs per unit area for the hybrid process. The results also showed that pervaporation of a dilute stream requires a huge amount of energy to provide heat for the pervaporation process, in conjunction with high refrigerant costs for liquefaction of the permeates and maintaining the vacuum on the permeate side. Based on comparison of the MESP value reported for thermochemical bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and SP bioethanol production from brown algae with the results of this study, the VFAP is economically viable and comparable with bioethanol production from second-generation biomass. The results showed that VFA recovery from dilute fermentation products is the main bottleneck of the process by having the highest energy consumption and capital costs. Therefore, alternative economical processes should be developed for VFA recovery to enhance the process economics. Sensitivity analysis on the solids loading showed that a higher solids loading could greatly enhance the plant economics. However, the impact of a higher solids loading on the performance of fermenting bacteria should be evaluated experimentally. In addition, hydrogen recovery from fermenter gases using PSA showed a positive contribution to the plant economics and it is recommended for consideration in a real plant design. Sensitivity analysis on economic parameters also showed that the biomass price, mixed alcohol selling price, and IRR have the most significant impact on the plant economics. Therefore, any further developments in artificial seaweed cultivation technology that can decrease the cost of brown algae cultivation may greatly contribute to the plant economics and reduce the MESP."
