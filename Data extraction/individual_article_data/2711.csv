0,Introduction,"Hydrogen fuel as a clean and promising energy storage medium has attracted tremendous attention for industrial application. To date, H2 is still mainly produced by reforming or gasification of fossil fuel products in industry. However, fossil fuel based energy sources definitely can not meet the requirement of globally boosting economic growth and sustainable development. Therefore, H2 production from renewable energy sources including solar energy, biomass, water and wind etc. has being intensively investigated to solve global problems of fossil fuel depletion and environmental deteriation [1–3]. Cellulose as the most abundant renewable biomass source has been widely investigated for H2 production under different conditions [4–7]. The main approach for conversion of cellulose to H2 has been realized by thermochemical gasification. For instance, pyrolysis and gasification processes operated at high temperature (773–1073 K) transform cellulose to bio-oils and H2 gas, along with other gases, such as CO, CO2 and CH4 [7]. In respect of the required high energy input, solar light as an inexhaustible energy source could be used to replace the thermal input. In addition, photoreforming of cellulose or its derivatives to H2, firstly reported at 1980s [8], is receiving more attention nowadays [9–16]. In this process, cellulose serves as an electron donor (hole scavenger) to promote aqueous protons reduction to H2 by photogenerated electrons. However, due to the insoluble nature of cellulose in water, suspended cellulose in water is not efficient electron donor for promoting H2 production [12]. Caravaca et al. claimed that photocatalysis driven cellulose hydrolysis to glucose is the first step for producing hydrogen on metal loaded TiO2 [13], however, cellulose hydrolysis is hardly occurred in pure water even under photocatalysis, which inevitably limits the conversion of cellulose. Therefore, it is a challenging task to make cellulose efficiently consumed by oxidative holes generated from photocatalysts. To address this issue, few examples on photoreforming of cellulose to H2 are recently reported by immobilizing cellulose particles onto CdS [14] and platinized TiO2 photocatalyst [15] or dissolving cellulose in highly concentrated alkaline solution (5∼10 M [OH−]) in the presence of CdS/CdOx quantum dots photocatalyst [16]. On the other hand, cellulosic biomass can be converted into other valuable liquid platform molecules such as glucose, gluconic acid and 5-hydroxyl methyl furfural (HMF) through acid hydrolysis or enzyme hydrolysis, to compete with thermochemical process [17–19]. Typically, hydrolysis with concentrated acid (> 5%) allows the use of milder conditions (373 K–423 K). However, subsequent separation and purification of the valuable bio-products from the reaction medium is rather difficult, which is still an issue to be resolved for practical application. Thus, considering the widespread applications of both photocatalysis and acid catalysis as shown in Scheme 1 , we questioned whether it might be possible to merge these two catalytic processes in one-pot, with the goal of solving long-standing, yet elusive problems in H2 production and biomass conversion. Specifically, acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. cellulose) generates soluble organic carbohydrates, which could be in situ used as the electron donors to promote photocatalytic H2 production from water. The generated carbohydrates are very effective electron donors due to their low oxidization potentials [20], and photocatalytic H2 generation from the carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) decomposition has also been demonstrated [21,22]. To our best knowledge, this is the first example that employing combined photocatalysis and acid catalysis for cellulose conversion to hydrogen. The merit of this photocatalytic H2 production strategy lies in the unnecessary input of valuable chemicals (e.g. alcohols) as electron donors and the avoidance of redundant separation of liquid products in cellulose hydrolysis, since gaseous H2 can be easily recovered and purified via a membrane filtration process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Original microcrystalline α-cellulose powder (Sigma-Aldrich, size 10 ∼ 1000 μm) without any pretreatment was used for test, chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6.6H2O, >99.9% Sigma-Aldrich), standard carbohydrates include glucose (>99.5%), fructose (>99.5%), arabinose (99%), erythose (>75%), 5-(hydroxylmethyl)furfural (HMF, >99%), formic acid (>95%) and gluconic acid (49∼53 wt% in water) etc. were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich company."
3,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 Photocatalyst preparation Platinized TiO2 (Degussa P25, specific surface area 50 m2/g) with a typical Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% was prepared by a photo-deposition method. A 500 ml TiO2 (1.0 gL−1) suspension with 50 ml methanol as electron donor and 6.5 ml of 1.0 gL−1 chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6.6H2O) was irradiated with UV light (250 W iron-halide lamp) for 60 min. After 1 h irradiation, Pt-deposited TiO2 (p-TiO2) powder was filtered, washed with D.I. water, and dried in air at room temperature."
4,Cellulose and photocatalyst characterization,2.3 Cellulose and photocatalyst characterization Particle size of cellulose was measured on a Mastersizer 2000 Particle Size Analyser (Malvern Instruments). Microstructure of samples was observed on a JEOL JSM-6700 F Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at 5 kV. The SEM specimen was prepared by placing small amounts of sample powder onto a carbon plate attached to an aluminum sample holder and gold powder was allowed to evaporate under vacuum at room temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis of powder was examined on a SToe STADI/P powder diffractometer. Incident radiation was generated using a Cu kα source (λ = 1.54056 Å). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was performed using a JEOL JEM-2011 electron microscope at 200 kV.
5,Activity test,"2.4 Activity test For hydrolysis experiment, a certain amount of cellulose powder (2.5∼12.5 mg) and TiO2 catalyst (0∼25 mg) was suspended in 50 ml H2SO4 solution (typically 0.6 M) in a home-made autoclave reactor with a quartz window on top of the reactor (as shown in Scheme 2 ). The autoclave was heated to ∼130 °C in an oil bath with monitoring the pressure inside of the autoclave (∼ 3.0 bar). After reaction, the autoclave was directly removed from oil-bath and cooled down to room temperature within 2 h. Then, the aqueous solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with RI detector and Agilent Hi-Plex column for sugar analysis. (HPLC condition: DI water was used as mobile phase, flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and column temperature at 79 °C). For quantifying the generated carbohydrates, commercial carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, 5-(hydroxylmethyl)furfural, arabinose, erythose, formic acid and gluconic acid were used to measure the standard calibration curve of each carbohydrate according to the HPLC profile. In case of combined photocatalysis and hydrolysis experiment, the autoclave reactor was heated in an oil-bath and UV–vis light irradiation (250 W, iron doped halide lamp) from the top of the reactor was also employed. In the preliminary test, a certain amount of cellulose powder (2.5∼12.5 mg) and TiO2(Pt) powder (0∼25 mg) were suspended in 50 ml 0.6 M H2SO4 solution in the autoclave reactor under UV–vis light irradiation. Before photoirradiation, the sealed photoreactor was purged with Ar for 30 min to remove the O2 and N2. The amounts of photogenerated H2 and CO2 (from cellulose decomposition) in the head-space (0.65 L) of photoreactor under irradiation were examined using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 3000 Micro Gas chromatograph). The pressure inside autoclave was identical with the hydrolysis experiment. Each photocatalysis run was performed for 10.0 h. For evaluation of the potential application of reforming raw biomass waste by this strategy, paper pulp (2.5 and 500 mg) as a representative raw biomass waste was suspended into the reactor in the presence of 25 mg Pt-TiO2 photocatalyst. The reaction was performed both at 323 K and 403 K. During the multicycle tests, the reactor was purged with Ar for 30 min again prior to starting the next cycle to remove the accumulated H2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural characterization of cellulose and photocatalyst,"3.1 Structural characterization of cellulose and photocatalyst Cellulose is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units, and it consists of crystalline and amorphous regions. Firstly, crystal structure and particle size of commercial α-cellulose powder (without pre-treatment) was analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle size analyzer. The crystallinity of α-cellulose was estimated about 74% according to the equation of Crystallinity Index (CI) = (I002-IAM)/I002 as shown in the XRD pattern (Fig.1 a) [23]. The crystalline structure of cellulose may be broken up upon treating it with strong acid or base. The particle size of α-cellulose was estimated about from 10∼1000 μm according to the SEM image and particle size measurement as shown in Fig. 1b and c. Thus, such rigid microcrystalline cellulose powder normally requires harsh reaction condition to be further convertible. The representative TEM image shown in Fig. 1d clearly shows the P25 TiO2 are composed by 20–30 nm nanoparticles. Through the photoreduction process, the 0.5 wt.% Pt nanoparticles (dark spots) with few nanometer size are randomly deposited onto TiO2 nanoparticles."
8,Acid hydrolysis of cellulose,"3.2 Acid hydrolysis of cellulose Sulfuric acid catalysed cellulose hydrolysis (cleavage of the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds and H-bonds) has been studied theoretically and experimentally, as this degradation step paves the way for other following catalytic transformations. Cellulose hydrolysis has been modelled as a pseudo-first order sequential reaction of cellulose hydrolysis followed by glucose degradation [24]. (1) Cellulose → k hyd [Glucose] → k deg [HMF + H2O] → LA + FA where k hyd = kinetic constant of cellulose hydrolysis, k deg = kinetic constant of glucose degradation, HMF = hydroxymethyl furfural, LA = levulinic acid, FA = formic acid. Hydrolysis of α-cellulose powder was tested in diluted sulfuric acid in a closed autoclave reactor under varied conditions (Scheme 2). As shown in the Eq. (1) describing the decomposition pathway of cellulose, glucose was found as the main hydrolysis product, while other hydrolysis products such as fructose (an isomer of glucose), 5-(hydroxylmethyl)furfural (HMF, dehydration from fructose) and other carbohydrates were also detected with much lower yields (Table 1 , entry 1), which could be neglected compared to the glucose yield. Fig. 2 a shows outstanding yields of glucose from cellulose hydrolysis at 403 K (autogenous pressure 3.0 bar) after 10.0 h reaction with varied concentrations of H2SO4. Increasing concentration of H2SO4 from 0.1 M to 0.6 M significantly enhanced glucose yields, while the glucose yield in 1.2 M H2SO4 was slightly higher than that obtained in 0.6 M H2SO4. It is found that the increase of glucose yields is linearly proportional to the increase of acid concentration (e.g. [H+]) from 0.1 M to 0.6 M, which confirms the dependence of hydrolysis rate upon the concentration of H+ in this tested scale. Cellulose hydrolysis was not efficient at lower temperature and pressure (< 403 K, < 2.0 bar) even in 0.6 M H2SO4 (data not shown). Therefore, hydrolysis experiment was performed in 0.6 M H2SO4 at 403 K for the following studies. As shown in Fig. 2b, glucose yields slightly increased with increasing the amount of TiO2 nanoparticles, which reached to the optimum concentration of TiO2 at 0.2 g/l (e.g. 10.0 mg in 50 ml H2SO4). Metal oxides (e.g. CaFe2O4 and HNbMoO6) have been employed as brØnsted acid catalysts for cellulose hydrolysis [25,26]. Similarly, sulfonated TiO2, as a solid acid catalyst [27], would promote cellulose hydrolysis due to the increased brØnsted acid density in acidic condition, as the glucose yields were enhanced from ca. 78.2(±3)% (without TiO2) to ca. 86.8 (±5)% (TiO2 0.2 g/L). Further increase of TiO2 (0.5 g/L) reduced the glucose yield, since large excess of TiO2 may cause the aggregation of nanoparticles which inevitably inhibits the contact between cellulose and catalyst particles. The time profiles of glucose production from cellulose hydrolysis within 10.0 h (Fig. 2c) indicates that glucose production rate gradually decreased along with reaction time, as over 60% glucose yield was obtained within initial 4.0 h reaction. It is proposed that the depletion of cellulose accounts for the reduced glucose production rate."
9,Combined acid hydrolysis and photocatalysis,"3.3 Combined acid hydrolysis and photocatalysis In order to study the combined hydrolysis and photocatalysis, cellulose hydrolysis experiment was performed under anoxic condition with simultaneous UV-light irradiation to the mixed titania photocatalyst and cellulose suspension. Platinum (0.5 wt.%) co-catalyst was pre-loaded onto TiO2 nanoparticles by a photodeposition method to enhance H2 production. The few amounts of platinum did not exert significant influences on the hydrolysis process, as there was no remarkable difference for the glucose yields with or without platinum deposition (see Table 1, entry 2 and 3). In addition, oxygen effect on the hydrolysis could be neglected as well (see Table 1, entry 3 and 4). In the absence of photocatalyst, there was no H2 evolved as shown in Fig. 3 , suggesting that H2 was produced from the photocatalytic process, rather than from the thermal or hydrolytic process. Furthermore, in the absence of cellulose, the H2 evolution under the tested condition (0.6 M H2SO4, 403 K) was also negligible, implying that water reduction is not favored without efficient electron donors in strong acidic condition at high temperature. The optimum concentration of TiO2(Pt) loading for H2 evolution was found about 0.5 g/l (25 mg TiO2(Pt) in 50 ml solution). Further increase in the concentration of TiO2(Pt) to 1.0 g/l (50 mg TiO2(Pt) in 50 ml solution) reduced H2 yield probably because of the aggregation of the TiO2(Pt) nanoparticles and the inhibited UV light transmission in the mixed suspension [28]. The H2 evolution rates were gradually reduced along with reaction time. This is thought mainly due to the depletion of organic intermediates produced from cellulose hydrolysis. Since H2 was only produced in the presence of cellulose, cellulose conversion efficiency reached to ca. 66% for H2 production within 10.0 h under the optimized condition, based on the assumption that 1 mol glucose unit hydrolysed from cellulose would produce 12 mol H2 after oxidizing to carbon dioxide (C6H12O6 + 6H2O = 12H2 + 6CO2) theoretically. The acid effect on H2 production was further investigated as shown in Fig. 4 . Trace amount of H2 was produced in 0.1 M sulfuric acid condition at 403 K, and the cellulose conversion efficiency was ca. 8.3%, in consistence with the glucose yield (ca. 10%) from the cellulose hydrolysis experiment. This indicates that nearly all the generated glucose and its hydrolytic intermediates as sacrificial electron donors were photo-oxidized to CO2, in accompany with H2 production. However, H2 evolution in 0.3 M or 0.6 M sulfuric acid condition was markedly enhanced. The H2 yields in 10.0 h were ca. 95 μmol and 123 μmol in 0.3 M and 0.6 M H2SO4 respectively, which accounts for ca. 50% and 66% cellulose conversion efficiency. Considering that the glucose yield of ca. 40% in 0.3 M in 10.0 h, it implies that the other hydrolysis carbohydrates (e.g. cellodextrins) in addition to glucose are also served as electron donors for H2 production. In case of 0.6 M H2SO4 condition, the H2 yield (66%) is significantly lower than that of glucose yield (85%), which indicates that the hydrolysis rate in 0.6 M H2SO4 is much faster than the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, and proton reduction is rate-limiting step in the overall process. Some potion of generated glucose was converted into HMF, erythrose and arabinose as shown in Table 1 (entry 6), which reduces the cellulose to H2 conversion efficiency. Furthermore, H2 evolution was negligible in 0.6 M H2SO4 with cellulose at 323 K, which also demonstrates that cellulose hydrolysis process is essentially necessary for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. In addition, cellulose effect on H2 production was also investigated. Hydrogen production is influenced by both the photocatalysis and hydrolysis. Cellulose hydrolysis provides electron donors for photocatalytic H2 evolution, thus the photocatalysis mainly determines the H2 evolution rate when cellulose loading is sufficient. The amount of loaded cellulose in 50 ml 0.6 M H2SO4 solution was varied from 0.0 mg to 12.5 mg. It is found that H2 yield gradually increases along with the increase of cellulose (Fig. 5 a). Without cellulose loading, no H2 was evolved in 0.6 M H2SO4 at 403 K. In the presence of highly concentrated sulfuric acid, the positive TiO2 surface might be covered by SO4 2− and the photogenerated charge transfer process was inhibited, which might be one of the reasons preventing H2 evolution. However, H2 production rate gradually reached to a maximum level when the amount of cellulose was increased to 12.5 mg. It can be assumed that carbohydrates production from hydrolysis and H2 production from water splitting achieve a maximum balance at this point. The time profiles of photocatalytic H2 production are similar regardless of cellulose loading without concentrated acid (Fig. 5b), implying that cellulose was not involved in the photocatalytic reaction in pure water. The total amount of produced H2 (ca. 33 μmol) without cellulose hydrolysis is about 5-fold less than that generated with cellulose hydrolysis (ca. 170 μmol). This confirms that more efficient H2 production only occurs when the photocatalytic process and cellulose hydrolysis are combined. To further examine the applicability of the combined photocatalysis, it is necessary to use the raw cellulosic biomass waste as the feedstock. Pulp is one of the most abundant raw materials worldwide. We examined the photocatalytic H2 production assisted by direct conversion of dry pulp paper as a representative raw feedstock with TiO2(Pt) photocatalyst. The H2 yield based on the amount of C6 monosaccharide unit contained in pulp paper (2.5 mg) reached to ca. 89% after 10.0 h reaction (Fig. 6 a). Photoreforming of pulp paper is much easier compared to photoreforming of cellulose. In addition, practically the content of cellulosic feedstock should be much higher than that of catalyst. Therefore, we fed 500 mg pulp paper into the reactor with 25 mg photocatalyst for the long-term stability test. The repeated cycles of photocatalytic H2 production from water with large excess of solid pulp paper under UV-light irradiation at 323 K and 403 K were tested for about 70 h as shown in Fig. 6b. There was no obvious decay for H2 generation during the repeated tests. H2 generation efficiency at 403 K is over 10-folds higher than that at 323 K, since acid hydrolysis of cellulosic pulp paper is not sufficient at 323 K. The efficient and stable H2 production (ca. 1320 μmol/h.g−1 cat.) at 403 K in 0.6 M H2SO4 implies the stability of photocatalyst even in such strong acidic condition. Thus, photoreforming of cellulosic biomass into H2 in large-scale is technically feasible, considering the utilization of low-cost photocatalyst and feedstock."
10,Mechanism analysis and discussion,"3.4 Mechanism analysis and discussion The H2 production is mainly proceeded via the hydrolytic formation of carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) and subsequent oxidation of carbohydrates and proton reduction on platinized TiO2(P25). Thus, the H2 evolution is dependent on both the hydrolytic and photocatalytic processes, which has been demonstrated by the investigation of photocatalyst, acid and cellulose effects as shown from Figs. 3 to Figure 5. When the acid hydrolysis rate and the amount of cellulose loading are sufficient (operated condition: 0.6 M H2SO4 at 403 K), the overall H2 evolution is limited by the photocatalytic water reduction process. Regarding to the oxidation species, it has been reported that both hydroxyl radicals and peroxy species generated on noble metal loaded P25 account for the glucose oxidation [22], and the glucose conversion process is through α–scission, with the arabinose and erythrose as the main intermediates. However, in this work, the arabinose and erythrose were less found (Table 1), probably because the longer photocatalytic reaction time and higher reaction temperature led to further decomposition of arabinose and erythrose into much smaller organic acids and CO2. According to the results on HPLC analysis of the liquid samples, the cellulose conversion route during the hydrolysis or combined process was proposed as shown in Scheme 3 . Organic acids intermediates such as gluconic acid, levulinic acid or formic acid, which might be produced during the photocatalytic process, were not able to be determined due to the interference of sulfuric acid. (See Table 1 and Note 1). Acid hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose (step I) or other minor carbohydrates derived from the conversion of glucose such as fructose (step II, isomerization), 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, HMF (step III, photo or photocatalytic conversion), and erythrose and arabinose (step IV, photooxidation), continuously supply the electron donors to TiO2(Pt) photocatalyst for enhancing photocatalytic reduction of protons to hydrogen, while these organic hydrolytic products would be further oxidized into small intermediates and converted into CO2 eventually (step V and VI), if the organic carbohydrates are not excess. More interestingly, we have found that conversion of glucose into HMF preferentially occurs during the photocatalytic process, compared to the hydrolysis process (Table 1, entry 5 and 6). HMF is thought more easily to be produced from the dehydration of (cyclic) fructose with the assistance of sulfuric acid, however, HMF yield is much lower without the UV-light irradiation. Even though the production of HMF from UV-photocatalytic degradation of cellulose catalysed by TiO2 in concentrated ZnCl2 solution has been reported [29], the detailed mechanism for the enhanced HMF formation during the UV-light irradiation process needs to be further investigated. On the other hand, it can be speculated that HMF is more resistible to the UV-light photocatalytic degradation than the other carbohydrates. Previous study has also mentioned that photoreforming HMF proceeds at a much slower rate [16]. HMF is a valuable platform chemical converted from cellulose decomposition, and has many applications as an important reagent in organic synthesis. Thus, the selective HMF production could be further optimized in this system, which deserves a further systematic study. In contrast to photoreforming of biomass substance into hydrogen reported in literature, in which more valuable chemicals such as alcohols (e.g. methanol or ethanol) and sugars (e.g. glucose) are mostly used as the electron donors, this work directly employs low-cost cellulose and raw paper pulp as the feedstock, which makes this H2 production process more competitive. In order to scale-up this biomass conversion approach, from the economic point of view, the noble-metal (e.g. Pd or Pt) based co-catalyst should be replaced. Nowadays, various transitional metal based materials such as Ni or MoS2 etc. have been reported as potential alternative co-catalysts of noble-metals [30,31]. Practically, sulfuric acids could be continuously used without further purification. In terms of more efficient utilization of solar energy, further improvements can be expected through the development of visible light photocatalysts with strong redox property [32–40], and utilization of a solar concentrator heating system for the required energy during hydrolysis. On the other hand, the hydrolysis process and photocatalysis process should be concordant for achieving the maximum efficiency, and reactor engineering is also required to gain the gaseous H2 fuel."
11,Conclusions,"We have developed a simple and highly efficient one-pot process, based on merging photocatalysis and acid hydrolysis, for H2 production from photoreforming cellulose in water. The photocatalytic H2 production is promoted by in situ generation of electron donors from direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass materials. The combined catalytic system works through the UV-light irradiation of mixed suspension of platinized titania photocatalyst and cellulose particles in concentrated sulfuric acid solution at 403 K. The reaction conditions are much milder and simpler compared to other technologies for H2 production from biomass such as high temperature gasification and steam reforming. The efficient hydrogen production system is also applicable to utilization of other biomass and raw biomass materials without any pre-treatment. Because of high cost and rigid reaction condition for the degradation of cellulosic biomass in other enzymatic, chemocatalytic, thermocatalytic processes, the results in this work are quite encouraging in terms of recovering hydrogen gas through the decomposition of cellulose."
