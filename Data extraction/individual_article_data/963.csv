0,Introduction,"Nowadays, increasing attention is paid to the development of new hydrogen technologies due to environmental concerns about fossil fuels usage. The use of hydrogen is becoming more and more common as a potential solution to the current fears and to increase energy and economic security as well. This is because hydrogen can be considered as a renewable fuel which liberates a considerable quantity of energy per unit weight (120 kJ/g) without liberating CO2 in its combustion [1]. Moreover, hydrogen is easily converted into electricity by fuel cells. Hence, the investigation of new hydrogen sources is of utmost importance. Presently, hydrogen is produced by fuel processing technologies converting hydrocarbons such as gasoline, methane, methanol, etc. into hydrogen rich stream [1–5]. Fuel processing of methane is the most common hydrogen production method in commercial use today [5]. There exist three main conventional techniques used to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels, namely: steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming [1]. In fact, these techniques are based on an oxidation reaction in which oxygen, water or carbon dioxide play the role of the oxidant. The reforming process produces a gas stream mainly composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Endothermic steam reforming requires an external heat source whereas the partial oxidation is strongly exothermic. Oxygen, water and carbon dioxide can be mixed together to achieve an autothermal reaction (global enthalpy equal to zero). Steam reforming potentially leads to the best hydrogen yields but also to the highest pollution in comparison with the other processes. Partial oxidation and autothermal reforming appear advantageous in terms of system complexity since no external heat source is required, but they raise safety concerns about thermal management. Specific problems like catalyst poisoning, size and weight requirements, compactness, dynamic behavior (sluggish response) and limitations on hydrogen production from heavy hydrocarbons is to be noted. Among the possible innovative options, plasma systems can provide original responses to these drawbacks [4–17]. In the plasma, the overall reforming reactions are the same as in conventional reforming, but the energy and the free radicals used for the reforming reaction are provided by the plasma itself. The plasma plays a catalytic role because highly active species such as electrons, ions and radicals may significantly enhance the reaction rate. High reactivity eliminates the need for a catalyst in the systems. Plasma systems can be applied to various hydrocarbons including natural gas, gasoline, heavy oils and bio fuels, as well as biomass. Moreover, the plasma high energy density leads to compactness of the system and fast response times can be achieved due to the electrical operation of the system. Historically, the first plasma assisted reformers used thermal plasmas, i.e., DC plasma torches, but such devices are not effective in terms of energy consumption. On the contrary, the application of non-thermal plasmas for hydrogen production can be considered very promising because of their non-equilibrium properties, low-power requirement and their capacity to induce physical and chemical reactions in gases at relatively low temperature [8]. Lower temperature results in lower energy consumption and lower electrode erosion since the cooling of electrodes is generally not necessary. Different types of non-thermal plasmas have been used for reforming of hydrocarbons: the corona discharge [10]; the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) [14]; gliding arc technology. The comparison between different arc discharge-based systems shows that the gliding arc technology meets the best performances due to its relative setup simplicity and high flexibility, which allows operation over a wide range of flow rates and the treatment of a large amount of chemical species [8]. Different DC and AC corona discharges operating at room temperature have been applied to decompose alcohols for hydrogen production [15–20]. In spite of the versatile capabilities of DC and AC plasma torches, one of main limitations of such arc based systems is the limited electrode lifetime, which leads to cost increase in operation and maintenance. In this context, microwave discharge-based systems, which are electrodeless, have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Some results obtained with microwave discharges at reduced pressure are presented in [21]. Nevertheless, microwave plasmas operating at atmospheric pressure have been the subject of increased attention during the last decade. It has been shown that high-density microwave plasma torches provide suitable conditions to dissociate molecules in the abatement systems, to burn out chemical and biological warfare agents, and to atomize materials [21–30]. One of the main advantages of microwave plasma torches at atmospheric pressure is that they make it possible to inject large power densities into the plasma and thus to achieve extremely high densities of active species of interest. The capability of microwave plasmas generated by surface waves at atmospheric pressure to decompose various alcohols (methanol, ethanol, butanol and propanol) and to produce hydrogen has been demonstrated in [31]. In particular, surface wave driven discharges offer several advantages over other types of discharges: they can operate with high stability and reproducibility over at large domain of operation conditions; they require lower power to achieve similar values of electron density (note that electrons are responsible for the creation of active species and for the first step in the decomposition processes); they produce large plasma volumes with different possible geometries, which enables high enough residence times. In the present work, a microwave plasma torch driven by surface waves operating at 2.45 GHz and atmospheric pressure has been used to create a plasma environment to decompose methanol/ethanol. A plasma in a gas mixture of argon and methanol/ethanol (CH3OH, C2H5OH) has been created using a waveguide surfatron-based setup [32]. In order to investigate the contribution of steam reforming reaction, water vapor has also been introduced into the mixture. Methanol/ethanol and water vapor are introduced into the discharge by bubbling of Ar through the alcohol and water. Mass spectrometry has been used to detect molecular hydrogen produced by methanol/ethanol decomposition. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy has been applied to detect such species as H2O, CO2 and CO molecules, which are produced as a result of plasma driven decomposition processes and subsequent association processes. The influence of the Ar “bubbling” flow through the liquid methanol/ethanol on the H2, CO2 and CO partial fluxes has been investigated, as well as the dependence of produced H2 flow on the power delivered to the launcher. The influence of water vapor in the plasma on the H2 yield has also been analyzed. The optical emission spectrum in the range 250–700 nm was investigated to detect the presence of the species of interest in the discharge."
1,Experimental setup,"The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . A surface wave induced microwave plasma torch is created using a waveguide surfatron-based setup [32]. The microwave power is provided by a 2.45 GHz generator (Sairem), whose output power was varied from 200 to 700 W. The generator is connected to a waveguide (WR-340) system, which includes an isolator, directional couplers, a 3-stub tuner, and a waveguide surfatron as a field applicator. The above system is terminated by a movable short-circuit, which allows the maximization of the electric field at the launcher position. The discharge takes place inside a quartz tube with internal/external radii of 7.5/9 mm, which is inserted vertically and perpendicularly to the waveguide wider wall. The background gas is injected into the discharge tube at flow rates from 100 to 4000 sccm under laminar gas flow conditions. Alcohol (methanol/ethanol) is introduced into the discharge using bubbling of Ar (purity of 99.999%) through the alcohol filled tank at room temperature as shown in the figure. The bubbling method allows one not to involve any additional energy in the process. The total flow Qt consists of two parts. One part goes through the tank containing the alcohol to drag its molecules (bubbling). The resulting mixture (Ar + alcohol) flow QA is combined with the second part of pure Ar flow QAr and the total flow Qt = QA + QAr is then introduced into the quartz tube, where the discharge takes place. When water vapor is additionally introduced into the plasma, the pure Ar flow is divided in two different fractional “bubbling” flows. The first one is formed by “bubbling” of Ar through the alcohol tank QA and the second one is formed by “bubbling” of Ar through a water tank, i.e., QW. Then, the two fractional flows are combined and the total gas flow Qt = QA + QW is introduced into the discharge chamber. The water in the tank was heated up to 70 °C and the pipes delivering water to the launcher were overheated. Pure methanol/ethanol (QMethanol, QEthanol) flows have been determined by calibration. Mass Spectrometry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) have been used to analyze the exhaust gas stream fluxes. For gas sampling, a portion of the output gas stream from the plasma reactor was directed to the mass analyzer or the FTIR spectrometer, respectively. A Stanford Research System RGA 200 mass analyzer was used. It can separate H2, O2, Ar, H2O, CO, CO2 and CH4, C2H2, as well as other light hydrocarbons. The absorption spectra of H2O, CO, CO2, and C2H5OH (ethanol) species were detected by an FTIR Termo Nicolet 5700 spectrometer in the wave number range of 1000–4000 cm−1. The light emitted by the plasma radiative species was collected perpendicularly to the discharge tube by an optical fibre. A collimator located in front of the optical fibre defines the discharge volume from where the plasma radiation is collected. The optical system consists of a 1.25 m focal length (visible light) Jobin-Yvon Spex 1250 spectrometer, with a holographic ruled diffraction grating (2400 grmm−1) equipped with a CCD camera. The cryogenic, back illuminated UV sensitive CCD camera has a 2048 × 512 matrix, featuring a 13.5 μm pixel-size, which provides high spatial and spectral resolutions. The instrumental function width was determined to be Δλ app = 0.04 Å. The plasma emission in the 250−850 nm range has been investigated."
2,Experimental results,"In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the microwave plasma decomposition processes of methanol and ethanol, the hydrogen yield dependence on the fluxes and the microwave input power has been investigated both in Ar and Ar + water environments. Separate experiments have been performed for methanol and ethanol."
3,Decomposition of methanol,"3.1 Decomposition of methanol 3.1.1 Effect of feed flow rates and input power The dependence of the process yield on methanol flow, total flow Qt and microwave power delivered to the launcher has been investigated. The species in the exhaust gas stream have been detected in order to investigate the effectiveness of the argon microwave plasma to break down the bonds of methanol molecules and release hydrogen molecules. The methanol molecules have been introduced by the “bubbling” method described above. There is a clear jump in H2 partial pressure, as measured with the mass analyzer, when the microwave plasma is turned on. The dynamic behavior of the plasma decomposition system is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The H2 partial pressure variation with time exhibits a step-like behavior when the methanol flow is changed; increasing the methanol flow increases the partial H2 and CO pressures. Note that H2 and CO are the methanol dissociation products according to the reaction CH3OH → 2H2 + CO (R1). Other species detected by the mass analyzer (Ar, N2, H2O) do not show changes when the plasma is turned on or turned off. The variation of the H2 production rate vs. the pure methanol flow for different total flows is shown in Fig. 3 . The theoretical dependence according to the dissociation reaction (R1) is also shown on this figure (solid line). As seen, for a total flux Qt in the range 500–2000 sccm the hydrogen production rate agrees with the predictions from (R1), indicating that every CH3OH molecule yields two H2 molecules as a result of the plasma stimulated dissociation process (nearly 100% efficiency of the decomposition process). The H2 production rate shows a strong non-linear dependence on the total flow when the fractional Ar “bubbling” QA flow is kept constant; it reaches a maximum at about 4000 sccm total Ar flow and then decreases. This decrease at higher total fluxes (>4000 sccm) can be explained by the decrease of the amount of methanol in the mixture. Moreover, the residence time also decreases at higher gas velocities. The microwave input power is also an important parameter in the plasma decomposition process. The power density, i.e., the absorbed power per unit volume, is linearly correlated with the electron number density [33–35]. The electrons are responsible for the first step of the decomposition processes since they produce reactive species in the discharge via different types of collisions with the gas atoms and molecules. The dependence of the hydrogen yield on the total microwave power delivered to the launcher in the range 100–700 W is shown in Fig. 4 . Here, the total Qt and QMethanol flows are kept constant. The observed increase in hydrogen yield with the input power can be explained by the fact that more active species are generated at higher microwave power. However, some saturation in hydrogen production is observed for microwave powers greater than 400 W, which corresponds to a power density of about 10 W/cm3. This fact is likely to be correlated with electron density saturation at high microwave power [33–35]. Fig. 5 (a, b) shows the emission of Ar/methanol plasma in the visible spectral range of 250–600 nm. Emissions from radiative molecular and atomic species such as CN, C2, OH and the hydrogen Balmer-alpha line (not shown here) were detected. The presence of these species is a signature of the dissociation processes of the alcohol molecules. Furthermore, three body recombination processes also occur and CN species are formed according to the reactions [31] C + N + Ar → CN ∗ ( B 2 Σ ) + Ar Strong emission bands from the C2 radical, i.e., the Swan system, were observed, while no emission of excited CO species was detected. The emission of C atoms appears at 244.91 nm, 248.66 nm and 289.14 nm as seen on the spectrum. The typical green C2 emission is generated by the radiative decay of C 2 ∗ ( A 3 Π g ) level. Due to the low energy threshold (E ext = 2.4 eV), ground state C2 molecules can easily be excited to this level either by electron impact [36] (1) C 2 ( X ) + e − → C 2 ∗ ( A 3 Π g ) + Ar or by three body recombination processes involving C and Ar atoms (2) C + C + Ar → C 2 ∗ ( A 3 Π g ) + Ar C2 molecules can also be created by recombination of two carbon atoms at the quartz tube wall (3) C + C ( + wall ) → C 2 ( + wall ) Furthermore, C2 molecules associate in the wall. In fact, a small carbon black deposit appears on the discharge wall when methanol is introduced in the Ar plasma environment. 3.1.2 Effect of additional water vapor flow The effect of a small addition of water vapor on the hydrogen and the carbon oxide/dioxide yields has also been investigated. For this purpose, the Ar–water flow (QW) was combined with the Ar/methanol flow QA (Qt = QA + QW). The water in the tank has been heated to about 70 °C for this purpose. The pipes delivering water have been overheated. Due to the reaction CH3OH + H2O → 3H2 + CO2 (R2), an increase in the H2 (see Fig. 6 ) and CO2 yields is observed. It should be noted that the methanol decomposition reaction CH3OH → 2H2 + CO (R1) is followed by the so called water gas shift reaction CO + H2O → H2 + CO2 (R3) when water vapor is introduced, which nearly fully removes the carbon oxide."
4,Decomposition of ethanol,"3.2 Decomposition of ethanol 3.2.1 Effects of feed flow rates An ethanol solution (96% ethanol + water) has been introduced in the Ar plasma environment by the “bubbling” method described above. Fig. 7 (a,b) shows two FTIR spectra in the 1000–4000 cm−1 wave number range as obtained before and after the microwave plasma torch is applied, respectively, for 500 W applied power, 500 sccm total Ar flow and two different ethanol flows. The spectral lines at wave numbers around 3000 and 1000–1500 cm−1 are a signature of the ethanol presence in the exhaust stream before the plasma is turned on. As expected, the Ar plasma environment totally decomposes the ethanol molecules. The primary by-products of this decomposition are CO2 and H2O, as detected by FTIR. The ethanol decomposition is likely to occur through the reaction C2H5OH → CO + 3H2 + C (R4). The presence of CO2 and water in the exhaust stream can be explained by the conversion of part of CO into CO2 as a result of the water gas shift reaction CO + H2O → H2 + CO2 (R3). Moreover, the presence of a small quantity of H2O can initiate the steam reforming reaction C2H5OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 (R5). Since the used ethanol solution contains about 4% of water, steam reforming and water gas shift reactions do occur. The CO2 absorption clearly decreases when the total Qt flow increases at constant ethanol percentage in the mixture (not shown here). It should be noted that QA is kept constant. Therefore, the relative amount of ethanol in the mixture decreases as the total gas flow increases, consequently the amount of CO2 decreases. The dynamic behavior of the plasma decomposition system exhibits jumps in the H2 partial pressure when the ethanol flow increases (see Fig. 8 ). The corresponding variations in CO and CO2 partial pressures are also shown in this figure. As seen, the latter partial pressures are nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that of molecular hydrogen. The presence of CO in the output signal can be explained by the different distance from the exit of the microwave plasma torch to the entrance of the mass analyzer as compared to the distance to the FTIR gas cell entrance, which results in different residence times. The variation of the hydrogen production rate vs. the ethanol input flow at different total flows and constant microwave power of 600 W is shown in Fig. 9 . The hydrogen production rate increases when the amount of ethanol increases. The maximum output is observed for a total Ar flow of 2000 sccm. For a higher total flow of 4000 sccm the H2 yield is significantly lower. This decrease of H2 yield at higher Ar total flows can be ascribed to the decrease in residence time due to the increased gas velocity. In the range 500–5000 sccm the residence time varies between 1.8 and 18.5 ms. When ethanol is introduced into the plasma a black deposit on the quartz wall appears. This indicates that some recombination reactions (such as (3)) may be in play. Furthermore, association reactions such as C2 + C2 (wall) → carbon black, produce carbon black deposit on the tube wall as observed in the experiment. 3.2.2 Effect of additional water vapor introduced into the plasma In order to investigate the influence of the steam reforming reaction, an additional quantity of water vapor was introduced by “bubbling” of Ar through the water tank as done before. The dynamic behavior of the H2 production rate as measured by the mass analyzer is shown in Fig. 10 , for three different values of the argon/ethanol (QA) flow, when additional water is introduced in the plasma environment. In fact, the H2 yield nearly doubles when water vapor is added. The infrared absorption spectra of the argon/ethanol plasma exhaust stream with and without water addition are shown in Fig. 11 . As seen from this figure, water addition into the plasma causes a decrease in CO2 absorption and the appearance of CO absorption. The intensity of H2O bands dramatically decreases. These results demonstrate that the steam reforming reaction (R5) is dominant when water vapor is introduced into the plasma. Furthermore, no carbon black deposition was observed in this case, which seems to confirm that the steam reforming reaction is the dominant process of H2 production here."
5,Characterization of argon – alcohol – water plasma torch,"The presence of alcohols and water vapor in the argon plasma torch change significantly the plasma characteristics. Optical emission spectroscopy has been applied to measure the gas temperature and the electron density as key plasma parameters. Usually, the rotational temperature of the OH radical is determined as a measure of the gas temperature. Here, the emission spectrum of the OH ( A 2 Σ + , v = 0 − X 2 Π i , v ′ = 0 ) (Q1 branch) band in the range 306–315 nm was detected. The measured spectrum is shown in Fig. 12 a. The rotational temperature has been determined by using the classical Boltzmann plot method (Fig. 12b). Assuming equilibrium, the intensity of the emission lines (I R) of a rotational band can be expressed as [29] (4) I R = a A j H c λ exp [ − E j h c k T R ] where a is a constant, A j is the transition probability of rotational level j, h is the Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, λ is the wavelength of the line, k is the Boltzmann’s constant, T R is the rotational temperature, and E j is the energy of the emitting state. Using (4), the rotational temperature can readily be calculated from the slope of the Boltzmann plot log(I R λ/A j) vs. E j (Fig. 12b). The variation of the gas temperature with the methanol flow is shown in Fig. 13 . These results were obtained in Ar/methanol and Ar/methanol/water vapor plasmas at constant total flow of 500 sccm and constant microwave power delivered to the launcher. As seen, the gas temperature keeps nearly constant at about 3000 K when the methanol flow changes from 2 to 11 sccm. The presence of water in the plasma increases the gas temperature to about 3500–4000 K. Measurement of Stark line broadening, which is proportional to the local charge density around the emitter, is the most frequently used method to determine charge density. The Stark broadening of the Balmer-alpha Hα line has been measured in our case. It should be noted that Hβ was not detected in the present experiments. The measured line profiles have been fitted by a Voigt function as shown in Fig. 14 . The data shown in the figure match a Voigt profile with a squared correlation coefficient value of R 2 = 0.9999. As is well known, a Voigt profile results from the folding of a Gaussian (Doppler and instrumental broadening) profile with a Lorentzian one (van der Waals, resonance, natural and Stark broadening). Estimations show that resonance and natural broadening are negligible under the present conditions. A deconvolution procedure has been used to determine the full width at half-maximum of the Gaussian (ΔλG) and Lorentzian (ΔλL) components. Stark and van der Waals broadening convolute to give a Lorentzian component. The measured gas temperature has been used to estimate van der Waals broadening (∼0.116 A) and the latter has been deconvoluted from the Lorentzian full width at half maximum to estimate the pure Stark broadening. Assuming that Ar atoms are the main perturbers, the same expression for van der Waals broadening of the Hα line as presented in [30] has been used. The electron density has been calculated making a fit of the widths listed by Gigosos et al. [37] for a reduced mass of 0.976, which corresponds to the present emitter – perturber conditions, i.e., the pair hydrogen – argon. The values of electron density so determined at 2 cm from the launcher vary in the range 3.3 × 1013–5.4 × 1014 cm−3, for a total flux (Qt) varying from 500 to 2000 sccm, and QMethanol is kept constant at 19,6 sccm and 500 W microwave power delivered to the launcher. It should be noted that the densities determined in this way correspond to radially averaged values. The obtained values are consistent with those presented in [31], taking into account the difference in tube radius of both systems."
6,Conclusions,"A microwave plasma torch operating at 2.45 GHz and atmospheric pressure conditions has been used to create a plasma environment to decompose alcohols. Methanol/ethanol and water vapor have been introduced into the discharge by bubbling of Ar through the alcohol and water. Mass spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy have been applied to detect the molecular hydrogen produced by methanol/ethanol decomposition and H2O, CO2 and CO molecules in the exhaust gas stream. Nearly 100% decomposition of methanol was achieved with the Ar/methanol plasma torch operation. The obtained results demonstrate that in the total flow range Qt = 500–2000 sccm every CH3OH molecule yields two H2 molecules as a result of plasma decomposition processes. The emission of carbon atoms and C2 radicals (Swan system) was also detected in the visible spectra of argon/methanol plasmas. Furthermore, the association of carbon atoms was shown to result in the formation of black carbon deposit on the quartz wall. It was further found that the H2 yield increases by about 50% when water is added into the Ar/methanol plasma mixture. The hydrogen production rate in the exhaust stream of the Ar/ethanol plasma torch was observed to increase when the amount of ethanol increases. CO, CO2 and water were detected as by-products of the plasma decomposition processes. The hydrogen production rate was nearly doubled when two partial flows, passing (“bubbling”) through ethanol and water, respectively, were combined. Two main reactions, i.e., C2H5OH → CO + 3H2 + C and C2H5OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 are the most likely source channels of H2. The latter one, i.e., the steam reforming reaction appears to be dominant. No carbon black deposit formation at the wall was observed during the operation of the Ar/ethanol/water vapor plasma torch. This fact further supports the hypothesis that the steam reforming reaction is dominant."
