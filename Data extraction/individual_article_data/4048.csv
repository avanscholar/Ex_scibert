0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines is an important synthetic route employed in the production of fine chemicals, dyes, polymers, food products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and pollution treatment [1,2]. The reaction is carried via either a non-catalytic route using a metal and an acid [3,4] or a catalytic process in the presence of a reducing agent [5,6]. Invariably, catalysts and reagents used in these processes involve metals such as Co [1], Ti [7], Au [8] or Pt [9]. The commonly employed harsh reaction conditions involving strong acids, heat and high pressures often leach away the metals in the catalysts and reagents into the downstream raising strong concerns about not only the economic loss but also the potential toxicity in the products. The use of elements such as Fe, Cu or Zn are preferred as they are environmentally benign, earth abundant, biologically safe, and less expensive [10,11]. Catalytic reduction of nitroarenes is a superior to metal-acid method as the leaching of metal ions in the downstream is avoided. Table S1 summarizes the recently reported catalysts for thermal and photochemical reduction of nitroarenes. Catalysts based on Co, Ni using hydrazine hydrate were reported to thermally reduce nitro arenes to amines (Entries 1, 2, Table S1). Cu based catalysts have been widely used in industrial reactions for several decades [12–14]. The preference over the use of Cu based catalysts and reagents for the transformation of organic functional groups, particularly under mild conditions, is apparent in several recent studies [12–14]. Beller et al. demonstrated the chemoselective reduction of unsaturated C=C bonds and –NO2 groups at 80 °C using H2 at 40 bar using supported Cu catalysts [15]. The commercially available CuO was reported to be active for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes using ammoniaborane as the hydrogen source [16,17]. In addition to these, Cu based catalysts supported on metal oxides and CuO in various morphologies (Entries 3–10, Table S1) have been reported to be active for the nitroarene reduction using NaBH4 as the reducing agent. Surprisingly, even noble metals supported on metal oxides such as Pt/CeO2 and Pt/mesoporous Al2O3 (Entry 11, 12, Table S1) reported only moderate conversion and selectivity for the nitroarene reduction. The pre-treated catalysts operate under H2 at high pressure. Interestingly, Pd/NH2-UiO-66 (amine based - Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 cluster) (Entry 13, Table S1) employed dehydrogenation of HCOOH to reduce nitroarenes. Besides using expensive metals, the catalyst is reported to take 7 h to complete the conversion of 1 mmol of nitrobenzene. Similarly, CeO2 was reported to reduce nitrobenzene using hydrazine hydrate in ethanol at 80 °C for 8 h (Entry 14, Table S1). The choice of the reducing agent is important to a chemical process from the environment perspective. In particular, use of hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent is preferred as it does not form any solid by-products like that of NaBH4 [18] and it is also a safer alternative to molecular H2. In addition to the transition metals, noble metal based Pd-C nanospheres and Pd-C (Entries, 15 and 16, Table S1) have been reported for the nitroarene reduction using hydrazine hydrate. Hence, a copper based material that is active for the nitroarene reduction using hydrazine hydrate is desirable. Interestingly, the reactivity of a reducible oxide such as CuO to decompose N2H4 spontaneously to N2 and H2O was patented in 1989 [19]. However, not much work has been done since then to exploit it in chemical transformations. In this work, the spontaneous decomposition of hydrazine by CuO was exploited in the chemical reduction of nitroarenes. CuO prepared in this work displayed 100 % conversion of nitroarenes (2.9 mmol) at room temperature in less than a minute with 100 % selectivity to amines. The present work is an interesting deviation from the earlier published works as no external source of heat, light or radiation was employed in this reaction. More interestingly, CuO reported here behaves as a reusable solid reagent rather than a catalyst."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cu(NO3)2.3H2O (99.99 %), hydrazine monohydrate and other organic substrates were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (99.9 %)."
3,Preparation of materials,"2.2 Preparation of materials CuO-N-250 was prepared by heating 2 g of copper nitrate in a quartz boat to 250 °C for 12 h in the open air followed by natural cooling to room temperature. The color of the powder was black. After the reaction, the recovered solid was labeled as CuO-N-250-AR. For regenerating CuO-N-250-AR, 160 mg of sample was taken in a quartz boat and heated at 450 °C for 12 h. The CuO regenerated thus is labeled as CuO-N-450. To prepare control samples, 80 mg of CuO-N-250 was kept under a reducing atmosphere (5% H2 in Ar) at 300 °C for 15 min followed by quenching in the same atmosphere to produce CuO/Cu. Synthesis of CuO-N-N-250 was carried out by taking 2 g of copper nitrate in a quartz boat and heated at 250 °C for 12 h in the N2 and O2 atmosphere (N/O∼9). After 12 h, the sample was quenched in the same atmosphere."
4,Reduction of nitroarenes,"2.3 Reduction of nitroarenes In a typical experiment, 80 mg of the CuO-N-250 was added to a test tube with a magnetic bead. The mixture (300 μL of nitrobenzene and 600 μL of hydrazine monohydrate) was added into the test tube with stirring. The organic compounds were extracted in ethyl acetate and used for further analysis."
5,Characterization of materials,"2.4 Characterization of materials The crystalline phase of the CuO was analyzed using a powder X-Ray diffractometer (Model: Rigaku Smart Lab XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154 nm) operated at a voltage of 45 kV and a current of 200 mA. The pattern was recorded in the range of 2θ = 20−80° with a step (deg) of 0.02. The reducibility of CuO-N-250 was analyzed using Temperature Programmed Reduction in H2 using a Chemisorption technique (Model: Chemstar TPX, Quantachrome instruments). The sample was pre-treated to 900 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min in the Ar atmosphere after which, it was cooled to 70 °C in the same atmosphere. Temperature was raised from 70 to 800 °C at 10 °C/min in the flow of 5% H2 in Ar at the rate of 30 mL/min. By using a thermal conductivity detector, the consumption of H2 for the reduction process was calculated at each temperature point. Raman spectrophotometer (Model: Horiba Labram HR Evo) was used for analyzing the vibrational modes of CuO in the range of 100−1000 cm−1 employing the 532 nm ULF laser source. The morphology of the CuO was characterized using the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, Model: Carl Zeiss Gemini SEM300) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Samples were Au/Pd sputtered before the analysis. The surface area of the material was calculated using physisorption (Autosorp IQ-MP-MP Viton). The sample was degassed for 2 h at 200 °C under a N2 atmosphere before analysis. The binding energies of the elements on the catalyst were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments UK, Model K ALPHA+) with an X-Ray Source- Al Kα (Monchromatic) with 6 mA beam current and 12 kV. The gas chromatograph (Model: Agilent GC 7890 B) with the capillary column (DB-1) and a flame ionization detector and high-performance liquid chromatography (Model: Nexera X2, Shimadzu scientific instruments) were used for the separation and quantification of the components in the reaction mixture. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (Shimadzu IR Tracer 100), equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory and a DLATGS (Deuterated L-alanine doped triglycine sulphate) detector. The DRIFTS reaction chamber is made of stainless steel and has a ZnSe window. The praying mantis mirror arrangement directs the incident beam onto the surface of the catalyst bed and collects the diffusion reflectance for analysis by the FTIR spectrometer. Approximately 100 mg of the finely ground CuO was put into a sample cup and placed into the sample cell. After that the sample was degassed for one hour at 250 °C in the nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to the room temperature in the same atmosphere. Then 30 μL of nitrobenzene was injected and spectrum recorded after 5 min."
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed using the plane-wave DFT code available in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.3.5) [20]. An energy cut off of 396 eV was used to expand the plane-wave basis set. The projected augmentation wave (PAW) method was used to describe the frozen core electrons and their interaction with the valence electrons. DFT + U methodology with generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization (GGA-PBE) was applied [21]. The value of Ueff =7 eV and J=0 eV for the 3d electrons of Cu, where Ueff = U-J (the difference between Coulumb U and exchange J parameter) were adopted from an earlier report [22]. To account for van der Waals interactions, dispersion corrections proposed by Grimme et al. [23,24] were applied. Convergence criteria for energy and forces on the structure are set at 1 × 10−6 eV and 0.05 eV/Å respective for geometry optimization. In order to study the oxygen and Cu vacancy formation energies and nitrobenzene adsorption on CuO (111) surface, a (3 × 2) slab of CuO (111) with four atomic layers and 20 Å vacuum thickness was used. A Monkhorst−Pack k-point mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 5 were used for the CuO surface and Cu bulk periodic system for integration in the reciprocal space. During optimization, the adsorbate and the top two layers of the slab were allowed to relax, whereas the bottom two layers were fixed to the bulk coordinates. The adsorption energy per molecule was calculated using the following relation: (1) E ads = E surface+mol − ( E sur + E mol ) where Esurface+mol is the total energy of the adsorbate-surface Esur is the energy of the metal oxide slab, and Emol is the energy of the nitrobenzene in the gas phase. The (Ov) and Cu vacancy (Cuv) formation energy on the CuO (111) surface was calculated using the following relation: (2) E O ,Vac = E ( Cu O ( O − V ) ) + 1 2 E ( O 2 ( g ) ) − E ( CuO ) Where E(CuO) is the energy of CuO (111) surface, E(CuO(O-V)) is the energy of CuO (111) surface with (Ov) and E(O2(g)) is the energy of oxygen molecule in gas-phase. (3) E Cu,vac = E ( Cu O ( Cu − v ) ) + E ( C u ( bulk ) ) − E ( CuO ) where, E(CuO) is the energy of CuO (111) surface, E(CuO(Cu-v)) is the energy of CuO (111) surface with Cuv and E(Cu(bulk)) is the energy of Cu in bulk FCC crystal. The Ov formation energy in the reduced environment was calculated using the following relation: (4) E O , vac = E ( Cu O ( o − v ) ) + E ( H 2 O ( g ) ) + 1 2 E ( N 2 ( g ) ) − 1 2 E ( N 2 H 4 ( g ) ) − E ( CuO ) where, E(CuO) is the energy of CuO (111) surface, E(CuO(O-V)) is the energy of CuO (111) surface with Ov and E(N2H4(g)), E(N2(g) and E(H2O(g)) are the energy of N2H4, N2 and O2 molecule in gas-phase. The energy values of gas-phase species N2, H2O, O2 and N2H4 were taken from the NIST library (NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and benchmark database NIST standard reference database number 101 Release 21. Aug. 2020 (http://cccbdb.nist.gov/)). DFT + U calculation are further applied to calculate the structures on the minimum energy path (MEP) using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [25]. The NEB method was improvised by the implementation of a climbing image algorithm to identify the structures corresponding to the maxima on the MEP as done in our previous reports [25,26]. Eight sets of images were used to linearly interpolate the reaction coordinate connecting the reactant and the product state. Spin-polarization and dispersive corrections were also included for the transition state calculations. A force convergence criteria was set to 0.2 eV/Å to obtain structures on the MEP. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated as the energy difference between the transition and the reactant states."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Reactivity and Structure of CuO-N-250,"3.1 Reactivity and Structure of CuO-N-250 CuO used in this work was prepared by the thermal decomposition of copper nitrate at 250 °C (CuO-N-250) in air. In a typical reaction, CuO-N-250 and nitroarenes were used in an equimolar ratio under neat conditions and a slight excess of hydrazine hydrate (see experimental section 2.3). In 10 s, a vigorous exothermic reaction occurred and the temperature increased up to 112 °C (See video in S2). The exothermic reaction subsided in 45 s leaving behind a reaction mixture containing an aqueous and an organic layer. It was observed that in 45 s, 2.9 mmol of nitrobenzene had been completely converted to aniline (100 % selectivity) by CuO-N-250. Interestingly, it was also observed that by the end of the reaction the black-colored CuO powder had turned into brown in colour (CuO-N-250-AR). The sample CuO-N-250 and CuO-N-250-AR were subjected to various characterization to understand the structure and the reactivity. In Fig. 1 a, the XRD pattern of the CuO-N-250 is shown in trace i (green). The peaks could be indexed to pure monoclinic phase (JCPDS # 98-005-9300). Trace ii (blue) is the XRD pattern of CuO-N-250-AR. The sample did not contain any trace of CuO and all the peaks could be assigned to metallic Cu confirming that Cu2+ is reduced to Cu° during the reaction. This observation also corroborated well with the results of the H2-TPR as shown in Fig. 1b. The freshly prepared CuO-N-250 trace i (green) showed the onset of reduction around 300 °C which continued till 450 °C [27]. In contrast, CuO-N-250-AR displayed a significant decrease in the uptake of H2 trace ii-(blue) strongly indicating the absence of reducible Cu2+ cations. FESEM images of the CuO-N-250 (Fig. 1c) displayed irregularly shaped microstructures organized in the form of stacked plates. Each plate like structure is of a few microns in length and around 200–300 nm in thickness. FESEM images of CuO-N-250-AR (Fig. 1d) showed spherical particles of 50–100 nm in size. In Fig. 1e, TEM images of CuO-N-250 are shown. The microstructural analysis revealed the presence of highly crystalline micron sized particles of CuO. The high resolution lattice fringes of CuO in Fig. 1f clearly showed the (111) plane whose d spacing was consistent with the XRD data. The BET surface area [27] calculated using physisorbed N2 isotherm on CuO-N-250 was 1.02 m2 g−1 with type II isotherm observed (Fig. S3), which indicated the non-porous material [28]. To check the effect of temperature of the synthesis on the reaction performance, CuO was prepared from copper nitrate by calcining at different temperatures such as 250, 350, 450, 550 and 650 °C and the performance of each of them was tested for the reduction of nitrobenzene. XRD of all the samples could be indexed to pure monoclinic cupric oxide without any impurity phase as shown in Fig. S4. All the samples gave 100% conversion of 2.9 mmol of nitrobenzene in 45 s at room temperature. Reactivity behaviour of CuO prepared at a particular temperature (650 °C) for different duration of calcination also remained unchanged."
9,Probing the defects on CuO-N-250,"3.2 Probing the defects on CuO-N-250 XPS was recorded to probe the surface composition of CuO-N-250. From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of CuO-N-250 (Fig. 2 a), four peaks were observed in the Cu2p region. The peaks observed at 933.2 and 953.2 eV were characteristic of Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 respectively [29,30]. The remaining two peaks at 941.7 and 961.8 eV were due to the satellite peaks of Cu2+ ions [29]. The shake-up satellite peaks [31] at 942.1 and 962.0 eV were characteristic of the partially filled d-block (3d9) Cu2+. It confirmed the presence of Cu2+ ions and ruled out the existence of Cu+ as in Cu2O [32]. The broad peak of O1s was deconvoluted into three peaks (Fig. 2b). The peak at 529.1 eV (OL-red) was due to the lattice oxygen (O2−) [29,30,33]. The second peak at 531.1 eV (OV-green) was due to the ionization of oxygen species that occurred due to the compensation of the oxygen deficiencies in the subsurface of copper oxides [29,34]. The peak at 533.0 eV (OA-brown) was due to the weakly adsorbed oxygen species [34]. The percentage of the area under the curve due to various oxygen species was calculated to know the relative concentrations of the oxygen species contributing from the surface [33]. Interestingly, the area under the curves due to O.L, O.V. and OA in CuO-N-250 were 54.2 %, 40.9 % and 4.9 % respectively, clearly suggesting the presence of high concentrations of OV [29,33]. Wang et al. [35] showed the change in the intensity of (111)/(200) planes in XRD pattern of CuO to be closely related to the presence of copper vacancies (Cuv) [35]. XRD patterns of CuO were measured with the internal standard crystalline Si powder added in a constant weight ratio. The ratio of the intensity of the CuO peak (111)/(200) with respect to the intensity of the Si (111) peak was compared for CuO-N-250 that was prepared in 20 % O2 in N2 (air) and a control CuO prepared in 10 % O2 in N2. The ICuO/ISi for CuO-N-250 was lesser by 5% compared to the control sample prepared in N2-richer atmosphere indicating the presence of CuV in CuO-N-250 sample. The decrease in the intensity of (111)/(200) plane of CuO is also consistent with the earlier results indicating the possiility of the presence of [35]. Raman spectroscopy is a very useful tool to probe the vibrational modes which carries a strong signature of the crystal structure. In Fig. 3 a trace i, Raman spectrum of CuO-N-250 is given. The vertical reference lines at the bottom indicate the position of Raman bands of bulk CuO as reported in the literature [36]. The Raman modes of vibrations for the standard bulk CuO have been reported at 296, 340 and 630 cm−1 corresponding to Ag, B1g and B2g respectively [36]. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3a (trace i-green), three major bands were observed in CuO-N-250 at 273 (Ag), 302 (B1g) and 607 (B2g) cm−1. No other bands corresponding to other phases of copper oxides were observed [37]. Importantly, there were significant red shifts in the wavenumber of all the three modes of vibrations in CuO-N-250 from the reference lines [36]. These vibrational modes of the CuO are sensitive to the O atom [36] and the shift in the Raman frequency indicated a change in the symmetry of the lattice and phonon confinement effects strongly indicating the presence of lattice vacancies. Following the experimental evidence on the existence of OV and copper vacancies, DFT calculations were performed to understand the energetics of their configurations on the surface and its possible interaction with nitrobenzene. Using DFT simulations, Maimaiti et al. [38] predicted that the computed surface energies of different CuO stoichiometric surfaces follow the order CuO (111) < CuO (011) < CuO (110) < CuO (010) < CuO (100), which indicated that CuO (111) is the most stable surface which was consistent with the report by Hu et al. [39]. Thus, CuO (111) surface was chosen as the model surface to study the adsorption of nitrobenzene. The CuO (111) surface consisting of four atomic layers was used for studying the nitrobenzene adsorption. The top layer of CuO (111) surface consisted of 3 and 4-fold Cu and O atoms (Fig. 4 ). The 3-coordinated O atoms (O3, Fig. 4) on the CuO (111) surface were the most exposed atoms connected to a one-three coordinated Cu atom (Cu3) and two four coordinated Cu atoms (Cu4). For surface adsorption, nitrobenzene was placed in different configurations (perpendicular and parallel) (Fig. 5 (a to d)). Strongest binding (Eads = -120.1 kJ/mol) was calculated when the nitrobenzene molecule was placed parallel to the surface as shown in Fig. 5d where one of the oxygen atoms of nitrobenzene formed a bond with the Cu3 of CuO (111) surface. Similar observation was made by Mishra et al. where CO2 adsorbed more strongly in a parallel position on the Cu3 and O3 atoms of CuO (111) surfaces [40]. Sun et al. also reported maximum adsorption of Hg atom on Cu3 atoms [41]. The Cu-O bond distance was calculated to be 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å, respectively (Fig. 5d). There are two possible types of Ov and Cuv present on the CuO (111) surface, formed by either removing the three-fold O3 and Cu3 or four-fold O4 and Cu4 (Fig. S5). The Ov formation energy was calculated to be lower for O3 (273.6 kJ/mol) as compared to O4 (345.9 kJ/mol). Similar values for Ov formation energies are reported for O3 and O4 by Maimati et al. [38] Thus, O3 vacancy is likely to be readily formed as compared to O4. Similarly, Cu3 and Cu4 vacancy formation energies were calculated to be 150.6 and 218.3 kJ/mol respectively. This indicated that Cuv, in general, are easily formed on the CuO (111) surface as compared to Ov. Interestingly, under reducing environment (when N2H4 is used as the reducing agent), OV formation energy is significantly reduced to -3.83 kJ/mol (Fig. 4), which indicated facile formation of oxygen vacancies Ov as compared to Cuv (150.6 kJ/mol, Fig. 4). Ov therefore plays a predominant role in the reactivity of CuO. This contrast in formation energies of Ov versus Cuv was also noticed by Wang et al., wherein the authors observed lesser Cuv formation energy as compared to OV in oxygen-rich environment, while in lean oxygen condition, OV formation became easier [35]. In order to study the effect of Cuv and OV on the adsorption of nitrobenzene on the CuO (111) surface, the adsorption energy of nitrobenzene on the non-stoichiometric CuO (111) surface were calculated. Nitrobenzene adsorption energy was significantly higher on OV (Eads = -148.5 kJ/mol, Fig. 5(f)) as compared to CuV (Eads = −115.3 kJ/mol, Fig. 5(e)) and stoichiometric CuO (111) surface (-120.1 kJ/mol, Fig. 5(d)). Oxygen atoms of nitrobenzene were adsorbed at a Cu-O distance of 1.8 and 2 Å (Fig. 5f) on the oxygen vacant CuO (111) surface, which is slightly less than that stoichiometric surface, leading to a strong binding. A similar increase in adsorption energies of CO, CS2 and H2O was observed on non-stoichiometric surface of CuO (111) [42,43]. The increase in adsorption energy on the non-stoichiometric surface was attributed to the decrease in the coordination number of Cu atom adjacent to a Ov [44] as compared to the stoichiometric CuO (111) surface [43]."
10,Experimental investigation of interaction of nitrobenzene and CuO,"3.3 Experimental investigation of interaction of nitrobenzene and CuO Wang et al. showed the interaction of nitrobenzene with metal oxide to understand the role of oxygen vacancy using the Raman spectrum [2]. The presence of oxygen vacancy in the CuO-N-250 was confirmed and discussed in detail (Section 3.2). After confirming the Ov in CuO-N-250, a small volume of nitrobenzene was drop casted over the surface of the CuO-N-250 and the spectrum was recorded after evaporating the excess nitrobenzene. In Fig. 3a, Raman spectra of CuO-N-250 (trace I) and CuO-N-250 adsorbed with nitrobenzene (trace II) are shown. The position of Ag, B1g and B2g bands observed in the case of bulk CuO is represented by dotted vertical lines. Interestingly, in contrast to the red shifting of the bands in CuO-N-250 (w.r.t bulk CuO) which strongly indicated the presence of Ov, it was observed that the adsorption of nitrobenzene seemed to reverse the positions back towards the bulk CuO. Additional bands observed at 681 cm−1 and 852 cm−1 in Fig. 3a (represented by a star) were due to the aromatic bending, and O-N–O bending (in-plane) of nitrobenzene [45–47] indicating the adsorption of nitrobenzene on CuO-N-250. The blue shift of bands in CuO-N-250-nitrobenzene suggested the adsorption of nitrobenzene at the Ov likely involving the O atom of the NO2 groups. The interpretation is in agreement with the DFT calculations. Furthermore, the interaction of nitrobenzene and metal oxide were studied using the DRIFTS (see experimental section). In Fig. 3b, two bands were observed at 1501 cm−1 and 1340 cm−1. Based on the literature, the peaks at 1525 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetric (υasym) and symmetric (υsym) stretching of nitrobenzene adsorbed on the metal oxides [48]. The red shift in the vibrational frequencies of CuO-N-250-nitrobenzene indicated the vibration frequency of the N–O bond decreased as it adsorbed on the CuO-N-250. Notably, the significant shift observed in CuO-N-250-nitrobenzene, suggested the weakening of the NO bonds after adsorption on CuO which leads to the formation of nitroso compound as predicted by DFT."
11,Mechanism of the reaction,"3.4 Mechanism of the reaction The generally accepted mechanism for the reduction of nitroarenes was suggested by Haber et al., [49]. According to this mechanism the reduction of nitroarenes either takes place via direct route through the formation of nitrosobenzene and hydroxyl as an intermediate or indirect route where nitrosobenzenes and hydroxyl intermediates condense to form azoxybenzene intermediate. In order to study the effect of Ov on the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline on CuO (111) surface, the first step of direct pathway mechanism was studied on both the surfaces. The most favourable binding mode of adsorption of H on both the surface was found to be on the on-top position on oxygen atom of the surface. DFT simulations showed that the presence of H atom on the surface facilitated the dissociation of N–O bond in nitrobenzene resulting in the formation of hydroxyl and nitrosobenzene intermediates with an activation barrier of 56.8 kJ/mol and 36.4 kJmol on the stoichiometric CuO (111) and oxygen vacant CuO (111) surfaces, respectively (Fig. 6 , 1(a) to (b) and 2(a) to (b)). This step was found to be endothermic on stoichiometric CuO (111) surface (Erxn =13.6 kJ/mol, Fig. 6, 1a to b) and exothermic on oxygen vacant CuO (111) surface (Erxn = −11.1 kJ/mol, Fig. 6, 2a to b) respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the transition state (TS1a) corresponding to N–O activation on the stoichiometric CuO (111) is calculating NO bond elongated to 1.4 Å along the reaction coordinate (as compared to 1.3 Å in the reactant state 1a, Fig. 6). A similar elongation in the length of N–O bond is calculated for the transition state (TS2a) of N–O dissociation on the oxygen vacant CuO (111) surface (Fig. 6, 2a to b). Interestingly, the oxygen atom undergoing activation is further away in the TS1a structure from the surface (CuO bond distance 2.2 Å, Fig. 6) as compared to TS2a structure (CuO bond distance 2 Å). This is leading to an overall lesser interaction of the TS1a structure on the stoichiometric CuO (111) surface as compared to the TS2a structure on the oxygen vacant surface. Consequently, the TS1a structure is likely to be less stable than that of TS2a. The differential stabilization of TS structures on the two surfaces are attributed to the differences in activation energies, calculated for the two surfaces."
12,Scope of substrates for reduction using CuO-N-250,"3.5 Scope of substrates for reduction using CuO-N-250 Each mole of hydrazine decomposes to give two moles of hydrogen. Considering the stoichiometric reduction of nitrobenzene by hydrazine to produce aniline and that of CuO to produce metallic copper one can calculate only 4.85 mmoles of hydrazine is required. Of this 90 % is utilized in the reduction of nitrobenzene. With a fair understanding of the mechanism of the action of CuO, it was convincing that CuO is one of the exceptionally reactive solids for the nitro reduction. To verify this, CuO-N-250 was further used to explore its applicability for the reduction of a broad scope of nitro containing organic substrates. In the presence of isopropyl alcohol, the reaction could not give complete conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline at room temperature even up to 2–3 h. Except acetone, the reaction did not proceed to any appreciable extent in the presence of solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, toluene and water. The reaction proceeded vigorously at room temperature and ambient pressure under neat conditions without any solvent (entry 1) with hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent and CuO-N-250. Encouraged by this, we proceeded to establish the scope of the reaction by studying the reduction of different nitroarenes (Table 1 ). All the products were characterized using NMR (Fig. S7). The CuO-N-250 mediated reduction on nitroarenes with an electron donating group i.e. p-methoxy nitro benzene (entry 2), and p-nitrotoluene (entry 5) gave excellent conversion to an amine. But, the yield (48 %) was lowered when the substitution was in ortho position of nitro benzene. This could be due to the effective steric hindrance. Further, the reduction was tried with electron withdrawing group (2-chloro nitrobenzene) as in the case of entry 8. Interestingly, we found dehalogenated product (i.e.) aniline in good yield. For the solid substrates shown in entry 3, 6–7, the reactions were not homogeneous. The diffusion limitations of the reaction carried under neat conditions affected the yield. The yield of these solid reactions were improved to 82 % by adding limited quantity of acetone (200 μL for 2 mmol of substrate). The yield could be further improved if reaction is operated under diffusion-limitations free conditions. Subsequently, the substrate scope was extended to the toxic substance i.e. 4-nitrophenol (entry 3) and other substrates such as 3-nitroamine (entry 6) and 7-nitroindole (entry 7). Nitroarenes such as 4-nitrophenol are considered as a serious water pollutant due its mutagenic, carcinogenic, cyto and embryotoxic potential in humans. On the other hand, 4-aminophenol is used as an important intermediate for the production of analgesic drugs, corrosion inhibitors, anticorrosion lubricants and photographic developers. Thus, the nitro-reduction is an important reaction to the human health and can be employed as a strategy alternative to mineralization. Overall, CuO is an efficient solid reagent with high reactivity towards the reduction of nitro to aminogroup in arenes (Table S1)."
13,Reusability of CuO-N-250,"3.6 Reusability of CuO-N-250 In the next step, we were curious to explore the reusability of CuO-N-250 for the reduction of nitrobenzene. As revealed by XRD and H2 TPR measurements, the CuO reduces to inactive metallic Cu during the reaction. The metallic Cu powder could be regenerated to a reactive CuO solid by thermally treating it at 450 °C for 12 h in air (CuO-N-450). Although the conversion of the regenerated CuO decreased to 76 % over four cycles, the selectivity to the aniline remained at 100 % (Fig. 6). The regenerated sample displayed a fully regained intensity in the H2 uptake in TPR (Fig. 7 b), implying the formation of CuO. The increased broadness of the peak in the regenerated sample indicated an increase in the particle size and the diffusion-limited reduction of the unsupported CuO by H2 [50]. XRD pattern of the regenerated oxide could be indexed to the pure monoclinic CuO phase (Fig. 7a) without any traces of Cu. The average size of the crystallite in CuO as calculated by using the Williamson-Hall plot was ∼58 nm in CuO-N-250, while it was ∼76 nm for CuO-N-450. The gradual increase in the particle size due to thermal annealing resulted in the loss of active surface, which is one of the causes for the loss in conversion. The decline in the conversion also occurred due to the differences in the concentration of surface OV, as revealed by the XPS data. XPS of CuO-N-250 and CuO-N-450 in Fig. 7c & d clearly shows that the concentration of OV at the surface decreases in CuO-N-450 (32.13 %) compared to the CuO-N-250 (40.93 %). To check the effect of shelf life, the activity of CuO prepared one year ago (2019) using the same method was compared to the freshly prepared sample. CuO prepared was found to be durable and did not show any deactivation due to ageing. (Fig. S6) (Fig. 8 )"
14,Conclusion,"In summary, the activity of CuO-N-250 reported here is exceptional and promising in the nitro-reduction of nitroarenes with high conversion and selectivity to anilines. The conversion of nitroarenes occurred under ambient conditions in less than a minute at a high substrate concentration using hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent. A mechanistic explanation to the activity of CuO is provided by DFT simulation. In general Cu vacancies are calculated to form with less energies as compared to Ov on the CuO (111) surface. However, in reducing environment, the energetics is significantly altered and Ov are readily formed on the CuO (111) surface. Formation of Ov on the CuO surface lead to a significant increase in the binding energy of nitrobenzene. The NO bond dissociation in nitrobenzene is facilitated by surface adsorbed hydrogen species, with a significantly reduced activation barrier on the oxygen vacant surface, making the reaction feasible at room temperature. The reusability of CuO was also demonstrated by thermally regenerating the reduced Cu. Further works on improving the reusability of CuO and expanding the scope of reactivity is currently in progress."
