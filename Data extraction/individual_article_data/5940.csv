0,Introduction,"Gasification of biomass is one of the advanced technology for converting renewable energy to high value fuels, convenient gas or some chemical feedstock [1,2]. Nevertheless, the high-quality syngas production is one of the upper limits for the upgrade of this technology [3,4]. One standard of the high-quality syngas is that the syngas contains rich hydrogen with very little tar [5,6]. Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is a promising technology for the syngas production [7,8]. Comparing with the traditional gasification process, the oxygen carrier (OC) is used for producing oxygen during the conversion process [6,9,10]. Therefore, the biomass CLG process can be controlled during different steps of the gasification reactions for high-quality syngas production. During this process, the control of the phase transfer for the OC is the key point for the syngas production [11,12]. First, the OC needs to be reduced to the metal phase, and this phase is beneficial for catalyzing tar cracking during the process [13,14]. Next, once the OC loses the lattice oxygen, the fuel reacts with the lattice oxygen for conversion [15]. Then, the reduced phase of the OC obtains the lattice oxygen from the air [16], and finally, the OC achieves from a reduction and oxidation cycle. From the reacting understanding viewpoint, the reactions during the process have obvious sequences [17,18]. Therefore, the investigation for the reactors should be carried out for the better order of every reaction. For the reactor design in some biomass pyrolysis or gasification processes, there are mainly four types of the reactors using in this process: (1) fixed-bed reactor. This kind of the reactor could make the reaction orderly, but the reactions would be usually lack of the oxygen for the syngas conversion [19,20]. (2) Bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. This reactor is beneficial for the mixture of the fuel, but the quality of the syngas could not be guaranteed because of the short reaction time [21]. (3) Circulating fluidized-bed reactor. This reactor is efficient and could be used for various fuels, but it is a little difficult to control during the operation of pyrolysis or gasification. (4) Entrained-bed reactor. The reaction in this reactor is fast, but this reactor needs a lot of heat for the high temperature maintaining [21]. Based on these four types of reactors, researchers studied a lot for the reactor design during the CLG of biomass. Hua et al. [22] investigated the unclear temporal and spatial variations of axial solid conversion in a packed bed using iron (III) oxide as an oxygen carrier and provided with the theoretical support for the packed bed scaling up. Niu et al. [23] studied the synthetic OCs of bimetallic Cu–Fe oxides prepared by the sol-gel combustion synthesis method for the biomass-derived CLG process, and screened the optimum condition of this process. On the other hand, some studies designed many kinds of reactors for the syngas production from biomass. For instance, Ge et al. [24] used a 25 kWth prototype and investigated the performance of biomass gasification using chemical looping with the hematite oxygen carrier. The experimental result showed that 860 °C was the optimal gasification temperature corresponding to higher carbon conversion efficiency and maximal syngas yield. Aziz et al. [25] conducted an integrated conversion system of algae to hydrogen production with the objective of high total energy conversion efficiency, and showed that the proposed system was potential to converting algae for hydrogen production with high total energy efficiency. Hsieh et al. [26] used a concurrent moving bed reducer for high purity and H2-rich syngas production. Shen et al. [27] designed a 5 kWth interconnected fluidized bed with a two-stage fuel reactor for the CLG process. Cebrucean et al. [28] compared a moving bed reactor configuration with a fluidized bed reactor configuration for the iron-based syngas-fueled chemical looping systems. Nevertheless, the reactor design still could not consider both the orders of the reactions and the quality of the syngas [29,30]. Actually, once the order of the reactions could be addressed, the high-quality syngas would be produced simply as well. In this context, a pyrolysis-gasification (PY-GA) coupled reactor was designed and built-up for combining with the pyrolysis process and the gasification process, and for the high-quality syngas production (Fig. 1 ). A PY-GA coupled reactor was a dual-bed reactor for creating a reduced atmosphere during the thermal chemical process from solid biomass. The reactor contained two separated parts: a pyrolysis (PY) part and a gasification (GA) part. The PY part was a moving-bed reactor, while the GA part was a fast fluidized-bed reactor. In the PY part, the solid biomass was introduced to the reactor for the pyrolysis process ( R1 ). During this process, the oxidized OC was reduced by releasing the volatile matters from biomass. The moving-bed reactor design for this part was providing with the enough reaction time for the OC reduction. The outlet of this part was designed at the bottom. The design of the outlet was beneficial for the reactions between the volatile matters and the OC ( R2 ), as well as the separation of CO2 in the product gas, especially the syngas. The GA part was designed for the pure syngas production with little CO2, and the steam was introduced to this part. The main reactions were the water-gas reaction ( R3 ) and the iron-steam reaction ( R4 ) shown as follows: R1 B i o m a s s → p y r o l y s i s V o l a t i l e m a t t e r s + C h a r R2 V o l a t i l e m a t t e r s + F e x O y → C O 2 + H 2 O + F e x O y − m ( m ≤ y ) R3 C h a r + H 2 O → H 2 + C O R4 F e + F e 0.947 O + H 2 O → H 2 + F e 3 O 4 The design of the PY-GA coupled-bed reactor was from the understanding of the combination between the OC reaction in the chemical looping process and the biomass gasification process. The biomass pyrolysis was usually before the gasification process and this process released volatile matters in short time, but the OC reduction usually need some time for reduction, and thus a moving bed design for the PY part was used in this study. On the other hand, the gasification process and the OC oxidation were both fast [31,32], and the fast fluidized-bed reactor for the GA part was used. Furthermore, according to the previous research [33,34], to consume volatile matters during the process could reduce the tar production. Therefore, the reactor design was beneficial for the in-situ tar removing process during gasification. The objective of the research was testing the reactor design for high-quality syngas production from solid biomass. Different gas compositions, gas lower heating value (LHV), syngas gas yield, and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were analyzed at two outlets of the reactor. Carbon conversion efficiency of different operating conditions was calculated. Two standards of the high-quality syngas production of the H2/CO ratio and tar yield were compared and discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Pine sawdust obtained from Nanjing (Jiangsu Province, China) is used as feedstock in the tests. This biomass is crushed and sieved to the range between 250 μm and 400 μm, The carbon composition from ultimate analysis was 44.90%(air dry basis). Iron ore obtained from Nanjing Meishan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd was used as the oxygen carrier (OC). This OC mainly contained iron (III) oxide. From the previous experimental performance [12,33], the OC showed a good reactivity in the CLG process. According to the X-ray Fluorescence (XRF, ARL-9800, Switzerland) analysis, the main composition of this OC was 90.75 wt% Fe2O3，4.18 wt% SiO2，0.88 wt% Al2O3. The OC was calcined in a muffle oven at 950 °C for 2 h. After that, it was crushed and sieved to the size range of100 μm–300 μm."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure A pyrolysis-gasification (PY-GA) coupled reactor was designed and built-up for the main experiments (Fig. 2 ). The reactor was fabricated from 310S stainless steel with two parts: pyrolysis (PY) part and gasification (GA) part. The PY part was a moving-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 26 mm and the height of 150 mm. The GA part was a riser (also a fast fluidized-bed reactor) with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The specific calculation of the design parameters could be referenced in Supplementary Material (Part S1) . The PY-GA coupled reactor mainly included PY part, GA part, hot gas cooler units, a biomass feeding unit, a steam/gas feeding controller, a temperature controlling system, and gas analysis facility. The flowrates of the feeding gas were controlled by mass flowrate controllers (MFC). The outlet of the gas from the trapper was introduced to a water cooler and a silica gel desiccant, successively. The gas was analyzed online by the gas analyzers (ABB Co. Ltd.). The gas composition of CO, CO2, CH4 was equipped with Non-Dispersive Infra-Red (NDIR) detectors (Uras26). The gas composition of H2 was a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, Caldos27). The gas composition of O2 was a paramagnetic detector (Magnos206). A series of experiments were conducted on this reactor. The effect of different reacting temperatures and steam-to-biomass mass ratio (S/B ratio) was investigated for the whole 12 operating conditions at the range of 790 °C to 880 °C and 1.0 kg/kg to 2.0 kg/kg, as shown in Table 1 . Before each case, the mass of 1 kg OC was set up in the reactor, and the enough biomass was put in the feedstock of the feeding unit as well. The pure nitrogen (99.99%) was introduced to test the air impermeability of the reactor. After that, the gas flowrate of 1500 mL/min pure nitrogen was introduced and the furnace was heated to the set-point of the reacting temperature at a constant ramping process and maintained at this temperature during the entire test. Then, the steam was introduced to the GA part. Meanwhile, the feeding unit was set to introduce biomass at a constant rate of 0.3 g/min. The steam generator could adjust to the set-point of the S/B ratio. The outlet of the gas from the trapper was introduced to a water cooler and a silica gel desiccant, successively. The method of the tar measurement was the mass difference. Before the tar collection, the mass of the tar trapper was recorded by the analytical balance. After the collection, the mass of the trapper was tested again. The volume of 10 mL isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was used to clean the trapper and obtain the tar into the liquid. Then, the IPA solution was tested on a GC-MS system. The analysis of GC-MS was carried out at the injector temperature of 300 °C and the oven temperature from 200 °C to 450 °C (heating rate of 8 °C/min). The mass spectra were operated in electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The chromatographic peaks were identified according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) MS library. The collection apparatus was shown in Fig. 3 . Each experiment was repeated three times to ensure repeatability."
4,Data evaluation,"2.3 Data evaluation The total outlet gas flow rate was calculated according to the nitrogen balance with a constant nitrogen feeding rate (High Purity: 99.99%). The dry product gas from the outlet consisted mainly of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 (if any) and N2. The calculation showed as follows: (1) n ˙ o u t = n ˙ i n , N 2 1 1 − ∑ x i The gas amount of gas i ( n i , i = C O 2 , C O , C H 4 , H 2 , m m o l ) was calculated as the sum of gas volume production rate per second based on the nitrogen balance shown as follows: (2) n i = V N 2 x i x N 2 ∗ C g a s The lower heating value ( L H V , MJ/Nm3) of the product gas from the reactor was calculated as follows: (3) LHV = 0.126 V C O + 0.108 V H 2 + 0.359 V C H 4 where V C O , V H 2 , and V C H 4 were the volume fractions of CO, H2, and CH4 in the product gas, respectively. Syngas yield from only the GA part ( Y s y n , Nm3/kg) represented the sum volume of H2 and CO without CO2 divided by biomass fed to the system: (4) Y s y n = V C O + V H 2 M b i o Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE, η e , %) was defined as the ratio of the low heating value of the products from unit mass of biomass gasification and the low heating value of unit biomass: (5) η e = LHV∗ Y s y n q b i o ∗ 100 % The H2/CO ratio (mol/mol) represented the proportion of H2 concentration and CO concentration, shown as follows: (6) H 2 / C O = n H 2 n C O Tar yield (g/Nm3) was used to estimate the tar production during the gasification, and the calculation was shown as follows: (7) Y t a r = m t a r Y g a s ∗ M b i o"
5,Results and discussion,"The reactions took place in the PY-GA coupled reactor mainly included two parts: the first part was biomass pyrolysis reactions occurred in the PY part, and the other part was the water-gas reaction for char gasification conversion took place in the GA part. There were two advantages for using the PY-GA coupled reactor: 1) improving the H2 composition in the syngas; 2) separating the tar in the moving bed reactor necessarily. In this section, the gas composition from the outlets of the two parts was analyzed (Section 3.1). The carbon conversion efficiency, lower heating value (LHV) of gas, syngas yield, and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were calculated ( Section 3.2 ). After that, the hydrogen to carbon monoxide molar ratio (H2/CO ratio) and the tar yield were compared with other similar technologies (Section 3.3 &3.4), and the possible reaction steps during the process were finally discussed ( Section 3.5 )."
6,Analysis of outlet gas compositions,"3.1 Analysis of outlet gas compositions The first key point of the reactions in the experiments was the different product gas compositions. According to the design of the PY-GA coupled reactor, the reactions in the PY part was mainly the release of the volatile matters in the biomass and the reduction for the iron-based OC. On the other hand, the release of the volatile matters would accompanied by the tar production in most cases [35,36]. Thus, identifying the gas composition of the outlet gas from the PY part was beneficial for the understanding of the tar production [37]. Fig. 4 showed the gas composition from the PY-part outlet in different operating conditions. As shown in the figure, there were mainly four gas compositions, CO2, CO, CH4, and H2. CO2 composition was the largest, and it was at range of 60–80%, while CO composition was at the range of 12–25%. H2 and CH4 compositions were little. The result demonstrated that during the reaction in the PY part, the OC released the lattice oxygen for the oxidation of the gas and led to the highest CO2 composition. Meanwhile, the mainly CO2 composition indicated that most of volatile matters or tar released from the biomass had reacted with the OC for the in-situ removal reactions for producing CO2 and H2O [38,39]. From the comparison of different temperature conditions, increasing temperature led to the CO2 increasing and the CO and H2 decreasing. The reason could be that there were a lot of oxidized OC, and the OC reduction would produce much CO2. Increasing temperature was beneficial for the OC reduction, and would result in the increase of CO2 composition. In addition, increasing temperature could also contribute to the oxidation between the OC and the biomass, driving the reaction towards the product sides. From the comparison of different S/B conditions, increasing S/B ratio caused the increase of CO2 and the weak decrease of H2. The result demonstrated that the coupled effects of different reacting atmospheres between the PY part and the GA part [29,40]. In the PY-GA coupled reactor, one key point of the high-quality syngas production was the efficient conversion in the GA part, and thus understanding the gas composition from the outlet of the GA part was crucial (Fig. 5 ). As could be seen in the figure, there were three components of the syngas: H2, CO, and CO2. It should be noted that there were no CH4 detected, and the result indicated the pure syngas production for this technology. From the comparison of different temperature conditions, increasing temperature could not change the H2 composition, but increasing CO composition and decreasing CO2 composition. The reason of the result could be that increasing reacting temperature made the Boudouard reaction towards to the CO production side [21,41]. It was worth mentioning that during the gasification process, the main reactions between the char and the steam was an endothermal reaction, and thus increasing temperature was beneficial for this reaction taking place. However, increasing temperature could limit the reaction between the iron and the steam to production hydrogen [9,42,43], and thus the H2 composition was relatively stable. From the comparison of different S/B conditions, increasing S/B ratio led to the decrease of H2 and the increase of CO2. Usually, more steam contributed to more hydrogen [44]. The possible reason for this result was the over-reacting during the reactions and over-oxygen provision [30,45]."
7,Evaluation of product gas in gasification,"3.2 Evaluation of product gas in gasification The design of the PY-GA coupled reactor aimed to the high-quality syngas production. Nevertheless, there were two different reactors for the gas production, and thus the carbon conversion efficiency was important to estimate the conversion during the process. Table 2 showed the carbon conversion efficiency in different operating conditions. As shown in the table, the total carbon conversion efficiency reached 99.08%. This explained that the conversion in the reactor was entire. Comparing with the PY part and the GA part, the carbon conversion efficiency in the PY part was at the range of 73–79%. This result showed that the carbon conversion in the PY part was large, and the possible reason was the high volatile matters containing in biomass (usually 60–80%) [46,47]. The carbon conversion efficiency in the GA part was 15–22%, and it was fit to the amount of the fixed carbon in biomass proximate analysis. On the other hand, H2 composition in the GA part reached about 61% in Section 3.1 . The result demonstrated that the produced syngas met the high requirement for the reaction design of the PY-GA coupled reactor. For the comparison of the S/B ratio, as the S/B ratio increasing, the carbon conversion efficiency in the GA part increased. The result indicated that more steam contributed to the water-gas reaction towards to the product side [48,49]. Lower heating value (LHV) was another of the key factors for the understanding of the conversion. Fig. 6 showed the variety of syngas LHV in different operating conditions. For comparison of different operating temperatures, increasing temperature led to the increase of the LHV, and all the value of the LHV was over 8.99 MJ/Nm3. For comparison of different S/B ratios, as the S/B ratios increasing, the LHV was relatively decreasing. The result represented that more steam in the reactor would cause the syngas conversion decreasing. According to the previous research [21,50], when using the steam as the gasifying agent in biomass gasification, the LHV of syngas was usually at the range of 8–18 MJ/Nm3. Therefore, the LHV in the experiment could reach the industrial requirement. It should be noted that in this process, the syngas production (H2 and CO) was only from the water-gas reaction and the iron-steam reaction, the syngas contained hardly CH4, and this result would also influence the total value of the syngas LHV. Syngas yield represented the degree of conversion from solid biomass to the gaseous product. Once the understanding of the syngas production process was clear, the concept of the PY-GA coupled reactor was used to produce high-quality syngas could be verified. Fig. 7 showed the variety of syngas LHV in different operating conditions. All the value of the syngas yield was at the range of 0.95–1.08 Nm3/kg, and this demonstrated that the conversion in different conditions were similar and stable. For comparison of the different operating temperatures, the syngas yield increased when increasing the temperature, and this indicated that high temperature was beneficial for the conversion. Additionally, the main reactions were endothermal reactions, increasing temperature led to the reactions towards the product side. For comparison of different S/B ratios, increasing the S/B ratio resulted in the weak syngas yield decreasing. This indicated that more steam was not beneficial for the conversion from the char to the syngas. The possible reason could be the oxidized effect from the steam. If the proportion of the steam in the GA part increased, some of the CO would be oxidized to CO2, and then decreased the syngas yield. Based on the calculation of the LHV and the syngas yield, the overall conversion for gasification could be estimated by the cold gas efficiency (CGE). The variety of CGE in different conditions were shown in Fig. 8 . It should be mentioned that CGE represented the real conversion efficiency because the syngas yield only considered H2 and CO without CO2. As could be seen in the figure, increasing the temperature led to the increase of the CGE from 46% to 61%, while increasing the S/B ratio caused the little CGE decreasing. The result showed that more steam influenced the conversion of gasification, and the main reason would be possible the self-moisture containing in the biomass [51]. Overall, the calculation of CGE was based on the calculation of the LHV and the syngas yield, the CGE represented the degree and the efficiency of the conversion. The value could be corresponded with the previous calculation, and relevant with the industrial requirement [21,52]."
8,Comparison of the H2/CO ratio in gasification,"3.3 Comparison of the H2/CO ratio in gasification The H2/CO ratio from the outlet of the reactor could evaluate the syngas quality and demonstrate the advantages of the gasification technology. In this process, the water-gas reaction and the iron-steam reaction was mainly used for syngas production in the PY-GA coupled reactor. Table 3 showed the variety of the H2/CO ratios in different conditions. As shown in the table, increasing the S/B ratio in the same temperature led to the slight decreasing of the H2/CO ratio. The result demonstrated that a lot of steam was not beneficial for increasing the proportion of H2, and the main reason could be that more steam led to the decreasing of the ratio of H2/H2O in the reactor, then limit the phase transfer of the iron oxide to the metal phase [53,54]. Subsequently, the proportion of H2 decreased. For comparison of different temperature in the same S/B ratio, it could be found that the H2/CO ratio decreased when increased the temperature. The reason could be on two aspects: first, increasing temperature would increase the spontaneity of the iron-steam reaction [29]. On the other hand, the Boudouard reaction was the endothermal reaction, increasing temperature could increase the reacting balance towards the CO production side. Therefore, the H2/CO ratio of syngas decreased in the experiment when increasing the temperature. In order to understand the advantage of the process, different H2/CO ratios in similar technologies were compared, as shown in Table 4 . Comparing with the design of the reactor, the fluidized-bed reactor was almost used in the gasification during 800–900 °C. The advantage of this reactor was the fast reaction rate and the strong mix of the solid reactants. For comparing with the operating parameters, at the similar S/B ratio, the obtained H2/CO ratio from the chemical looping gasification of biomass in the PY-GA coupled reactor was the second largest. It should be also noted that the technology of Khan et al. got a larger H2/CO ratio than this process, and the reason might be the high S/B ratio control and the CaO material for the absorption of CO2. Actually, from the viewpoint of the reacting conditions, increasing S/B ratio or temperature was beneficial for the H2/CO ratio increasing. On the other hand, more steam would cause the over-oxidized product gas, and thus, controlling the temperature at 820 °C and the S/B ratio at 1.0 kg/kg would be the efficient conversion in this process."
9,Comparison of the tar yield in gasification,"3.4 Comparison of the tar yield in gasification Biomass was a macromolecular structure, a large amount of the tar was produced during gasification, and the tar production needed a device for evaluation. In some of our previous studies [33,39], iron-based OC had a multi-function for the tar elimination. Basically, if the outlet of the PY part contained almost CO2 and H2O, the lattice oxygen would be consumed for the tar conversion. The comparison of the tar yield between the OC and the sand could be found in Supplementary Material (Table S1) . In the experiment, the difference of mass was used to evaluated the tar, but it should be mentioned that the mass contained the water mass, and the tar mass was the difference of the water mass tested by the Karl-Fischer moisture device. Table 5 showed the tar yield tested in different conditions. For the comparison of different temperature at the same S/B ratio, increasing temperature led to the decrease of the tar yield. The reason for the result might be two aspects: on one hand, increasing temperature would cause the secondary cracking of the tar for this decrease. On the other hand, increasing temperature would increase the reactivity of the OC for the release of the lattice oxygen, leading to the conversion from tar to CO2. The analysis of GC-MS for determining the type of the tar indicated that the chemical compounds all belonged to aromatics. This type was similar with the types of the alkyl tertiary tar and the condensed tertiary tar identified by some previous studies [39,60]. The comparison of the tar yield in similar gasification technologies was important to evaluate if this technology could be used in the future industry. Table 6 showed the comparison of the tar yield in different biomass gasification technologies. From the viewpoint of the reactor design, it could be found that using fluidized-bed reactor or fixed-bed reactor was beneficial for the tar removal during the temperature during 750–900 °C. For comparison of the similar control of S/B ratios, it should be mentioned that the obtained tar yield of Rapagna et al. was the lowest, and the obtained tar yield of Tian et al. was alomost the same as the CLG process conducted on the PY-GA coupled reactor. It should be noted that these two processes both used fluidized-bed reactor, and usually, the obtained tar yield from the fluidized-bed reactor was less than that from the fixed-bed reactor [61,62]. The result demonstrated that the CLG process produced less tar during the reactions because most of the produced tar was from the PY part, and the reactor was a moving bed (fixed-bed reactor). However, this technology could still be improved for less tar production during the gasification process in the future work."
10,Discussion of the possible reaction steps,"3.5 Discussion of the possible reaction steps The design of the PY-GA coupled reactor was for high-quality syngas production. There were two standards for high-quality syngas production: hydrogen rich and low tar containing. The PY-GA coupled reactor divided the reactions into two parts: pyrolysis and gasification. In the pyrolysis part, there were two main reactions: biomass pyrolysis reactions and oxidized-OC reduction. In the gasification part, there were other two main gas-solid reactions: the water-gas reaction and the iron-steam reaction. Comparing with the traditional biomass pyrolysis or gasification process, this CLG process occurred in the PY-GA coupled reactor was advanced for the complicated oxidized and reduced chemical reactions stepping by than the traditional method. From the viewpoint of the in-situ tar removal, according to some previous studies [6,38], a large amount of tar generally was produced during the pyrolysis process, and the possible reason was that biomass was a macromolecular structure for the complicated conversion. However, the OC was beneficial for the tar conversion during the reactions because of the lattice oxygen releasing [33]. When the volatile matters released from biomass, the reduced atmosphere also helped the release of the lattice oxygen in the OC, as shown in Fig. 9 . Meanwhile, the product gas from the outlet of the PY part was mainly CO2, and this was also beneficial for the pure syngas production in GA part, and improved the gas quality as well. There were possible four reaction steps occurred in the reactor: (1) biomass pyrolysis in PY part, including the release of the moisture and volatile matters; (2) the OC reduction from the oxidized phase to the reduced phase in PY part; (3) the water-gas reaction between the char and the steam in GA part, producing mainly H2 and CO; (4) the iron-steam reaction between the reduced phase of the OC and the steam in GA part for mainly H2 production. These steps took place accordingly and then the high-quality syngas was produced. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the principle of the chemical looping process was based on the CO2 separation in high temperature. This demonstrated that during the pyrolysis stage, more CO2 releasing could be beneficial for the carbon capture and the decrease of the energy consumption, and therefore the process was better for reducing the greenhouse gas emission."
11,Conclusion,"One of the key factors for the efficient conversion in chemical looping gasification (CLG) of biomass was the reactor design. In order to produce high-quality syngas from solid biomass, the PY-GA coupled reactor was designed and built-up for the investigation. The possible reaction steps in gasification was determined, and the following conclusive remarks could be made: 1. The OC released the lattice oxygen for the oxidation of the gas and led to the highest CO2 composition in the PY part, while in GA part, H2 composition was the largest and the produced syngas was relatively pure. 2. Comparing with PY part and GA part, the main carbon conversion efficiency occurred in PY part. LHV of gas, syngas yield, and CGE could meet the requirement of the future industrial application. 3. The obtained H2/CO ratio from the CLG of biomass in the PY-GA coupled reactor could reach 3.47 mol/mol (820 °C and 1.0 kg/kg), and this was competitive comparing with other similar gasification technologies. 4. The process produced less tar in the PY-GA reactor during the reactions because of the well division for the in-situ tar removal, but the technology could still be improved for less tar production during the process. 5. There were possible four reaction steps occurred in the reactor: the pyrolysis, the OC reduction, the water-gas reaction and the iron-steam reaction. These steps took place accordingly and then the high-quality syngas was produced."
