0,Introduction,"Undoubtedly, the release of greenhouse gases has sparked environmental concerns due to its detrimental effects. Recently, this important issue has led to the invention and implementation of approaches to reduce the impact of the fossil fuels combustion [1,2]. Over a long time, more interest has shifted to the need for clean energy sources through better environmental-friendly technologies. The need to reduce the level of the atmospheric pollution caused by the emission of greenhouse gases has been a deep interest. Fuel cell technology as one of the new technologies for mitigating these emissions, has proved beyond a reasonable doubt an efficient conversion of chemical into electrical energy. In specific terms, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems have shown zero-level pollutants emission. Their working principle is based on transformation of chemical energy from electrochemical reaction involving hydrogen and oxygen into a highly clean electrical power source [3]. Considering these environmental concerns, the world hydrogen demand has increased to a greater extend especially in the future due to energy and environmental sustainability [4]. Among the primary processes deeply studied in the conversion of hydrocarbons into hydrogen include partial oxidation, steam reforming, auto-thermal reforming, and CO2 reforming. However, dominant process used to convert natural gas as a fossil fuel into hydrogen is steam reforming [4,5]. Presently, it constitutes over 50% of the global hydrogen supply [6]. Hydrogen generation from renewable and CO2-neutral biomass sources has recently been the focal point due to the urgent demand for clean energy production [7]. Interestingly, catalytic reforming of bio-oil, which is derived from fast pyrolysis of biomass, has been widely studied. High possibility exists in making the process of hydrogen production by catalytic reforming of bio-oil more economically as well as scaling up the process. This is due to the fact that the transportation of the oil is very easy [8]. The oil consists of very large varieties of components. Theses comprise of low and high molecular weight oxygenated compounds, the likes of carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and phenols [9–11]. Phenol is an important chemical engineering material and ubiquitous in industry wastewater, its existence has become a thorny issue in many developed and developing country. From a well-research study of the bio-oil sourced from different biomass fractions, it reveals that up to 30wt.% are phenolic compounds [7,12,13] and it is one of the major products of bio-oil fraction. Phenol present in industrial wastewater is considered toxic for many aquatic organisms [14–16]. Many advanced biological methods are applied to industrial wastewater treatment with low cost, high efficiency and no secondary pollution, but the screening of functional microorganisms is certainly cumbersome process [17]. Unfortunately, a major setback to the phenol steam reforming is its high tendency of carbon byproduct formation [18–20]. As a result, catalyst deactivation becomes more probable. This catalyst deactivation hinders continuous process for the steam reforming reaction and consequently affects the sustainability of the hydrogen production. Incorporation of noble metals such as Ru as part of the catalysts has proved good stability towards coke formation and improved activity for the phenol steam reforming process [20–25]. But a major disadvantage of these metals is their low availability and high cost. As result, they stand to be not economically competitive in relative to other transition metal based catalysts [26]. Therefore, development of a highly active and carbon-resistant transition metal catalyst has been study which has gain interest of most researchers in the area. This is capable of enhancing the hydrogen production via phenol steam reforming. In recent times, Ni-based catalysts which possessed high activity for the steam reforming process have been widely investigated [18,27,28]. Moreover, it has displayed a very strong ability in breaking the CC, OH, and CH bonds [29]. Considering the process of phenol steam reforming at industrial level, it is more feasible to develop the Ni-based catalysts due to their relatively cheaper price and good abundance [30]. Usually, carbon formation during the reaction leads to their deactivation [27]. Therefore, it is very important to explore the development and improvement of a highly stable and active Ni-based reforming catalyst. Many efforts have been dedicated towards improving the deactivation resistance of the Ni-based catalysts especially in methane feed source [31,32], ethanol [33] glycerol [34] and acetic acid [35]. Some studies revealed that the incorporation of cobalt to nickel catalysts reduces the chances of coke deposition during the reaction [36–44]. The principle involves the breaking of the surface nickel ensembles as cobalt is being added to the nickel catalysts. As a result, the amount of nickel particle size reduces and consequently the carbon deposition [38]. In addition, the vital metal-support interaction helps in the reduction of the carbon deposition over supported metal catalysts in the reforming process. An important support for Ni-based reforming catalysts is ZrO2. It has gained interest towards improving the metal-support interaction. This is could be attributed to its unique acidic and basic properties as well as reducing and oxidizing properties [45]. Apart from the unique kind of interaction between the active phase and support, Zirconia also shows more chemical inertness relative to other support materials. It has been an important material both as catalyst and catalysts support in different catalyst systems due to its unique chemical stability and redox properties. Moreover, the acidic and basic character of its surface hydroxyl groups as well has made it to be unique in its ability to facilitate the steam reforming process [46]. On a general note, ZrO2 has three different polymorphic forms. These include monoclinic (m-ZrO2), tetragonal (t-ZrO2), and cubic (c-ZrO2). Among these three forms, the t-ZrO2 phase is more desirable compared to the monoclinic and cubic phases in the reforming process [45]. However, kinetic studies on phenol steam reforming are rarely available in literature. Most of the previous research studies mainly focused on other components of the bio-oil such as ethanol [47–51], glycerol [52–55], methane [56–63] and acetic acid [64,65]. A study by Madhumita et al. [47] considered a Eley–Rideal and Power Law models steam reforming of ethanol over Ni/Ce-ZrO2 catalyst. The study concluded that the dissociative adsorption of ethanol on the active sites of the catalyst was the rate-determining step. Furthermore, Akande et al. [66] suggested an Eley–Rideal-based kinetics model for steam reforming of ethanol over 15%-Ni/Al2O3. They revealed that the rate-determining step was the dissociation of adsorbed crude ethanol. An Eley–Rideal-based mechanism for ethanol steam reforming over Ni/MgO/Al2O3 catalyst was proposed by Mathure et al. [67]. They pointed the need for a more-elaborate reaction scheme to explain the complex reactions happening in the course of steam reforming of ethanol. A mechanistic kinetic model based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood was proposed by Sahoo et al. [68]. They considered ethanol steam reforming, water gas shift reaction and ethanol decomposition over a Co/Al2O3 catalyst. From their studies, they concluded that the rate-determining step happens to be the formation of acetaldehyde from ethoxy. Kinetic parameters in for glycerol steam reforming over Ni/CeO2 was presented by Adhikari et al. [69]. The study revealed activation energy, EA, of 103.4kJ/mol and reaction order of 0.233. They used a power-law model that assumes zero-dependency on steam. Using the same approach, Simonetti et al. [70] found fractional reaction order with respect to glycerol and EA values of 60–90kJ/mol for CO production over Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. Similarly, a study by Munera et al. [62] found that both CH4 and CO2 were adsorbed on Rh/La2O3 catalyst. The rate determining step was proposed to be the dissociation of the adsorbed CH4 producing C and H2. Moreover, CO2 was noticed to adsorb on the La2O3 basic site, thereby providing surface oxygen for the gasification of deposited carbon. Recently, Pakhare et al. [63] reported on the kinetics of methane dry reforming over Rh-substituted La2Zr2O7 pyrochlores catalyst. The study proposed a reaction mechanism that was in conformity with that of Munera et al. [62]. Besides, the rate determining step was proposed to be the reverse water gas shift reactions as well as activation of the adsorbed CH4. Nevertheless, a kinetic model for steam reforming of phenol over Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst has not been reported in the literature. The motivation of our present work is to provide an accurate kinetic model for the steam reforming of phenol using Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst based on the methodology of different kinetic models that were reported. Furthermore, we also aim to evaluate the effects of reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, feed flow rate, phenol concentration and catalyst amount on the catalytic activity of the Ni-Co/ZrO2 bimetallic catalyst. Experimental data of conversion for a range of temperatures were obtained and kinetic model which best fits the data was obtained."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The catalyst was prepared through the drop wise addition of ZrO2 (90wt.%) into the solution of active metal Ni (7.5wt.%)–Co(2.5wt.%) (all materials are purchased from Aldrich). Ni-Co was obtained by aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co (NO3)2·6H2O) and Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2·6H2O). The techniques used to make the catalyst were as follows: firstly, 9g of Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) was dispersed in 250mL of deionized water and stirred for 2h at 90°C. While stirring the slurry, 7.48g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and 2.51g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) was added to the slurry. The Ni and Co compositions were calculated according to Eq. (1), where X is Ni(NO3)2·6H2O or Co(NO3)2·6H2O. The mixture was held until it forms an extremely viscous paste. The paste was dried at 110°C for 24h and the catalyst was calcined at 750°C for about three hours. Then, the catalyst was pelletized and sieved on two layers of 35 and 34mesh to acquire particles sizes between 1.0mm and 1.4mm. (1) A m o u n t o f X ( g ) = 0.75 g N i ( o r ) 0.25 C o × 1 m o l N i ( o r ) C o 58.7 g × 1 m o l X 1 m o l N i ( o r ) C o × 291 g X 1 m o l X"
3,Reaction studies,"2.2 Reaction studies Catalyst performance tests were carried out using 0.2g of catalyst diluted with 0.3g silicon carbide, SiC (helps to improve catalyst activity [71–74] and drastically reduce the catalyst cost [75]). The catalyst bed was placed in a 6mm ID stainless steel reactor with a coaxially centred thermocouple. The catalysts were flushed in nitrogen at 300°C with 30mL/min, followed by reduction in situ at 600°C for 1h with 30mL/min of pure hydrogen before the commencement of the reaction. Using HPLC pump (Bio-RadTM, Series 1350), phenol and water were fed independently into the pre-heater prior to mixing with carrier N2 at 30mL/min. The catalyst samples were reduced and employed in the phenol steam reforming (H2O/phenol (mol/mol)=9). The reaction condition was at atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 500 to 800°C. It was maintained for 6h so as to check if deactivation of the catalysts occurred. The percentage of phenol in nitrogen was 0.12% at a flowrate of 0.36mL/min. The reaction products were analysed via an on-line GC with TCD (Agilent 6890N) equipped with Carboxen Plot 1010 capillary column (Fused Silica, 30m x 0.53mm) connected in series. A confidence level of 95% was chosen for uncertainty analyzing the gas production and phenol conversion data. The schematic flow diagram of the experimental setup for the catalytic steam reforming is shown in Fig. 1 . For all results, we describe the catalysts as Ni-Co/ZrO2. Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) were applied to compute the phenol conversion and the hydrogen yield.

4,Results,
5,Catalyst activity for kinetic study,"3.1 Catalyst activity for kinetic study 3.1.1 Effect of temperature For the kinetic study, the experiment was run for duration of 6h in order to evaluate the Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalytic performance in the steam reforming reaction. Seven different temperatures were chosen. Fig. 2 presents the variations of phenol conversion and product yields as a function of temperature (500–800°C). A flow rate of 0.36mL/min and 0.2g catalyst were used to achieve the highest hydrogen production and phenol conversion. Increased in temperature from 500°C to 800°C resulted in an increase in phenol conversion from 42.3% to 99.9%, respectively. Hydrogen yield of 27.1% and 89.5% at 500°C and 800°C were recorded respectively. This implies that a higher temperature is important in achieving a higher phenol conversion and hydrogen yield. From Fig. 2, the experimental results of gaseous product selectivity with temperatures can be seen. A high CO2 yield was observed at 500°C and is favored at low temperature [76]. The increase in hydrogen yield suggested that the phenol steam reforming takes place at all temperatures to a reasonable extent. 3.1.2 Effect of catalyst weight Experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor on at 800°C and 0.36mL/min feed flow rate to investigate the effect of the catalyst weight on the activity of the Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst. From Fig. 3 , phenol conversion and gas product yield as affected by difference in the amount of catalyst can be seen. Indeed, the amount of the catalyst was observed to have a significant contribution in enhancing the performance of the catalyst. Phenol conversion and hydrogen yield increased as the amount of the catalyst was increased. Phenol conversion and hydrogen yield increased from 90.8% to 99.9% and 82.6% to 89.5% with an increase in catalyst amount from 0.05 to 0.2g respectively. Further increase in the weight of the catalyst showed a negative effect on hydrogen yield and phenol conversion. Lathasree et al. [77] found that as the weight of the catalyst increased, the number of phenol molecules adsorbed were increased owing to an increase in the number of catalyst particles. They mentioned that the decrease in the catalyst performance beyond the catalyst loading of 2.0g may be attributed to the screening effect of excess catalyst particles in the solution. Hence, a 0.2g weight catalyst is selected as the upper limit for the present study. 3.1.3 Effect of phenol concentration Fig. 4 depicts the effect of phenol concentration on the catalyst activity. Different molar ratios water to phenol (98:2, 96:4, 94:6, 92:8 and 90:10) was used. An increase in the ratio from 2wt.% to 10wt.% has significantly increased the catalyst activity. From the plot, it can be seen that a molar ratio of 90:10 yielded a phenol conversion of 98.8%. At 98:2H2O:phenol molar ratio, only 23% phenol conversion and 15% H2 yield were achieved. The lower hydrogen yield at low phenol concentrations is believed to be due to reason of less phenol is accessible for the reaction. As a result, a maximum of 10wt.% phenol concentration (in the stream) was chosen for the present study. 3.1.4 Effect of feed flow rate Fig. 5 displays the influence of changing flow rate on the catalyst activity. The catalyst weight and temperature were 0.2g and 800°C respectively. The effects of flow rate on hydrogen yield differ between the different methods and systems. From the figure, it is clear that as the flow rate changes from 0.16 to 0.56mL/min, the phenol conversion was noticed to decrease. However, hydrogen yield clearly declines in an exponential pattern. At a flow rate of 0.16mL/min, maximum hydrogen yield reached about 99.7% was reached. With further increase in flow rates (0.56mL/min), the hydrogen yield decreased (to 81.6%). Similar to what was observed for the hydrogen yield, CO yield exhibited the same exponential decline. At lower flow rates (0.16mL/min), the yield was high (46%). When the flow rate was increased to 0.56mL/min, the yield reduced to 19.1%. At lower feed flow rates, the contact times were longer for the feed and the catalyst and the catalyst performance enhanced toward hydrogen production. A decrease of hydrogen yield with increased flow rate has been experimentally shown for other reaction such as methane partial oxidation in the previous research [78,79]. Huang et al. [80] reported that the flow rate had no effect on product distribution in methane conversion for methane partial oxidation. To further examine the stability and extent of deactivation of the Ni-Co/ZrO2, the effect of time-on-stream (TOS) was investigated. The phenol steam reforming was studied for a time span of 72h. The investigation was carried out at 800°C, 0.2g catalyst, and 0.16mL/min feed flow rate. Fig. 6 depicts the phenol conversion and gas product yield as a function of time. It was clear that there was no significant change in the observed phenol conversion and product yield. However, the phenol conversion decreased slowly with time, nearly 0.03% per hour. At the first hour, the phenol conversion was 99.9%, which subsequently decreased to 96.5% during the last 72h. Moreover, the hydrogen yield decreased from 99.7% to 92.7% within the same time frame. Therefore, the stability and activity of the catalyst was maintained over time. The reason behind this may be due to the oxygen storage capacity of ZrO2 which cause to activate the oxidation-reduction cycle of the catalyst [81]. Song et al. [82] reported that the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of zirconia is highly active in steam reforming process. OSC is defined as the maximum amount of oxygen which can be stored inside the catalyst [83]. As a result, the oxidation–reduction cycle of the catalyst became more activated. This helped in gasifying the deposited carbon on the active sites."
6,Kinetic study,"3.2 Kinetic study The importance of studying the kinetics of a reaction cannot be overemphasized. It is vital for the production of all chemicals at industrial scale. In the present study, the kinetics of the Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalayst were explored. Six data points for each catalyst were selected for investigating the response of the phenol conversion as a function of many factors affecting the steam reforming reaction. The main reactions considered were the steam reforming reaction (Eq. (4)) and water gas shift reaction (Eq. (5)): (4) C 6 H 5 O H + 5 H 2 O → 6 C O + 8 H 2 (5) C O + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 To develop a comprehensive model for the phenol steam reforming process, the first reactions were considered simultaneously. Significant amount of hydrogen and negligible CO2 were formed in the absence of water. However, when water vapor was supplied to the system, relative distribution of the CO2 was inversed. Additionally, CO formation was also observed during the phenol reforming in the presence of water. Thus, decomposition reaction and WGS reaction were considered in order to incorporate the effect of variation in temperature, catalyst amount and feed flow rate in the phenol steam reforming process model. Subsequently, the reaction rate (−rPh) based on catalyst weight were evaluated using the conversion-residence time kinetic data. It is represented by Eq. (6). (6) − r P h d W = F P h d x P h The reaction rate, −rPh is in mmol/g.s, the phenol conversion represented by xPh. The molar flow rate of phenol (FPh) and the catalyst weight (dW) were expressed in mmol/s and g respectively. The current investigation employs the Power-law type rate expression. This is due to its simplicity in usage [84,85] to determine the reaction order. It is expressed in integral form as: (7) W F P h = ∫ 0 x P h d x P h − r P h Rearranging and multiplying through with −rPh, Eq. (7) transforms to: (8) − r P h = x P h F P h W c a t Now, rate of the reaction can be evaluated based on variations in factors such as reaction temperature, feed flow rate, catalyst amount as well as phenol/steam ratio. Thus, the catalytic activity of the Ni-Co/ZrO2 bimetallic catalyst can be accounted for under these variations. 3.2.1 Effects of operating conditions on reaction rate Fig. 7 shows the rate of the reaction base on the catalyst mass as a function of operating conditions such as temperature, catalyst weight, feed flow rate and phenol concentration in the feed. The limit and the steps of the operation conditions are reported in Table 1 . The steam reforming of phenol is endothermic reaction; higher phenol conversion can be obtained with an increase in temperature due to the enhanced reaction rate at higher temperatures. Therefore, reaction temperature is an important process variable in determining the reactant conversions as well as controlling the side reactions which may occur parallel to the main reforming reactions. The rate of the reaction also increased with increasing in the phenol concentration. It can be obviously seen that the reaction rate is in the exact fit with phenol concentration with R2=0.99. R2 shows the goodness of the experimental data fit the model and close to 1 is the best fit. The differences between the R2 values found can be attributed to the operation conditions used. On the other hand the catalyst weight factor has a negative effect on the reaction rate. 3.2.2 Apparent activation energy and comparison of activity Based on the phenol conversion rate as well as the CO and H2 generation rates, the apparent activation energies were evaluated through Arrhenius plots and shows in Fig. 8 . A temperature range of 500–800°C was chosen. To ensure stable performance of the catalyst, the experimental data were taken after 6h time-on-stream (TOS). Using both the plot and Eq. (9), the activation energies (EA) were evaluated. Slopes of the plots represent the apparent activation energies. (9) L n ( k ) = L n ( A ) − E A R T In Eq. (9), (A) represents the frequency factor, the activation energy (EA), gas constant (R) and absolute temperature were expressed in J/mol, J/mol.K and K respectively. From the slopes of the plots on Fig. 8, it is clear that the activation energy of phenol conversion is significantly higher than those of H2 and CO generation. The activation energy for the phenol consumption was found to be 102.27J/mol. It can be recalled that the rate expression in Power-law form is to be employed in determination of the reaction order. The expression is generally in the form: (10) − r P h = k C P h a C W b where a and b is denoted as the reaction order with respect to phenol and water concentrations. The apparent rate constant (k) was evaluated using the non-linear regression technique. The principle was based on minimization of the sum of square difference of the calculated and experimental rates of the phenol steam reforming reaction. POLYMATH software (version 6.1) was used to compute the unknown parameters (k, a, and b). As well, the reaction was also determined. Table 2 shows the results of the computation. The reaction rate in terms of Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst weight is depicted by Table 2. The reaction was carried at 800°C, using 0.2g catalyst and 0.16mL/min feed flow rate. The results of regression analysis show very good fit between the power-law model and the Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst data (R2 =0.98) with the overall reaction order of 0.93. Difference in R2 values found from other studies can be attributed to the different catalysts used [86]. The reactant composition at the entrance and the product composition at the exit of the reactor were the only variations that could be monitored. Therefore, it was not practicable to monitor the reaction progress at each point down the catalyst bed. Thus, six different catalyst bed lengths were used to monitor the reaction in order to obtain variation in the rate along the axial direction of catalyst bed. From the investigation, nearly the whole amount of phenol (98.9%) was consumed within a bed length of 2mm (which was equivalent to 0.2g). It can be inferred that beyond the catalyst weight of 0.3g, only a slight increase in conversion could be achieved. Therefore, the kinetics of the phenol steam reforming was investigated as follows. We assume that the external mass transfer, internal mass diffusion and heat transfer limitations are negligible, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for the phenol steam reforming follows the steps such as the reactants adsorption on surface of the catalyst, the reactant reaction on the surface of the catalyst and the product desorption from the surface of the catalyst. Both phenol and steam can adsorb on the same or different sites on the catalyst. The development of mechanisms was based on the assumptions that the rate-determining step (RDS) could be controlled by the surface reaction step, adsorption step or desorption step. The For the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms of the phenol steam reforming, it was assumed that both non-dissociative and dissociative phenol adsorption could occur. In general, the only differing assumption between LH and ER mechanisms is the use of a dual site mechanism for the reaction in the LH case and a single site mechanism in the ER case [87]. When the phenol molecule dissociates upon adsorption, it is referred to as the dissociative adsorption of phenol. As in the case of molecular adsorption, the rate of adsorption here is proportional to the concentration of phenol in the system, because this rate governs the number of gaseous collisions with the surface. For a molecule to dissociate as it adsorbs, however, two adjacent vacant active sites are required rather than the single site needed when a substance adsorbs in its molecular form. The probability of two vacant sites occurring adjacent to one another is proportional to the square of the concentration of vacant sites. For each mechanistic scheme mentioned, different rate equations were derived by considering each step as the rate limiting step. Table 3 displays the rate models. The rate experimental data obtained were fitted to the various rates. For the estimation of the kinetic constants, nonlinear regression analysis using Polymath 6.1 was done on each of the rate equations. The analysis was completely on mathematical basis. As a result, the thermodynamic significance of the kinetic constants cannot be accounted for. When poor correlation coefficients and calculations exceeded the maximum number of iterations (higher than 64) or negative parameter values were obtained, the models involved were discarded and deemed as no convergence model. The experimental rate data was best fitted to the rate equation. The equation was derived by considering surface reaction as the rate limiting step. As shown in Table 4 , non-dissociative adsorption of both phenol and steam for both LHHV and ER models were as well assumed."
7,Conclusions,"A kinetic investigation on phenol steam reforming over Ni-Co/ZrO2 was carried out. For the studies, the selected temperature range, catalyst weight, phenol concentration and feed flow rate were 500–800°C, 0.05–0.3g, 2–10wt.%, 0.16–0.36mL/min respectively. The reaction rate for the phenol steam reforming was did not suffer mass transfer limitation. The phenol steam reforming was considered kinetically controlled due to the radial heat transfer limitation being was reasonably negligible under these operating conditions. Base on simplified Power Law model, the overall reaction order was found to be 0.93 and the activation energy for phenol consumption was found to be 102.27J/mol. The chemical reaction was modeled using rate models developed from the LH and ER mechanisms. Non-linear regression was employed in the evaluation of the kinetic constants from the experimental data. Out of the six models proposed, only two exhibited acceptable. A proposed approach for the developed mechanism is presented and discussed. The Results suggested that the surface reaction was the rate limiting step by assuming non-dissociative adsorption of phenol and steam to be the most likely pathway for the phenol steam reforming reaction using Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst. Ultimately, the objective from study reaction kinetics is significantly helpful in optimization of catalyst synthesis and design to improve the commercialization viability of the phenol steam reforming process for Ni based catalysts."
