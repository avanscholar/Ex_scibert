0,Introduction,"Currently, the development of bio-based chemicals and fuels derived from agricultural bioresources based on biorefinery concept has been suggested as a crucial platform for the future replacement of petrochemicals [1–3]. In addition, the CO2 emission from the consumption of petroleum-based fuels can be reduced by an utilization of chemicals and fuels from biomass [4,5]. Lignocellulosic biomass, an important bioresource to produce the useful chemicals and fuels, mainly composes of cellulose, hemicellulos, and lignin with difference in mass composition depending on types of biomass [6]. Furfural (FAL) derived from simultaneous hydrolysis and dehydration process of xylan containing in hemicelluloses is a member of top thirty platform chemicals derived from agricultural feedstock by the United States Department of Energy [7–10]. Furfural can be further upgraded to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), furan, 1,5-pentanediol, 1-pentanol, and butanol toward catalytic processes including hydrogenation via ring hydrogenation and ring opening, hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation under mind conditions (Temperature: 150–250 °C in presence of H2 or N2 pressure (See in Scheme S1)) [7,8,11–15]. Among them, FOL and 2-MF are parts of versatile bio-based chemicals and can be extensively applied in various chemical industries. FOL can be widely utilized as a feedstock for the production of furan-based resins in addition to pharmaceuticals and fragrances industries [8]. Likewise, 2-MF, a multipurpose chemical intermediate, can produce pesticides, perfumes, and fuel additive to improve an octane number [11]. FAL can be commonly transformed to the FOL and 2-MF by hydrogenation accompanied with hydrogenolysis in presence and absence of hydrogen supply. Typical hydrogenation under high pressure of hydrogen causes critical issues and safety concerns [16]. Alternatively, the hydrogen-free process using 2-propanol as a hydrogen source so- called catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is of great attention since the hydrogen free process is much safer than the process operated under a supply of hydrogen gas. 2-Propanol acts as hydrogen source to hydrogenate the carbonyl group outside the furan ring and it becomes an acetone, as depicted in Scheme S1. Various supported catalysts have been employed for the CTH of FAL under alcohols as hydrogen donor, for example Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, Ru, Cu-Pd, Ni-W, Ni-Cu, Cu-Fe, and Cu-Zn supported on Al2O3, MgO-Al2O3, ZrO2, and carbon-based materials [16–29]. From literatures, the Cu-based catalysts are highly selective to hydrogenation of the C=O outside the furan ring to generate FOL, followed by oxygen removal in form of water to generate 2-MF via hydrogenolysis with low hydrogenation activity of C=C bond in the furan ring [30]. Therefore, many previous investigations have been focused on the Cu-containing catalysts such as supported Cu-Ni, Cu-Fe, and Cu-Zn catalysts due to high selectivity toward the FOL and/or 2-MF [23–25]. The CTH of C=O group in FAL to FOL can proceed toward Lewis acid-mediated intermolecular hydride transfer or Meerwein−Ponndorf−Verley (MPV) accompanying with metal-mediated hydrogenation, whereas the metallic sites could generate the hydrogen atom from alcohol donor, followed by Lewis acidic sites catalyzed the hydrogenolysis of C–OH to 2-MF [31]. Consequently, the comprehensive investigation on the role of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts relating to the Lewis acidic sites is an important way to design the non-precious catalysts for the CTH reaction. In addition, the bimetallic Cu-Co catalyst has not been investigated for the CTH of FAL. Herein, the bimetallic NiCu and CoCu and monometallic Cu, Ni, and Co supported on γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and employed for the CTH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran using 2-propanol as a hydrogen source. Their properties of catalysts were examined to advance the better insight into the relation between the activities and catalyst properties. The phase confirmation and active components identification were analyzed using XRD and XPS. The reducibility and metal-metal interaction were investigated by H2-TPR implementation. The evidence on the Lewis acidic site on the synthesized catalysts surface was elucidated using the in-situ pyridine adsorption FTIR. The influences of reaction temperature and time were conducted to optimize the yields of FOL and 2-MF. The recyclability of catalysts was explored and carbon deposit was further investigated by TGA measurements for the selected monometallic and bimetallic catalysts."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Purity ≥ 99.5%), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Purity ≥ 98.5%), and cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Purity ≥ 98%) were purchased from the CARLO ERBA Reagents S.A.S.. The furfural (Purity 99%) and 2-propanol (AR grade) were obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Pte. Ltd., and the QREC Chemical Co. Ltd., respectively. The γ-Al2O3 support (1.8 mm particle size) was supported from the Sasol Company, Germany. All chemicals were utilized without purification process."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Cu, Ni, Co, Ni-Cu, and Co-Cu supported γ-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by an impregnation method. The corresponding metal salts were dissolved in a deionized water and dropped on γ-Al2O3 support, which was crushed and sieved to 0.30–0.42 mm diameter. Then, the resultant samples were removed the water at 110 °C for at least 12 h and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain the catalysts in oxide form. Before to reaction implementation, the oxide samples were transformed to metallic forms via hydrogen reduction process at 500 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace under a H2 flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1. The synthesized catalysts with metal loading by weight percentage of 15%Cu, 15%Ni, 15%Co, 5%Ni-10%Cu, and 5%Co-10%Cu supported on γ-Al2O3 catalysts were noted as CuAl, NiAl, CoAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The Bel Sorp mini II apparatus was utilized to determine the textural properties of the calcined catalysts by a N2 sorption at −196 °C. The samples were removed the volatile compounds under vacuum atmosphere at 150 °C for 12 h before measurements. The phase confirmation and crystallinity of the calcined, reduced, and spent catalysts were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The spectra were recorded on X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-6000) with a Cu Kα X-ray source radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in the range of 2θ = 20° to 80° with scan speed of 2° min−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to examined the oxidation states and forms of the reduced catalysts. The XPS analyses were conducted using a KRATOS AXIS Ultra spectrometer connected to a monochromatic Al K X- α ray source. The C1s at 284.5 eV was recorded to adjust the other investigated binding energies. The percentage of element composition was calculated based on the deconvolution of peaks for each oxidation state. The hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction technique (H2-TPR) was employed under diluted H2 to investigate the reducibility and metal-metal and/or metal-support interactions of the calcined catalysts using a BELCAT-B Instruments, Japan. The calcined samples were pre-treated at 200 °C for 1 h under Ar atmosphere with a flow rate of 50 cm3 min−1. The TPR profiles were recorded using TCD signal and conducted by rising the temperature from 100 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under 5 vol% H2/Ar with flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1. The particle size and metal species distribution of the CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts were observed using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system. The TEM equipped with EDS detector (a JEOL JED-2300D) was used to perform the quantitative elemental analysis of the selected catalysts. The FTIR spectra of the pyridine adsorbed on γ-Al2O3 supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were recorded using a Bruker FTIR Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFTS cell to distinguish the Lewis and Brönsted acidic sites on the catalyst surface. Prior to the implementation, the calcined samples were in-situ reduced in the IR cell at 500 °C for 2 h under the supply of hydrogen. Subsequently, the catalysts containing in IR cell were cooled to 150 °C under the flow rate of helium for 1 h, whereas, the adsorption of pyridine was conducted into the IR cell under the helium flow for 2 h at 150 °C. After the pyridine adsorption, the gas replacement was done by flowing helium for 1 h and the FTIR spectra were recorded in the range of 1400–1700 cm−1 with the resolution of 2 cm−1. In addition, the percentage distribution of different types of strong, medium, and weak Lewis acidic sites was performed by the devolution of peaks in the range of 1575–1620 cm−1. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the amount of carbonaceous species and/or heavy organic residue deposited on the spent catalysts in comparison with the fresh catalysts. The analyses were performed using a Shimadzu DTG-60 analyzer. The spent catalysts were dried at 200 °C for an overnight to remove the moisture and remaining reactants and products. All the TGA profiles were recorded from 25 to 800 °C under a supply of air with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1."
5,Catalyst performance investigation,"2.4 Catalyst performance investigation The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural was conducted in a glass-lined stainless-steel high pressure 100 ml batch type reactor. In a reaction test, 1 g of furfural, 40 ml of 2-propanol, and 0.2 or 0.1 g of the reduced catalyst were added into the reactor. Subsequently, the sealed reactor was flushed by N2 for at least three times to remove an air inside. The initial N2 pressure was fixed at 5 bar before an implementation, whereas, an autogenous pressure was in the range of 15–45 bar with the reaction temperature in the range of 180–220 °C. Subsequently, the reactor was heated to the target temperature. After time requirement, the reactor was suddenly placed into an ice-cool water to stop the reactions. The suspended product was collected and separated using Nylon syringe filter . In the reusability test, the spent catalysts were separated by vacuum filtration, followed by washing with ethanol for several times and reused directly after dried overnight at 65 °C . The carbon balance after the reaction was always 97–99% for all the experiments done in this present work. The average values using duplicate and/or triplicate experiments were reported. A gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID) (Clarus 680, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a capillary column (DB-1HT, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.1 μm) was used to quantify the amount of reactant and products in liquid phase. The injection and detection temperatures were set above boiling point of reactant and products at 250 and 230 °C, respectively. The temperature program started at 40 °C and hold for 5 min, followed by heating up to 200 °C with a heating rate of 8 °C min−1 and holding for 3 min. The FAL conversion and product yields were determined according to the following equations: (1) FAL conversion % = C FAL , 0 − C FAL , F C FAL , 0 × 100 (2) Product yield % = C product C FAL , 0 × 100 where the CFAL,0 and CFAL,F are initial and final molar concentrations of furfural, respectively, whereas, Cproduct is the molar concentration of all the products, for example furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF). Moreover, the total moles of remaining H2 and N2 in gas product for the CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts after the CTH experiments at reaction temperature of 200 °C and reaction time for 4 h were further investigated by a gas chromatography–thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) equipped with a packed column (molecular sieve 5A). The mole fraction of H2 and N2 was calculated using the calibration curves of standard gases and the ideal gas law was employed to estimate the total mole of remaining H2 using the gas pressure after the reactor was cooled down to room temperature."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst Characterization,"3.1 Catalyst Characterization 3.1.1 N2 sorption experiments All the textural properties of the calcined samples are listed in Table 1 . The bare γ-Al2O3 support exhibited the BET surface area of 193.6 m2 g−1 with the total pore volume of 0.50 cm3 g−1. After loading of metal species, the BET surface area of supported samples dropped approximately 17.2–22.3% compared with the bare support due to the converging and/or blockage of pores by metal loading. A significant decrease in pore volume and diameter was observed for the calcined NiAl and CoAl samples, implying an agglomeration of metal oxides into γ-Al2O3 pores. However, the average pore diameter of calcined NiCuAl and CoCuAl samples did not obviously change after metal loading, indicating the partial converging of metal oxides on the external area of the support. The N2 isotherms and pore size distribution of all the calcined catalysts are depicted in Fig. S1. All the profiles exhibit a typical type IV isotherms with a H1-type hysteresis loop classified by IUPAC organization, confirming the characteristics of mesoporous material [32]. The average pore size using the BJH method was around 10 nm for all the calcined samples, indicating a uniform mesoporous structure. 3.1.2 H2-TPR implementation The reducibility and metal-metal and/or metal-support interactions of all the calcined samples were investigated using H2-TPR measurements (See in Fig. 1 ). In the case of calcined CuAl catalyst, there are two reduction peaks at 210 °C and 280 °C. The former peak is due to the reduction of high dispersion of CuO particles or ions located on the catalyst surface, whereas, the latter peak is assigned to the reduction of bulk CuO to metallic Cu [11,33]. The reduction of the calcined NiAl catalyst occurring in the wide range of 400 to 800 °C. The peak in the range of 400–600 °C with the maximum at 540 °C is due to the reduction of NiO that strongly interacts with the alumina support and the tiny peaks at temperature above 600 °C correspond to the reduction of amorphous surface of NiAl2O4 [34,35]. Besides, the profile of the calcined CoAl catalyst exhibits two reduction peaks at 380 °C and a board peak in the range of 420–610 °C. This result indicated that the reduction behavior of the calcined CoAl catalyst occurred in two steps; the former peak is assigned to the transformation of Co3O4 to CoO and the latter peak is ascribed to the transformation of CoO to metallic Co [36]. Furthermore, the reduction peaks of the bimetallic NiCuAl catalyst shift to a lower temperature in the range of 200–300 °C, which consist of two maximum peaks at 220 and 260 °C [32]. This result indicated that the addition of Ni into Cu species could facilitate the reduction of NiO species. Likewise, the profile of the CoCuAl catalyst revealed that the main peak shifts to lower temperature at 245 °C compared with the CoAl catalyst. It should be noted that the interaction between Cu and Ni or Co resulted to the simplicity of the reduction behavior of the bimetallic ones. Furthermore, this behavior could be due to the hydrogen spill-over on the metallic Cu at lower temperatures. Thus, the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen molecules to atoms on metal particles could facilitate the reduction of other metal oxides located nearly to Cu species [37]. 3.1.3 XRD analysis The crystallinity and phase confirmation of all the calcined and reduced catalysts were investigated using the X-ray diffraction. The XRD patterns of all the calcined and reduced catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The broad peaks at 2θ = 32°, 46°, 61°, and 67.2° detected in the calcined and reduced catalysts are attributed to the γ-Al2O3 phase [38–40]. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35.4°, 38.7°, 48.8°, and 58.2° detected in the CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts are assigned to the CuO [32]. Interestingly, the intensity of all diffraction peaks for the CuO phase detected in the CoCuAl catalyst was lower than that of the CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts. This result implied that the addition of Co into Cu species resulted in the formation of smaller and/or high dispersion CuO particles. In the case of the NiAl catalyst, the peaks at 2θ = 37.3°, 43.3°, and 63° are ascribed to NiO [34,40,41]. In the case of CoAl catalyst, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.2° and 36.8° are assigned to the diffraction peaks of Co3O4 spinel structure [42]. In the case of the NiCuAl catalyst, no diffraction peaks in XRD pattern attributed to nickel forms were observed, but there were the diffraction peaks of CuO. This was due to the peaks of NiO were overlapped with CuO because of its low Ni content. For CoCuAl catalyst, the diffraction peaks are ascribed to CuO and the other peaks are clearly observed at 36.8°2 and 44.8° assigned to the diffraction peaks of Co3O4 [42] confirming the coexistence between CuO and Co3O4. The XRD patterns of all the reduced catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2b. As observed in the XRD patterns of the reduced CuAl catalyst, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 43.2°, 50.3°, and 74.2° corresponded to metallic Cu plane of (111), (200), and (220), respectively [11,43]. The diffraction peaks of Ni (111) at 44.5°, Ni (200) at 51.6° [44], Co(111) at 44.5° and Co(200) at 47.5° [45,46] are observed for NiAl and CoAl catalysts, respectively. As observed in the XRD pattern of the reduced NiCuAl catalyst, the nickel characteristic peaks disappeared and the diffraction peak of metallic Cu is detected at 2θ = 74.1°. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks of CuNi alloy at 2θ = 43.6° and 50.5° are observed, indicating the generation of Cu-Ni alloy during the reduction at 500 °C [32,41,47–50]. Similarly, as detected in the XRD pattern of the reduced CoCuAl catalyst, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44° and 51° are attributed to Cu-Co alloy [51]. As Confirmed in Fig. S2, the peak shift was detected for both the reduced NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, indicating the formation of metal alloys species. It should be confirmed that the reduction of NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts under H2 flow at 500 °C resulted in the generation of the bimetallic alloys. 3.1.4 XPS analysis The XPS spectra were further measured to examine the oxidation states and forms of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The calcined samples were ex-situ reduced at 500 °C under a supply of H2 before the XPS implementation. As depicted in Fig. 3a, c, and e, the Cu2p spectra of the reduced CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts exhibited two distinguishable doublet peaks of Cu2p 3/2 and Cu2p 1/2. The deconvolution of peaks were performed to confirm the oxidation states of Cu2+ and Cu+/Cu0. The peaks located at binding energies of 934.8 and 954.3 eV are ascribed to the Cu2+, whereas the peaks at binding energies of 932.4 eV and 951.9 eV correspond to Cu+/Cu0, indicating that the CuO species remained on the catalyst surface [42,51–55]. Moreover, the peaks at 942.2 and 961.4 eV are assigned to the shake-up satellite, indicating the presence of CuO in the reduced catalysts. The distinction between Cu+ and Cu0 was detected in the Cu LMM spectra of the reduced CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts (See in Fig. 3b, d, and f). Three peaks located at binding energies of 570.1, 569, and 568.1 eV are ascribed to Cu+, Cu2+, and Cu0 states, indicating the existence of all three Cu valence species on the catalyst surface (See in Table S1) [19]. Although, as observed in H2-TPR profiles (See in Fig. 1), the Cu oxides of all the catalysts could be completely reduced at 500 °C, and no CuO species were detected in the XRD analysis (see Fig. 2b). This was due to the partial oxidation of catalysts surface in the air before the XPS measurements. It has been reported that the coexistence between the metallic Cu and Cu+ can promote the CTH reaction through the synergistic effect between Lewis acidic sites and metallic sites [52]. The Ni2p spectra of the reduced NiAl and NiCuAl catalysts are depicted in Fig. 4a and b. The peaks revealed the mixture of the Ni2+ and Ni0 states. The peaks at binding energies of 853.5 and 872.8 eV are attributed to the Ni2+, and the peaks at binding energies of 852.1 and 870.1 eV belong to Ni0 [56,57]. Besides, the characteristic peaks of Co2p spectra were observed in the reduced CoAl and CoCuAl catalysts (See in Fig. 4c and d). The peaks of Co2p were deconvoluted into two doublet peaks attributed to metallic cobalt (Co0) and cobalt oxides (Co2+/Co3+). The peaks in the range of 777.2–777.6 eV and 792.7–793.1 eV ascribed to Co2p 3/2 and Co2p 1/2, respectively are assigned to the Co0 [38,46]. Moreover, the XPS spectra of Co2p 3/2 and Co2p 1/2 of the reduced CoAl and CoCuAl catalysts exhibit two oxidation states of Co3+ and Co2+; the peaks at ⁓779.1–779.2 eV and ⁓792.3–793.2 eV are attributed to Co3+ and the peaks at ⁓781.9–782.2 eV and ⁓797.1–798 eV are assigned to Co2+, respectively [38,42]. It was confirmed that the existence of satellite peaks in the spectra suggested that the Co metallic coexisted with Co oxides. As confirmed in the H2-TPR, the reduction of bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl samples could occur at the temperature lower than that of NiAl and CoAl samples. The composition percentage calculated from XPS experiments of Ni0 and Co0 detected in NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts was higher than that of the reduced NiAl and CoAl catalysts (See in Table S1). This result confirmed that the Cu species could facilitate the reduction behavior of the Ni and Co species as observed for the NiCu and CoCu alloys. 3.1.5 TEM-EDS observation TEM measurements were employed to examine the distribution of metal species of the reduced CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts. As exhibited in Fig. S3, the EDS mapping revealed the homogeneous distribution of Cu species on the alumina support. For the reduced NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, as demonstrated in Figs. S3b and S3c, the particles of Ni and Co were in various sizes and seem to be embedded with the Cu species located on alumina support. 3.1.6 Pyridine FTIR measurements The pyridine adsorption FTIR was conducted to distinguish the Lewis and Brönsted acidic sites on the catalyst surface since the presence of Lewis acidic centre significantly affects the CTH reaction [31,58,59]. It was reported that the peak at 1540 cm−1 are assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Brönsted acidic sites, and the Lewis acidic sites can be divided into two regions: vibrational mode between 1445 and 1435 cm−1 and 1630–1590 cm−1 regions [38,60]. In the case of the bare γ-Al2O3 support, the peaks corresponding to Lewis acidic sites are observed (See in Fig. S4). The interaction between pyridine and Lewis acidic sites on γ-Al2O3 surface exhibited two adsorption peaks with the bands at 1449 cm−1 and 1622–1610 cm−1 regions, attributing to Lewis acidic centre presenting on the γ-Al2O3 surface [61,62]. On the other hand, no adsorption peaks of the Brönsted acidic sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface are detected. The results are in agreement with the literatures that γ-Al2O3 possesses the Lewis acidic sites (L) and surface hydroxyl groups (B+L) without the detection of Brönsted acidic sites (B) [61,63,64]. The pyridine FTIR spectra of all the reduced catalysts are depicted in Fig. 5 . The peaks intensity and wavenumbers in the FTIR spectra were used to examine the distribution and types of Lewis acidic sites. The absorption peak at 1590 cm−1 is ascribed to pyridine adsorbed on weak Lewis acidic sites, whereas the other two absorption peaks at 1610 and 1620 cm−1 are assigned to medium and strong Lewis acidic sites, respectively [65]. Besides, the peak at 1575 cm−1 is due to the other types of pyridine adsorption on catalyst surface [38]. Therefore, the devolution of the peaks in the range of 1575–1620 cm−1 was used to examine the distribution of weak, medium, and strong Lewis acidic sites. As revealed in Fig. 5, all the catalysts exhibited three major band patterns including Lewis acidic sites at 1449 cm−1, combination between Lewis and Brönsted acidic sites at 1495 cm−1, and Lewis acidic sites in the range of 1575–1622 cm−1. In the case of monometallic catalysts, the NiAl catalyst exhibited the highest peaks intensity at Lewis acidic sites, indicating the higher amount of Lewis acidic sites among the other monometallic CuAl and CoAl catalysts. It was evident from FTIR spectra that the formation of bimetallic Ni-Cu and Co-Cu alloys apparently increased the peak area of Lewis acid sites in the range 1610–1622 cm−1 compared with the CuAl catalyst, implying the tunable Lewis acidic sites by Ni and Co additions. These results confirmed that the stronger Lewis acidic centre could be improved by the addition of Ni and Co species. Table 2 summarizes the percentage distribution of weak, medium, and strong Lewis acidic sites of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts by the deconvolution peaks on the region between 1575 and 1630 cm−1 (See in Fig. 6 ). It could be clearly demonstrated that the medium Lewis acidic sites on the catalyst surface was dominant fraction over all the monometallic catalysts and the bare γ-Al2O3 support. After addition Ni and Co species into Cu species, the percentage distribution of strong Lewis acidic sites was nearly comparable to medium Lewis acidic sites. This result suggested that the synergistic effect occurring on bimetallic catalysts resulted in change on the acidic distribution of Lewis acidic sites. The correlation of acidity and catalytic activity for the CTH of furfural will be further discussed in the next section."
8,Catalytic activity investigation,"3.2 Catalytic activity investigation The catalytic activities of monometallic CuAl, NiAl, and CoAl and bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts were conducted through catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of furfural (FAL) using 2-propanol as a hydrogen source at the reaction temperature in the range of 180–220 °C and reaction time for 0.5–6 h. The N2 pressure was fixed at 5 bar throughout the investigation. The major target of the present study was the selective CTH toward furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) productions. Therefore, the optimization on the catalyst performance and operating conditions was conducted to maximize the two major products. 3.2.1 Influence of reaction temperature In order to control the product distribution during the CTH reaction, the influence of reaction temperature on FAL conversion and product yields was first explored over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts (See in Fig. 7 ). At the reaction temperature 180 °C, as can be seen in Fig. 7a, 100% furfural conversion was achieved over the CuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, whereas it reached around 68.9–93.2% furfural conversion over the NiAl, CoAl, and NiCuAl catalysts. It was found that the major generated product over all the catalysts was FOL with a minor 2-MF. Over the CuAl catalyst, the FOL yield catalyzed via the CTH of carbonyl group appeared a maximum yield of 92.8% with minor 2-MF yield of 6.6% since the generated FOL further converted to 2-MF via cleavage of C–OH bond under H2-free condition. The similar results were obtained over the CoCuAl catalyst. It was reported that the combination between Cu0 and Cu+ could promote the hydrogenation of C=O group in FAL to C–OH group by Lewis acidic sites with the generation of FOL, followed by the cleavage of C–OH bond via hydrogenolysis to 2-MF by metallic sites, suggesting that the Cu species was more selective to the transfer hydrogenation of C=O bond than C=C bond in furan ring [11,30,42,66,67]. Interestingly, the 2-MF yield reached to a maximum of 16.2% over the NiCuAl catalyst, suggesting that the Ni addition had an ability to promote the transfer hydrogenolysis of cleavage of C–OH bond in compared with the monometallic CuAl catalyst. The further increase in reaction temperature was conducted to improve the yield of 2-MF by the addition of Ni and Co species into Cu species. The pure γ-Al2O3 support exhibited 59.9% FOL yield with no 2-MF yield at 200 °C of reaction temperature and reaction time for 2 h, whereas the higher product yields were achieved when the CTH was catalyzed by the metal species. The increase temperature up to 200 °C significantly improved the conversion and product yields over all the catalysts especially for the 2-MF yield. As can be demonstrated in Fig. 7b, the FAL conversion was 100%, accompanied with different 2-MF yields over the CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts. The catalytic activities in term of 2-MF yield increased in order of CuAl (20.7%) < CoCuAl (29.0%) < NiCuAl (41.1%). These results clearly implied that the CuAl catalyst had a capability toward the hydrogenolysis of C–OH group, nevertheless it could not break the C–OH bond efficiently under the H2-free condition compared with the Ni and Co-promoters. As described in the literature, the ability to adsorb the carbonyl (C=O) and hydroxyl (C–OH) groups during the CTH reaction is due to the Lewis acidic sites on the catalyst surface [68]. Moreover, the CTH of C=O group to FOL could proceed toward Lewis acid-mediated intermolecular hydride transfer or Meerwein−Ponndorf−Verley (MPV) accompanying with metal-mediated hydrogenation, whereas the metallic sites could generate the hydrogen from alcohol donor, followed by Lewis acidic sites catalyzed the hydrogenolysis of C–OH to 2-MF [31]. In addition, the generation of hydrogen after the CTH experiments was confirmed for the CuAl, NiCuAl, CoCuAl catalysts, indicating that the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol involved in this reaction (See in Fig. S5). Confirming by Pyridine FTIR, the peak intensities on the Lewis acidic sites at 1622–1610 cm−1 of NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts were higher than those of CuAl catalyst, implying the higher amount of Lewis acidic sites by Ni and Co additions (See in Fig. 5). It should be deduced that the Ni and Co-promoters could improve the ability on scission of C–OH bond via Lewis acidic sites to generate 2-MF. Comparing in term of percentage acidic distribution, the strong fraction of Lewis acidic sites at 1620 cm−1 could be generated by Ni and Co additions. This result implied that the metallic sites generated the hydrogen atom from 2-propanol and the strong Lewis acidic sites could carry out the hydrogenolysis effectively to produce 2-MF. Thus, it was evident that the addition of Ni and Co species into Cu species promoted the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis via scission of C-OH bond. Interestingly, over the CoAl catalyst, the FAL conversion and FOL yield increased with the rising reaction temperature from 180 to 200 °C. The major product was FOL, indicating that Co species were selective to the CTH of C=O bond only compared with the hydrogenolysis of C–OH bond. It should be deduced that the monometallic CoAl catalyst is suitable for an industrial application of FOL production with reducing the purification cost. As listed in Table 3 , it can be clearly demonstrated that the addition of Ni and Co into Cu could improve the product selectivity mainly toward FOL and 2-MF with the combination of product yields higher than 90%. Compared with the CuAl catalyst, the increase in the reaction temperature could increase the 2-MF yield but it competitively produced side products. It has been reported that 2-pentanone, 1,2-pentanediol, and 1,4-pentanediol via ring opening reaction were generated when the reaction was catalyzed using the Cu catalyst [69]. Thus, the major drawback of the 2-MF production over the Cu catalyst was 15.5% selectivity of by-products (See in Table 3). This result was similar to the NiAl catalyst with 22.8% selectivity of side products. The increase in reaction temperature up to 220 °C resulted in a significant decline on the FOL yield except for the CoAl catalyst (See in Fig. 7c). These results suggested that the produced FOL partially underwent to the other products. The remained FOL, 2-MF, and 2-MTHF were mainly detected over the CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts. The highest 2-MF yield at 54.1% was achieved over CoCuAl catalyst. Under 2-propanol as a H2-donor, it should be confirmed that the FAL was firstly hydrogenated to FOL. Subsequently, the transfer hydrogenolysis of FOL was proceeded to generate 2-MF and further hydrogenated to 2-MTHF. Over the NiAl catalyst, it was found that the FAL conversion improved and reached 100% at 220 °C. The FOL was not detected at 220 °C and the liquid product mainly composed of tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-MTHF, and 2-MF. The results indicated that the NiAl catalyst was selective to the decarbonylation and hydrogenation of carbonyl group and furan ring due to the nature active Ni sites with high selectivity toward the cleavage of C–O and hydrogenation of C=O. This observation was consistent to previous investigation [11,70]. Moreover, the existence of Cu species plays a crucial role in inhibition the ring hydrogenation and the decarbonylation which proceeded to the undesired products (Furan or THFA). This is due to the strengthen interaction of Cu metal to C=O of furfural, resulting the suppression of the adsorption of furan ring on catalyst surface [11,43,71]. Confirming by rising the reaction temperature, the product composition over the CoAl catalyst was FOL, indicating that Co species were mainly selective to the CTH of C=O bond. As expected, the reaction temperature significantly affected the product distribution over the different catalysts. Thus, the reaction temperature at 200 °C is more suitable for FOL and 2-MF productions. 3.2.2 Influence of reaction time The influence of reaction time on FAL conversion and two major FOL and 2-MF yields was investigated at 200 °C over the monometallic CuAl and bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts due to an ability on the FOL and 2-MF productions. Figs. 8a–c show the influence of reaction time on FAL conversion and product yields over CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts at 200 °C. It can be demonstrated that the FAL conversion reached 100% over all the catalyst within 2 h, accompanied with the difference in FOL and 2-MF yields. The increasing tendency of FOL yield was shaper at initial stage over the CuAl and CoCuAl catalysts and substantially decreased after 2 h over both catalysts. Besides, the tendency of 2-MF yield slightly increased in the range of 0.5 to 2 h reaction time over the NiCuAl catalyst, suggesting that the Ni-promoted Cu catalyst could break the C-OH bond via hydrogenolysis effectively among the other catalysts. In the case of the CuAl catalyst, the FOL yield reached a maximum yield of 85% at 0.5 h, but a substantial decrease afterward was observed. The yield of 2-MF continuously increased with reaction time and reached to 43.7% at 6 h, whereas the generation of other by-products was found to increase at the same time. As mentioned above, the control FOL and 2-MF selectivity using CuAl catalyst was difficult due to the formation of by-products. In the case of the NiCuAl catalyst, the maximum FOL and 2-MF yields were 50.0% and 41.1%, respectively within 2 h. The further increase in the reaction time resulted in a slight increase in 2-MTHF and THFA yields, indicating that the ring hydrogenation and ring opening reactions proceeded with the reaction time. It should be deduced that the reaction time at 2 h was the optimized time for the two major products using NiCuAl catalyst. As demonstrated in Fig. 8c, the CTH over CoCuAl catalyst generated FOL and 2-MF as the major products and other by-products were less than 14% at 6 h. It was found that the yield of FOL decreased from 84% (0.5 h) to 36% (6 h). In contrast, the yield of 2-MF increased with reaction time and reached to 47–50% (4–6 h)."
9,Catalyst recyclability,"3.3 Catalyst recyclability The stability of the selected CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts were investigated by performing the consecutive reusability at 200 °C with the reaction time for 4 h. After the CTH experiment, all the separated catalysts by filtration were reused directly without reactivation after dried overnight at 65 °C. Fig. 9 exhibits the change of FAL conversion and product yields with three consecutive runs. The FAL conversion remained 100% over the CuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, whereas a slight decline from 100% to 88.7% was observed over the NiCuAl catalyst. The overall product yields gradually decreased over the CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts through the three consecutive runs with different levels in each product yield. It was apparent that the yield of 2-MF dropped significantly from 31.1% to 8.6%, meanwhile the yield of FOL slightly increased from 51% to 65.3% over the CuAl catalyst (See in Fig. 9a). In the case of the NiCuAl catalyst, a significant decline of 2-MF yield and increase in FOL yield were observed (See in Fig. 9b). In addition, it can be seen that both 2-MTHF and THFA products disappeared in the second run, indicating that the ring hydrogenation and decarbonylation were restricted. It could be clearly demonstrated that the CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts deactivated after first consecutive experiment. In the case of the CoCuAl catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 9c, the product yield of 2-MF seemed to be slightly decrease with further consecutive experiment. The yield of FOL increased from 40.4% to 65.4%, while the 2-MF yield decreased from 47.0% to 29.2% in third experiment. The changes in product distribution between FOL and 2-MF were observed over the CuCoAl catalyst. This result suggested that the CoCuAl catalyst had an ability to retain the overall catalytic activities without the reactivation toward C=O hydrogenation and C–OH hydrogenolysis, although it seemed to deactivate after the first experiment. This would be beneficial for the CoCuAl catalyst compared with CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts under CTH reaction. The stability of reduced CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts was further investigated under fixed conditions (200 °C, 15 min, and 10% catalyst loading based on initial mass of FAL) at conversion level in the range of 17–86%. As shown in Fig. S6, the FAL conversion significantly decreased over all the catalysts through the three consecutive runs, indicating that the deactivation was observed over all the catalysts. Moreover, > 97% FOL selectivity was obtained over the CuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, whereas, the NiCuAl catalyst exhibited a significant change in FOL and 2-MF selectivity. These results were similar to deactivation study at high conversion level. To examine the reasons for the catalyst deactivation, the XRD, Pyridine FTIR, and TGA experiments were conducted using the spent catalysts after the CTH experiments at reaction temperature of 200 °C and reaction time for 4 h. The XRD patterns of all the spent CuAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl catalysts are depicted in Fig. S7. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of the spent catalysts illustrated similar to the diffraction peaks of the reduced catalysts (See in Fig. 2b). However, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of all the spent catalysts slightly decreased especially for the spent NiCuAl catalyst. Correspondingly, the FTIR spectra of the pyridine adsorbed on the spent catalyst (see Fig. S8) exhibited the decrease in the peak intensity over all the positions, implying the reduction of Lewis acidic sites after the CTH reaction. It was evident by TGA experiments of the fresh and spent catalysts as depicted in Fig. 10 . The weight loss at temperature lower than 200 °C is due to the removal of moisture content in the catalysts, whereas at the temperature in the range of 280–800 °C is from the decomposition of carbon species in an air atmosphere. The highest weight loss of 2.8% was observed for the spent CuAl catalyst, followed by 2.2% and 1.1% for the spent NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts, respectively compared with the fresh catalysts. These results suggested that the carbonaceous species or heavy organic residue deposited on the catalysts surface during the reaction, which could block the active sites of the catalyst. It has been reported that the carbon deposit would be major reason for the degradation of Cu-containing catalysts, resulting from the polymerization of unconverted reactant and products [72]. It can be explained from our investigation that the blocking active sites by carbon species could reduce the Lewis acidic sites and crystallinity of the catalysts. This might be the one of reason for catalyst deactivation and the change in product distribution during the CTH reaction. In addition, the CoCuAl catalyst has the superior performance to retard carbonaceous species among the CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts. This would be a beneficial behavior of the CoCuAl catalyst compared with the other ones."
10,Conclusion,"Non-noble bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts as well as monometallic CuAl, NiAl, and CoAl catalysts were obtained by an impregnation method and all the catalysts were employed for the CTH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran under 2-propanol as a hydrogen donor. The characterization investigations revealed the formation of metallic CuAl, NiAl, CoAl, NiCuAl, and CoCuAl phases with difference in Lewis acidic sites. The strong metal and metal interactions were found to decrease the reduction temperature required for the NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts. It can be demonstrated that the bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts were highly selective to generate the furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran toward the hydrogenation of C=O, followed by the hydrogenolysis of C–OH with lower undesired products in compared with the monometallic CuAl catalyst. The excellent performance of the bimetallic NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts was due to the tunable Lewis acidic centre on the catalyst surface. The reusability experiments confirmed that a small degradation of catalytic performance and the lowest carbon deposit were detected using the CoCuAl catalyst."
