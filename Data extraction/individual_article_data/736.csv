0,Introduction,"The increasing global energy consumption associated with environment pollution greatly stimulated scientists to explore clean renewable energy sources [1–3]. Hydrogen, as an eco-friendly clean energy source with bountiful supply, has been thought to be one of the most promising energies to replace fossil energy because of huge combustion heat and pollution-free advantages [4–6]. Up to now, electrolytic water splitting has attracted extensive attentions and has been recognized as a promising technology for hydrogen generation, because such route can be potential by synergy with the gradually increased renewable energy and thus result in zero greenhouse gas emissions [7]. However, one of the critical issues in electrolysis water splitting is that the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires a high overpotential and proceeds with sluggish kinetics, which significantly enhances the energy demanded and thereby slows down its large-scale industrial application. In addition, O2 produced at anode is a less value-added product relative to H2. In this regard, it is imperative to explore innovative strategy to reduce the electrolytic energy, to enhance kinetic of anode reaction, and to generate more value-added product other than O2 [8–11]. In the recent years, one promising route was proposed to electrolytic hydrogen production by replacing anodic OER with oxidation reaction of some oxidizable species, such as hydrazine [12], urea [13], and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [14]. Glucose, as an important monosaccharide in biology, can be naturally formed from water and carbon dioxide via photosynthesis of algae and plants under assistance of sunlight energy [15–17]. In addition, glucose usually exists as waste products of biomass in sugar, pulp and paper processing industries [18]. Glucose has been widely used as a precursor for the synthesis of gluconate, which is an important intermediate in the fields of food, pharmaceutical, and beverage industries with features of non-toxic, non-corrosive and readily biodegradable [19]. The commercial/industrial method to produce gluconate, i.e. glucose biochemical oxidation, is yet limited by slow reaction rate, low space-time, and problematic enzyme product separation [20]. We noticed that the theoretical thermodynamics potential for glucose oxidation into gluconate is much smaller than that (1.23 V) of OER [21], which makes it be an attractive alternative to replace OER in water splitting [22]. Although electrocatalytic glucose oxidation has been broadly investigated, especially for employing glucose as biofuel cells and sensor for medical applications [16,23], electrolytic generation of gluconate did not receive enough attention it deserved yet [21]. It is thus desirable to explore electrolytic route to convert glucose into gluconate to replace the current biological or purely chemical processes. Herein, we propose a new tri-profitable strategy to develop an alkaline-acid asymmetric electrolytic cell (3A-EC) by coupling anodic glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) in alkaline anode with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic cathode, in which energy from GOR and electrochemical neutralization energy between OH− at anode and H+ at cathode (Supporting information) can be simultaneously harvested, implementing significant energy saving upon electrolytic generation of gluconate and H2."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of catalyst 2.1.1 Materials Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O AR), selenium powers, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), D2O and Pt/C (20 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O AR), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, AR), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85 wt%) and urea were bought from Sinopharm. The bipolar membrane was obtained from the Yanrun Film Technology Development Co., Ltd in Beijing. Carbon cloth (termed as CC) was purchased from Haote New Materials Co. LTD in Jingzhou. All reagents were used without further purified. 2.1.2 Preparation of Fe0.1Co-CHH To acquire clean and hydrophilic surface for the hydrothermal growth, the CC was pretreated in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1 h in the oil bath and then in 30 % H2O2 under same conditions, and then washed with ethyl alcohol and deionized water respectively and dried in vacuum oven at 60 °C. First, 0.87 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.12 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (the molar ratio of Fe source to Co source is 0.1:1), 0.9 g (NH2)2CO and 0.22 g NH4F were dissolved in 70 mL deionized water and strongly stirred to form a homogeneous solution. The as-prepared CC (4 cm2 cm) above was immersed into the above solution at least half an hour to make it completely hydrophilic. Then, the mixture solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which subsequently was heated to 120 °C and kept at that temperature for 7 h. Finally, when it cooled naturally to room temperature, CC was respectively rinsed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the surface of the unstable impurities and dried in an oven at 60 °C for further characterizations and next step reaction. Binary Fe, Co-based carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanowire arrays (Fe0.1Co-CHH) supported on CC substrate was obtained. The synthetic methods of FexCo-CHH (x = 0.05, 0.3, 0.5) with different iron content, Co-CHH and Fe-CHH were the same as above. Nevertheless, the amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was 0.06 g, 0.36 g, 0.60 g for FexCo-CHH respectively, no adding iron source and no adding cobalt source as well as increasing amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O to 0.87 g for Co-CHH and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to 1.2 g for Fe-CHH. 2.1.3 Preparation of Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC The sample was put into the small porcelain boat placed in the lower reaches, and 1.5 g selenium powder was placed in the upper reaches of the large porcelain boat, subsequently, which was heated to 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and held for 1 h under the Argon atmosphere. Finally, nanowires that grew on the CC were completely obtained (denoted as Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC). The loading of Fe0.1-CoSe2 on CC was about 4.93 mg cm-2. The synthetic methods of Fex-CoSe2/CC(X = 0.05, 0.3, 0.5), CoSe2/CC, and FeSe2/CC were the same as that of Fe0.1-CoSe2 in addition to using different CHH precursors. The loading capacity of sample on carbon cloth is 5.00 mg cm-2, 4.92 mg cm-2, 4.85 mg cm-2, 5.03 mg cm-2 and 4.89 mg cm-2 after selenylation, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Miniflex6000, Rigaku) at 40 kV and 15 mA using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.54178 Å). The morphologies of samples were recorded by the Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU-8010), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai F20) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was obtained from TEM. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) results were acquired from an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Scientific) XPS spectrometer with Al Kα as the excitation source (1486.6 eV). The elemental analysis was based on the test of the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Ultima-2). NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Bruker spectrometer. The products generated analyzed using DMSO as the internal standard."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements 2.3.1 GOR and HER tests The electrochemical measurements for GOR and HER were performed in a typical three-electrode system using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation at room temperature. The as-prepared electrodes (0.25 cm2) and a graphite rod was used as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively, and the Hg/HgO electrode for alkaline electrolyte and Ag/AgCl electrode for acidic electrolyte was utilized as the reference electrode. To prepare the Pt/C electrode, the commercial Pt/C (20 %) ink was prepared by dispersing 5.0 mg catalysts into a mixture of 50 μL Nafion, 150 μL isopropanol and 300 μL deionized water under ultrasonic agitation at least 30 min, then 50 μL of the ink was coated on CC, the Pt/C/CC electrodes (denoted as Pt/C 20 %) with catalysts loading of about 2 mg cm−2 were obtained after naturally drying under room temperature. All electrolytes were injected with high pure argon (99.99 %) for at least 30 min before tests to remove the interference of oxygen. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests for GOR were severally performed in 1.0 M KOH solution with a magnetic stirrer. The potential range of electrochemical tests is 0 V to 0.7 V (vs. Hg/HgO). Polarization curves for HER were collected at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. All the potentials measured could be converted to reversible hydrogen electrode according to the formula: E R H E = E H g / H g O + 0.098 + 0.059 × p H in 1 M KOH solution or E R H E = E H g / H g O + 0.098 + 0.059 × p H in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. 2.3.2 Assembly and tests of 3A-EC 3A-EC was investigated in a traditional two-electrode system employing the as-prepared electrodes as cathode and anode simultaneously. The bipolar membrane was used to divide alkaline (1.0 M KOH) anodic chamber and acid (0.5 M H2SO4) cathodic chamber. The LSV curves for alkaline-acid asymmetric electrolytic cell were measured at a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. All electrochemical measurements of the 3A-EC were performed in an inert atmosphere at both chambers without special instructions."
5,Calculation method,"2.4 Calculation method DFT calculations were performed with periodic super-cells under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function for exchange-correlation and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials for nuclei and core electrons. The Kohn-Sham orbitals were expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 30 Ry and the charge-density cutoff of 300 Ry. The Fermi-surface effects has been treated by the smearing technique of Methfessel and Paxton, using a smearing parameter of 0.02 Ry. The Brillouin-zones were sampled with a k-point mesh of 3 × 3×1. The vacuum layer was ∼15 Å to remove the slab interaction in the z direction. The fundamental (100) surface was chosen for both FeSe2 and CoSe2 to represent the exposed surfaces. The atoms of bottom two layers in the model are fixed to simulate support and others were relaxed to simulate the reactive surface of catalysts as shown in Fig. S1. Fe0.1-CoSe2 is made from CoSe2, with the proper fraction of Co replaced by Fe, the probable position of which is identified via a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation, with more detailed given in supporting. The DFT calculations are performed by the PW module contained in the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [24]. Based on this method, ΔG° of the GOR steps were calculated by the Eq. (1) (1) ΔG0 =ΔEDFT + ΔZPE – TS where ΔEDFT is the total energy obtained from DFT calculations, zero-point energy (ZPE), and the entropy (S) of each adsorbed state were calculated by Dmol3, T is the temperature (T =300 K)."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Structure and morphology of catalyst,"3.1 Structure and morphology of catalyst The synthetic route to Fex-CoSe2/CC is schematically presented in Fig. 1 a. First, Fe containing cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanowire arrays (Fe0.1Co-CHH) was in-situ deposited on CC surface through a facile hydrothermal route. The crystalline phase of Fe0.1Co-CHH was proved by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S3). The SEM image in Fig. 1b shows that Fe0.1Co-CHH nanowires were uniformly grown on CC surface with a length of about 3∼4 μm, as further evidenced by SEM images in Fig. S4a–b. Fe0.1Co-CHH was then transformed into Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC through the selenization process [25,26]. As can be seen from Fig. 1c–d, the as-evolved Fe0.1-CoSe2 nanowires are uniformly decorated on CC surface and well maintain one-dimensional morphology. A close look clearly signifies that the Fe0.1-CoSe2 nanowires have a diameter of 70∼100 nm and the length is 3∼4 μm (Fig. 1e). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Fe0.1-CoSe2 (Fig. S4c–d) further confirm the nanowire structure. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1f illustrates the lattice fringe spacing of 2.62 Å corresponding to the (210) crystal plane of cubic phase CoSe2 [27,28], which is also consistent with the crystal plane shown in the selected area electron diffraction (SADE) pattern (inset of Fig. 1f). Additionally, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis indicates that different elements are evenly distributed over the selected area for the Fe0.1-CoSe2 (Fig. 1g). Obviously, Fe element uniformly distributes throughout the whole nanowire with a relatively low density. For comparison, we also synthesized a series of electrodes through the same route but with different ratios of Co source and Fe source, including CoSe2/CC, FeSe2/CC, and Fex-CoSe2/CC (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5). It should be pointed out the the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC has a similar XRD pattern to the CoSe2/CC (Fig. 2 a), indicating negligible changes of the crystalline structures after the introduction of Fe [29]. The set of characteristic peaks can be well indexed to the crystalline planes of cubic phase CoSe2 (JCPDS No. 09-0234) [30]. The broad peak at around 25.6° is indexed to the (002) reflections of the CC substrate [31]. With increasing iron ratio, no extra diffraction peaks can be observed, implying that partial substitution of Co with Fe has no effect on the crystal phase of CoSe2 likely due to similarity of atomic sizes between Fe and Co (Fig. S5) [32]. The Fe/Co atomic ratios of the FexCoSe2/CC were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), and the results shows that the ratio of Fe/Co in each sample was similar to that of the reaction precursors (Table S1). Fig. 2b presents the Raman spectra for FeSe2/CC, Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC, and CoSe2/CC. The peak at around 190 cm−1 for CoSe2 and the peak at around 194 cm−1 for FeSe2 could be attributed to the Ag stretching mode of Se-Se bonding. In Fe0.1-CoSe2 catalyst, Ag mode of vibration appears at around 192 cm−1. This suggests that Fe-doping lowers the frequency of vibration [33,34], which is consistent with the previous results [35]. The surface compositions and valence states of the Fe0.1-CoSe2 were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As presented in Fig. 2c, the survey XPS spectrum of Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC verified the existence of C, O, Fe, Co and Se species. Fig. 2d shows the high resolution Co 2p spectrum for Fe0.1-CoSe2, in which the binding energies at 778.4 and 793.5 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 for CoSe2, respectively [36–38]. While the peaks at 780.5 and 797.1 eV account for surface oxidized cobalt [39,40]. In addition, the Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2e) is fitted with two spin orbit peaks at 711.6 and 720.2 eV for the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, verifying the existence of FeII. While the second doublet at 714.3 and 724.4 eV with a shake-up satellite (716.8 and 733.3 eV) is assigned to the FeIII [41–44]. Notably, no characteristic peak of FeSe2 appeared in the Fe 2p spectrum, manifesting that a ternary Fe-CoSe2 is formed [45,46]. High resolution XPS spectra of Se 3d is shown in Fig. 2f, the two peaks at 54.6 eV and 55.5 eV correspond to the binding energies of Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively, which are also consistent with metal-selenium [47]. The two peaks at 58.4 and 61.5 eV was assigned to SeOx bonding structures at the surface [48]."
8,Electrocatalytic activity and stability for GOR,"3.2 Electrocatalytic activity and stability for GOR The electrocatalytic properties toward GOR were studied in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with or without 0.5 M glucose using a traditional three-electrode system. Fig. 3 a records the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves on the set of electrodes. The Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC shows an onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M glucose, which is much lower than that (1.65 V vs. RHE) for OER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte without glucose, indicating that Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC shows more favorable upon catalysis of GOR, as evidenced by a remarkably negatively shifted overpotential and an increased current density. The other electrodes, including CoSe2/CC, FeSe2/CC and Fex-CoSe2/CC (x = 0.05, 0.3, 0.5) were also tested in electrolytes of 1.0 M KOH with addition of 0.5 M glucose. One can observe Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC manifests the highest current density among these electrodes (Fig. S6a), which may be related to the improved electrocatalytic active surface areas and lower impedance of the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC. Moreover, no bubbles can be seen at anode when glucose was added to the anode electrolyte, implying that GOR is a priority reaction over OER. Fig. 3b presents a mutil-step chronopotentiometric curve for Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC at 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M glucose. The potential immediately levels off at 1.12 V and remains stable for the rest 200 s. All current densities also show similar stable trends, demonstrating the excellent mass transport properties the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode [49,50]. In addition, the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) at the solid/liquid interface of all electrodes were measured to assess the electrocatalytic active surface areas (Fig. S7a–f), which illustrates that the Cdl of Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode is 32.85 m F cm−2, this value is much higher than that of the other electrodes (Fig. 3c, Fig. S7g), indicating that Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC has the most exposed active sites [51,52]. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at the overpotential of 250 mV to explore the catalytic kinetics in the GOR process. As the show in the Fig. S7h, the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC has a smaller series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) than the other electrodes, indicating good electrocatalytic activity [53]. The stability of one catalyst is also a significant indicator to evaluate its catalytic performance, which was verified by a chronopotentiometric running at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. An applied potential of ∼1.15 V was kept under magnetic agitation after 8 h electrolysis (Fig. 3e). However, we found that the potential value is actually increasing gradually by careful observation, which may be related to the consumption of glucose [54]. Furthermore, the XRD patterns and morphology of the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC almost show no change after the durability test (Fig. S8, Fig. 3d), implying the superior stability of the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode in 1.0 M KOH solution."
9,Electrocatalytic activity and stability for HER,"3.3 Electrocatalytic activity and stability for HER We further study the electrocatalytic properties of the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode toward HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC only demands an overpotential of 270 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is superior to those of the CoSe2/CC, the FeSe2/CC, and the FeX-CoSe2/CC with different iron content (Fig. 4 a, Fig. S9). To gain insights into the high activity for HER, the Tafel slopes were plotted, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC exhibits a small Tafel slope (40.0 mV dec-1) relatively to the other electrodes, indicating the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC proceeds fast kinetics towards HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution [55,56]. To gain further insight into the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, the double layer capacitance (Cdl) was calculated to estimate electrochemical surface areas based on CV scanning in 0.5 M H2SO4 ranging from 0.1 V to 0.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. S10a–f). The current density differences (Δj = ja-jc, where ja and jc are the anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively) were plotted against the scan rate (Fig. 4c, Fig. S10g). Compared to other catalysts, the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC displays the highest Cdl of 59.98 m F cm-2, suggesting more active sites and its higher activity in acid [57]. Furthermore, we also assessed the durability through the chronopotentiometric operation for 20 h, during which Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode maintains a constant voltage at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. After 20 h of stability test in 0.5 M H2SO4, the LSV curve of Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC is almost overlapped with the initial curve (Fig. 4e). In addition, we performed XRD test and SEM image on the electrode material after a 20 -hs stability tests (Fig. S11), the crystalline structure of the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC is basically consistent with the standard card, and the nanowire array structure doesn’t change (Fig. 4d), further proving that Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC possesses excellent catalytic stability for HER."
10,Performance of the 3A-EC,"3.4 Performance of the 3A-EC The Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC electrode, thanks to its unique one-dimensional array structure and optimal electronic structure, showed satisfactory catalytic performance not only for GOR in alkaline but also toward HER in acid, which motivated us to design an alkaline-acid asymmetric electrochemical cell (3A-EC) for energy-saving hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 5 a, a bipolar membrane (BPM) is used to separate the anolyte and the catholyte. Fig. 5b display the LSV curves for the 3A-EC with 1.0 M KOH in absence and presence of 0.5 M glucose as anolyte and 0.5 M H2SO4 as catholyte. As expected, the 3A-EC without glucose in anode requires an applied cell voltage of 1.34 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the applied voltage required is much lower than the conventional alkaline electrolyzer or proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, indicating that the pH difference between the anode and cathode can effectively decrease energy for water electrolysis [58,59]. Impressively, after adding 0.5 M glucose in the anode, the applied voltage can be further reduced to 0.72 V to reach an electrolysis current density of 10 mA cm−2, confirming a significant decrease in energy consumption with the assistance of GOR. The decrease in both the applied voltage and the required energy for H2 production also highlights the advantages of the as-designed 3A-EC over the traditional electrolyzers (Table S2). In other words, we propose a new tri-profitable strategy to develop an alkaline-acid asymmetric electrolytic cell (3A-EC), in which energy can be remarkably decreased, and simultaneously produced value-added products of gluconate and H2. The cell voltage of the 3A-EC with or without glucose at different current densities is visually shown in Fig. 5c, demonstrating glucose contributes significantly to reduce the applied voltage. Notably, the 3A-EC using the bare CC as both anode and cathode requires a cell voltage of 1.90 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which further indicates that Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC has a high catalytic activity for glucose oxidation and hydrogen production (Fig. S12). In order to further study the effect of pH change (ΔpH) on GOR-assisted hydrogen production, LSV measurements was performed in a two-electrode system using Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC as electrode (Fig. S13a), signifying that pH difference between anolyte and catholyte play a key role in affecting the electric energy demanded. Fig. S13b summarizes the cell voltage required to drive an electrolytic current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the 3A-EC with different ΔpH. Obviously, the asymmetric electrolytic cell with ΔpH of around 14 need the smallest applied voltage, while the further increase of ΔpH likely induce an enhanced applied voltage, majorly due to the kinetic limitations of mass transport at high concentrations [60]. The stability of the 3A-EC was examined by chronopotentiometric testing at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). It is observed that the voltage increases gradually in each cycle. However, the applied voltage required can be recovered when refreshing both anolyte and catholyte, Therefore, the pH value of the electrode solution on both chambers was recorded (Fig. S14). As predicted, the ΔpH values of the two chambers gradually changed with the passage of time. All these results indicate continuously consumption of OH- and glucose in anode chamber and H+ in cathode chamber [58,61]. A reproducible cycle of voltage is obtained upon 5-cycle operation within about 30 h, indicating the as-proposed 3A-EC is capable of producing H2 and gluconate upon long-term operation. In addition, to monitor the hydrogen production efficiency during electrolysis in 3A-EC, H2 produced in the cathode chamber was collected by means of drainage. As can be clearly seen from the Fig. S15a–b, the color of the anolyte gradually becomes dark yellow as the electrolysis goes on, which further indicates that glucose has been oxidized into gluconate. Notably, there is no gas release in the anode chamber during Faraday efficiency test (Fig. 5f), which evidently proves that the Fe0.1-CoSe2/CC show high selectivity toward catalysis of GOR relatively OER, thanks to its much lower overpotential of the former reaction over the latter one. The measured hydrogen production was basically consistent with the calculated production (Fig. 5e), implying a high Faradic efficiency (FE) for H2 generation of over 99 %. 1H NMR spectrometry was employed to detect the products in anode chamber upon continuous running, as show in Fig. S16. For the electrolyte before catalysis reaction, one can see the peaks in the range between 2.8–4.0 ppm attribute to glucose, while the emerging peaks in anolyte after one-hour electrolysis in the region between 3.75–4.75 ppm was attributed to gluconate with a FE of around 86.7 %, indicating that glucose was converted into gluconate at anode."
11,Density functional theory calculations,"3.5 Density functional theory calculations DFT calculations were performed to gain a mechanical insight of Fe0.1-CoSe2 based HER and GOR. The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model suggested by Nørskov et al. was introduced in the calculation of the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) in all of step [62]. The optimized structures were shown in Fig. S17a–b, where the most probable position of dilute Fe in Fe0.1-CoSe2 is identified to be in the third layer (Fig. S17c) via a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation (detailed in SI). We thus applied the ""detective pin"" method to study the active sites of CoSe2, FeSe2 and Fe0.1-CoSe2; the results show that the “Co” in Fex-CoSe2 are the major active sites toward acidic HER and alkaline GOR, and the Fe0.1-CoSe2 shows the optimal structures and properties for HER and GOR, which offers an appropriate Fe-doping for modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst with a favorable affinity for the intermediates of HER and GOR [34,63], as shown in Figs. S19 and S20, respectively, resulting in the increased catalytic activity toward both HER and GOR. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the ΔG°H* (standard adsorption Gibbs energy of the adsorbed H) at active sites in the Fe0.1-CoSe2 is more neutral, suggesting the more advanced HER activity achieved by the introduction of dilute Fe in CoSe2. On the other hand, the Fe0.1-CoSe2 is also found to have superior performance for GOR than CoSe2, indicated by the ∼0.04 eV’s lower in thermodynamic barrier for the rate-limiting step, i.e., the first step in the free energy diagram in Fig. 6b."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we developed an alkali-acid asymmetric electrochemical cell (3A-EC) that implement the feasibility of producing gluconate and H2 in an energy-saving and cost-effective way. For this purpose, we fabricated a self-supporting bifunctional electrode by in-situ growing Fe0.1-CoSe2 nanowires on carbon cloth, which showed high catalytic performance for GOR in alkaline anolyte and for HER in acidic catholyte in terms of selectivity, activity, and stability. We demonstrate the 3A-EC can efficiently harvest two kinds of energies, i.e. electrochemical neutralization energy and electrochemical glucose oxidation energy, to assist electrolytic hydrogen production. This merit endows our strategy and device with promising in application for energy-saving electrochemical synthesis, and may open up a new venue to a variety of energy system."
