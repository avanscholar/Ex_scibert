0,Introduction:,"Noble metal nanoparticles had an increased attention over the last decade and still fascinating the researcher to greater extent due to their unique photochemical properties [1–7]. In particular the gold nanoparticles have been unique characteristics such as tunable localized surface plasmon resonance enable them wide variety of application such as Förster resonance energy (FRET) sensor, photo-thermal therapy (PTT), catalysis, electronics, and energy storage devices [5–9]. For instance, spherical gold nanoparticles have extensively used in the FRET process because of no dipole moment it can interact with the donor from all faces in the visible region [9]. On the other hand the gold nanorods had been used as the sensor over wide range from visible to near infrared region due to their tunable wavelength spectrum. Moreover, the PTT application of gold nanoparticles is due to the exceptionally high absorption cross-section through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) compared to the bulk gold that result in increase the localized temperature which is essential principle of the cancer treatment process [10]. All these properties are dependent on the size and shape of the nanoparticles, therefore, to control the size and the shape of the gold nanoparticles many methods have been used [11]. For instance, the chemical reduction method in which the gold ions are reduces to gold atoms with the application of suitable reducing agent. Commonly, used reducing agents are NaBH4, hydrazine, and gaseous hydrogen [11–15]. Moreover, green synthesis process has also been developed in which the nature of the reducing agent was mild and the sources of the reducing agents were green plants [16]. Additionally, in a polyol process the reduction of the metal ions to metal were achieved by using the different molecules containing the OH functional group such as ethylene glycol (EG), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [17–20]. The advantage of using a polymer can be in many ways compared to other process; (i) it can reduce the metal ions to metal and (ii) encapsulate them to provide the longer stability. Moreover, encapsulation of the metal nanoparticles minimizes the chance of agglomeration and provides the controlled growth of nanoparticles. The decrease in the agglomeration tendency would increase the industrial scale productions for their commercialization and therapeutic applications. The ease of availability and hydrophilic nature of some polymers such as PVA polymer which is simple to process have been widely used in making polymer nanocomposites [3,4]. Additionally, as for the therapeutic and diagnostic applications there would need of a noble metal nanoparticle suspended in water/encapsulated in hydrophilic biocompatible polymeric film would be advantageous due to their non-hazardous nature. The obtained nanoparticles would not require further the transfer of non-aqueous to aqueous phase and can be directly used for biological application. In this work, we report the synthesis of Au nanoparticles immobilized PVA in the forms of nanocolloids and thin films. Nearly, at 50 °C the aqueous PVA solution reduces the gold ions to gold atoms. Subsequently, the solution was made viscous by heating for longer duration of time. Afterwards, the gold nanocolloids were casted in the form of nanocomposite films and dried in ambient conditions. Later, these films were analyzed with X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, UV–Visible absorption, infra-red absorption and thermo-gravimetric techniques."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly (vinyl alcohol) was purchased from MERCK having the average molecular weight of PVA Mw = 89,000, and Chloroauric Acid was purchased from LOBA Chemie private limited. The entire chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis A simple process is used to prepare gold-PVA nanocomposites. Initially 2 g of PVA solution were dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water in a round bottom flask. Subsequently, the flask was placed in oil bath that was placed on the magnetic stirrer. The temperature was set to 50–55 °C. The temperature 50–55 °C is carefully chosen by looking at the glass transition temperature of PVA under moist condition, which is approximately 42 °C [21]. The mixture was stirrered till the solution became clear. Consequently, the solution was cool down to 45–50 °C and then added the calculated amount of chloroauric acid. Subsequently, the mixture was stirrer for 1 h and the solution was taken out at different interval of time. The solution was made more viscous by evaporating the excess water. Later, the viscous solution was casted in the form of thin films. The content of HAuCl4 in the PVA film were varied from 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 wt%. The color changes in the nano-colloids are shown in Fig. 1 a. It changes from achromatic color to yellow immediately upon addition of chloroauric acid and subsequently, change to light blue after 2 min of addition of chloroauric acid. Consequently, changes to dark blue in 10 min after addition of chloroauric acid and at the end of the reaction (1 h), the solution became purple. The color changes in the nano-colloids were independent of the Au-content in the solution. However, the colour changes were observed in the Au-PVA composites films as shown in Fig. 2 b. The color appears light brown for 0.2 wt% Au, purple for 0.5 wt% Au and dark purple for 1.5 wt% Au in the PVA film. The Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation of interaction between PVA and water molecules through hydrogen bonding. The phase and structure analysis of Au-PVA nanocomposites films were studied using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with a filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm, 40 kV and 30 mA) over 2θ range of 10–90°. The morphology and surface topology of Au-PVA nanocomposite were studied with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) model FEI-Apreo S. Vibrational analysis were done with the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, JASCO FTIR-4200). The FTIR spectra were collected over the range of wavenumber from 4000 to 650 cm−1 during 64 scans, with 2 cm−1 resolution. UV–Visible analysis was done with UV–visible spectrometer of Ocean Optics, Inc. Model-SD 2000. The TGA measurements were done in a nitrogen atmosphere with a thermal analyzer of Perkin-Elmer model DT-40."
4,Formation of gold nanoparticles,"The formations of the gold nanoparticles were took place via reduction of gold ions with PVA polymer between 50 and 55 °C. The colour change of solution from yellow to purple is strong evidence of reduction of gold ions to gold atoms and subsequently to gold nanoparticles. During the reaction of the PVA with gold nanoparticles, the secondary alcohol groups of PVA were most likely converting to ketone group. This work is further, supported by our previous work [2,4] and strengthen our previous findings because in the current process the charring effect of PVA (due the combustion of PVA in direct contact with hot plate) is completely ruled out: (i) due to lower temperature preparation and (ii) use of oil bath to provide the uniform heating. Due to the uniform heating, compare to the hot plate process it can provide the better control on the size of nanoparticles."
5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction analysis,"4.1 X-ray diffraction analysis Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of pure PVA, 0.2 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt% and 1.5 wt% Au-PVA nanocomposites films. PVA sample does not shows any relative peak intensity between 2θ = 30–90°. Nevertheless, the PVA have shown the peak at lower angle, usually below 2θ = 30° [3]. As it is clear from Fig. 4 the semi-crystalline peak of PVA is centered at 20°. The relative intensities of the peaks increase with the increasing Au-content in the PVA films which suggest the increased crystallinity or order of the polymer molecules. That is obvious as the two layers of the polymer chains can be adsorb on nanoparticles surfaces which can provide slightly more order compared to pure PVA films. All the compositions of Au-PVA nanocomposites film shown in Fig. 3, illustrate the pick at 2θ = 38.14, 44.24, 64.52, 77.50, 81.66 corresponds to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) crystal planes. These peaks reveal the face centered cubic structure of gold nanoparticles which are identical with those reported for the standard gold metal (Au0) (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards-JCPDS, File No. 4–0784) [22]. The average crystallite size for 1.5 wt% Au content in PVA was 22.0 ± 0.8 nm as calculated by applying the Scherrer equation given below [23] t = 0.9 λ / β c o s θ where t is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, β is full width at half maxima (fwhm), and θ is the Bragg angle. The lattice parameter of gold nanoparticles is a = 0.4080 nm agrees well with the reported bulk value of gold crystal which is a = 0.4079 nm. The calculated density of Au nanoparticles in as-prepared nanocomposites is 19.28 g/cm3, which are close to the value of bulk Au crystals (19.28 g/cm3). There is no diffraction peaks observed due to any unwanted impurity present in the samples."
7,SEM and EDX analysis,"4.2 SEM and EDX analysis The SEM images of the gold nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5a shows the SEM image of pure PVA film and Fig. 5b shows 1.5 wt% Au nanoparticles encapsulated in the PVA films. The pure PVA film shows layered features in SEM image, while the Au nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA film appears whitish contrast compared to the PVA film. The higher magnification image is shown in Fig. 6 a and the enlarge view of it is shown in Fig. 6b. As the size calculated from the SEM images suggests the size of the nanoparticles were between 25 and 30 nm. The shapes of the nanoparticles were varied from nearly spherical to slightly elongated and triangle shaped Fig. 6b. Additionally, we do not see any sign of aggregations in the SEM images suggesting the uniform distribution of gold nanoparticles over the PVA matrix. The EDX spectra of pure PVA film and gold nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA film are shown in Fig. 7 A and B respectively. The EDX analysis of the 1.5 wt% gold nanoparticles encapsulated PVA sample clearly shows the presence of the gold peaks while the pure PVA film do shows only the presence of carbon and oxygen in spectrum. These results further support the gold nanoparticles formation."
8,UV–visible analysis of gold nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA films,"4.3 UV–visible analysis of gold nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA films The UV–visible spectra of gold nanoparticles encapsulated in the PVA films are shown in Fig. 8 on the scale of 200–700 nm. Our observations suggest two regions of absorption in nanocomposites films of gold encapsulated in PVA (as shown in Table 1 ). The Table 1 shows the band positions in two regions and compares their relative intensities. The first is below 400 nm and other is above 400 nm as it also evident in spectrum. The pure PVA film shows very weak absorption band at nearly 210 nm. Nevertheless, the 0.2 wt% Au nanoparticles encapsulated in the PVA film shows a sharp SPR band of the gold nanoparticles at 554 nm [22]. Furthermore, with increase in the gold nanoparticles up to 0.5 wt% in the PVA film the SPR band remains nearly at the same position. Nevertheless, in the case of the 1.0 wt% content in the PVA film SPR band is observed at 560 nm. Additionally, with the increasing content of the gold nanoparticles in the film the peak width at fwhm increased and the peak show the small red-shift in the absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. 9 . These results are in agreement with the Mie theory which tells that red-shift observed as the size of particles increases that is obvious with increasing gold content in PVA [24, 25]. However, the 1.5 wt% Au content in the PVA film shows very weak absorption at 565 nm which could be due to the saturation in the absorbance. Nevertheless, the PVA region peak intensity increased 32 times compared to the intensity of the SPR of gold nanoparticles. Though, for all other composition the intensity of the PVA peak is 0.9 times of the gold peaks. Therefore, it is speculated that the gold is acting as donor to PVA as the peak intensity of the peak in the PVA region increased in all the cases compare to the pure PVA film. Furthermore, we also study the UV–visible absorbance of gold nanoparticles encapsulated in the PVA films after annealing at 150 °C for 1 h, the results are shown in Fig. 10 . In our observation and as it can be seen in the figure the SPR peaks were red-shifted by approximately between 1 and 2 nm which suggest that the PVA is able to retain the SPR peaks till 150 °C. Therefore the results suggest that it can be used as sensor as high as 150 °C in the form of the polymer nanocomposites films."
9,Infrared analysis,"4.4 Infrared analysis Vibrational analysis of the gold encapsulated PVA films of the thickness ~ 1 mm was analyzed by FTIR technique as shown in Fig. 11 . Pure PVA film shows the characteristic absorption bands at 1730, 2970, and 2947 cm−1 ascribed to the ester carbonyl stretching, symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the CH, respectively [26–28]. Additionally, broad peak observed for the OH stretching between 3000 and 3500 cm−1 centered at 3380 cm−1 [19]. It is evident on comparing the spectra of pure PVA and gold encapsulated PVA nanoparticles that after oxidation, the intensity of the broad O-H stretching slight decreases and the CO stretching band at ~1730 which was originally assigned to the ester carbonyl in the PVA, shows slight increases which is due to the partial contribution of the aldehyde carbonyl stretching to the ester carbonyl contribution in the same region [20]. All the other peaks in the absorption spectra are very much at same position for PVA and the PVA encapsulated gold nanoparticles."
10,Thermal analysis,"4.5 Thermal analysis TG curves are shown in Fig. 12 , represent the weight losses of Au-PVA nanocomposites films as a function of temperature together with the thermogram of pure PVA film measured under nitrogen atmosphere. The initial weight loss between 100 and 150 °C is due to the removal of water content from the samples. However, the major weight losses are observed in the range of 250–500 °C for the nanocomposites films which is most likely due the structural disintegration of the polymer chains. Additionally, the thermal breakdown of the Au-PVA nanocomposite films shows the small shift toward the higher temperature in comparison to the pure PVA film [28,29]. The reason of the increase in the stability of the Au-PVA nanocomposites is the physical adsorption of the PVA on the gold nanoparticles surface and the gold nanoparticles surface increases the applied heat transfer more effectively compare to pure PVA film because the gold nanoparticles are better conductor as compared to PVA film. The maximum thermal stability is observed in the case of 1.5 wt% Au-content in PVA, which is stable up to 355 °C while the stability of the pure PVA film is only up to 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 12. The greater stability of 1.5 wt% Au-content in PVA sample compare to other Au-PVA nanocomposites films is due the higher content of the Au in PVA that provides larger overall adsorption surface area and provide more effective heat transfer. Moreover, above 500 °C, all curves become nearly flattened and the residual inorganic content was highest for 1.5 wt% Au-content in PVA approximately 10% while it was nearly 0% for the pure PVA sample."
11,Conclusions,"In this paper, we had reported the direct synthesis of water dispersed gold nanoparticles encapsulated in PVA. The synthesis was carried in round bottom flask at 50–55 °C by drop-wise addition of aqueous HAuCl4 to aqueous PVA solution, which resulted in Au-PVA nanocomposites structure in forms of nanocolloids and nanocomposites films. The PVA polymer was acted as reducer to gold ions to gold metals and as a capping agent. The XRD patterns suggested fcc crystal structure of the gold nanocomposites which was further supported by the SPR band of the gold nanoparticles which was at ~ 550 nm. Additionally, upon annealing the film at 150 °C the nanocomposites retained the SPR band that would be useful for the thermal sensing application at high temperature. Moreover, the TGA analysis suggested that the thermal stability of the films increase with increasing content of gold in the films. The maximum stability was showed by 1.5 wt% Au nanocomposites film which was till 350 °C. This improved thermals stability would be enhanced their application in electronic and automobile industries."
