0,Introduction,"There is an increased interest about biodegradable polymeric materials as a potential alternative to the total or partial substitution of petrochemical-based plastics. The use of biodegradable polymers for packaging offers an alternative for food packaging and a partial solution to the environmental problem due to the accumulation of non-biodegradable polymers [1,2]. Most research efforts on biodegradable polymers for food packaging are focused on renewable raw materials, as proteins and polysaccharides, due to their film forming capability, and lipids associated with film forming agents [3,4]. Application of single biopolymers such as starch, chitosan, cellulose and derivatives, to develop new eco-friendly packaging materials are limited because of their mechanical and barrier properties are far from those of synthetic polymers. However, polymer–polymer interactions can improve the final properties of the developed films by mixing biodegradable polymers with different properties and structures [5]. Among polysaccharides, cellulose and chitosan are the first and second most abundant biopolymers on earth, respectively. Their abundant availability is an important feature to focus efforts on investigating alternatives to obtain a biodegradable film with adequate properties. In addition, chitosan and cellulose are important due to their ease of modification and potential applications [6]. Cellulose is an unbranched homopolysaccharide, composed of β-d-glucopyranose units linked by (1 ⟶ 4) glycosidic bonds. The pyranose rings are in the chair conformation 4C1, with the hydroxyl groups in an equatorial position [7]. Due to the abundant inter- and intra-molecular H-bond networks among the cellulose chains and its crystallinity, cellulose is not soluble in usual solvents [8,9]. Many soluble derivatives have been developed from cellulose such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). These cellulose derivatives have been extensively studied as biopolymers for food packaging [3]. On the other hand, the use of cellulose fibers as a reinforcing agent in films based on other biopolymers has been extended. Some studies include cellulose nanofiller in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based film [10–12], chitosan films reinforced with a high content of nanofibrillated cellulose [13], cassava starch reinforced with cellulose fibers [14], cellulose nanowhiskers or nanocrystalline reinforcing chitosan films [15,16], nanocrystalline cellulose reinforcing agar films [17], starch and polyvinyl alcohol films modified with cellulose nanofibers [18] or nanocrystalline cellulose reinforcing alginate-based film [19]. Due to the properties of cellulose, it is interesting to study the use of this natural resource as the basis of biodegradable films. Some solvent systems for cellulose dissolution have been developed, which allow using pure cellulose to obtain films without the need of derivatives. One of the solvent developed is the NaOH/Urea aqueous system. This system needs to be precooled to obtain a clear cellulose solution as the solubility increases at temperature below −12 °C [20]. NaOH/urea system is less expensive and less toxic for the environment than other solvents and it has been considered as an eco-friendly solvent which can readily dissolve cellulose. To obtain a film from cellulose dissolution it is necessary to use coagulants like H2SO4/Na2SO4, Na2SO4, acetic acid or (NH4)2SO4 [9,21–23]. Regenerated cellulose films are made from purified wood or cotton pulp. They are transparent, durable, flexible, non-water soluble and impermeable to O2 and other gasses. Other transparent films such as microfibrillated cellulose film and nanofibrillated cellulose films have emerged as a potential packaging material due to their strong mechanical properties. The main difference of the regenerated cellulose films with microfibrillated or nanofibrillated cellulose films is that regenerated cellulose films are cast from fully dissolved cellulose, whereas films from cellulose fibers are comprised of one-dimensional nanofibers [24]. Chitosan is obtained from chitin. Chitin is a linear polymer of mainly β-(1 → 4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose units and low amounts of β-(1 → 4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-ᴅ-glucopyranose residues. Chitin is found in the exoskeleton of crustaceans, in fungal cell walls and in other biological materials. Chitosan is derived from chitin by deacetylation in an alkaline media. Chitosan is a copolymer consisting of β-(1–4)-2-acetamido-ᴅ-glucose and β-(1–4)-2-amino-ᴅ-glucose units with the latter usually exceeding 60%. Chitosan is soluble in acid conditions (i.e. acetic or lactic acid). Chitosan films have a selective permeability to gasses (CO2 and O2) and good mechanical properties [25]. The well-documented antimicrobial properties [26–28] have increased the interest of using the chitosan as a raw material to develop biodegradable films intended for food packaging. Other copolymer that could be used with cellulose and chitosan due to the good mechanical properties is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA is a semicrystalline polymer extensively studied, soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, and insoluble in other organic solvents. PVA is suitable for combination with other polymer to increase the physical, thermal and barrier properties due to its biodegradability, high-polar character, good mechanical properties, high-thermal stability and easy processability [11,18,29]. Chitosan has showed excellent association capability with PVA and good results of PVA based films reinforced with cellulose fiber have been reported [10–12]. However, combinations of cellulose, chitosan and PVA have not been reported yet. Considering the interest to develop films based on cellulose, the aim of this study was to obtain biodegradable copolymer films based on cellulose, chitosan and PVA. Polynomial models were used to evaluate the effect of the composition of the blend on the mechanical properties (toughness, burst strength and distance to burst), water adsorption properties. Besides, microstructure, light-barrier properties, transparency, structure and thermal analyses of the developed films were evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,"Extra pure cellulose microcrystalline, (average particle size 90 μm), urea (99.5%) for analysis, sodium hydroxide (98%), extra pure anhydrous sodium bromide (99%) and acetic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium). Polyvinyl alcohol, degree of hydrolysis (calculated on dried substance) ≥ 98% and molecular weight (MW) approx. 30,000, was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Chitosan (Mw 100,000–300,000) was purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium)."
2,Preparation of films,"2.1 Preparation of films Films were elaborated according to a modified NaOH/urea method [21]. Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of the process. Transparent solutions of cellulose were obtained by the NaOH/urea dissolution method [21]. A 500 mL of NaOH/urea/H2O solution (7:14:79, w/w) was used for preparing each run with a desired amount of cellulose. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The cellulose suspension was frozen at −20 °C for 24 h. Then thawed at room temperature with vigorously agitation for 1 h. A transparent solution with the cellulose completely dissolved was obtained (Fig. 2 ). A defined volume was cast on Petri dish to a 0.5 mm thick layer, and then immersed in a coagulation bath of acetic acid 4% (v/v) to regenerate. The resulting films were washed using running distilled water until a pH = 7. Then, regenerated cellulose films were immersed in a bath with defined concentrations of chitosan and PVA for 1 h. Finally, the wet cellulose-chitosan-PVA films were dried at room temperature for 2 days. The dried films were peeled, and samples were cut to a specific size for each test. The samples were stored in desiccators for 5 days at 51% or 0% relative humidity (RH) as needed for the tests."
3,Film thickness measurement,"2.2 Film thickness measurement Thickness (mm) of films was measured using a Thickness Meter ET115S (Etari GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). The thickness was measured at 5 random locations of each film and mean values were reported. The thickness of the films was measured prior to characterization tests."
4,Mechanical properties,"2.3 Mechanical properties Mechanical tests of cellulose films were performed at room temperature using a texturometer TA-XTplus and software Exponent version 6.1.12.0 (Stable Micro System, UK). Toughness (MPa) was measured following the standard method D-882 (ASTM), with some modifications. An initial grip separation of 40 mm and crosshead speed of 4 mm/s were set up. Ten samples of 15 mm × 100 mm, were cut from each film formulation and stored in desiccators at 51% RH for 5 days, to ensure stable moisture content. The films were fixed at both ends and the strength was measured in tension mode. Toughness or tensile energy to break is one important mechanical property in polymeric materials. The toughness is the capability of a material to absorb energy during deformation up to fracture [30]. According to this definition, toughness encompasses the energy required both to create the crack and to enable the crack to propagate until fracture [31]. Toughness (T) was calculated from the stress-strain plot, as the area under the curve per specimen volume, following Eq. 1. (1) T = Energy Volumen = ∫ 0 εf σ dε where εf is the maximum strain, σ is the maximum stress before rupturing and dε is the derivative as a function of the strain. On the other hand, puncture strength of films is a useful parameter to evaluate the mechanical strength of the film. Films should have good uniaxial mechanical properties in order to maintain the film integrity during transportation, handling and storage of packed product with protuberances. It is expected that films with higher strength will have better mechanical properties [32,33]. Puncture test was performed to determine burst strength (BS) and distance to burst (DB), also denominated puncture force and puncture deformation, respectively. Four squared samples of each film (30 mm each side) were stored in desiccators at 51% RH for 5 days. The samples were fixed on a film support rig (HDP/FSR) and submitted to perforation by a cylindrical probe (d = 3 mm), moving at 60 mm/min until rupture. Curves of force (g) as a function of deformation (mm) were recorded. Maximun force of the peak was recorded as BS and distance to the peak was recorded as BD."
5,Water adsorption,2.4 Water adsorption Water adsorption was determined by the gravimetric method. Three samples of each film were cut into 3 × 3 cm squares and stored in desiccators with silica gel for 5 days. Dry samples were weighed. Each sample was immersed in a closed container with 100 ml of distilled water and stored at 20 °C for 24 h to allow samples reaching equilibrium. Then the excess surface water was removed from the swollen films with aid of filter paper. Wet film samples were weighed and moisture content (%W) of films was calculated using Eq. 2. (2) % W = W wet − W dry / W dry · 100 where Wwet is the wet weight and Wdry is the dried weight. Each test was performed by triplicate [34].
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Films were fixed on slides with adhesive carbon tape, metalized with Au, observed and photographed with a high-vacuum microscope (JEOL JSM-6360LV, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV."
7,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"2.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR spectra of the films were recorded with FT-IR ABB Bomen 102 (ABB Ltd., Zurich Switzerland) equipped with a Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance (UATR) accessory SPECAC Golden Gate with diamond crystal was used to collect the FTIR spectra of the films. Samples were conditioned at relative humidity of 65 ± 2% and 21 ± 1 °C for at least 48 h prior to the test. FTIR spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 over the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1."
8,Light barrier properties and transparency,"2.7 Light barrier properties and transparency A spectrophotometer V-670 (Jasco Inc., Japan) was used to analyse the ultraviolet and visible light barrier properties of the film, using transmittance mode at 2 nm intervals in UV-VIS-NIR regions (190 nm–2500 nm). The transparency of the films was calculated from the percent transmittance of light at 600 nm, following the Eq. 3 (Han & Floros, 1997): (3) Transparency = log % T 600 / x where %T600 is the percent transmittance at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). The test was done in duplicate for each sample."
9,Thermal analysis,"2.8 Thermal analysis A differential scanning calorimeter was preformed to examine the thermal properties of cellulose films with chitosan and PVA, using a Q1000 equipment (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The samples were conditioned in hermetic aluminium pans, with a sample weight around 2–4 mg. The test was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 400 °C, in inner atmosphere of N2 (50 mL/min)."
10,Statistical design and analysis,"2.9 Statistical design and analysis The set of experiments followed a second-order, incomplete, factorial design. Cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol concentration were considered as operational variables (denoted A, B and C, respectively) and their effects on the select dependent variable (T, BS, DB, and %W) were calculated. The set of experiments followed the Box–Behnken design [35]. This design was formed by combining two level factorial designs with incomplete block designs. Table 1 summarizes the experiment design. The statistical analysis was performed using Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cook's distance was applied to detect outliers [36]."
11,Results and discussion,"Biodegradable films were manufactured with cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol at several concentrations following the experimental design showed in Table 1. Cellulose ranged from 3 to 5% (w/w), to obtain a complete dissolution of cellulose using NaOH/urea method. Mixing baths contain chitosan ranged from 0 to 1% (w/w) and PVA ranged from 0 to 4% (w/w). At higher chitosan and PVA concentrations, it was hard to obtain films with an appropriated thickness (40–70 μm) because the bath was too viscous and the thickness of the dried film increased too much. The results of dependent variables (T, BS, DB, and %W) are also showed in Table 1. The relationship between the independent (cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol concentrations) and dependent variables (T, BS, DB, and %W) of the films was described using polynomial models."
12,Effect on toughness (T),"3.1 Effect on toughness (T) Films obtained showed values of toughness in the range from 0.47 to 8.01 MJ/m3. Experimental data fitted well to a two-factor interaction model. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2 . F-value of the model was 4.04 (p-value <0.0366) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.75. The adequate precision measures the signal/noise ratio and it is a statistical parameter used to evaluate the significance of a model. The adequate precision obtained was 6.85, indicating an adequate signal. A ratio higher than 4 is desirable. Observing the F-values of each variable, it is possible to analyse the effect of the parameter on the dependent variables. Therefore, the evaluation of F-values of the three variables confirmed that toughness was mainly affected by the interaction chitosan-PVA and the linear effect of chitosan concentration, followed by the linear effect of cellulose and PVA concentrations and the interaction cellulose-chitosan. Finally, the interaction between cellulose and PVA, produced a negligible effect according to the F-value. Eq. 3 predicts the response of toughness (T), considering the range of concentrations established for the variables. (4) T MJ m 3 = 2.52 − 0.09 · Cellulose % − 11.7 · Chitosan % − 0.22 · PVA % + 2.57 · Cellulose % · Chitosan % − 0.09 · Cellulose % · PVA % − 2.13 · Chitosan % · PVA % The response surface describing the effect of the concentration of cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol on T is shown in Fig. 3 . An important effect of PVA on T was observed. In regenerated cellulose films without chitosan and PVA, the variation of T as a function of the cellulose concentration was minimum. This behavior indicates that the increase of cellulose concentration from 3 to 5% was not enough to change the structure of pure cellulose films or to improve the capacity of absorbing energy without fracturing. The variation of T values depended on the chitosan and PVA concentrations. Increasing the concentration of one of the two polymers (chitosan or PVA), resulted in a decreased of the T values. This effect was more noticeable at low concentration of cellulose. Probably, at lower cellulose concentrations, interactions between cellulose-chitosan or cellulose-PVA reduced the flexibility, meanwhile at higher cellulose concentrations, the interaction between cellulose chains resulted in lower T values. On the other hand, cellulose films combined with both polymers (chitosan and PVA) manifested a different behavior. T values increased as chitosan and PVA concentrations increased specially to higher PVA concentrations. These results show the important effect of PVA on T values in presence of chitosan (from 0.61 MJ/m3 to 8.01 MJ/m3 at constant cellulose and chitosan concentration). Furthermore, increasing cellulose concentration, in presence of chitosan and PVA, T values increased. PVA and chitosan improved the flexibility and ductility of cellulose films, probably due to the crosslinking between chitosan-PVA which reducing brittleness of the films. Previous researches reported T values ranging from 3.0 to 15.1 MJ/m3 as a function of the polymerization degree in microfibrillated cellulose [37]. Hybrid composite films of nanofibrillated cellulose, cationic hydroxyethylcellulose and glycerol showed T values of 4.9 MJ/m3 and 16.9 MJ/m3 as a function of the formulation [38]. T values reported for PVA and chitosan films were 34.2 MJ/m3 and 16.8 MJ/m3, respectively. In this case, chitosan-PVA blend films manifested a reduction of T values when the chitosan content increased. The authors explained this behavior by the formation of covalent bonds resulting in a more rigid and brittle film [39]. The obtained values in the current study were consistent with the T values of different polymers reported in literature. Furthermore, the obtained values were dominated by the presence of cellulose and improved by the interaction chitosan-PVA."
13,Effect on burst strength (BS),"3.2 Effect on burst strength (BS) Films showed values of BS in the range from 929 to 6291 g. Experimental data fitted well to a two-factor interaction model. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. The F-value for the model was 7.21 (p-value <0.007) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.84, and the adequate precision value was 9.48, indicating an adequate signal. F-values indicated that the linear effect of chitosan and PVA concentrations were the main significant terms, followed by the interaction chitosan-PVA. Then, the interactions cellulose-chitosan and cellulose-PVA, and the linear effect of cellulose concentrations had less effect on the value of BS. Eq. 4 predicts the response of burst strength using the real values for the components of the mixture. (5) BS g = 910 + 242 · Cellulose % − 4982 · Chitosan % + 560 · PVA % + 1183 · Cellulose % · Chitosan % − 168 · Cellulose % · PVA % + 1116 · Chitosan % · PVA % The surface response obtained after evaluating the effect of the concentration of cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol on burst strength of films is shown in Fig. 4 . BS values of pure regenerated cellulose films had minor variations as a function of cellulose concentration. However, cellulose showed an important effect on BS in presence of chitosan or PVA. Hence, the behavior of the films depended mainly on the combination cellulose-chitosan and cellulose-PVA, or the combination of cellulose with both polymers. Blending cellulose with chitosan, at lower cellulose concentration, BS values decreased slightly when chitosan increased. This behavior changed at high concentration of cellulose, increasing slightly BS values when increasing chitosan concentration. Similar effect is observed when blending cellulose with PVA. Results indicate that the interaction between cellulose-chitosan or cellulose-PVA at high cellulose concentration, improved the resistance to perforation of the films increasing from 1608 to 2138 g. The values were in accordance with those reported for pure chitosan films of 1234 and 1981 g for low and high molecular weight, respectively [33]. Blending cellulose films with chitosan and PVA, increased significantly the BS values. This effect was more noticeable at high cellulose concentration as the films reached values of 6291 g, almost six times higher than the minimum value obtained. The effect of chitosan and PVA was more significant when both polymers were used, probably due to the interaction chitosan-PVA generated new bonds increasing the resistance to puncture. Similar effect of PVA and chitosan has been also observed by other authors. The improved resistance to puncture was previously observed on carboxymethyl cellulose based-films and gelatin based-films with PVA [5,40]. Moreover, chitosan played reinforcement role in kefiran films improving the mechanical properties when the chitosan concentration increased. The authors explained this behavior due the capacity of chitosan to promote hydrogen bonds in the film matrix [41]."
14,Effect on distance to burst (DB),"3.3 Effect on distance to burst (DB) The films showed values of DB from 1.25 to 2.52 mm. Experimental data fitted well to a quadratic model. Experiment 3 was ignored because it was detected as an outlier. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. F-value was 15.6 (p-value <0.009) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.97, and the adequate precision value was 12.3, indicating an adequate signal. F-values indicated that the interaction cellulose-PVA had the highest effect, followed by the interaction chitosan-PVA and the linear effect of chitosan and PVA concentration. The quadratic effect of chitosan and PVA concentration, with the linear effect of cellulose concentration had a lower effect on DB. Finally, cellulose-chitosan interaction and the quadratic effect of cellulose concentration had a negligible effect on DB, according to the F-values obtained. Eq. 5 predicts the response on DB using real values for the components of the mixture. (6) DB mm = 6.85 − 1.96 · Cellulose % − 0.47 · Chitosan % − 1.60 · PVA % + 0.28 · Cellulose % · Chitosan % + 0.34 · Cellulose % · PVA % + 0.32 · Chitosan % · PVA % + 0.16 · Cellulose 2 % − 0.92 · Chitosan 2 % + 0.05 · PVA 2 % The surface response for the effect of concentration of cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol on distance to burst of films is shown in Fig. 5 . The PVA and cellulose concentrations showed the greater effect on DB property. In films containing no chitosan or no PVA, the increase of cellulose resulted in a decrease of DB values suggesting that high cellulose content decreased the mobility of chains resulting in higher resistance to the perpendicular deformation. Blending cellulose with chitosan and PVA changed the behavior. The response was different when the polymers were combined, i.e. cellulose-chitosan, cellulose-PVA or mixing cellulose with both polymers. In cellulose-chitosan based films, DB values depended on the cellulose content. In cellulose films, increasing chitosan concentration, decreased DB values. This effect was more noticeable at lower concentration of cellulose. DB values reported for pure chitosan film was 2 mm [42], in accordance with the resistance values to perpendicular deformation obtained in the current study. Apparently, new interactions between chitosan and cellulose are promoted at high cellulose contents. An improvement of puncture deformation of kefiran films added with PVA has been reported [41]. Kefiran-PVA films showed similar values of DB to those of cellulose-chitosan films found in the current study. In films based on cellulose-PVA, the cellulose concentration modified the resistance to perforation of films. At low cellulose concentrations, DB values decreased when the PVA content increased. At high concentration of cellulose, the DB values increased when the PVA increased. Hence, due to the good extensibility of pure PVA films, a plasticizer effect of PVA was observed on cellulose film, increasing the deformation values [2]. The mechanical puncture deformation was improved in gelatin films when adding PVA [40,43]. The plasticizing effect of PVA on the cellulose film was improved when chitosan was also added."
15,Effect on water adsorption (%W),"3.4 Effect on water adsorption (%W) The %W values of the developed films ranged from 52.30 to 143.56%. Experimental data fitted well to a linear model. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. F-value of model was 12.1 (p-value <0.0008) implying that the model was significant. The r2 value was 0.77, and the adequate precision was 11, indicating an adequate signal. PVA concentration was the main term affecting %W value. Chitosan concentration had a lower linear effect on %W, and the linear effect of cellulose concentration had a negligible effect. Eq. 6 predicts the response of %W. (7) % W = 39.8 + 1.58 · Cellulose % + 32.4 · Chitosan % + 16.5 · PVA % According to the response surface (Fig. 6 ), PVA and chitosan increased the water adsorption, probably due to the hydrophilic nature of these polymers [29,44]. PVA content affected significantly the %W increasing the values from 55.45 to 122.39% when PVA was added at 4%. A value of 260% for water adsorption has been reported for PVA-gelatin films [45], and 110% for starch-PVA films [46]. In absence of PVA, chitosan increased slightly the water adsorption from 55.45 to 84.71%. The effect of chitosan and PVA on water adsorption was higher in presence of both polymers, reaching the maximum value of 143.56%. A value of water adsorption of 195% for pure chitosan films has been reported [16], demonstrating the high hydrophilic character of this polysaccharide. The values obtained in the current study were lower than those values for pure chitosan films because cellulose polymers have a high crystalline structure, inaccessible to water molecules, reducing the hydrophilic character of the developed films. On the other hand, in pure cellulose films, the %W showed a slight increase as a function of cellulose concentration, probably due to the cellulose also have a paracrystalline or amorphous region which is sensitive to water molecules, thus making them hydrophilic. The amorphous region may have increased at higher cellulose contents [24]."
16,Microstructure,"3.5 Microstructure Fig. 2 shows that sample of films obtained were transparent. Pure cellulose films had a smoked colour, but in formulations with PVA films had a translucent and shiny appearance. The surface of the films was analysed through the cross-sections by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of the films obtained in experiments 1, 5 and 6. The selected experiments allowed analyzing the effect of the cellulose and chitosan on the surface at constant PVA concentration. Thickness of the films increased with the increase of chitosan and cellulose concentration. The cross-section of the films allowed to observe a dense and compact structure, besides a laminated structure of cellulose fibers. At a lower concentration of cellulose, a better organization of the cellulose fibers is allowed, leaving less empty voids."
17,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"3.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The interactions between cellulose-chitosan-PVA were analysed by FT-IR measurements. FT-IR spectra of developed films of experiment 2, 4, 11 and 14 are shown in Fig. 8 . The selected samples allow to observe the interaction between the film components at structural level. The FT-IR spectra showed similarities between them. The peak about 3458 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration regions of OH group. This peak became sharpened and displaced to a higher wavenumber with the addition of PVA to pure cellulose films, due to the increase of OH groups and their tendency to form hydrogen bonding that shifted wavenumber. However, in this region between 3600 and 3000 cm−1, films with chitosan in the formulation, have lower peak intensity and they were displaced to a higher wavenumber. The NH peaks also appears in the same range, and these changes indicated a combination withOH group [47]. The vibration bands around 2900 cm−1 are attributed to the aliphatic CH stretching from alkyl groups. The bands for experiment 14 at 2900 cm−1 shifted to high wavenumbers for experiment 4 and 11 as resulted of the interaction between the PVA with CH2 of the cellulose [48]. FT-IR spectra of experiment 2 and 4 have a characteristic peak at 1555 cm−1, corresponding to NH2 deformation vibration, indicating the presence of chitosan [44,47]. It was observed the characteristic peak of cellulose at 1055 cm−1, due to the COC pyranose ring stretching vibrations of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols from the cellulose [49]."
18,Light barrier properties and transparency,"3.7 Light barrier properties and transparency Biodegradable films with good UV-light barriers and an adequate transparency are good for food packing applications. Low transmittance level in the UV range can make such films an excellent UV barrier. Therefore, the developed films could prevent UV light-inducing lipid oxidation when applied on food systems. Lipids oxidation produce undesirable off-flavours, decreasing the shelf-life of the products. Hence, packaging materials against UV light has received a great deal of attention. Furthermore, consumer's preference polymers with high transparency which let to see them the food items [50,51]. The transmittance of light in the range of UV, visible light and near infrared from 190 nm to 2300 nm of selected samples of cellulose-based films is shown in Fig. 9 . The selected samples allowed to observe the effect of chitosan and PVA on the optical properties. Transmission range of UV light is between 100 and 400 nm. In the range 180–400 nm, pure regenerated cellulose films showed transmittance values very low below 8.5%. The presence of chitosan decreased the transmission of UV light below 4.9%. However, PVA increased the UV light transmittance of the films up to 55%. Again, chitosan decreases the transmission, films with chitosan and PVA showed a UV light transmittance up to 29%. On other hand, the transparency values obtained for the experiment 2, 4, 11 and 14 were 11.91, 14.68, 24.50, and 13.94, respectively. PVA increases the transparency of the films and chitosan increases the opacity of the films. The films developed had optimal values of transparency, similar to the values of synthetic polymers [52,53]. In the region corresponding to the near infrared, the absorptions at 1450 and 1950 nm were related to the first overtone of the OH stretch and the combined stretch and deformation of OH groups from glycerol. The absorption at 2260 nm is likely related to a combination of CH and OH stretch overtones from cellulose [54]."
19,Thermal analysis of films,"3.8 Thermal analysis of films It was measured the thermal properties of the films with the formulation corresponding to experiment 2, 4, 11 and 14, to analyse the effect of the chitosan and PVA on the thermal stability of the films. Fig. 10 shows the DSC profiles of the films selected. The first endothermic peak starting at 60 °C, corresponding to the volatilization of water from the films samples [50]. The endothermic peak at about 220 °C in DSC curves of the experiment 4 and 11, corresponds to the thermal degradation of PVA [29]. This peak was larger and sharper for experiment 4, due to the presence of PVA and the interaction chitosan-PVA. The peaks between 250 and 350 °C correspond to the onset temperature of thermal degradation of cellulose [55]. The presence of PVA increased thermal stability of the films, which is attributable to the increased interaction between the plasticizers and cellulose films [22]."
20,Conclusions,"Biodegradable films based on regenerated cellulose reinforced with chitosan and PVA were prepared. Results suggest an adequate interaction of chitosan and PVA when combining both polymers with regenerated cellulose films by immersion. Blending chitosan-PVA enhanced the toughness of the films. This effect was not observed when combining binary formulations of cellulose-chitosan or cellulose-PVA. Burst strength of cellulose films was improved with chitosan and PVA, but the higher values were reached in formulations containing both reinforcing polymers, due to the interactions chitosan-PVA. This effect was more noticeable at high content of cellulose. However, the PVA and cellulose concentrations were the most important parameters to increase the puncture deformation. The percentage of adsorbed water increased up to 143.55% when cellulose films were reinforced with PVA and chitosan. The low transmittance of UV light showed the UV protect properties of cellulose against these radiations to active the processes of lipid oxidation in food. Mixing cellulose with chitosan, improved this protect effect. PVA increases the transmittance values and improves the transparency of the films. FTIR and DSC analysed showed an interaction between the components of the films. Results showed that it is feasible to obtain cellulose-chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol composite films with improved mechanical properties, high capacity to adsorb water, good barrier properties against UV radiations and adequate transparency value. These properties could be useful in potential applications for the food industry as an alternative to synthetic films."
