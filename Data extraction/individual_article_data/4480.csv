0,Introduction,"Recent years have seen significant research attention directed toward the production and application of two-dimensional nanomaterials, including graphene, metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, boron nitride, and so on [1]. Compared to other candidates, superior stability in strong acid/alkali/oxidant conditions and better biocompatibility have made boron nitride nanosheets that hold its own place in fields constituted by multitudinous nanomaterials [2,3]. BN nanosheets have presented enhancement effect in mechanical property and thermal conductivity of diverse materials, such as polymers, ceramics, and metals [4]. In the matter of thermal interface materials, wide energy band gaps make BN become better choice than their carbon counterparts, with much research progresses [5]. For instance, in research work of Zhang et al., the surface of BN nanosheets was functionalized by coating of polydopamine toward better dispersion state. In combination with ordered orientation, highly thermal conductive polyvinylidene fluoride composites were fabricated [6]. As mentioned by Hu et al., partial ionic-bond character of BN bond produces an undesired chemical inertness and sets an obstacle for the exfoliation and surface modification, thus producing weak interfacial interaction between BN nanosheets and polymer matrix [7]. In order to obtain highly-chemical active BN nanosheets, thermal or hydroxide assisted routes were commonly adopted to introduce hydroxyl groups that can enhance its surface activity and serve a functional platform onto the surface of BN nanosheets [8–10]. For example, Cui et al. processed the commercially obtained BN powder at high-temperature followed by hydrolysis [10]. Likewise, hydroxide-assisted ball-milling or sonication also produce a certain amount of hydroxyl onto the surface of BN nanosheets [9]. However, it was frustrating that the amount of introduced hydroxyl was relatively low in these works and no more than 12 wt % [9,11–13]. Therefore, the introduction of hydroxyl groups to achieve a desirable level still maintains a challenge, hindering the potential exploitation of h-BN nanosheets. Especially in the field of polymeric composite materials, the bare surface and undesirable dispersion state of h-BN isn't capable of forming a strong interfacial interaction with polymeric materials, thus limiting its reinforcement effect toward the property of polymer materials [14,15]. As a commercially biocompatible hydrophilic polymer, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been widely used in biomaterial areas, such as medicinal composite membrane, joint prosthesis, and artificial cornea. For meeting the practical requirement, of particular interest is to improve the tensile strength and toughness of PVA while at the same time obtaining better extensibility. The employment of nanotechnology in polymer materials is capable of enhancing their various properties, including flame retardant, thermal stability, and electric conductivity [16–18]. However, the use of nanomaterials for enhancing the mechanical property of PVA doesn't still achieve a desirable result, due to the increased tensile strength and toughness usually comes at the price of ductility [19,20]. What is more, the decreased visible light transmittance usually caused by incorporated nanomaterials also influences the use of PVA, especially in artificial cornea materials. Next, PVA will present a self-stiffness phenomenon during dynamic service process, which is due to the crystallization behavior. This self-stiffness result of PVA will damage the material elasticity, which is significantly harmful to its use in dynamic environment. In the present study, we proposed a scalable one-step calcination synthesis for hydroxylated BN nanosheets by the use of melamine and boric acid as precursor at nitrogen atmosphere. It is anticipated that boric acid will substitute the C atoms of carbon nitride formed during the calcination of melamine, thus producing highly-hydroxylated BN nanosheets. The obtained OH-BN is capable of well dispersing in aqueous phase and form uniform dispersion with PVA. The incorporated OH-BN can effectively improve the tensile strength, toughness and ductility as well as flame retardant of PVA nanocomposite films, meanwhile, the high visible light transmittance was able to be reserved. What's more, the self-stiffness phenomenon that damages the material elasticity during dynamic service process of PVA nanocomposite films was effectively hindered."
1,Experiment,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials Melamine and boric acid were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd. (China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mw = ca. 1950) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The above reagents were directly used without pre-treatment. The solvent used was deionized water."
3,Synthesis of hydroxyl-functionalized boron nitride (OH-BN),"2.2 Synthesis of hydroxyl-functionalized boron nitride (OH-BN) Firstly, 6 g of melamine and 0.9 g of boric acid were dissolved successively in 500 mL of deionized water. Then, the mixed solution was dried at 80 °C to remove all water and continuous stirring was performed. The dried product was slowly heated to 900 °C and keep 3 h under at nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the obtained product was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C."
4,Synthesis of PVA/OH-BN nanocomposite films,"2.3 Synthesis of PVA/OH-BN nanocomposite films Firstly, 10 g of PVA was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water at 95 °C in a three-neck flask with a mild stir. After PVA was dissolved thorough, a certain amount of OH-BN dispersion prepared by sonication in deionized water was slowly added into PVA solution and stirred for 24 h. Then the mixture was cast onto glass plates and dried at 45 °C in an oven for 2 days to form flat films which were peeled off."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were obtained with a Japan Rigaku D/Max-Ra rotating anode X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CuKα tube and Ni filter (λ = 0.1542 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out to research the surface element of as-prepared BN, with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer employing a mono-chromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV), hybrid (magnetic/electrostatic) optics, and a multichannel plate and delay line detector. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was recorded by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Company) range to 4000 cm−1 from 400 cm−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to directly observe the morphology of as-prepared boron nitride with a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Morphologies of fractured appearance of PVA nanocomposite films were also surveyed with a DXS-10 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was executed with a TGA Q5000 IR thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments, U.S.) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The micro-sized combustion behavior of PVA nanocomposite films were performed on a microscale combustion calorimeter. Tensile testing of the composites was performed with an electronic universal testing instrument (MTS System Co., Ltd., China) at a crosshead speed of 20 mm/min."
6,Self-stiffness phenomenon characterization,"2.5 Self-stiffness phenomenon characterization The stiffness of PVA nanocomposite films was recorded by Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA Q800), with a small amplitude of 0.2% and constant temperature of 27 °C as well as a fixed frequency of 10 Hz. The test time of all samples was 3 h, i.e., 108000 cycles. Usually, the traditional DMA test is also performed in fixed frequency. This point is same in modified DMA test. However, the test temperature of traditional DMA test is continuously changed in a fix heat or cooling rate. The test temperature of modified DMA test was set in 37 °C, nearing body temperature. Of course, the obtained data parameter in traditional and modified DMA test are same, including storage modulus, loss modulus, stress, strain, force, as well as stiffness. The obtained stiffness in modified DMA test was used to investigate the self-stiffness phenomenon."
7,Results and discussions,"For obtaining the hydroxyl-functionalized boron nitride nanosheets (OH-BN), the solutions of boric acid and melamine were firstly uniformly blend by the combination of mechanical agitation and sonication. Then the mixture dried at 80 °C was slowly heated to 900 °C for 3 h (Fig. 1 a). The snow-white product was well dispersed in aqueous solution by the sonication process of 10 s (Fig. 1 b and c), which may be due to the hydrogen-bond interaction forming between OH-BN and water molecules. The XRD pattern (Fig. 2 a) of the resultant presents characteristic peaks of OH-BN at 26.4°, 42.8°, and 53.8°, corresponding to 002, 100, and 004 planes, respectively [16]. The disappeared diffraction peaks of boric acid at XRD curve of HO-BN confirmed the successful substitution reaction [21]. During the heating process, melamine was converted to carbon nitride; meanwhile, the B atoms of B(OH)3 will replace the C atoms of carbon nitride to produce OH-BN. The obtained OH-BN presents two typical IR absorption peaks at 1386 cm−1 and 778 cm−1 (Fig. 2b), due to the stretching and bending vibration of BN bond [16]. These two evincive IR characteristic peaks are consistent with the FTIR result of commercial BN. In addition, a weak shoulder peak at ∼3248 cm−1 is found in FTIR spectrum of OH-BN, which is described to N-H stretching vibration. More importantly, OH stretching vibration mode from sp3-hyridized N3B(OH) or N2B(OH)2 units is detected in FTIR curve of OH-BN, presented by a broad absorption peak at 3411 cm−1 [22]. Such obvious evidence toward the abundant presence of OH groups isn't offered in FTIR spectrum of commercial BN. After being characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the content of oxygen in the OH-BN is up to 19.64 at % (Fig. 2c and Table 1 ), much higher than the XPS result of commercial BN (1.74 at %). The chemical environment of B 1s in OH-BN was further investigated by XPS after synthetic reaction (Fig. 2d). It can be observed that sp2-hyridized BN domains still occupy the main proportion up to 82.17% (Table 2 ) [8,21]. Except for sp2-hyridized BN domains, sp3-hyridized BN domains was also found, which is due to the existence of N2B(OH)2 units and N3B(OH) units. Besides, the BET surface areas of as-prepared OH-BN was determined by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The surface area of OH-BN is up to 111.189 m3/g and provides a possible for HO-BN to strongly interact with polymer chains (Fig. 2e). As been observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the as-prepared snow-white OH-BN powders exhibited typical layered structures (Fig. 2f), similar to other 2D nanomaterials, such as graphite, MoS2, and g-C3N4 [23–25]. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) was conducted to analyze the content and distribution of elements. EDS mapping results confirm that all O, N, B species are uniformly distributed over the entire sample area (Fig. 2g). All results confirm that the calcined products are hydroxylated hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets. The light transmittance curves of PVA/OH-BN indicate that incorporated OH-BN still keep well visible light transmittance of PVA films (Fig. 3 a). Even at an addition amount of up to 0.5 wt %, the prepared PVA nanocomposite film still not shelters the bottom pattern (Fig. 3b). Such high visible light transmittance makes PVA nanocomposites feasible in practical application fields. Compared to pure PVA, PVA nanocomposites have a higher absorption to UV lights, making them good candidate materials as artificial cornea that requires good blocking ability to UV wavelengths and well visible light transmittance. When the addition of OH-BN was higher than 1.0 wt %, the visible light transmittance was significantly reduced. These results may be due to high addition of OH-BN cause inevitable stacking. The size scale of the aggregation of OH-BN is much larger than one tenth of the wavelength of visible light, thus the scattering of lights between these two materials is enhanced [26]. The obvious increase in the ductility of PVA nanocomposite films can be directly observed in Fig. 3c (PVA/OH-BN-0.2), with a stretched morphology for tested sample. Due to the material rebound resilience, the stretched scale of PVA is much longer in actual test process. As presented in Fig. 3d and e and Table 3 , incorporated OH-BN dramatically enhances the mechanical property of PVA nanocomposite films. When the addition amount achieves 0.2 wt %, elongation at break, tensile strength, and Young's modulus are simultaneously increased by 109.3%, 73.6%, and 144.4%. As far as we know, such a significant enhancement effect with 0.2 wt % of additional amount in the stiffness and toughness was seldom reported for PVA nanocomposites films [27,28]. It is found that most results improve the tensile strength of PVA film at the cost of decreased ductility. What's more, the increasing tendency of Young's modulus almost coincided with the increasing additional amount. It is noticeable that PVA/OH-BN-4.0 obtained a desirable increase of approximate 988% in Young's modulus, increasing to 1780 MPa from 180 MPa. In view of the service status of PVA used as artificial tissue material is usually dynamic, we designed a simulative scene to investigate the self-stiffen phenomenon in response to dynamic external mechanical stimuli. The stiffness of neat PVA and its nanocomposite films under dynamic compressive loading and 37 °C was recorded by Dynamic Thermomechanical Analysis (DMA). As Fig. 3f and g shows, stiffness curve of pure PVA presents an obvious amplification, increased by 88.2%. Attributing from the crystallization of PVA chains [16]. However, the incorporated OH-BN (0.2 and 0.5 wt%) caused the decreased tendency toward the stiffness improvement of PVA nanocomposite films. The sample with 0.5 wt % OH-BN only presents 33.2% increase in stiffness value in contrast to the initial value. In view of the XRD results of PVA nanocomposite films (Fig. 4 e), it was reasonably speculated that the introduction of OH-BN nanosheets was able to hinder the crystallization process of PVA chains during the dynamic compressive loading, and maintain its initial state. Besides, an important phenomenon was noted that the addition of 4.0 wt % OH-BN presents a larger enhancement tendency than those of PVA/OH-BN-0.2 and PVA/OH-BN-0.5. This phenomenon illustrates, when the additional amount exceeds a critical value, the self-formed hydrogen-bonds interaction between OH-BN and PVA chains exhibited more effective influence on the movement of PVA chains than crystalline-region self-relief effect of OH-BN, further confining the movement of PVA chains and increasing the stiffness value. This result is also consistent with the tensile result of PVA/OH-BN-4.0. The above results confirm that the incorporated OH-BN is capable of hindering the crystallization behavior of PVA chains during its dynamic service process, thus preventing the self-stiffness process and keeping its elasticity for its use in artificial cartilage. In order to investigate the mechanical enhancement mechanism, SEM photographs of fracture surfaces at liquid nitrogen of PVA and its nanocomposite films were directly observed (Fig. 4). The pure PVA film presents a smooth plane (Fig. 4a), contributing to typical brittle fracture [29]. However, incorporated OH-BN led to a remarkable different fracture surfaces that was rougher with increasing amount of OH-BN for PVA nanocomposite films. And PVA/OH-BN-4.0 presents a wave-liked fracture surface which is roughest among them (Fig. 4c). This result demonstrates that OH-BN nanosheets form a strongly interfacial interaction with PVA chains, which may be due to the hydrogen bond interaction [28,30]. FTIR spectra of PVA and its composite films illustrate that the characteristic peak of OH shifts to higher value (Fig. 4d). In particularly, the characteristic peak of OH in PVA/OH-BN-4.0 was moved to 3455 cm−1 from 3413 cm−1 (pure PVA), confirming that hydrogen-bond interactions are self-assembly between hydroxyl groups of both PVA chains and OH-BN [31]. Generally speaking, strong interfacial interaction between nanofillers and PVA matrix would cause a lower elongation at break [32]. In this work, the tensile strength and ductility were simultaneously enhanced. For explaining this desirable result, XRD patterns of PVA and PVA nanocomposite films before and after tensile test were studied (Fig. 4e and f). The slightly lower intensity of diffraction peak originating from PVA crystal confirmed that the addition of OH-BN would decrease the crystallinity of PVA matrix. This phenomenon implied that the increase of the elongation at break may be attributed to the change of the crystallinity of PVA matrix. After tensile test, samples exhibited lower intensity even characteristic peak at 40.76° isn't able to be found. An extremely important phenomenon should be noted that the 4.0 wt % of OH-BN cause a largest drop in intensity of diffraction peak compared to other samples (Fig. 4f), indicating that the high addition of OH-BN contribute to the self-relief of the PVA crystal. As presented in Fig. 4g, these above all analyses indicate that strong hydrogen-bond interactions are capable of being self-assembled between hydroxyl groups of the surface of OH-BN nanosheets and PVA chains, thus producing a higher tensile strength and Young's modulus. When nanocomposite films are stretched, the crystalline chains of PVA are self-relieved by OH-BN and the crooked chains are straightened, thus obtaining the excellent ductility. The enhanced thermal stability produced by the layered structure of OH-BN of PVA and its nanocomposite films under air atmosphere was determined by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) test. From that point of improved char residue and the increased temperature at mass loss (Fig. 5 a and Table 4 ), it can be concluded that the incorporated OH-BN obviously enhance the thermal stability of PVA composite films [33,34]. There is no residual char left in pure PVA film when the test temperature reaches 800 °C. In contrast to pure PVA, the char residue at 800 °C of PVA/OH-BN-4.0 was significantly increased to 8.9 wt % (inset in Fig. 5a). In addition, the temperature at 50 wt % (T50 wt%) weight loss of PVA/OH-BN-4.0 were increased by 33 °C. The microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) was employed to investigate the flame retardancy of PVA nanocomposite films. When the addition was lower than 1.0 wt%, heat release rate (HRR) curves of samples still keep similar shape to pure PVA without obvious reduction in peak value of HRR (Fig. 5b). However, the first process of HRR curve of PVA/OH-BN-1.0 evolved into two peaks at 332.8 °C and 397.1 °C, respectively, indicating the hindered heat release process. The desirable result was obtained in PVA/OH-BN-4.0 nanocomposite film whose the peak value of HRR was decreased by 25.1% and the corresponding temperature at peak value was also increased by 59 °C. The production of thermal degradation gas was detected with Thermogravimetric analysis-infrared spectrometry (TG-IR). As direct observation in 3D TG-IR spectra (Fig. 5c and d), PVA/OH-BN-4.0 present a lower absorption intensity for evolved gaseous products than that of pure PVA. After normalized with the total sample mass, the total absorbance intensity of volatilized products of PVA/OH-BN-4.0 is still obviously lower than that of pure PVA (Fig. 6 a). Especially, the absorption intensity of different types of pyrolysis gas in PVA/OH-BN-4.0 were also visually suppressed (Fig. 6), including aromatic compounds (1510 cm−1), carbonyl (1720 cm−1), and hydrocarbons (2977 cm−1) [24,35,36]. These results demonstrate the incorporated OH-BN reduces the release of toxic gas of PVA nanocomposite film during thermal degradation process. As reported in previous literatures, layered structure of OH-BN presented a barrier function for hindering the transfer between degradation products and heat, thus enhancing the thermal stability and fire safety of PVA nanocomposite films [16,37]."
8,Conclusions,"To sum up, we have successfully improved the mechanical properties and hindered the self-stiffness phenomenon as well as retained transparency of PVA nanocomposite films by incorporating OH-BN nanosheets prepared by one-step thermal calcination. Only adding small amount (0.2 wt %) of OH-BN is capable of significantly improving the tensile strength (73.6%), elongation at break (109.3%), and Young's modulus (144.4%) of PVA due to the self-formation of hydrogen-bonds interaction and self-relief of crystalline-regions. During dynamic service process, the self-stiffness phenomenon that usually causes the decreased elasticity was also retarded. In addition, the well-dispersed state and layered structure of OH-BN nanosheets can also enhanced the flame retardant and thermal stability of PVA via barrier effect. This work opens the door toward the scalable production of OH-BN and the all-around properties improvement of PVA nanocomposite films, thus promoting the development of multifunctional composite materials."
