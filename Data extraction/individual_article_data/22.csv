0,Introduction,"Alkenyl ketones represent a class of important structural units in many natural products and other biologically active compounds [1]. They were also utilized as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, fine chemicals and functional materials [2]. Due to their increasing importance, a number of synthetic methods have been developed over past decades. For example, they were prepared via the coupling of nitriles with alkenyl grignard reagent followed by the hydrolysis (a) [3a], the coupling of aldehydes with alkenyl grignard reagent followed by the hydrolysis and oxidation (b) [3b], the coupling of oxime ethers with alkenyl grignard reagents (c) [3c], the coupling of oxaziridines with alkenyl lithium reagents followed by the hydrolysis (d) [3d], the coupling of keto esters with alkenyl bromides followed by the decarboxylation (e) [3e], the coupling of phosphorus ylides with alkenyl aldehydes followed by the hydrogenation (f) [3f], rhodium-catalyzed the coupling of ketone aldehydes with (trimethylsilyl)diazomethanes (g) [3g], and base-mediated coupling of ketone aldehydes with methyltriphenyliphosphonium bromides (h) [3h] (Scheme 1 ). However, these protocols often suffer from the tedious synthesis of starting materials, the use of expensive and/or harmful reagents, the generation of a large amount of high-molecular-weight by-products and low yields. Therefore, the development of a new strategy for the synthesis of alkenyl ketones with high atom efficiency under environmentally benign conditions is highly desirable. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to the α-alkylation of ketones with alcohols as alkylating agents based on hydrogen auto-transfer process or hydrogen-borrowing strategy [4], using transition metal catalysts, such as Ru [5], Ir [6], Pd [7], Os [8], Fe [9], Co [10], Mn [11] and Ni complexes [12]. In this process, alcohols are initially dehydrogenated to form aldehydes and metal hydride species, followed by a base-mediated cross-aldol condensation between resulting aldehydes and ketones occurred to afford α,β-unsaturated ketones, which could further converted to α-alkylated ketones via transfer hydrogenation by metal hydride species. Such methodology is highly attractive due to high atom efficiency and the formation of water as the only by-product. However, these procedures usually required the presence of strong base (KOH, NaOH, KOtBu, etc.) and focused on the activation of saturated alcohols as alkylating agents. Despite the significant potential, the development of an efficient method for the synthesis of alkenyl ketones via transition metal-catalyzed α-alkylation of ketones with alkenyl alcohols is still extremely challenging and remains unexplored. It may due to the uncertainty of selective transfer hydrogenation in the process of reaction (Scheme 2 ). Recently, Fujita and co-workers have synthesized a series of Cp*Ir complexes bearing a α-hydroxybipyridine or a bipyridonate ligand, exhibiting highly catalytic activity for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols and N-heterocycles [13], and hydrogen production from an alcohol-water solution under basic conditions [14] based on the concept of ligand-promoted dehydrogenation. We have demonstrated that such complexes are highly effective metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen auto-transfer process [15] and acceptorless dehydrogenative cyclization [16]. As part of our continuing interest in this field [15–17], we herein wish to describe our effort towards the α-alkylation of ketones with alkenyl alcohols for the synthesis of alkenyl ketones. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation is also presented."
1,Result and discussion,"To explore the feasibility of above proposal, a series of iridium complexes were chosen as catalysts for the α-alkylation of acetophenone (1a) with 4-penten-1-ol (2a). In the presence of cat. 1–8 and Cs2CO3 (0.3 equiv), the model reaction proceeded in tert-amyl alcohol at 125 °C for 12 h to afford the α-alkylated product 3aa in ≤9% yields (Table 1 , entries 1–8). To our delight, when [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 9), and [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 10) were used as catalysts, the product 3aa could be obtained in 90% and 95% yields, respectively, indicating functional groups on bpy are crucial for the activity of iridium catalysts (Table 1, entries 9–10). Using a rhodium analog [Cp*Rh(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 11) as an alternative catalyst, the product 3aa was obtained in 50% yield (Table 1, entry 11). No reaction occurred when a ruthenium analog [Cp*Ru(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 12) was utilized (Table 1, entry 12). Then, cat. 10 was chosen as the catalyst for further research. Attempts to use K2CO3 or Na2CO3 instead of Cs2CO3, reduce the amount of Cs2CO3, or decrease reaction temperature resulted in none of product or relatively low yields (Table 1, entries 13–16). With definitized reaction conditions in hand, we evaluate the generality of reaction with respect to ketones and the results are presented in Table 2 . The α-alkyaltion of acetophenones bearing a methyl group on ortho-, meta- and para-position, afforded desired products 3ba-3da in 82–89% yields (Table 2, entries 1–3). Similarly, acetophenones possessing an another electron-donating substituent, such as ethyl, isopropyl and methoxy groups, were converted to corresponding products 3ea-3ha in 76–87% yields (Table 2, entries 4–7). Furthermore, α-alkylated products 3ia-3oa could be obtained in 81–91% when halogenated acetophenones were served (Table 2, entries 8–14). A seriously electron-withdrawing trifluoromethoxy group was tolerated as well, and the reaction gave the desired product 3pa in 83% yield (Table 2, entry 15). In the case of 4′-phenylacetophenone and 2′-acetonaphthone, corresponding products 3qa and 3ra were observed in 85% and 79% yields, respectively (Table 2, entries 16–17). The catalytic system was also applied to non-methyl ketone and aliphatic ketone, such as 1-tetralone and 1-cyclopropylethanone, giving desired products 3sa and 3ta in 83% and 81% yields, respectively (Table 2, entries 18–19). Furthermore, the scope of reaction with respect to alkenyl alcohols was investigated (Table 3 ). Transformations with other terminal alkenyl alcohols, such as 5-hexen-1-ol, 9-decen-1-ol and 10-undecen-1-ol, afforded corresponding products 3ab-3ad in 83–87% yields (Table 3, entries 1–3). To our surprise, the catalytic system is comparable with non-terminal alkenyl alcohols, such as (E)-4-hexen-1-ol and 3,7-dimethyl-oct-6-en-1-ol, reactions gave desired products 3ae and 3af in 78% and 80% yields, respectively (Table 3, entries 4–5). More interestingly, the cyclic alkenyl alcohol was also proven to be a suitable substrate and the desired product 3ag was obtained in 75% yield (Table 3, entry 6). To explore the practical application of this catalytic system, the gram-scale α-alkylation of 1a (2.40 g, 20 mmol) with 2a (2.06 g, 24 mmol, 1.2 equiv) under standard conditions was undertaken. The product 3aa could be obtained in 81% yield (Scheme 3 ). On the basis of experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the present iridium-catalyzed α-alkylation of ketones with alkenyl alcohols (Scheme 4 ). The initial step involved the generation of an unsaturated species A through the elimination of H2O from cat. 10. Then, the ligand of species A accepted a proton of alcohols to afford alkoxy iridium species B, which underwent β-hydrogen elimination to give iridium hydride species C and aldehydes [18]. Base-mediated cross-aldol condensation between ketones and resulting aldehydes occurred to afford α,β-unsaturated alkenyl ketones as intermediates. Furthermore, ligand-promoted simultaneous transfer of the hydride on iridium and the proton on OH group to α, β-unsaturated alkenyl ketones resulted in the occurrence of 1,4-hydrogenation [19], and catalytic species A was regenerated and unsaturated enols were released, which were further converted to alkenyl ketones as final products via the tautomerism. To support the proposed mechanism of reaction, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-hepta-2,6-dien-1-one (5) with phenylmethanol (6) as a hydrogen source was investigated (Table 4 ). In the presence of cat. 7 and cat. 8, the reaction proceeded for 12 h and none of product was observed (Table 4, entries 1–2). When cat. 9 and cat. 10 were used as catalysts, the product 3aa was obtained in 89% and 96% yields, respectively (Table 4, entries 3–4). It indicates that functional groups in bpy ligand are crucially important for catalytic transfer hydrogenation. Moreover, apart from 3aa, none of 4aa was produced in this process. Apparently, the formation of alkenyl ketones as products may contributed to the selective 1,4-transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups rather than alkenyl groups. These experimental results strongly supported the proposed mechanism outlined in Scheme 4."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated a simple, general and efficient strategy for the synthesis of alkenyl alcohols via the α-alkylation of ketones with alkenyl alcohols. The iridium-catalyzed reaction is highly attractive because of easily available starting materials, high atom economy and environmental friendliness. Mechanism investigation revealed that functional groups in the ligand are crucial for the activity of catalyst and selective transfer hydrogenation is the determining step of the formation of alkenyl ketones as products. Notably, the present research exhibited the potential of metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts for the activation of unsaturated alcohols as electrophiles for hydrogen auto-transfer process."
