0,Introduction,"Biogas technology is currently being widely applied to several industrial wastewaters and animal wastes (Sirirote et al., 2010). It not only produces combustible biogas, which is widely used to substitute fuel oil for steam generation in industry, but also reduces treatment cost. Several types of industrial wastewaters such as food wastewater (Zhu et al., 2011), cassava wastewater (Wang et al., 2012), and cornstalk waste (Cheng et al., 2012) can be used to produce biogas. Apart from producing the combustible biogas, anaerobic digestion offers several benefits; for example, it can be operated at a high organic loading rate under ambient conditions, which reduces the overall treatment cost, decreases the emission of greenhouse gases, and eliminates odorous problems (Biofuels, Waste Energy, 2008). However, the anaerobic processes require a rather large size of bioreactor because of slow rates. One of innovative techniques for the improvement of biogas production from wastewaters is a use of two-stage processes (Wikimedia Foundation, 2014). The two-stage anaerobic process consists of two sequential steps of hydrogen and methane production units (Zhu et al., 2008). In the first unit, organic compounds in wastewater are hydrolyzed and converted anaerobically to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) by acidogenic bacteria. Next, the effluent liquid from the first unit is continuously fed to the second unit to further produce methane by methanogenic bacteria. The two-stage anaerobic processes can produce a higher methane production rate and yield due to a better balance between the rates of VFA production and consumption as compared to a single process (Xia et al., 2011). Sarada and Joseph (1996) reported that a two-stage anaerobic system operated at a temperature of 30°C, a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24d and an organic loading rate of 4.5kg/m3 d gave 50% increase in the gas production rate and 40% increase in the methane yield when being compared with a single-stage anaerobic process. Liu et al. (2006) reported that the methane production efficiency of a two-stage hydrogen–methane process treating household solid waste increased about 21% when compared with one-stage process. Sarada and Joseph (1996) reported that a toxic level of VFA to methanogens was found to be about 400mg/l in a two-stage system treating tomato processing wastewater. Temperature is another of important factor, affecting the process performance of anaerobic fermentation. A two-stage process operated under thermophilic temperature (55°C) gave a higher biogas production rate than that operated at a low temperature (35–37°C) because under the high temperature, the reaction rate is higher (Xia et al., 2011). Luo et al. (2010) reported that the hydrogen and methane yields in a two-stage thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) of cassava stillage were 55mlH2/g VS and 94mlCH4/g VS, respectively which were higher than those of two-stage mesophilic fermentation process of food waste (Nathao et al., 2013). In this research, spontaneous hydrogen and methane productions from cassava wastewater were investigated by using a two-stage UASB process at a constant high temperature of 55°C. The first hydrogen UASB unit was controlled at a constant pH 5.5. The effluent from the hydrogen bioreactor was further fed to the methane UASB bioreactor to produce methane without pH control. The two-stage UASB unit was operated at different COD loading rates. The recycle ratio of the effluent flow rate from the methane UASB bioreactor to the feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1 in order to minimize the use of NaOH for pH adjustment in the hydrogen UASB unit. It was hypothesized that both hydrogen and methane production efficiency could be maximized by the combination of two-stage process, the pH control at 5.5 for the hydrogen UASB unit, and the effluent recycle operation, under thermophilic operation for both UASB units."
1,Methods,
2,Feed preparation,"2.1 Feed preparation Cassava wastewater used in this study was obtained from Ubon Bioethanol Co., Ltd., Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. It was sieved to remove any large solid particles and kept at 4°C before use. The cassava wastewater used in the present work had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 14,500mg/l and a ratio of COD:nitrogen:phosphorous of 100:2.98:2.03, indicating that the studied cassava wastewater had sufficient amounts of both nutrients for anaerobic degradation (the theoretical ratio of COD:nitrogen:phosphorous is 100:1:0.4 for anaerobic decomposition for biogas production (Intanoo et al., 2012; Sreethawong et al., 2010))."
3,Seed sludge,"2.2 Seed sludge A granular sludge sample taken from the full-scale UASB unit treating cassava wastewater of the same factory was used as seeds for starting up of both studied UASB bioreactors. The seed sludge only for the hydrogen UASB was heated at 95°C for 15min in order to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria and to eliminate methane-producing bacteria (hydrogen-consuming bacteria) (Intanoo et al., 2012; Sreethawong et al., 2010; Poontaweegeratigarn, 2012). The initial microbial concentration in terms of MLVSS (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids) of each UASB bioreactor was about 12,000mg/l."
4,UASB operation,"2.3 UASB operation The UASB reactors used in the study were constructed from borosilicate glass with 4 and 24l working volumes for the hydrogen and methane UASB bioreactors, respectively. The temperatures inside both bioreactors were controlled constant at 55°C by a water jacket surrounding each bioreactor and a circulating/heating bath. The cassava wastewater was fed continuously to the bottom of the hydrogen UASB bioreactor (in an upward direction) at any desired flow rate by using a peristaltic pump to obtain different COD loading rates (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150kg/m3 d based on the feed COD load and hydrogen UASB working volume or 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25kg/m3 d based on the feed COD load and methane UASB working volume). The pH of the hydrogen UASB unit was maintained at 5.5 by using a pH controller. The effluent from the hydrogen UASB unit was directly pumped into the methane UASB unit by a peristaltic pump with a level control probe. The pH of the methane UASB unit was not controlled. In order to minimize the consumption of NaOH for the pH adjustment in the hydrogen UASB unit, a recycle ratio of the methane UASB effluent flow rate to the feed flow rate of 1:1 was used in this study. The schematic of the two-stage UASB unit is shown in Fig. 1 . At any given COD loading rate, the two-stage UASB system was operated to reach steady state before taking effluent and produced gas samples for analysis and measurement. For each studied COD loading rate, the two-stage UASB system was operated approximately 4weeks to reach steady state condition. The steady state was justified when both of the gas production rates and the effluent COD values of both hydrogen and methane UASB units did not change with time."
5,Measurements and analytical methods,"2.4 Measurements and analytical methods The volumes of produced gases from both UASB bioreactors were recorded daily by wet gas meters (Ritter, TGO5/5). The compositions of both produced gas samples were determined by a gas chromatograph (GC; Auto System GC, Perkin–Elmer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a packed column (stainless-steel 10′×1/8′×.085″ HayeSep D 100/120 mesh, Altech) and the analysis conditions were given in our previous study (Intanoo et al., 2012). The COD in the feed and effluent samples were quantified by the dichromate method using a COD reactor and a spectrophotometer (HACH, DR 2700). The mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (MLVSS) representing the microbial concentration in each UASB unit was measured by taking all the sludge in each bioreactor at the end of each studied COD loading rate. The effluent volatile suspended solid (effluent VSS), representing the microbial washout from each UASB unit, was measured according to the standard methods (Eaton et al., 2005). The total amount of volatile fatty acids in each bioreactor at any given COD loading rate was determined by the distillation-titration method (Eaton et al., 2005). The samples obtained from the steam distillation step were additionally taken for the determination of organic acid compositions by using another gas chromatograph (GC; PR 2100, Perichrom) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and the analysis conditions were given in our previous study (Intanoo et al., 2012). Nitrogen analyses (in terms of organic nitrogen measured by the diazotization, cadmium reduction method, and inorganic nitrogen measured by the salicylate method) in the feed and effluent samples were carried out with the TNT persulfate digestion. The total phosphorous contents in the feed and effluent samples were determined by the molybdovanadate method with acid persulfate digestion (Hach Company) (Intanoo et al., 2012). The effluent samples of both the hydrogen and methane bioreactors were measured for pH and alkalinity. The sodium concentrations in the effluents of both the hydrogen and methane UASB units were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS; SpectrAA 300, Varian). The average values of all analysis and measurements (<5% SD) were used to access the process performance of the two-stage UASB system."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production performance results,"3.1 Hydrogen production performance results 3.1.1 COD removal and gas production rate Fig. 2 a shows the effects of COD loading rate on COD removal and gas production rate of the hydrogen UASB unit operated at 55°C and pH 5.5. Since the constant recycle ratio of 1:1 was used to operate the two-stage UASB system, the actual COD loading rate calculated from the COD values of both feed and recycle effluent was also presented for comparison. The COD removal increased with increasing COD loading rate and attained a maximum value of 35% at a COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d. Beyond the COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d, the COD removal decreased with further increasing COD loading rate. The gas production rate also shows a similar trend to the COD removal. The maximum gas production rate (5.5l/d) was found at the same COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d. The cassava wastewater contains a high organic content in terms of a COD value of 14,500mg/l. Hence a higher COD loading rate provided a greater organic compound amount available for microbial activity, leading to increase in both COD removal and gas production rate. However, with further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d, the decreases in both COD removal and gas production rate resulted from the increasing toxicity from organic acid accumulation which will be discussed latter. 3.1.2 Hydrogen production efficiency The gas composition and hydrogen production rate of the hydrogen UASB unit are shown in Fig. 2b. The produced gas of the hydrogen UASB bioreactor mainly contained hydrogen and carbon dioxide with a small amount of methane. The methane content decreased steadily with increasing COD loading rate, corresponding to a reduction of hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 12h at a COD loading rate of 30kg/m3 d to 2.4h at a COD loading rate of 150kg/m3 d (Solera et al., 2002). The hydrogen content increased with increasing COD loading rate from 30 to 90kg/m3 d and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d. The maximum values of both hydrogen content and hydrogen production rate were 40% and 2.2l/d, respectively, at the same COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d. The first increase in hydrogen production rate with increasing COD loading rate resulted from the increase in organic load available for the microbial activity. However, both decreases in hydrogen production rate and content with further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d resulted from the increasing toxicity of increasing VFA in the system (Luo et al., 2010). The CO2 concentration in the produced gas showed an opposite trend to the H2 concentration. The specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) is used to indicate the ability of microbes to produce hydrogen from organics of any particular wastewater per unit volume of reactor or per unit dried weight of microbes, which is very useful for scaling up a bioreactor. Both SHPR values increased with increasing COD loading rate from 30 to 90kg/m3 d, then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d (Fig. 2c). Both maximum SHPR values found at the same COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d were 197.17mlH2/gMLVSSd and 530mlH2/ld which were consistent with the maximum values of hydrogen production rate, hydrogen content, and COD removal. In addition, hydrogen yield, used to indicate the efficiency of conversion of organic compounds to hydrogen by microbes in terms of mlH2/g COD applied or mlH2/g COD removed was also determined in this study. They showed a similar trend to the SHPR values (Fig. 2c and d). The maximum hydrogen yield of 80.25mlH2/g COD removed (or 54.22mlH2/g COD applied) was found at the same COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d, which corresponded to the highest SHPR and hydrogen production performance. The higher hydrogen production efficiency resulted from the greater organic load in the system to provide more food for the microorganisms to produce more hydrogen. Again, the SHPR and hydrogen yield sharply decreased when the COD loading rate increased beyond 90kg/m3 d due to toxicity from the VFA accumulation. In our previous work, using anaerobic sequencing batch reactor to produce hydrogen from alcohol wastewater under a constant pH of 5.5 at 55°C without effluent recycle (Intanoo et al., 2012), the maximum hydrogen yield of 130mlH2/g COD removed (or 30mlH2/g COD applied) was found at a COD loading rate of 68kg/m3 d. The hydrogen yield values obtained from the present work are comparable to those of the previous work. The hydrogen yield from cassava wastewater under the two-stage thermophilic UASB process of the present study is about 50% higher than that under the two-stage mesophilic UASB process (12.82mlH2/g COD removed) (Chaimongkol, 2009). As shown in Fig. 2f, the alkalinity of the hydrogen UASB unit slightly increases with increasing COD loading rate and reaches a maximum level at a COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d. With further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d, the system alkalinity slightly decreased. The decrease in alkalinity resulted from the increase in VFA in the system. It should be mentioned that the alkalinity range in the hydrogen UASB unit was considerably low because of the low system pH of 5.5. 3.1.3 Volatile fatty acid (VFA) and VFA composition The effects of COD loading rate on total VFA and VFA composition in the hydrogen UASB unit are shown in Fig. 3 . The total VFA increased markedly with increasing COD loading rate from 30 to 120kg/m3 d, but it slightly increased with further increasing COD loading rate beyond 120kg/m3 d. The maximum total VFA concentration (13000mg/l as acetic acid) was at the highest COD loading rate of 150kg/m3 d. The high VFA result suggests that the cassava wastewater was easily converted to VFA since it contains mostly starch. As compared the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it can be concluded that the toxic level of VFA to hydrogen-producing bacteria was around 8800mg/l as acetic acid under the studied conditions, which is consistent to our previous work (Intanoo et al., 2012; Poontaweegeratigarn, 2012; Sreethawong et al., 2010; Chaimongkol, 2009; Thungmanee, 2011). As shown in Fig. 3, the main components of produced VFA are butyric acid (HBu), valeric acid (HVa), acetic acid (HAc), and propionic acid (HPr). All produced organic acids had a similar trend to that of the total VFA concentration except the HPr concentration slightly increased with increasing COD loading rate. In this study, the HBu concentration was the highest while HPr concentration was the lowest, which contributed to the system having high hydrogen production performance (Wang et al., 2009a,b; Hawkes et al., 2002). According to the microbial metabolic pathway, all organic acids are produced in conjunction with the production of hydrogen while the consumption of hydrogen results in the formation of HPr (Antonopoulou et al., 2011), as shown in the following equation. (1) CH 3 COOH + H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O Another component that also shows a negative effect to the efficiency of hydrogen production is the formation of ethanol. One mole of ethanol is produced by consuming one mole of hydrogen under anaerobic condition (Thungmanee, 2011). However, in this study, there was a very small amount of ethanol produced and the ethanol concentration remained almost unchanged throughout the COD loading rate range of 30–150kg/m3 d. Therefore, the effect of produced ethanol can be negligible for this study."
8,Methane production performance results,"3.2 Methane production performance results 3.2.1 COD removal and gas production rate As described before, the liquid effluent from the hydrogen UASB unit was directly fed to the methane UASB unit for further production methane. The methane bioreactor was also operated under thermophilic temperature (55°C) without pH control. Fig. 4 a shows the COD removal at different COD loading rates (based on either the feed COD load and methane UASB volume or the actual incoming COD load and methane UASB volume). The COD removal increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum value of 72% at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d (based on the feed COD load and methane UASB volume). Beyond the optimum COD loading rate of 15kg/m3d, the COD removal slightly decreased with further increasing COD loading rate. The gas production rate showed a similar trend to the COD removal. Interestingly, the gas production rate of the methane UASB unit was about 4 times higher than that of hydrogen UASB unit, corresponding to the size ratio of both bioreactors. 3.2.2 Methane production efficiency The produced gas from the methane UASB unit mainly contained methane and carbon dioxide with a very small amount of hydrogen (less than 0.5%) (Fig. 4b). Both methane content and methane production rate increased with increasing COD loading rate from 5 to 15kg/m3 d, but decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 15 to 25kg/m3 d (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the CO2 content in the produced gas showed an opposite trend. The maximum methane content and methane production rate of 68% and 16l/d, respectively, were found at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d, corresponding to the optimum COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d (based on the feed COD load and hydrogen UASB volume) for maximum hydrogen production performance. Fig. 4c and d show the specific methane production rates (SMPR) and methane yields, which increased with increasing COD loading rate from 5 to 15kg/m3 d, and then decreased with further increasing COD loading rate from 15 to 25kg/m3 d. The maximum values of SMPRs (650mlCH4/ld or 356.31mlCH4/gMLVSSd) and methane yields (183.31mlCH4/g COD removed or 98.87mlCH4/g COD applied) were at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d. Hence, the COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d was considered to be an optimum organic loading rate for both production of hydrogen and methane by the two-stage thermophilic UASB system. The maximum methane yield of 840CH4/g TVS applied found in this study (Fig. 4e) was about 100% higher than that from household solid waste using one-stage process at 37°C (413mlCH4/g TVS applied) (Liu et al., 2006; Poontaweegeratigarn, 2012). The pH and alkalinity of the methane UASB unit increased with increasing COD loading rate and reached a maximum level at a COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d (Fig. 4f). With further increasing COD loading rate from 15 to 25kg/m3 d, the system pH and alkalinity sharply decreased. The sharp decreases in pH and alkalinity resulted from the increase in VFA in the system. The decrease in pH from 6.65 to 6.04 in the methane UASB unit affected the activity of methane-forming bacteria, causing a decrease in methane production performance because of the toxicity from the VFA accumulation (Kvesitadze et al., 2012; Chandra et al., 2012), as indicated latter. 3.2.3 Volatile fatty acid (VFA) and VFA composition Fig. 3b shows the effect of COD loading rate on total VFA and VFA composition in the methane UASB unit. The total VFA increased steadily with an increase in COD loading rate. The maximum total VFA of 780mg/l as acetic acid was at the highest COD loading rate of 25kg/m3 d. Based on the results of COD removal, gas production rate and total VFA, the toxic level of VFA to the methane-producing bacteria is around 350mg/l under the studied conditions which is in good agreement with previous work (Sarada and Joseph, 1996). Similar to the organic acids produced in the hydrogen UASB unit, the methane UASB unit also only generated HAc, HPr, HBu and HVa and all produced organic acids also increased gradually when the COD loading rate increased. At any given COD loading rate, the concentration of HAc was the highest followed by HPr, HBu, and HVa, respectively. The highest HAc concentration resulted from the further degradation of both HPr and HBu, according to Eqs. (2) and (3) (Abbasi et al., 2012). The production of methane mainly resulted from the two basic bioconversion reactions of hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic pathways, as shown in Eqs. (4) and (5) (Abbasi et al., 2012; FAO Corporate, 1997). (2) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 (3) CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + 3 H 2 (4) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O (5) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 3.2.4 Microbial concentration and microbial washout As shown in Fig. 5 , the MLVSS (representing the microbial concentration) in each UASB bioreactor decreases with increasing COD loading rate, whereas the microbial washout (effluent VSS) from each UASB unit shows an opposite trend. The results of both steady increases in hydrogen and methane production efficiency, with decreasing microbial concentration in the studied COD loading rate range of 5–15kg/m3 d (based on the feed COD load and methane UASB volume), suggest that an increase in COD loading rate increases the organic load available for microbial activities to produce more both gases. There was an increase in microbial washout from both UASB bioreactors with increasing COD loading rate. This probably indicates that the only inactive microbes were washed out. However, the results showing the decreases in both production performance of hydrogen and methane with further increasing COD loading rate from 90 to 150kg/m3 d based on the feed COD load and hydrogen UASB volume or 15 to 25kg/m3 d based on the feed COD load and methane UASB volume can be explained by the fact that the increasing organic acid concentration greater than 8800 and 350mg/l increased the toxicity to the microbes in the hydrogen UASB unit and the methane UASB unit, respectively, causing increasing washout of active microbes from both UASB bioreactors. As a consequence, microbial activities in both hydrogen and methane productions of both UASB units decreased with further increasing COD loading rate. In this study, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used to adjust pH in the hydrogen UASB unit could affect the microbial activity in both UASB bioreactors, depending on its concentration (Rinzema et al., 1988). A low concentration of sodium (230–350mg/l) serves as an essential element to stimulate the activity of methanogenic bacteria (Rinzema et al., 1988). However, a high content of sodium greater than 16,000mg/l, exhibits toxicity to anaerobic microbes (Chen et al., 2003). In this study, the sodium content in both UASB units was in the 150–220mg/l range, which is much lower than the sodium toxic level to the anaerobic microbes. This low sodium level in the two-stage UASB system resulted from the effluent recycle operation. The sodium concentrations of feed (138mg/l) and the final effluent (150–220mg/l) were not significantly different, indicating that effluent recycling could reduce the NaOH consumption for pH adjustment in the hydrogen UASB unit. 3.2.5 Nitrogen and phosphorous uptakes and transformation Fig. 6 shows the nitrogen and phosphorous uptakes and nitrogen compound transformation in both steps of acidogenesis and methanogenesis. Both of nitrogen and phosphorous uptakes for the acidogenic and methanogenic steps increased with increasing COD loading rate. The higher the COD loading rate, the higher the nutrient uptakes. For any given COD loading rate, both N and P uptakes in the hydrogen UASB unit were significantly higher than those in the methane UASB unit. The utilization of nitrogen by microbes can come from different nitrogen sources: ammonium-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and organic-nitrogen (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009). The concentrations of ammonium-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen from both steps decreased slightly with increasing COD loading rate, whereas the organic-nitrogen concentration decreased drastically, suggesting that the nitrogen uptakes of both steps mostly came from organic-nitrogen compounds (Luo et al., 2010). At the optimum COD loading rate for both UASB units, the ratio of COD removal:N uptake:P uptake in the methane UASB unit was found to be 100:2.59:1.96, which is slightly higher than that in hydrogen UASB unit (100:2.20:1.31). Both N and P uptakes were much higher than the theoretical nutrient requirement for anaerobic decomposition for methane production in mesophilic temperature (COD:N:P=100:1.0:0:2). This is because the system was operated under thermophilic temperature, which requires higher nutrients (Intanoo et al., 2012; Sreethawong et al., 2010). 3.2.6 Overall performance Table 1 compares the process performance in terms of hydrogen and methane production of the present study with some previous results. This two-stage UASB process operated at the optimum COD loading rate of 12kg/m3 d (based on the total volume of both UASB units and feed COD load) provided the hydrogen yield in terms of 130mlH2/g TVS applied and the methane yields of 988mlCH4/g TVS applied (Table 1), which were significantly higher than those of two-phase thermophilic CSTR process at an organic loading rate of 10gVS/ld (hydrogen yield of 56.6mlH2/g VS applied and methane yield of 249mlH2/g VS applied) (Luo et al., 2010). The H2/CH4 ratio (1:7.6) of the mixed gas produced from this study was lower than that of the two-phase thermophilic CSTR process (1:4.4) (Luo et al., 2010); because the continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was operated at much lower rate, leading to the dominance of methanogenesis (Abbasi et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). The mixed gas produced from both UASB units used in this study, known as hythane, contained 7.11% H2, 54.13% CH4 and 38.75% CO2 at the optimum COD loading rate. The calculated values of higher heating value (HHV) and the lower heating value (LHV) of the mixed gas (hythane) are 23.62 and 21.14MJ/m3, respectively (Green and Perry, 2008). The biogas produced from a single-stage UASB unit typically contains 70% CH4 and 30% CO2 without H2. The HHV and LHV of the biogas are 22.70 and 20.43MJ/m3, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the use of two-stage anaerobic process provide a higher heating value of produced mixed gas as compared to that obtained from a single-stage anaerobic process."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, separate production of hydrogen and methane from cassava wastewater using a two-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) process under thermophilic temperature (55°C) was optimized by recycling the methane UASB effluent to the hydrogen UASB unit at a constant recycle ratio of 1:1 and by controlling the hydrogen UASB unit at pH 5.5. The highest hydrogen production performance in terms of the highest hydrogen content (40%), yield (54.22mlH2/g COD applied) and SHPR (197.17mlH2/gMLVSSd) and COD removal (35%) was achieved at a COD loading rate of 90kg/m3 d (based on the feed COD load and hydrogen UASB volume) corresponding to the optimum COD loading rate of 15kg/m3 d (based on the feed COD load and methane UASB volume) which also provided maximum process performance of the methane UASB (in terms of the highest methane content of 68%, methane yield of 164.87mlCH4/g COD applied, and SMPR of 356.31mlCH4/gMLVSSd, and COD removal of 72%."
