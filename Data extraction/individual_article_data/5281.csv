0,Introduction,"In recent years, threats caused by the use of plastics have led to significant technological advancements in renewable and biodegradable packaging. In addition to the threat posed by the plastic waste accumulation and exploitation of fossil fuels to the ecosystem, degraded plastics can yield microplastics, which are potentially toxic to humans and animals (Browne et al., 2011). Typical plastic packaging has evolved into durable, inert, and affordable products, hence becoming a challenge to replace. Accordingly, biodegradable packaging, including the edible options, have continued to gain popularity as potential alternatives in the food industry (Giteru et al., 2017). Zein (ZN) and chitosan (CS) are co-products of corn and seafood industries, respectively. Bio-based materials derived from ZN and CS have recently received significant interest, owing to the potential for assembly into stable nano/microstructures (Figueira et al., 2016; Escamilla-García et al., 2017; Giteru et al., 2019). The previous studies observed that when blended with synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), optimal blends of ZN and CS could yield low-cost biodegradable films of excellent mechanical and barrier properties (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). Additives, such as plasticisers and crosslinkers are commonly used to attain the desired performance of ZN/CS films, for example, improved flexibility and low solubility in water when using polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Giteru et al., 2019) and tripolyphosphate (Liang and Chen, 2018). Finally, ZN and CS are naturally abundant, and their production is of low cost and eco-friendly (Escamilla-García et al., 2017). Although films developed from bio-based materials may be perceived as edible, there are limited toxicological details based on the source of the materials or the effects of the processing technique. Despite the precautions taken in the selection of non-toxic bio-based materials and agents of modification, the film development processes may transform them into toxic substances (He and Xiong, 2012; Roș;u et al., 2017; Chiralt et al., 2018). Toxicity of edible films can also develop from the interactions between the film and gastrointestinal substances during the digestion process (Moreno and Giménez, 2016). Roșu et al. (2017) demonstrated the acquisition of cytotoxic effects in methylcellulose-based films processed using graphene oxide, where the use of its derivative, reduced graphene, showed minimal toxicity. Therefore, information relating to the cytotoxicity of biopolymer interactions and crosslinking effects on the safety of edible films is crucial to the selection of ingredients and modification techniques. Pulsed electric fields (PEF) processing is an emerging technique already applied for structural modification in biological tissues, i.e. plants (Leong et al., 2018), and animals (Alahakoon et al., 2019; Bhat et al., 2019). The technique has also been used in the destruction of microbes and enzymes (Chafai et al., 2015), and extraction of unique compounds, for instance, bioactive substances (Quagliariello et al., 2016) and proteins (Polikovsky et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2017; Buchmann et al., 2019). Although the exact mechanism of modification in biological tissues is still under elucidation, electroporation, which is the permeabilisation of cells through pore development, has been suggested (Leong et al., 2016). In addition, PEF processing can lead to enhancement or suppression of macromolecular interactions, for example, protein-protein or glycosidic interactions in polysaccharides (Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Such activities can lead to configurational and conformational modifications of biomacromolecules (Ma et al., 2012b; Giteru et al., 2018b). Increasing awareness of the activities occurring during PEF has led to the speculation that by modifying the functionality of biomacromolecules, their cytotoxic effects could also be influenced (Quagliariello et al., 2016; Griseti et al., 2019). Griseti et al. (2019) investigated the enhancement of cytotoxicity activity of plasma-activated phosphate-buffered saline. A plasma treatment process using a 10 kV mono-polar square pulse at 10 kHz (frequency) and 1 μs (pulse duration) potentially activated the hydrogen peroxide radicals, nitrite (NO2 −) and nitrate (NO3 −) which acted in synergy to kill cancer cells (human multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTS). Quagliariello et al. (2016) also demonstrated that PEF processing (1 – 3 kV/cm electric field strength, 10–1000 pulse number, 5 Hz frequency, and 0.16–144 kJ/kg specific energy) not only raised the yield of brown rice extracts (γ-oryzanol, polyphenols and phenolic acids) but also enhanced their anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities. The safety concerns of PEF-based food applications relates to the potential of the high-energy pulses to induce the formation of free radicals and secondary products due to functional modifications (Gómez et al., 2019). To date, pilot-scale processes for the synthesis of new functional compounds, for instance, through protein-polysaccharide bioconjugation reactions, are rarely investigated for cytotoxic effects. Despite the evidence supporting the effectiveness of PEF in the medical field or its beneficial use in the food industry, the cytotoxic effect of the resulting products is seldom reported. The current study aimed to understand PEF-induced modification of zein-chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol (ZCP) film development process and the potential cytotoxic effects of the films on immortalised, metabolically competent mammalian cells (Hepa-1c1c7). In order to achieve this aim, the study investigated the modification of biomacromolecules during the assembly into films and any links to cytotoxicity. The films were degraded in both simulated gastrointestinal electrolyte solutions and simulated gastrointestinal digestion process. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 3-[4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assays were used to analyse the changes occurring in the functional composition of the films and their potential cytotoxicity."
1,Theoretical considerations on PEF-induced modification of biomacromolecules,"1.1 Theoretical considerations on PEF-induced modification of biomacromolecules PEF processing involves the application of high voltage electric fields in short pulses (μs – ms) to materials placed between two electrodes. Threshold intensity (Ic), which is the minimum intensity required for modification of biomacromolecules is depended upon PEF processing factors and configuration of the PEF equipment (Eq. 1, 2) (Zhang et al., 1995). The specific energy (Q) requirement for different configurations (continuous, Eq. (1) or batch, Eq. (2) ) is also depended upon the operational aspects of the process. These factors include the chamber geometry, electric field strength, pulse shape (square/exponential), treatment temperature, treatment time, and sample characteristics (i.e. molecular configuration and conductivity) (Toepfl et al., 2007; Jaeger et al., 2014). (1) Q ( k J / k g ) = f m ˙ · ∫ 0 τ p U ( t ) · I ( t ) · d t (2) Q ( k J / k g ) = U · I · τ p · n w = U 2 · τ p · n P R · w where f is the pulse frequency (Hz), m ˙ the mass flow rate of the product (kg s−1), U is the pulse voltage (kV), I is the electrical current in the treatment chamber (A), n p the number of pulses (dimensionless), τ p pulse width (μs), R load resistance (Ω) and w the sample weight (kg). Mostly, an integrated in-built system measures and records the electric field strength, load resistance, pulse voltage, current, pulse number and power (P) kW. The primary effect of PEF on biomacromolecules is generally related to the local changes in the structure of the functional units. This may involve dissociation and partial or complete unfolding of molecular chains (Hong et al., 2016b), alterations of the surface residues and their charges (Xiang et al., 2011a), as well as reorientation and enhancement of inter/intramolecular interactions (Giteru et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018). These alterations are attributed to the two proposed mechanisms of PEF-induced modification of biomacromolecules (1) the occurrence of electrochemical reactions at the electrode-media interface (Table 1 ) (the standard potential difference for water electrolysis is −1.23 V at 25 °C, pH 0 (Kojic et al., 2012)). (2) The polarisation of charged moieties, i.e. reorientation of the particles along the direction of electric fields (Ma et al., 2012b; Toepfl et al., 2014). Accordingly, electrochemical reactions and electrolysis lead to (a) ion build-up that influences electrostatic attractions of macromolecular chains and (b) generation of free radical such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), singlet oxygen (1O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These processes impact the hydrolysis and dissociation of chain bonding, local concentration of ions and migration of polyelectrolytes (for example, proteins and charged polysaccharides) (Jager, 2012). Regarding proteins, studies show that PEF induced polarisation of peptide bonds and simple elements on the molecular chains results in the development of dipole moments. The dipole moments accompanied by rapidly changing polarity result in perturbations that cause the unfolding of proteins due to the physical damage. It also causes an increase in the positive charge density of the hydrogen atoms on the amino (-NH3 +), peptide linkages amine (NH2), N–H and the carboxyl (-COOH) groups (Mazurkiewicz et al., 2015). PEF can also increase the stretching vibration of disulphide (S–S) linkages (Yan-Yan et al., 2014). On the one hand, these events can lead to decreases in the ordered structures (α-helices), an increase in disorder (β-sheets, β-turns and random coils) and exposure of surface free sulfhydryls (S–H) (Guan et al., 2010; Yan-Yan et al., 2014). But then, polarisation of polar moieties (e.g. CO, C–O and C–O–C, or PO) and modification of surface residues due to reactions with free ions can also promote self-assembly of proteins through electrostatic, hydrogen bonding (H–H), covalent linkages (sulphydryl, S–H/disulphide S–S) hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions (Liu et al., 2011). These processes result in the formation of transient structures and changes in the interfacial properties of the proteins, which influences their functional properties including the surface hydrophobicity (Li et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2016), colloidal behaviour (Xiang et al., 2011b), thermal stability (Liu et al., 2011) and swelling index (Li et al., 2007). Due the high hydrophobic and amphiphilic character of zein (Wang and Padua, 2010), mild variations in the ionic and polar environment can quickly transform the properties of its surface residues and alter its aggregation behaviour, for instance, the structural inversion observed on varying the solvent polarity in 60–90% (v/v) ethanol-water solvent (Kim and Xu, 2008). Thus, ZN was a suitable biopolymer for modification under PEF. Generally, the impact of electric fields on chitosan (Luo et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2017) or its composite system (CS–PVOH) (Giteru et al., 2018a) was observed as the destruction of the crystalline regions and disintegration of large chitosan molecules into low molecular weight compounds. The loss of granular crystallinity was also reported in tapioca (Han et al., 2012), cassava (Hong et al., 2016b), rice (Zeng et al., 2016), potato (Han et al., 2009b; Hong et al., 2016a) and corn starch (Han et al., 2009a). The polarisation effect, the hydroxyl ions (OH−) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) generated during PEF act synergistically to increase the system entropy, which favours the reaction between glycosidic linkages and H2O or other free active moieties. Such reactions cause the dissociation at the carbonyl ends of the double helices and the substitution of the hydroxyl groups in the polysaccharide chains (Bouyer et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2012a). These activities can affect the granular morphology, crystallinity, solubility, molecular weight, particle size, thermal and colloidal stability of chitosan (Luo et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2017; Giteru et al., 2018a). Protein-polysaccharide complexes are developed for improved stability of colloidal dispersions and the quality of prepared materials (Turgeon et al., 2003). PEF processing is a possible technique for the enhancement of protein-polysaccharide interactions (Guan et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Zhao and Yang, 2012). The functional groups exposed through the unfolding of the proteins (-NH2) and dissociation of polysaccharides (-CO) can form beneficial intermolecular interactions via covalent linkages, resulting in bioconjugation and better microstructural development of the resulting material (Fig. 1 ) (Guan et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011). Compared to systems of individual macromolecules, an intermix of ZN and CS can be employed for the development of films with better mechanical strength, and stability in varied environments (Giteru et al., 2019). Despite the plasticisation using PEG and modification using PVOH, the composite films continue to exhibit brittleness and stiffness, owing to the high-density interactions between their molecular chains. The presented mechanisms of PEF demonstrates its potential to improve the functionality of ZN-CS films through protein-polysaccharide bioconjugation reactions (Sun et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2017). Although the goal of the current study was not to optimise PEF processing parameters for modification of biomacromolecules, a preliminary study conducted in this work showed that PEF could improve the mechanical, thermal and erosion stability of the developed films (Fig. 1). The results showed a dose-dependent impact of PEF, but it is important to note that numerous PEF parameters require standardisation for accurate definition of the necessary intensity to initiate such improvements (Jaeger et al., 2014). Notwithstanding, our preliminary findings identified suitable levels of electric field strength and a range of specific energy for the current investigation. The novelty of this study was to evaluate the in vitro degradation of biodegradable films prepared from PEF treated dispersions and provide an understanding of the influence of PEF on the cytotoxic effects of the films using a tissue culture model."

All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade, and all supplies were used as received."
4,Pulsed electric field processing and film preparation,"2.2 Pulsed electric field processing and film preparation Zein-chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol (ZCP) film-forming dispersion (FFD) was prepared according to an optimised formulation developed by Giteru et al. (2019). The FFD was prepared to a total solids content of 1.81% (w/v) comprising of 0.35, 0.29, 0.13, 0.23 wt fraction (dry basis) ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG, respectively and a final solvent composition of 60% v/v (ethanol-water) and 0.6% acetic acid. The pulsed electric fields (PEF) equipment used in this investigation was a pilot plant scale (ELCRACK-HVP 5, German Institute of Food Technologies, Quakenbrück, Germany) in a batch configuration mode. The equipment had specifications of 25 kV maximum capacity of output voltage delivered in bipolar square wave pulses. The voltage was monitored on-line with a 25 MHz digital oscilloscope (UT2025C Model, Uni-Trend Group Ltd., China). The oscilloscope had <14 ns rise time, 250 MS/s sample rate real-time, 2 mV vertical sensitivity and 20 ns of scan time base. The treatment chamber was a 40 mm gap stainless steel electrode with an area of 56 cm2. For sample treatment, 40 g of freshly prepared dispersions was filled into the chamber and treated using three levels of specific energy (Q) (60–70 kJ/kg, 385–400 kJ/kg and 620–650 kJ/kg), which can be obtained from Eq. (2) . The electric field strength (E) (1.6 kV/cm), frequency (f) (50 Hz), and pulse width (τ p ) (32 μs) were kept constant across the treatments. The number of pulses (n p ) varied accordingly to attain the desired levels of specific energy: 60–70 kJ/kg (n p = 1840 ± 32), 385–400 kJ/kg (n p = 8856 ± 65) and 620–650 kJ/kg (n p = 13274 ± 130). Variations in n p also depicted the difference in the effective PEF processing times (t PEF ) from the following expression t PEF = n p × τ p (μs). The temperature (T, oC) and conductivity (C, μS/cm) of the dispersions before and after the treatment were measured using a conductivity meter (CyberScan CON 11; Eutech Instruments, Singapore, Singapore). Joule heating resulted in a temperature increase from the initial 20.5 ± 1 °C to a maximum of approximately 52 °C under the highest specific energy. The electrical conductivity of the dispersions (initial conductivity = 262 ± 6 μS/cm) also varied with temperature and specific energy as follows: 60–70 kJ/kg (318 μS/cm), 385–400 kJ/kg (341 μS/cm), and 620–650 kJ/kg (362 μS/cm). It is important to note that the cumulative and short-lived process of Joule heating during PEF differs from a conventional heating process (Toepfl et al., 2007). In our preliminary study, conditions under a simulated conventional heating process (60 °C maximum temperature for 2 min) was insignificant in the modification of the colloidal dispersions and the resulting films. Hence, the temperature alterations to the macromolecules were not considered. The pH of the dispersions (5.6 ± 0.1) did not change due to the treatment. Post-PEF treatment, the dispersions were cooled down (20 °C for 1 h) then used for the subsequent analyses. Thereafter, the dispersions were degassed for 2 min at 25 ± 3 °C using an ultrasonic machine at 37 kHz (Elmasonic S 30 H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). The films were cast on 10 cm × 10 cm polystyrene Petri dishes using a constant total solids rate of ~0.05 g/cm2. The drying conditions were kept constant at 20 ± 2 °C using forced draft (airflow rate = 0.5 m/s). Dried films were conditioned at 20 ± 2 °C in a vacuum desiccator equilibrated using magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg (NO3)2∙6H2O) at ~53% relative humidity (RH) for a minimum of seven days."
5,In vitro degradation of ZCP films,"2.3 In vitro degradation of ZCP films 2.3.1 Susceptibility to hydrolysis in simulated gastrointestinal electrolyte solutions The degradation of non-PEF and PEF-treated ZCP-films was investigated using simulated gastro-intestinal electrolyte solutions prepared at physiological pH and according to Minekus et al. (2014). First, 0.6 g of shredded films (<0.5 mm length) was mixed with 2 mL simulated saliva electrolyte stock (SES) solution (0.117 g/L (2 mM) NaCl, 0.149 g/L (2 mM) KCl, 2.1 g/L (25 mM) NaHCO3) at pH 7.0 followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Next, 2 mL of simulated gastric electrolyte stock (GES) solution (1.775 g/L (151 mM) NaCl and 0.42 g/L (28 mM) KCl) was added to the mixture and the pH adjusted to 3.0 using 1M HCl. The resulting mixture (~4 mL) was incubated for 120 min at 37 °C with shaking (100 rpm). This was followed by a final degradation stage where 4 mL of simulated intestinal electrolyte stock (IES) solution (0.1M sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), 20 mM bile salts) was added, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using 1 M NaOH. Aliquots were drawn at 0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min during IES degradation and prepared for protein digestibility assay using Ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) as illustrated in Fig. 2 . The TCA soluble peptide fraction was obtained by mixing the aliquots in 1:1 ratio with trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 20% (w/w) followed by storing at 4 °C for 30 min then centrifugation (13000×g, 20 °C, 5 min). The supernatant containing the TCA soluble peptide fraction was kept at −20 °C for use in the determination of available amino groups (AAG). The slurry obtained at each time point was centrifuged (13000×g, 20 °C, 5 min), then both the supernatant and the indigestible residue were frozen (−20 °C) until further analysis as illustrated in Fig. 2. 2.3.2 Susceptibility to enzyme hydrolysis in simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion Non-PEF and PEF-treated ZCP films were subjected to simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion according to the method of Minekus et al. (2014) with some modifications. Films (0.6g) were soaked in 1 mL deionised water (~150 mg protein/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C, then 1 mL of SES was added, and the mixture was made into a thick paste. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 using 1 M NaOH, and then 0.5 mL α-amylase stock solution (12.5 g/L α-amylase) was added to the mixture and incubated with shaking (100 rpm) for 2 min at 37 °C. The enzyme was deactivated by adjusting to pH 3.0 using 1M HCl. Gastric digestion followed by addition of 2 mL pepsin stock solution (4000 unit/mL, i.e. 40 mg/mL pepsin in 200 mL GES) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 120 min with shaking (100 rpm). Gastric digestion was stopped using 1M NaOH (650 μL) followed by addition of 4 mL IES containing pancreatin (10 g/L pancreatin in IES, pH 7.0) and bile salts (20 mM) followed by incubation (37 °C) with shaking (100 rpm). Aliquots (500 μL) were taken before the addition of pancreatin (t = 0) and during pancreatic digestion at 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min. The TCA soluble fraction was prepared, as described in Fig. 2. Further aliquots obtained from the digests were prepared for analysis of cytotoxic effects and physicochemical properties by firstly heating at 95 °C for 5 min (Fig. 2 ). A blank prepared using deionised water instead of the film was aliquoted at each time point to account for interactions between the enzymes in the buffered environment."
6,Physicochemical characterisation of degradation products,"2.4 Physicochemical characterisation of degradation products 2.4.1 Determination of free amino groups content Ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay was used to quantify the available amino groups after in vitro degradation and enzyme digestion as described by Church et al. (1983) with minor modifications. The OPA assay is based on the reaction of the low molecular weight aldehyde and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) with primary amines to produce 1-alkylthio-2-alkylisoindoles with a maximum absorbance at 340 nm (Church et al., 1983). The OPA reagent was freshly prepared before use by mixing 50 ml of 100 mM sodium tetraborate buffer, 200 μL 2-mercaptoethanol and 80 mg OPA (pre-dissolved in 2 mL methanol) followed by 5 mL of 20% (wt./wt.) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and then the volume was made to 100 mL with deionised water. The TCA-soluble peptide fractions were mixed with the OPA reagent at a ratio of 3:20 (v/v) in 96 well plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 min before the absorbance was read at 340 nm using a microplate reader (Biotek, Vermont, USA). A standard solution of L-serine (0–200 mg/L) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) (Church et al., 1983) was used to prepare a standard curve, from which the free primary amine content (μM L -serine equivalent) was calculated."
7,Chemical characterisation by FTIR spectroscopy,"2.5 Chemical characterisation by FTIR spectroscopy The FTIR spectra for the degraded ZCP films were recorded using attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (ALPHA-D, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) using a platinum/diamond crystal (Figueira et al., 2016). The samples were prepared by freeze-drying (Freezone® 12 plus, Labconco, MO, USA) of both the supernatant and the residue obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min from IES degradation and pancreatic digestion phases. The freeze-dried products were milled into a fine powder and then placed in a uniform layer on the crystal surface. Interferograms were recorded using 64 scans acquired at 4 cm−1 resolution with the subtraction of the blank background. The spectra were normalised using the OMNIC® software version 9.2.86 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. MA, USA). Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) using the OMNIC software was used for Gaussian-Lorentzian curve fitting (Hajji et al., 2014) in the region 1700-1500 cm−1 (amide-II and I) to separate overlapping peaks. The spectra of each compound, i.e., ZN, CS and PVOH, were also determined for comparisons."
8,Cytotoxic effects of degraded ZCP films,"2.6 Cytotoxic effects of degraded ZCP films Metabolically competent liver cells (mouse hepatoma, Hepa-1c1c7) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Cambridge, UK), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Biochrom) in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland). The cells were incubated (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) at 37 °C, 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and >90% RH. The growth medium was replaced every 48–72 h and cells were subcultured at ≥ 80% confluence and used between three and five passages. The cells were prepared for assays by transferring to a 96–well (flat bottom) tissue culture plate (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) at seeding of 1 × 104 cells/well. The plates were incubated for an additional 24 h in the conditions above before replacing the media with the growth medium containing the test samples. Viability of Hepa-1c1c7 cells was used as an indicator of cytotoxicity, which was evaluated by measuring the capacity of the cells to reduce 3-[4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) dye to formazan. The reduction of MTT (blue-coloured) by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase is considered reliable for measurement of mitochondrial function (Elbekai et al., 2004). Potential cytotoxicity for both simulated gastro-intestinal electrolyte solution (GES) and enzyme-degraded ZCP films was evaluated following ISO 10993 (ISO, 2009). Briefly, a sample loading concentration of either 5% (supernatant) or 1 mg/mL (residue) in the growth media was added to each well. After treatment with the test formulations and 48 h incubation, the culture medium was aspirated from the wells; then cells were washed with 100 μL of PBS. This was followed by adding 100 μL of MTT reagent (1 mg/mL) to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. The unreacted MTT dye was aspirated, and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved using 50 μL DMSO in each well during shaking for 10 min at 500 rpm. The absorbance was determined at 540 nm using SpectraMax® Plus384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The background absorbance of multi-well plates was subtracted from the absorbance of the samples at 540 nm. The relative cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the control wells in which only the media without the test sample were added (Chuacharoen and Sabliov, 2017). Each formulation was applied to nine wells per experiment, and the experiment was conducted in triplicate from three independently prepared films."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis All values were expressed as the mean of at least three independent assays. The differences between the results of untreated and PEF-treated samples at the three specific energy levels were compared using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's test to separate the means at p < 0.05 significance level. Student's paired t-test was used to compare the result of the blank and the films from the cytotoxicity assay at p < 0.05 test of significance. Bivariate correlations were calculated using Pearson's correlation. All data were analysed using IBM SPSS software (ver. 25, NY, USA)."

11,In vitro degradation of ZCP films in simulated gastrointestinal medium,"3.1 In vitro degradation of ZCP films in simulated gastrointestinal medium 3.1.1 Evaluating susceptibility of ZCP films to degradation in gastrointestinal electrolyte solution using OPA In measuring the level of available amino groups, the OPA technique provides information on the nature of interactions and microstructural conformation of biopolymers, thus the degree of structural stability (Mulcahy et al., 2017). The early stages of degradation (up to 30 min) resulted in significantly higher (p < 0.05) yields of AAG from the non-PEF compared to PEF-treated films (Fig. 3 ). This suggested the existence of a lag phase during the swelling and relaxation of films prepared from PEF-treated dispersions. Generally, the data showed gradual increases in AAG at 60–240 min in both non-PEF and PEF-processed films. Although variations in AAG among the PEF processed films were only significant at 120 min between 60–70 kJ/kg and 600–620 kJ/kg, the yield was generally lower at the low specific energy compared high-energy processing. This finding suggested the strengthening of the film matrix at low-intensity PEF and less resistance of the films to IES degradation at high intensity. Previous investigations on the involvement of PEF in CS/PVOH matrices using rheological techniques showed enhancement of intermolecular interactions when PEF energy was <275 kJ/kg and weak interactions, heterogeneity and rapidly decaying solution matrices at PEF energy >275 kJ/kg (Giteru et al., 2018a). The authors attributed the modifications at low-intensity PEF to the formation of new interactions, owing to the increase in molecular binding sites for the establishment of intermolecular entanglements among CS and PVOH polymeric chains. In the current study, the levels of AAG indicated the release of ε-amino groups of lysine and α-amino groups of N-terminal amino acids in proteins. A low concentration of amino groups suggested the existence of covalent interactions including protein-protein associations induced by aggregation or interactions between the amino groups of the protein and the carbonyls of the polysaccharides (Mulcahy et al., 2017). Increases in AAG were related to the increase in the relaxation of the film in a gradual process that begins in the gastric degradation phase (pH 3.0). Favoured by the high hydrogen ions (H+) concentration, the ionisation of the protein and polysaccharide components causes electrostatic repulsion, molecular relaxation, weakening and disintegration of the film network (Masamba et al., 2016). Such processes caused dissociation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which exposes the film support network to further disintegration in the aqueous media. At the simulated intestinal electrolyte solution (IES) phase, the neutral pH lowered the ionisation of ZN and CS macromolecules, which was observed as cloudiness in the mixture, suggesting the presence of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. However, the prior disintegration of the microstructure of the films in the gastric phase, coupled with the presence of bile salts continued to increase the susceptibility of proteins to hydrolysis in the simulated IES (Gass et al., 2007). Despite the lack of significant influence of PEF processing on AAG, these findings suggested that the effect of time on the degradation of the films might affect the concentration of the products in the supernatant or residue. 3.1.2 Investigating the relationship between degradation products and PEF-induced changes in the molecular structure using FTIR The FTIR spectra of the supernatant and residue of SGES degraded ZCP films are shown in Fig. 4 A and B. A typical plot from Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) is shown in Fig. 4C. The amide-II and I bands were prominently featured at 1,600 to 1,500 cm−1 and 1,700 to 1,600 cm−1 respectively. Other peaks occurred at ~1425-1416 cm−1 and 1060-1040 cm−1 representing –OH, C–O–C, and C–OH (esters region) which were attributable to CS and PVOH. As the fingerprinting region of FTIR spectra (<1500 cm−1) is prone to influence by numerous factors, these bands were not considered in evaluating the structural degradation of the film. Besides, compared to the amide-II and I bands, the absorption spectra below 1500 cm−1, which also consist of the protein side chains, induced a negligible effect on the overall spectra of the protein (Sessa and Woods, 2011). Specifically, the amide-I peaks (1,700 to 1,600 cm−1) are assigned to the β-sheets due to protein aggregation (1614-1612 cm−1), antiparallel β-sheets/low frequency β-sheets (1640-1615 cm−1), α-helices (1660-1648 cm−1), random coils (1670-1660 cm−1), β-turns (1665-1690 cm−1) and β-sheets (1700-1690 cm−1) (Erickson et al., 2014). The amide-II band at ~1575 cm−1 is assigned to the -C-N stretching and -N-H bending. The relative ratios of these bands and others such as 1650 and 1610-1620 cm−1 (amide-I), 1545 and 1510 cm−1 (amide-II) or amide-I/amide-III have previously been used to study the secondary structure of ZN (Singh et al., 2009). The consistency of variations in the proportions of peaks centred at 1660-1657 cm−1 and 1580-1575 cm−1 bands (amide-II and I) strongly suggested that the changes in the protein structural units had significant involvement in the degradation of the films. These made the bands a good representative for the protein structure and the films. The ratios of peak intensity (height and area) at 1655 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1 (1655/1575) are summarised in Table 2 . On prolonged degradation (240 min) in IES, non-PEF samples showed a decrease in the peak height ratios, indicating an increase in the density of –C-N stretching and -N-H bending of the amide-II region. This was an indicator of decreasing order in the protein secondary structure, showing a reduction in the formation and retention of α-helices with the progression of digestion. The peak height ratios decreased (~0.48) on PEF processing at 60–70 kJ/kg or 385–400 kJ/kg. Similar trends were observed in the ratios of the peak area, indicating that PEF had significantly increased the type and bond density of the amide-II region. Processing at a high specific energy (600–620 kJ/kg) resulted in significantly lower peak height ratios compared to the non-PEF samples of degraded films. This indicated an enhancement of C–H and C–O–C linkages, suggesting an increase in conformational changes of the protein structure from the ordered α-helix to the β-sheet arrangement (Hurtado-López and Murdan, 2006; Giteru et al., 2018b). These findings suggested that PEF-induced effects were conveyed from the freshly treated dispersions to the dried films. The secondary protein structures were further evaluated concerning the release of the amines as determined using the OPA method. The obtained correlation coefficient suggested a negative relationship between the availability of amine groups and the intensities of the amide-I/amide-II ratio (Table 2). This indicated that the loss of α-helix contributed to the rising levels of AAG, suggesting that the measurement of AAG was an ideal form of monitoring the level of protein (film) disaggregation (Singh et al., 2010). The AAG and conformational data suggested time-dependent relaxation and degradation of the film matrix, which provided access for the hydrolysis of inter-/intramolecular hydrogen bonding and covalent interactions. Overall, these findings indicate a decrease in the α-helix content with increasing IES degradation time, a phenomenon expected in solvated protein, which occurs with the breakdown of hydrogen bonding (Singh et al., 2010). The negative correlation between the ratio of peak areas and the AAG indicated that prolonged degradation could increase the bond density in the amide-II region (C–H, N–H). The increase in the vibration of amide-II was consistent with the β-sheet conformation of a modified protein, which could be enhanced by protein-polysaccharide interactions (Guerrero et al., 2014). In their study, Guerrero et al. (2014) observed a high vibrational frequency at 1517 cm−1, which was interpreted as the exposure of tyrosine (Tyr) (β-sheet interfaces) from the unfolding of soy protein isolates (SPI) in the presence of gum arabic, acacia gum or dextran. This observation was a clear indication that conformational changes in ZN occurred during the formation of the composite film. From our observations, the significant correlation between the ratio of peak area and AAG shows that PEF treatment at 60–70 kJ/kg or 385–400 kJ/kg led to significant increases in the β-sheet conformation (protein unfolding) during IES degradation. Consequently, the exposed functional groups under the new conformational arrangement established strong covalent and noncovalent linkages (hydrophobic interactions) between the film components during the solvent evaporation, increasing the resistance of the films towards SGES. The correlation between the peak area and AAG of non-PEF or extreme PEF intensity was not significant. Owing to the high reduction in the intensity of amide-II and I bands in the spectra of the residue from the degradation process ( Fig. 4B) (1700-1500 cm−1) it was not possible to compute a reliable amide ratio for the samples, but the shifting and establishment of new peaks were recorded in Table 3 . The establishment of new peaks at >1660 cm−1 and lower vibration frequencies (<1645 cm−1) in the amide-I region suggest an increase in random coils and β-sheet respectively (Singh et al., 2010). Coupled with the enhancement of the band at ~1069-1046 cm−1, these results suggest the existence of higher interaction among the compounds of the residue, including protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide associations. However, these compounds existed as insoluble complexes, which implied different functionalities between the compounds in the residue and those observed in the supernatant. 3.1.3 Influence of PEF on cytotoxic effects of SGI electrolyte degraded ZCP films Cytotoxic effects of degraded PEF-treated and untreated films were tested on Hepa-1c1c7. The assay was an important consideration, despite the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) status of ZN, CS, PVOH and PEG (Gagliardi et al., 2018). The simulated gastrointestinal electrolyte environment addressed some of the biosafety concerns of changes occurring during the degradation in environmental conditions. Hepa-1c1c7 cells were selected for cytotoxicity testing since the cells continue to express characteristics of healthy liver cells including detoxification, which were crucial in the toxicity assay (Elbekai et al., 2004; Holme et al., 2007). As aforementioned, functional and compositional differences existed between the supernatant and the residue of SGES degraded films. The cell viability (%) data from both the soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (residue) degradation products at 0 min and 240 min in IES solution are summarised in Fig. 5 . Potential sources for cytotoxicity of the films include interactions among the compounds during processing, use of ethanol as a solvent and the PEF processing technique (Da Silva Filho et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012). The data from the evaluation of the supernatant shown in Fig. 5A depicted no significant differences in cell viability between the 0-min, and 240-min IES degraded films. The overall cell activity decreased with increasing PEF specific energy, where significant differences occurred between the non-PEF, or PEF-processed films (60–70 kJ/kg) compared to the processing at 600–620 kJ/kg after 240 min degradation in IES. The result suggests that the degradation of low-intensity processed films increased the level of compounds that can facilitate cell attachment and proliferation. A cell viability rate of ≥80% in non-PEF and PEF processed films at 60–400 kJ/kg, suggesting low toxicity of the formulation compounds (Dang et al., 2012). Nonetheless, small particle sizes or low molecular weight compounds (e.g. chitosan) in the digested films may have contributed to the observed cell apoptosis (Liang et al., 2011). On the other hand, decreased cell proliferation after processing the films at 600–620 kJ/kg suggested the effect of high PEF energy on biocompatibility between the film components, perhaps yielding high hydrophobic materials that were unfavourable for cell proliferation (Yu et al., 2017). Interactions between biopolymer compounds have previously been reported to influence cell survival rates (Quagliariello et al., 2016). In the current study, the extent of degradation, which increased with increasing time, did not influence cell viability. The residue from the degraded products at t = 0 showed high (>90%) cell viability rates (Fig. 5B) indicating an increase in cell attachment and proliferation. Although the influence of PEF processing was not significant for the residue, the products of prolonged degradation (240 min) in IES affected the viability of the cell. This finding is related to the presence of numerous insoluble compounds in the degraded residue, including ZN, CS and PVOH, which may interact with the cells to lower their performance (Liang et al., 2011)."
12,Evaluating in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion of ZCP films,"3.2 Evaluating in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion of ZCP films 3.2.1 Effect of PEF on the yield of available amino groups in simulated in vitro digestion of ZCP films The available amino groups (AAG) in the enzyme digested ZCP from both the supernatant and the residue are summarised in Fig. 6 . The level of AAG at the beginning of the intestinal phase depicted the breakdown of proteins in the gastric phase, where pepsin hydrolyses proteins at high acid into oligopeptides of varying sizes. It has been suggested that digestion of ZN-based matrices using pepsin targets the α-ZN and not the dimers (Hurtado-López and Murdan, 2006; Hu et al., 2016). Therefore, AAG levels at t = 0 suggested that PEF could enhance the hydrolysis of ZN using pepsin. Regarding the structure of the film, the high acid in the gastric phase facilitates dissolution of the protein in the film matrix allowing structural relaxation and accessibility of inter-/intramolecular hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and disulphide linkages. Contrary to the degradation of the film in simulated electrolyte solutions, the changes in AAG were easily discernible after simulated in vitro digestion process. Generally, increasing the residence time in simulated pancreatic digestion resulted in higher yields of amino groups, a phenomenon that was not altered (p > 0.05) by application of PEF. A gradual increase in AAG can be seen during the first hour of intestinal digestion followed by a drastic increase on digestion to 120 min, after which there was a minimal change at 180 min and no further changes after 240 min (p < 0.05). The lower initial values of AAG may be attributed to the unavailability of peptide linkages for the enzyme activity, which has previously been related to the protein aggregation or reaction of the free amino groups of the protein with the carbonyl moieties of the polysaccharides via covalent and non-covalent interactions (Guan et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011). Sun et al. (2011) observed the enhancement of intermolecular interactions in whey protein isolate/dextran system after PEF, as evidenced by the reduction of AAG values from 35.77% to 43.53% (Sun et al., 2011). In another study, higher intensity PEF promoted graft reactions between the amino (–NH2) and the carbonyl (-CO) groups in a bovine serum albumin/dextran system (Guan et al., 2010). These findings were related to the amino group-reducing sugar bioconjugation reactions. The increase in the AAG during the digestion process suggested an increase in the susceptibility to enzyme hydrolysis during the 2-h intestinal digestion phase, which was attributable to the increase in molecular chain relaxation and protein unfolding (Liu et al., 2018). The phenomenon may also be contributed by the loss of protein-polysaccharide linkages due to the prolonged exposure to the high pH environment (Sun et al., 2011). 3.2.2 Effect of PEF on the functional groups of enzyme hydrolysed ZCP films determined by FTIR and the relationship with AAG Changes in the chemical groups of the digested films were detected using FTIR-ATR spectra and related to the yield of AAG from both the soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (residue) digests. The spectra illustrating the intensity of the peaks in the amide-II and I regions of the supernatant was presented in Fig. 7 . The curves show the amide bands with peaks at ~1661-1655 cm−1 (amide-I, C–O stretching) and 1588 cm−1 (amide-II, N–H). Intensities of the peaks at ~1660 cm−1 showed significant decreases with increasing duration of enzyme hydrolysis (Fig. 7 ). Longer digestion times resulted in more elaborate bands at ~1580 cm−1, compared to its counterpart at 1660 cm−1, which agrees with the observed increase in the available amino groups. The findings suggested partial or complete unfolding of ZN and CS helices; thus, the effect on α-helix in the secondary structure (Perez and Pilosof, 2004; Xiang et al., 2011c). The amide-II and I bands became a focus for the study of the changes in protein structure as ZN was the only major nutrient that resulted in consistent signals at these peaks. Fig. 8 A–D shows the ratios of intensities of the peak height and area in the amide-I/amide-II (1655/1575) regions, which were obtained from the deconvoluted spectra. Both the relative height and area ratios decreased with increasing digestion time, indicating an increase in the N–H bending vibration of the amide-II. These findings indicate a reduction in protein/protein interaction, which increased the protein unfolding, exposing higher levels of the initially buried particle-particle linkages to enzyme hydrolysis (Xiang et al., 2011a). The intensities of the peak height and relative area ratios were found to correlate negatively with the amine content, as shown in Fig. 9 A and B. This was a confirmation that the increase in the amine content contributed to the higher levels of N–H bending observed at 1580-1575 cm−1. Generally, the correlation between the peak height and area ratios with the AAG provided proper fitting (r2, 0.50–0.95) for the samples across the PEF treatment regimes. Although the medium intensity PEF at 385–400 kJ/kg resulted in a weak correlation of the height and area with levels of AAG (r2 = 0.56 and 0.50 respectively), the relationship was consistent in all the treatments. The data indicated a high dependence of the yield of AAG to the duration of enzyme hydrolysis, with stabilisation occurring between 120 and 180 min. Due to the observed interdependence between AAG and the peak height and area ratios, further investigations were conducted to establish if the differences in composition affected the nature of the compounds in the supernatant and residue. The data shows that the yield of AAG could easily be predicted using information from accurate determinations of microstructural properties in the protein-based biomaterials. Table 4 shows the observations on the shifting of peaks obtained from the residue of degradation products after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. As the data indicates, it was not possible to compute consistent intensity ratios for the amide (amide-II and I) peaks due to the irregular shifts and disappearances of some bands in the regions of interest. However, the data obtained from the analysis of residues indicated an increase in the intensities of the bands at vibration frequencies of 1692-1670 cm−1, 1630 cm−1, 1617-1612 cm−1, and enhancement of the bands at 1590-1585 cm−1 and 1050 cm−1. These bands are attributable to the formation of protein aggregates, as previously observed in grain and legume proteins (Carbonaro et al., 2012). This phenomenon was expected in the indigestible residue, as insoluble and indigestible materials mainly constituted them. Zein-based complexes are well known to resist degradation under gastric and intestinal environment but can be degraded in the colon due to the full range of colon microbiota (Liu et al., 2006). Generally, the treatment at extreme specific energy resulted in a higher loss of the peaks in both amide regions, suggesting the engagement of the protein in hydrogen bond formation. The ability of some film components to resist digestion in the small intestines may be beneficial in designing colon-specific delivery systems for bioactive material, since it may be susceptible to degradation in the colon (Liu et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2018) 3.2.3 Cytotoxicity of the products from in vitro digestion of ZCP films In vitro cytotoxicity of digested ZCP films was determined from both the supernatant and the residue by MTT assay. Fig. 10 A shows that there were no significant differences in the cell viabilities of PEF treated and untreated (p > 0.05) digests of the supernatant. The digest at 0 and 240 min gave cell viabilities of >75% suggesting low cytotoxic effects in the test environment (Liang et al., 2011; Dang et al., 2012). Processing of the films under PEF did not significantly alter their cytotoxic effects at the tested concentration. These findings are in agreement with previous studies indicating low cytotoxic effects of laboratory-developed ZN-based products (Chuacharoen and Sabliov, 2017). Chuacharoen and Sabliov (2017) observed high biocompatibility between ZN nanoparticles, including samples of folic-acid cross-linked materials with HeLa and A549 cells (an overexpressing folate receptor cells and a deficient folate receptor cells respectively). Yu et al. (2017) used MTT to investigate the cytotoxic effects of ZCP films. The films showed negligible cytotoxic effects against L929 cells (mouse lung fibroblasts), which was attributed to the enhancement of cell proliferation due to the hydrophilicity of CS. Hydrophilic moieties on polymer chains (e.g. chitosan) increases the adsorption and adhesion of cells onto the polymer, which enhances their proliferation and growth (Yu et al., 2017). Residual products comprising a large proportion of insoluble matter have been least evaluated for their characteristics and cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity results for the undigested residue were summarised in Fig. 10B. The residue comprises indigestible film components as well as an enrichment of the enzymes after centrifugation. All experiments were conducted using 1 mg/mL residue in the feed media as determined in a preliminary investigation and previous investigation (Kanwar and Kanwar, 2009). The residues obtained at 0 min during intestinal digestion showed ~75% cell viability suggesting a low cytotoxic effect. The sampling at t = 0 involved the samples in the gastric phase immediately after peptic digestion, thus lacked the pancreatic enzymes and bile salts. PEF treatment did not influence the cytotoxic effect of the residue. However, at 240 min, the residue gave ≤30% cell viability suggesting a significant increase in the cytotoxicity compared to the samples at t = 0 min. As the variation between the residue at t = 0 min and t = 240 min was the incorporation of pancreatic enzymes and bile salts during intestinal digestion phase, the resulting cytotoxicity after 240 min was attributable to the cocktail of enzymes in the pancreatic digestion products. Due to the interference from the enzymes, it was difficult to conclude on the potential cytotoxicity of undigested films against Hepa-1c1c7 cells. While the undigested residue affected proliferation and growth of the cells, the data presented little evidence of the toxicity of the films since the cytotoxicity assay involved the liver cells, which would not normally encounter the undigested residue. Thus, a study investigating the cytotoxic effect of the films on gastrointestinal cells with consideration of the residence time of the food bolus in the gastrointestinal tract, including the colonic medium, is recommended."
13,Conclusions,"In this study, pulsed electric fields at a specific energy of 50–60, 385–400 and 600–620 kJ/kg were applied in the treatment of ZCP film-forming dispersions. PEF-induced changes were evaluated using degradation in simulated gastrointestinal electrolyte solutions and simulated digestion at the respective pH of the solutions at 37 °C. Extended duration at the final degradation stage (simulated intestinal environment) showed significant increases in the protein hydrolysis and breakdown of film microstructure. However, the applied PEF conditions did not significantly modify the processes of degradation. Structurally, we obtained a clear indication of PEF induced modifications of the chemical groups in the products of both electrolyte degradation and enzymatic digestion processes. The high correlation between the available amino groups and the specific ratios of chemical groups in the amide-II and –I justified the monitoring of protein hydrolysis as an index of changes introduced to the ZCP film microstructure. Nevertheless, the PEF-induced modifications to the chemical groups of the films did not influence the cytotoxic effects of the films against the viability of Hepa-1c1c7. The residues from enzymatic degradation process comprising of the insoluble complex from the film and enzymes showed cytotoxicity effect against Hepa-1c1c7 cell line. However, compared to the residue obtained after the gastric digestion phase, the observed cytotoxic effect was attributable to the cocktail of enzyme present in at the end of the digestion at 240 min. Therefore, the results of the cytotoxic effect of the undigested film after 240 min were inconclusive. However, PEF treatment did not influence the chemical groups in the residue and the resulting inhibitory effect."
