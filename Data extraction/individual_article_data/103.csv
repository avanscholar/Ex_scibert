0,Introduction,"The consumption of fossil fuel keeps increasing with some concern of how long it would last as well as its impact on global warming [1–5]. Various renewable resources including agricultural lignocellulosic biomass becomes increasingly recognized as a valuable feedstock for biofuel and biochemical production due to its abundance and renewability [6–10]. Gamma-valerolactone (GVL), a biomass-derived chemical is a non-toxic and versatile organic compound which could be employed as a starting material or a solvent in energy and polymer industries [11–17]. Generally, GVL is produced via hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) or its esters [18–33]. Good number of reports have demonstrated great potential of LA as a starting material for GVL production. For examples, Cervantes and García showed that GVL could be produced from LA successfully after 24 h using Ru nanoparticle catalyst at 130 °C [19]. Yan and Chen found that Cu-Fe showed good activity on GVL production from LA at 200 °C for 10 h [20]. Moreover, a high GVL yield obtained from LA conversion over Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at 250 °C after 6 h was also reported by Obregón et al. [21]. However, due to the fact that levulinic acid could not be separated easily from its acid matrix that used in an extraction process from biomass feedstock, its esters were then becoming more suitable choices for GVL production [9,27]. In addition, methyl levulinate has been suggested as one of the most suitable esters for GVL production over metal catalysts [34–36]. Conventionally, H2 gas is used directly as a hydrogen source for hydrogenation of LA or its esters which is not favorable considering its risk of explosion from exothermic heat under high reaction pressures [18,20,21]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), on the other hand, is more preferable because of its endothermic nature and its low reaction pressure caused by a replacement of hydrogen gas with organic compounds which could promote superior product selectivity [28,29,31,19–33,35–37]. Particularly, effective catalysts play the most important role in CTH for accelerating conversion of feedstock and controlling high product yield. In general, Ru-based materials were reported as efficient noble metal catalysts for conversion of LA or its esters to GVL [19,26]. Non-noble metal-based catalysts including nickel, cobalt, copper, chromium, iron or their alloys have also been reported as alternative catalysts for hydrogenation of LA or its esters to GVL as well as other related reactions [18,20–25,27–29,31,32,50]. Among many works reported recently, Song et al. demonstrated an effective Ni/NiO composite catalyst for GVL production from LA. They found that the metal/oxide active sites is the key for its high activity [50]. Another work by Ashok et al. suggested that a suitable loading of CuO promoted a hydrogen spillover effect which could decrease NiO reduction temperature to metallic nickel [38]. Furthermore, our previous report on methyl levulinate (ML) conversion over Ni-Cu-O catalyst indicated that the nickel and copper mixed metal oxides could be employed as catalysts for GVL production [51]. Additionally, Said et al. had reported that CuONiO nanocomposites were effective catalysts for 2-propanol dehydrogenation due to enhancement of electrical conductivity and basicity [49]. This good agreement from the previous reports of copper mixed oxides or composites on their promising catalytic performance in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions is advantageous for the catalyst design in CTH. The purpose of this work is; therefore, to integrate the hydrogen spillover effect of CuO with various alcohols as reducing agents for activation of copper mixed metal oxide catalysts and to propose their reaction mechanism for GVL production. A systematic study of catalyst reduction behaviors using Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), alcohol-assisted simultaneous reaction (ASR), in situ X-ray diffraction (in situ XRD) reduction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were combined with the catalytic performance of GVL production. The obtained knowledge from this work could lead us to a new catalysis concept of simultaneously activated catalysts (SACs) for advanced catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All metal nitrate salts were purchased from Ajax Finchem Pty Ltd. with minimum purity of 98%. Metal oxide and their Cu–based mixed metal oxides were simply prepared by thermal decomposition of metal nitrate salts. For metal oxide preparation, a chosen nitrate salt of 0.042 mol of each metal was dissolved in 10 ml of DI water. While a mixture of 0.021:0.021 mol ratio of Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O and one of the other metal (Ni, Co, Cr, or Fe) nitrate was selected for Cu–base mixed metal oxide preparation. After dissolution of metal salts in DI water, the sample was dried and calcined at 800 °C for 5 h in air and collected after cooling down at room temperature."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Powder X–ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples from both conventional and in situ experiments were analyzed by an X–ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Ltd., Germany) using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA over the 2θ range of 10 < 2θ < 80 °. For the in situ experiment, the sample was heated with a heating rate of 12 °C /min under hydrogen atmosphere (99.99%) at the flow rate of 20 ml/min from room temperature to 600 °C on a Rh–Pt alloy substrate. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out using CHEMBET–Pulsar Quantachrome Instruments (Germany) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The catalyst (20 mg) was reduced in 5 vol% H2 in argon at a flow rate of 30 ml/min with a heating rate of 10 °C /min from room temperature to 800 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using PHI 5000 Versaprobe II (ULVAC-PHI, Inc., Japan). The obtained data was fitted and interpreted using XPSPEAK4.1 program."
4,Evaluation of catalytic properties,"2.3 Evaluation of catalytic properties All catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 130 ml stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer (500 rpm). 0.58 ml of methyl levulinate (ML), 24 ml of alcohol, and 1 g of a metal oxide or mixed metal oxide catalyst were loaded in an autoclave and heated up to 200 °C with heating rate of 5 °C /min. A liquid sample analyzed by gas chromatograph using a flame ionization detector or GC-FID (GC–2010, Shimadzu, Japan) and a mass spectrometry detector or GC–MS (GCMS–QP2020, Shimadzu, Japan), and a capillary column (DB–WAX, Agilent technologies, USA) with 30 m in length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness). The methyl levulinate conversion and the GVL product yield were calculated using the following equations: (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = m o l e o f c o n s u m e d M L m o l e o f i n i n i t i a l M L × 100 (2) Y i e l d % = m o l e o f p r o d u c e d G V L t h e o r e t i c a l m o l e o f G V L × 100 The numbers of mole of ML and GVL were obtained from the peak area analysis using GC–FID while other by–products were detected by GC–MS. Hydrogen content remaining in the reaction was calculated according to the ideal gas law. In brief, the final pressure was recorded after the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. The value of remaining pressure in atm was then subjected to Eq. (3). (3) n = P V R T where V = 0.1 l (actual volume of the reactor), R = 0.08206 L.atm/(mol.K) and T = 298.15 K. The gas was later analyzed using micro-GC for acquiring purity of hydrogen (CP 4900, Agilent Technologies, USA) and multiplied with the calculated total mole number of remaining gas."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance Single phase metal oxides and mixed metal oxides catalysts were compared for GVL production from ML. Initially, five single phase metal oxides including CuO, NiO, Co3O4, Cr2O3, and Fe2O3 were tested as catalysts for production of gamma–valerolactone (GVL) from methyl levulinate (ML) by catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) in a 2–propanol (2-PrOH) system. Their crystal structure information can be found in Fig. S2 and their surface area was shown in Table S1. Catalytic evaluation results of these metal oxides showed neither catalytic behavior toward 2-propanol dehydrogenation nor GVL production at 200 °C during the reaction period of 3 h. These results were supported by unchanged reaction pressures caused by 2-propanol evaporation and undetectable or negligible hydrogen gas, acetone, methanol, or GVL throughout the course of the reactions. Consecutively, the four Cu–based mixed oxides were employed as catalysts giving catalytic results provided in Fig. 1 a. CuNiO showed high catalytic property which was in good agreement with our previous report [51]. The order of catalytic performance in terms of ML conversion and GVL yield is as follows; CuNiO > CuCoO > CuCrO > CuFeO. The superior catalytic properties of CuNiO and CuCoO catalysts are in accordance with those nickel and cobalt catalysts reported in other studies, namely Raney-nickel [28,29], Ni/Al2O3 [23,25], and Co-based catalysts [24,27]. The formation of H2 was labelled as amount of remaining hydrogen in Fig. 1a. For the CuNiO catalyst, it was quite obvious that both 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and ML hydrogenation could take place effectively. CuCoO and CuCrO also showed similar behavior to CuNiO but with less catalytic activity. On the other hand, CuFeO did not show high ML conversion but gave almost the same amount of remaining H2 as that of CuNiO. This indicated that CuFeO catalyst tended to be an active catalyst for 2-PrOH dehydrogenation but was not effective for ML hydrogenation. XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after the reaction were also shown in Fig. 1b and c. It could be seen that CuO was completely reduced to Cu metal while NiO was partially reduced to Ni metal after the reaction. As it was reported by Song et al. on their study in GVL production from LA using Ni/NiO composite catalyst. They found that the reactant was more likely to adsorb on the NiO sites while the H2 molecules preferred to stay on the Ni metallic sites. Therefore, the presence of Ni/NiO structure could enhance the catalytic perfamance [50]. In this work, although ML was used as a reactant instead of LA, the Ni/NiO phase with the presence of Cu metal could provide efficient GVL production. The XRD pattern of CuCoO showed complete reduction of both CuO to metallic Cu and Co3O4 to metallic Co, respectively. The conversion of ML over this catalyst was around 80%. Zhou et al. had used metallic Co, Ni, and Fe for conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL. They found that metallic cobalt was the most active catalyst for GVL production [27]. The CuCrO catalyst showed moderate catalytic activity for both 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and ML conversion. According to the study of Yan and Chen, they found that Cu-Cr catalyst with the 1:2 ratio of Cu2+/Cr3+ was an active catalyst for the conventional hydrogenation of LA to GVL using H2 gas of 70 bar at 200 °C for 10 h [18]. They suggested that Cu2+ had an important role for H2 dissociation where the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio significantly influenced the effectiveness of hydrogenation. In this work only 1:1 ratio of Cu2+/Cr3+ was employed under the reaction pressure below 40 bar (generated from the 2-PrOH and its produced H2) only for 3 h. It might be the unsuitable Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio, lower reaction pressure and shorter reaction time that was responsible for its lower activity. The XRD pattern after reaction of CuCrO catalyst represented in Fig. 1c showed 2 phases of Cu metal and CuCr2O4 which was different from the spent Cu-Cr catalyst reported by Yan and Chen. The higher catalyst reduction temperature used in their work and the low reduction temperature in this work could lead to the phase difference. CuFeO catalyst did not show high activity towards GVL production but provided large amount of hydrogen gas. Yan and Chen also studied the Cu-Fe catalyst for GVL production from LA which indicated that the optimum Cu2+/Fe3+ ratio was 1:1 under H2 pressure of 70 bar at 200 °C for 10 h. Although the Cu2+/Fe3+ ratio from this work and their work were similar but the lower reaction pressure and shorter reaction time in this work could result in its lower catalytic activity. In addition, the Cu-Fe and CuFeO catalysts after reaction showed different phases. The spent Cu-Fe had two phases of CuFe2O4 and CuFeO2 while the spent CuFeO contained Cu metal and Fe3O4 phases. Hence, the synergy of various oxidation states (Cu°, Fe2+, Fe3+ and O2−) in Cu and F3O4 system during the dehydrogenation process should be responsible for its good H2 production. Additionally, substrates for GVL production, besides methyl levulinate were expanded to levulinic acid, ethyl levulinate, and butyl levulinate over the NiCuO catalyst. The results shown in Table S7 suggested that conversion of other feedstocks or GVL product could barely be detected after 3 h of the reaction at 200 °C. This indicated that the NiCuO catalyst is highly selective toward methyl levulinate substrate."
7,Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),"3.2 Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) To further elucidate the reduction behaviors associated with the catalytic performance of the Cu–based mixed oxide catalysts and their host metal oxides, the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2–TPR) was conducted and the results were shown in Fig. 2 , where their peak areas were displayed in Table S2.CuO catalyst showed a large bell peak at 439 °C representing a complete reduction from Cu2+ to Cu° showing a good agreement with that reported by Tang et al. [39]. NiO catalyst showed a major reduction peak at 500 °C suggesting a reduction of Ni2+ to Ni° as reported by Sá et al. [40] and Zhu et al. [41]. In addition, an appearance of a low intensity flat curve at around 620 °C could be related to a difficultly reduced species of high crystalline NiO (Fig. S2). Co3O4 catalyst showed only one broadly asymmetric reduction peak at 514 °C which was similar to that reported by James and Maity [42]. Fe2O3 catalyst was reduced at two different temperatures of 506 and 665 °C, in accordance with studies by Valenzuela et al. [43] and Liang et al. [44]. In contrast, there was a small peak observed at around 380 °C in Cr2O3 catalyst. This result was different from Cr2O3 reduction behavior reported by Amrute et al. [45] and Bai et al. [46]. They mentioned that the reduction process of Cr2O3 underwent two steps including Cr6+ to Cr3+ at lower temperature and Cr3+ to Cr2+ at higher temperature. Hence, a very small reduction peak found in this work of the Cr2O3 catalyst could be attributed to the reduction of small portion of Cr6+ presented in Cr2O3 to Cr3+. Moreover, it was clear that all five single phase metal oxides catalysts prepared in this work showed smaller degree of reduction or appeared at higher reduction temperature compared to the similar metal oxides synthesized at lower calcination temperatures in other reports. The inferior reduction behavior of all metal oxides which resulted in a lack of their active metallic sites lead to their poor catalytic performance towards GVL production. Further investigation in the H2-TPR study of the copper mixed oxide catalysts indicated that each catalyst had at least two reduction peaks as shown in Fig. 2b. The CuNiO catalyst showed two main reduction peaks at 408 and 440 °C with a very broadly flat curve at around 700 °C. As it could be observed in the corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 1b), two phases of CuO and NiO were presented in the CuNiO catalyst. The first reduction peak belonged to the reduction of CuO to metallic copper (Cu°) while the second peak was assigned to the reduction of NiO to metallic nickel (Ni°). CuCoO showed three reduction peaks at 353, 427, and 449 °C. Based on the XRD pattern of CuCoO catalyst shown in Fig. 1b, this catalyst had two major phases of CuO and CuCo(Co2O4) spinel. Therefore, the first small peak at the lowest temperature should be assigned to the easily reduced CuO phase while the peak at 427 °C should correspond to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu° and Co3+ to Co2+ in the spinel structure. The highest reduction peak at 449 °C belonged to the reduction of Co2+ to metallic Co [47]. Interestingly, XRD pattern of CuCrO showed two different phases of CuO and Cu(Cr2O4) spinel without the presence of Cr2O3 phase. This meant that the formation of copper oxide and chromium oxide could alter the oxidation states of chromium. In addition, TPR profile of CuCrO displayed two overlapped peaks at 345 and 383 °C as well as another broad peak at 660 °C. The first peak at 345 °C was attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ in CuO to Cu°. The second peak at 383 °C was a reduction of Cu2+ in the Cu(Cr2O4) spinel to Cu° and the last peak at 660 °C was attributed to the reduction of Cr3+ in Cu(Cr2O4) spinel to Cr2+. Lastly, CuFeO also showed three reduction peaks at 411, 483, and 661 °C while its XRD pattern in Fig. 1b showed three phases of CuO, Cu(Fe2O4) and Fe2O3. The first peak at 411 °C indicated the reduction of Cu2+ in CuO to Cu°. A shoulder appeared at around 450 °C could be assigned to the reduction of Fe3+ in Fe2O3 to Fe2+ in a spinel Fe3O4. A very small peak shown at 483 °C could represent the reduction of Cu2+ in Cu(Fe2O4). Finally, the broad asymmetric peak at 661 °C could both be attributed to the partial reduction of Fe3+ in Cu(Fe2O4) to Fe2+ in (CuFe)(Fe2O4) spinel and the complete reduction from Fe3+ in both rhombohedral and spinel structures to FeO and/or Fe°. In brief, the CuNiO was composed of two separated phases of CuO and NiO; however, the reduction temperature of both CuO and NiO were lower than their host metal oxides. On the other hand, the addition of copper oxide to the cobalt oxide (CuCoO) created the new phase of CuCo(Co2O4) spinel structure while maintaining the CuO phase but without the presence of pure the Co3O4 phase. The reduction profile of CuCoO indicated that CuO could be reduced at low temperature. The formation of copper oxide and chromium oxide created the more reducible phase of Cu(Cr2O4). Finally, the formation of copper and iron mixed metal oxides (CuFeO) could create the new CuFe2O4 phase but still maintained their host metal oxides of CuO and Fe2O3. All reductions of Cu2+ and Fe3+ were shifted to lower temperatures. In all cases, the reducibility of metal ions were improved after the mixed oxide formation with copper oxide. The alteration of catalyst redox behaviors was strongly related to the enhanced catalytic performance."
8,Alcohols-assisted simultaneous reaction evaluation (ASR),"3.3 Alcohols-assisted simultaneous reaction evaluation (ASR) With the consistent results among XRD, H2-TPR, and catalytic performance evaluation, it could be confirmed that the CuNiO was the most effective catalyst for GVL production from ML. Subsequently, various alcohols including aliphatic primary alcohols (ethanol, EtOH and 1-propanol, 1-PrOH), aliphatic secondary alcohols (2-propanol, 2-PrOH and 2-butanol, 2-BuOH), and a cyclic secondary alcohol (cyclohexanol, CyOH) were selected for catalytic testing to verify effect of alcohol types on GVL production over the CuNiO catalyst. Catalytic results presented in Fig. 3 a showed that the secondary alcohols were more suitable than primary alcohols in this reaction. EtOH and 1–PrOH gave about 30% of ML conversion and less than 10% of GVL yield. Formation of a stronger bond between the catalyst active sites and alkoxide species generated from the primary alcohol compared to that of the secondary alcohol could support the ineffectiveness of the primary alcohols [30]. On the other hand, the aliphatic secondary alcohols (2-PrOH and 2-BuOH) showed drastically better catalytic activity than the cyclic secondary alcohol (CyOH). This was due to a high adsorption tendency of CyOH over the catalyst surface [30]. In addition, its high viscosity (Table S4) could also affect ML dispersion in the solution which lowered ML conversion. In addition, the efficiency of CyOH in GVL production from ML reported here was different from the GVL production from EL reported by Cai et al. [32]. Although similar CuNi-based catalysts were employed in both studies, alcohol had additional role in facilitating metal oxide reduction in our investigation. A very low amount of H2 generated after reaction as shown in Fig. 3a indicated that CyOH has low tendency for hydrogen production. Both 2–PrOH and 2–BuOH provided high ML conversion and more than 95% of GVL yield which is in good agreement with the previous reports [28–32]. In addition, the highest remaining hydrogen amount was obtained in the 2–PrOH system. As mentioned above, generated hydrogen species from alcohol could perform as a reducing agent for the activation of metal oxide catalyst to generate metal active sites. Phase alteration of CuNiO catalyst after reactions in various alcohols was determined by XRD technique as shown in Fig. 3b. In the primary alcohol system, Cu metal phase was formed with the presence of CuO and NiO. Aliphatic secondary alcohols; on the other hand, showed higher degree of catalyst reduction where metallic nickel was also observed. Surprisingly, although low ML conversion, low GVL yield, and low H2 production were observed in CyOH system (Fig. 3a) both metallic Cu and Ni were generated after the reaction. This means that the CyOH could reduce CuNiO catalyst. However, its strong adsorption on the catalyst as well as its high viscosity could be the reasons for its ineffective role in GVL production."
9,In situ XRD reduction: Role of CuO in copper mixed metal oxide catalysts,"3.4 In situ XRD reduction: Role of CuO in copper mixed metal oxide catalysts To confirm and gain more insight information on the reducibility enhancement of CuO addition in the copper mixed oxide catalysts, the CuNiO was further selected for an in situ XRD reduction experiment in comparison with the CuO and NiO catalysts. [53] Phase transformation of each catalyst was recorded while the catalyst was reduced under pure hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperature. The in situ reduction of CuNiO result shown in Fig. 4 a indicated that CuO was reduced to form metallic copper at around 150 °C, following by NiO reduction to form metallic nickel at around 155 °C. While the reduction profile of CuO shown in Fig. 4b indicated that Cu metal was created when the temperature reached 130 °C. The reduction behavior of NiO was displayed in Fig. 4c where Ni metal was generated at 200 °C. It can be seen that CuO phase in the CuO catalyst was reduced to Cu metal at lower temperature than CuO in CuNiO while NiO phase in the NiO catalyst was reduced at higher temperature than that of the CuNiO catalyst. The shift of CuO reduction temperature to higher temperature (from 130 to 150 °C) and the shift of NiO reduction temperature to lower temperature (from 200 to 155 °C) was an important evidence of the complementary reduction between CuO and NiO in this catalyst. In addition, the occurrence of CuO and NiO reduction temperatures in the CuNiO catalyst at a very close values (150 and 155 °C, respectively) could support that there was a good interaction between these two oxides in the structure. In brief, the in situ XRD results obtained here could confirm the spillover effect of hydrogen species from the created Cu metal to its neighboring NiO for generating nickel metal active sites at lower temperature."
10,Reusability and versatility of the catalyst,"3.5 Reusability and versatility of the catalyst The spent CuNiO catalyst was employed for four more times for the GVL production. The results depicted in Fig. 5 a revealed that this catalyst showed only a small decrease in terms of ML conversion and GVL yield after the fourth time. The XRD patterns of the fresh and the 4th reuse of the catalyst were shown in Fig. 5b. It indicated that the spent catalyst still had the same three phases including Cu metal, Ni metal, and NiO as it was reported earlier in Fig. 1c. The small decrease of the catalytic activity might be resulted from the fact that some metallic sites became agglomerated (Fig. S5). The number of phases existed in the CuNiO catalyst before and after the reaction led to a further challenge to find out whether the catalytic performance of the mechanically mixed CuO and NiO would be similar or different from that of the CuNiO catalyst as well as its completely reduced form (alloy). The comparative results of the three scenarios were shown in Fig. 5c. The mechanically mixed CuO + NiO catalyst gave 17% of ML conversion with negligible GVL yield and H2 production. The improvement in terms of ML conversion compared with the inactive CuO and NiO suggested that the presence of both CuO and NiO in the same system promoted the catalytic activity. The similar XRD patterns of the catalyst before and after reaction without the presence of reduced species (Cu or Ni metal) indicated that the oxide phases in the mechanically mixed metal oxide catalyst might have some capability to accelerate ML conversion; however, metallic sites were required for producing GVL (Fig. 5d). On the other hand, a completely reduced CuNiO labelled as CuNi_alloy showed only one single phase of CuNi alloy. Surprisingly, this alloy catalyst showed comparable ML conversion and GVL yield to those of the pristine CuNiO catalyst. These results suggested that the ML could be converted either on mixed metal oxides or metal/alloy active sites, however, the high selectivity of GVL product preferred the suitable ratio of metal oxides/metallic active sites. In addition, in terms of H2 production, the alloy catalyst was not comparable to the CuNiO catalyst suggesting that the 2-PrOH dehydrogenation preferably took place over the mixed metal oxide catalysts. Comparative H2-TPR results of the mechanically mixed CuO + NiO, CuNiO, CuO, and NiO catalysts were shown in Fig. S3. Higher reduction peaks of the mechanically mixed catalyst than that of the CuNiO could explain why there was no metal phase generated after the catalyst utilization. As it was described above, CuNiO showed its impressive catalytic activity in all forms namely, pristine mixed metal oxides (CuNiO), partially reduced composite (Cu + Ni/NiO), and completely reduced solid solution (CuNi alloy). This is the important proof to confirm that CuNiO was a versatile catalyst for GVL production."
11,Metal valences and surface species,"3.6 Metal valences and surface species To gain more understanding about good performance of the mixed metal oxide catalyst, the Cu/Ni molar ratio of 1.00 and 1.03 were observed in the pristine CuNiO and CuNi_alloy catalysts by using XRF method, respectively (Table S6). Surface analysis results using XPS technique of the pristine CuNiO, spent CuNiO, and CuNiO after 4th reuse were compared in Fig. 6 . According to the Cu2p spectra (Fig. 6a–c), the pristine CuNiO was originally composed of CuO and Cu(OH)2. After its first use, CuO was completely transformed to Cu metal, while the Cu(OH)2 was still existed. The 4th reuse catalyst also showed these two species but with higher Cu metal/Cu(OH)2 peak ratio. Ni2p spectra (Fig. 6d–f) also showed two species of NiO and Ni(OH)2 in the pristine catalyst while the Ni metal was observed along with these two species both in the spent and 4th reuse catalysts. The O1s spectra (Fig. 6 g, h, i) showed good agreement with the Cu2p and Ni2p results on their surface metal oxides and metal hydroxides formation. Additionally the high binding energy at around 532.6–532.7 eV in the spent catalyst and the 4th reuse samples indicated the physically adsorbed water and/or organic compounds (i.e. ML, GVL, 2-PrOH) over NiO species. This could be implied that the NiO was an important site for ML or 2-PrOH adsorption during the ML conversion to GVL. The XPS results revealed various types of surface species including Cu, Ni, CuO, NiO, Cu(OH)2, and Ni(OH)2. While the CuO was found in the pristine catalyst but disappeared after its first use in the reaction. The role of CuO was consistent with the in situ XRD results stated above for facilitating NiO reduction at low temperature. The mutual presence of Cu, Ni, NiO, Cu(OH)2, and Ni(OH)2 on the surface were responsible for high catalytic performance of CuNiO catalyst. There was a report by Tang et al. that CuO in form of nanostructure could be also employed as catalysts for GVL production from ML in the presence of methanol directly without catalyst pretreatment [54]. An investigation by combining the findings of their work and the current study to prepare nanostructured mixed metal oxides catalysts for more effective GVL production could be an interesting aspect to conduct in the future."
12,Proposed mechanism of alcohol-assisted simultaneous activated copper mixed oxide catalysts for GVL production,"3.7 Proposed mechanism of alcohol-assisted simultaneous activated copper mixed oxide catalysts for GVL production Generally, catalytic transfer hydrogenation mechanism over heterogeneous catalysts can take place either through direct catalytic transfer (MPV) or metal hydride mechanism depending on catalyst active sites [29–31,37, 48]. If both Lewis acid and Brønsted basic sites are presented next to each other on the catalyst, the reaction would undergo via MPV mechanism. On the other hand, the reaction would proceed through the metal hydride mechanism if only a Lewis acid or the metal active site is presented. Therefore, in this work, it is worth proposing a reaction mechanism of ML to GVL conversion over the CuNiO catalyst to clarify its simultaneous reduction behavior and promising catalytic performance under 2-PrOH system (Scheme 1 ). As it was shown in Fig. S4, CuNiO showed the highest acidity compared with other mixed metal oxide catalysts while the acidity could be doubled after the reduction of CuNiO to form CuNi alloy. Moreover, the CO2-TPD results (Fig. S4c and d) also confirmed that the CuNi alloy has the highest basicity (Table S3). This data could strongly support that the catalytic performance of ML conversion to GVL is not only dependent on catalysts’ reducibility but also their acid and base properties. Typically, two major steps including (1) alcohol dehydrogenation to activate surface of the catalyst and (2) hydrogenation of ML followed by simultaneous cyclization to produce GVL. In the first major step, 2-propanol was oxidized over a mixed metal oxide catalyst (containing both Lewis acid and Brønsted base sites) to form 2-propoxide on the catalyst surface [52] (step i). This dehydrogenated intermediate generated hydrogen species and acetone via direct catalytic transfer or MPV mechanism (step ii). Then, the hydrogen species reduced metal oxides surface simultaneously to form metal active sites (Lewis acid) and this process generated water (Table S5) which could partially reoxidize the metals to metal hydroxides. After ML was inserted to the active metal sites (step iii) under adequate reaction pressure resulted from generated hydrogen gas and alcohol vapor at 200 °C, ML could then spontaneously react with adsorbed hydrogen species on the catalyst surface to form methyl gamma-hydroxypentanoate (GHP) adsorbed on the surface (step iv) [29–31,37]. Some of this intermediate could be eliminated from the surface (step v) while the others underwent cyclization (step vii) leading to GVL production as well as methanol (MeOH) formation (step viii). The vacant active sites were then filled with 2-propanol (step ix) to generate active hydrogen species after 2-propanol dehydrogenation (step x) and acetone elimination (step xi). This led to an active site ready for the next cycle of GVL production. Due to the fact that there were less number of Lewis acid (metal or alloy) than Brønsted base (species on the catalyst active sites at the beginning of the reaction, both alcohol dehydrogenation and GVL production preferably underwent trough MPV mechanism [37]. However, after the first cycle of reaction both MPV and metal hydride are crucial pathways for 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and ML hydrogenation."
13,Conclusions,"The catalytic transfer hydrogenation was successfully employed in both activation of copper mixed oxide catalysts and production of GVL consecutively. By using H2-TPR technique, alcohol-assisted reduction evaluation (ASR), in-situ XRD reduction, and XPS analysis, it was evident that the good synergistic behaviour between the secondary alcohols and the H2 spillover effect in copper mixed oxide catalysts is the key for the superior catalytic performance. All catalysts showed potential performance for GVL production from ML in the 2-PrOH system at 200 °C within 3 h. The most efficient catalyst, CuNiO could be recycled up to four times with only slight decrease of GVL yield. The reaction mechanism in alcohol dehydrogenation and ML hydrogenation underwent through both MPV and metal hydride routes. The discovery in this work could pave the way for a new sustainable concept in catalysis over simultaneously activated mixed metal oxide catalysts."
