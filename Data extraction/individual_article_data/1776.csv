0,Introduction,"The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier can reduce the effects of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. However, since hydrogen is not found naturally, it can be produced by the use of several technologies such as steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming from different feedstock (hydrocarbons like methane and gasoline, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol), and the electrolysis of water. But with the current technologies, the large amounts of hydrogen required in a hydrogen-oriented economy cannot be adequately produced and delivered. To overcome this barrier, a hydrogen infrastructure should be implemented, such as small fuel processors at the refueling stations and stationary power generation plants, which can be attractive in near- to mid-term approach for supplying hydrogen as an energy carrier [1]. One of these technologies, which can be a desirable candidate for the stationary power generation plants, is the gasification process under supercritical conditions that has shown a great potential for the conversion of hydrocarbons or biomass with high moisture content to produce hydrogen and other combustible gases. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has recently received much attention as a potential alternative to energy conversion methods applied to aqueous/non-aqueous biomass sources [2–4] or fossil fuels such as coal [5], due to the unique physical properties of water above its critical conditions (i.e. 374.8°C and 22.1MPa). Since both H3O+ and OH− ions are formed due to the self-dissociation of water at temperatures of near-critical and supercritical point, water behaves not only as a reaction medium but also as a reaction participant [6,7]. Moreover, since organic compounds have complete miscibility and a high solubility in supercritical water, chemical reactions with high efficiencies and without interfacial transport limitations can be obtained in the case of water-organic mixtures [8]. Extensive investigations have been conducted in the recent years on non-catalytic [9–12] or catalytic [13–15] hydrogen production in supercritical water medium, which included model compounds such as glucose, cellulose, lignin and some real biomass compounds [2–4]. The use of alkali and alkaline-earth metal compounds as a catalyst to promote hydrogen production from biomass is an important research interest [16–18]. However, it was reported that the main chemistries involved in this process in a batch reactor have not been quite understood [16]. Many researchers have tested the effect of different catalysts such as Al2O3, TiO2, MnO, ZrO2 or C supported Pt, Ni, Ru, Rh and Pd for hydrogen production from different feedstocks [19]. However, these catalysts exhibit different catalytic activity or gas composition depending on the feedstock used. On the other hand, Guo et al. [20] have reported that metal oxides and noble metals such as CeO2, nano-CeO2 and nano-(ZrCe) x O2 are not good SCWG catalysts for hydrogen production because of their low activities, and emphasized the need for additional studies that provide a systematic assessment of different catalysts for different feedstocks. In this work, hydrogen production from 2-propanol over Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts was studied in supercritical conditions of water. 2-propanol, which is one of the isomeric secondary alcohols, is usually produced by the hydration of propylene made from petroleum. Since 2-propanol can also be produced by the traditional fermentative pathways from glucose using microbes such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae [21], we preferred it as a feedstock. The gasification yields and the gaseous effluent compositions were investigated in the temperature range of 400–550°C and the reaction time range of 10–30s, under a pressure of 25MPa. In addition, different 2-propanol concentrations and reaction pressures were tested in order to comprehend their effects on the gasification yield and hydrogen composition."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 were supplied commercially (Alfa Aesar) and used without further processing. SEM photos and content analyses of the catalysts are showed in Fig. 1 . SEM images were obtained from scanning electron microscope (JEOL-5410LV) using Bath Scatter Electron Detector and Secondary Electron Detector. XRF spectrums were obtained using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). 2-propanol (Merck) was used in the experiments after it was diluted with deionized water to the desired concentrations.
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Catalytic gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water was performed in a packed bed reactor system as showed in Fig. 2 . The experimental apparatus consisted of a packed bed reactor (10cm length×2cm i.d.) and a pre-heating line (50cm×4.35mm i.d.), which were placed into a PID controlled split furnace (Protherm). The weights of Pt/Al2O3 (d cat =1.96g/cm3) and Ru/Al2O3 (d cat =1.82g/cm3) used in the reactor were 33.4g and 25g, and their shapes were in spherical form and in cylindrical form, respectively. From the feed pump to the gas-liquid separator, all of the wetted parts of the system were made of 316 SS. 2-Propanol solution in desired concentration was pumped into the pre-heating zone and the reactor placed in the furnace by using a high-pressure pump (Autoclave Engineers). The feed flow rates that adjust the chosen reaction time, which is the amount of time the 2-propanol solution spends inside the reactor, were calculated according to Eq. (1). The temperature of the 2-propanol solution was provided to reach the desired value by passing through the pre-heating zone, before coming upon the catalyst in the reactor. At the exit of the furnace, the effluent was cooled rapidly by a heat exchanger and the possible reactions immediately stopped. The system pressure was maintained at the desired value in a precision of ±0.1MPa by a back pressure regulator (GO Regulator Inc.). The products leaving the back pressure regulator were separated by a gas–liquid separator. The gaseous effluent taken from the top of the separator was transported for quantitative analysis to a gas chromatograph capable of online sampling. After gas sampling, the flow rate of the gaseous effluent produced was measured at each experiment by a digital volumetric gas flow meter (Agilent, ADM2000), the ratio of which to the feed flow rate was used to determine the gasification yield. On the other hand, the samples taken from the liquid effluent were subjected to Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyses, with the aim of determining their organics contents. The difference between the TOC value of the 2-propanol feedstock and that of the liquid sample obtained after an experiment was used to calculate the TOC conversion for a specific reaction condition, which informs about the carbon conversion taking place during gasification, according to Eq. (2)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The gas samples were analyzed according to ASTM D1945, ASTM D1946, ASTM D2597 and DIN 51872-4 methods, through a Perkin Elmer, Clarus 500 RGA-1115 model GC coupled with two TCD and one FID detectors. The concentrations of the 2-propanol solutions and liquid phase reactor effluents were characterized in terms of their TOC concentrations. TOC analyses were performed by using a total organic carbon-total nitrogen analyzer (Hagh-Lange), which was based on the combustion catalytic oxidation method and a highly sensitive multi-channel non-dispersive infrared detector was used."
5,Results and discussion,
6,General aspects,"3.1 General aspects Two different catalysts, namely Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3, were employed in the reactor for the catalytic hydrothermal gasification of 2-propanol. The gasification over Ru/Al2O3 was observed to be much more effective in terms of carbon conversion, as TOC conversion values up to 98 % were achieved even at low reaction times (Fig. 3 ). Though the gas composition varied at different reaction conditions during the catalytic gasification, it consisted mainly of hydrogen, propane, propylene, methane and carbon dioxide. Besides these components, scarce amounts of ethane, n-butane, i-butane, 1-butene, i-butene, t-2-butene and 1,3-butadiene were also obtained at some experimental conditions, but they were not taken into consideration for the general reaction pathway. The measurement of carbon dioxide in the gaseous products during chromatographic analyses demonstrated that in supercritical conditions, water participated to the catalytic reaction as a reactant dissociating to H3O+ and OH− ions. According to the components measured in gas analysis results at various reaction conditions, a possible mechanism for the reactions taking place is presented in Table 1 ."
7,The effects of reaction temperature and time,"3.2 The effects of reaction temperature and time During the gasification experiments, 0.5M dilute solutions of 2-propanol were used, with an initial TOC content of 18,000mg/L. Two different catalysts, namely Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3, were employed in the reactor. The experiments were performed in the temperature range of 400–550°C and in the reaction time range of 10–30s, under a constant pressure of 25MPa. With the aid of these experiments, it was aimed to find the effects of reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst type on the gasification yield and biofuel composition; and to determine the optimum conditions for hydrogen production. The reaction time at supercritical conditions was calculated according to the equation written as below: (1) τ = V Reactor F · ρ SC ( P , T ) ρ L where V Reactor is void volume of the packed bed reactor, ρ SC(P,T) and ρ L are the fluid densities in g/mL under reaction conditions and at feed pump conditions, respectively. F is the feed flow rate of 2-propanol solution in mL/s. Since the reaction media consisted of dilute mixtures of 2-propanol in water and no data were available for density of 2-propanol–water mixture at supercritical conditions, the fluid densities in the reactor at different reaction conditions were assumed to be those of pure water and the values were taken from the steam tables [22]. Fig. 3 shows the change of TOC conversion of the liquid effluent with temperature and time. The carbon conversion can be calculated as below: (2) Carbon conversion ( % ) = { 1 − TOC in liquid phase ( mg/L ) TOC in feedstock ( mg/L ) } × 100 A blank experiment that involved the direct gasification of 2-propanol without any catalysts was also carried out to observe the effect of catalyst use on gasification at 450°C. Accordingly, it can be seen that TOC conversion significantly increased when a catalyst was used and Ru/Al2O3 was much more effective on the gasification rate than Pt/Al2O3. For both catalysts, the gasification rate increased with temperature and reaction time. Fig. 3 also demonstrates that temperature had a more prominent effect on the gasification rate than that of reaction time. The gasification yield (Fig. 4 ), which stands for the amount of gaseous product obtained per the amount of 2-propanol solution fed to the reactor, also increased with reaction temperature and time. But this increase was higher for Ru/Al2O3 than for Pt/Al2O3. The maximum gasification yield was obtained as 27.2L/L feed, with the use of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at 550°C and 30s. The gasification yield with Pt/Al2O3 remained between about 5 and 7L/L feed. On the other hand, it was between 0.1 and 1L/L feed in the experiments conducted without any catalysts. Although Ru/Al2O3 exhibited much more catalytic activity for the gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water, its selectivity toward hydrogen production was not high enough when compared to Pt/Al2O3 in the experimental conditions we studied. As seen in Fig. 5 , its hydrogen selectivity remained at around 10%, whereas this value was between 1 and 2% at experiments made without using a catalyst. On the contrary, Pt/Al2O3 exhibited a very high selectivity toward hydrogen production, which was favored by low temperatures and fast reaction times. For example, the reaction conducted at 400°C and 10s yielded a gaseous effluent composed of 96% hydrogen and at this condition, the gasification yield was 4.73L/L feed. The hydrogen content of the gaseous effluent decreased with increasing reaction temperature and time, and the minimum amount of hydrogen, 15%, was obtained at 550°C and 30s. Fang et al. [23] have reported similar results on the gasification of glucose using Pt, Ni and Ru catalysts. They have observed that Pt is the most selective catalyst regarding hydrogen production when compared with Ni and Ru catalysts, and obtained a hydrogen rich gas with a 67-wt% gasification rate. Considering methane formation on the other hand, as seen in Fig. 6 , Ru/Al2O3 catalyst showed higher gasification activity toward methane. Accordingly, the methane content in the gaseous effluent decreased with increasing reaction temperature and time. Ru/Al2O3 favored methane formation according to the water gas shift reaction and methanation of CO reaction given in Table 1, which consumed a part of the hydrogen produced and eventually decreased the hydrogen yield. It has been presumed that oxygenated compounds containing hydroxyl groups adsorb to the catalytic Ru surface predominantly through one or more oxygen atoms [19]. First the reactant undergoes dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface, followed by subsequent cleavage of C–C or C–O bonds. Cleavage of C–C bonds leads to synthesis gas which is subjected to the water gas shift reaction and possible methanation reaction, while cleavage of C–O bonds gives organic acids and alcohols [19]. Considering carbon dioxide on the other hand, its content in the gaseous effluent increased with increasing reaction temperature and time. Moreover, neither propylene nor propane formation was not observed during the gasification of 2-propanol over Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. This situation shows that 2-propanol was converted to methane directly without any formation of propane and propylene due to the high catalytic activity of Ru/Al2O3, and then transformed to carbon dioxide and water, which are the final products. On the contrary, methane formation during the gasification of 2-propanol over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was observed at higher temperatures and longer reaction times (Fig. 6). The maximum amount of methane in the gaseous product was 40 %, which was obtained at 550°C with a reaction time of 30s, the conditions at which the hydrogen content was found to be minimum for this catalyst. Fig. 7 shows the change of propane and propylene during the gasification of 2-propanol over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and without any catalyst. In the blank experiments that were carried out without using a catalyst at 450°C, just propylene was detected in the gas product, but in fact, the gasification yield was not sufficient. On the other hand, during the gasification over Pt/Al2O3, remarkable amounts of propane and propylene were obtained. Actually, when Figs. 5–8 are discussed together for Pt/Al2O3, it can be observed that a serial reaction was carried out over the catalyst. If the reaction occurred at low temperatures and short reaction times, a hydrogen rich product was obtained. If the reaction temperature or time was increased gradually, a weighted product in order of hydrogen, propane, propylene, methane and carbon dioxide was obtained. The reaction pathway is considered to be carried out in order of the first seven equations given in Table 1. Youssef et al. [24] have also reported that Ru/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest gasification activity toward methane in their study on the catalytic gasification of oleic acid over various catalysts in supercritical water. At the same time, they have mentioned that Ru/Al2O3 and powder Ni/Silica-alumina surpassed the other catalysts in terms of hydrogen yield, which was four times higher than that without a catalyst. Byrd et al. [25] reported that Ru/Al2O3 was an effective catalyst for the production of hydrogen with low methane and carbon monoxide formation during the gasification of ethanol in supercritical water. In addition, they have suggested that the methanation reaction can be reduced by keeping low residence times and a high water-to-ethanol ratio in the feed. As mentioned by Guo et al. [20], catalysts exhibit different activity or gas composition according to feedstock used, and additional studies regarding hydrogen production by using different catalysts for different feedstocks should be made. Fig. 8 shows the change of carbon dioxide amounts in the gaseous product at different reaction conditions. As the temperature increased, the amount of carbon dioxide began to increase, having a maximum value at 550°C and 30s for each catalyst used. However, Ru/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a higher activity toward carbon dioxide than Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In the blank experiment made at 450°C, since the gas effluent consisted almost of propylene, carbon dioxide could not be detected."
8,The effect of feed concentration,"3.3 The effect of feed concentration To examine the effect of the feed concentration on the gasification of 2-propanol over Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3, a series of experiments were performed at 400°C and a residence time of 10s was chosen. The 2-propanol concentrations for the gasification over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst were settled as 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3mol/L, which correspond to 36, 54, 72, 90 and 108g/L of TOC value, respectively. Because of the high catalytic activity of Ru/Al2O3, the flow rate of the gaseous product happened to be very high in the separator of the system and did damages on the online sampling apparatus due to the overloading of the gas pressure. Therefore, 2-propanol concentrations for the gasification over Ru/Al2O3 catalyst were settled to be lower than those of Pt/Al2O3; as 0.5, 0.42, 0.33, 0.25 and 0.17mol/L, corresponding to 18, 15, 12, 9 and 6g/L of the TOC value, respectively. Fig. 9 shows the effect of increasing feed concentration on the gasification yield and TOC conversion for each catalyst used. As expected, the gasification yield and the carbon conversion increased with increasing concentration of 2-propanol solution fed to the system. Even though the feed concentrations were lower in the gasification over Ru/Al2O3, the changes in the gasification yield and carbon conversion were much faster when compared with those of Pt/Al2O3. Moreover, since the activity of Ru/Al2O3 was toward to the methanation reaction, the methane content of the gaseous effluent increased with increasing concentration of 2-propanol solution fed to the reactor (Fig. 10 ). While the carbon dioxide content also increased with increasing feed concentration, it caused a decrease in the hydrogen content of the gas effluent. Byrd et al. [25] have explained the increment in the methane yield with increasing feed concentration by the saturation of the active sites of the catalyst with adsorbed reactant molecules, which prevented other feed molecules from reaching the surface and reacting to form products. In the gasification over Pt/Al2O3, hydrogen was the main product with 95mol%, however, its proportion in the gaseous product decreased with increasing feed concentration. Especially, the hydrogen content dropped dramatically over the concentration of 2.5mol/L, and propylene took the place of hydrogen. The reason of this reduction of hydrogen for both catalysts was the inhibition of the water gas shift reaction due to the high concentrations of reactants in the reaction medium. Therefore, to produce a hydrogen rich gas, the reaction should be carried out with low concentrations, at low reaction temperatures and short reaction times."
9,The effect of system pressure,"3.4 The effect of system pressure For the catalytic gasification by using Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3, the effect of pressure on the hydrogen and gasification yields was studied at 400°C and for a residence time of 10s, with a 2-propanol feed concentration of 0.5M. As the system pressure was reduced from supercritical region to subcritical region, while the gasification yield showed a slight reduction for Pt/Al2O3, it reduced dramatically from 8 to 2.5L/L feed for Ru/Al2O3 (Fig. 11 ). On the other hand, the hydrocarbon content such as methane, ethane and propane in the gas product increased with pressure reduction for Ru/Al2O3, while the carbon dioxide content decreased (Fig. 12 ). During the gasification over Pt/Al2O3, as the system pressure was reduced, the hydrogen content decreased from 95 to 45mol%. However, other gases such as methane, propane and carbon dioxide showed a slight increment with the pressure reduction (Fig. 12). Hydrolysis reaction plays a significant role in the gasification of hydrocarbons in supercritical water, but it requires the presence of H3O+ or OH−. These ion products increase with pressure, and their concentrations rise to a maximum at near-critical point pressures in the subcritical and supercritical regions. Therefore, the hydrolysis rate increases as shown in the first equation given in Table 1. It is also well known that a high pressure is in favor of water gas shift reaction. The increase in the hydrogen content with pressure increment can be attributed to both situations mentioned above."
10,Kinetic evaluation of the catalytic gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water,"3.5 Kinetic evaluation of the catalytic gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water As seen from Fig. 1, the catalysts used have a nonporous structure, and the reaction occurs at the outer surface of catalyst. Because of no intra-diffusional effects, the catalytic decomposition taking place in supercritical water can be described as follows: (3) − ⅆ [ C n ] ⅆ t = k 0 Exp ( − E a / R T ) [ C n ] a [ H 2 O ] b where [H2O] and [C n ] and are the concentrations of water and the reactant in mmol/L, respectively. a and b represent the reaction orders, E a is the activation energy and k 0 is the pre-exponential factor that are received from Arrhenius equation. The experimental data show that water had a role either as a reactant or a reaction media in supercritical conditions. However, since the water amount in the reaction medium was generally greater than 98%, the reaction order term b in Eq. (3) becomes 0 and the effect of H2O concentration changes is neglected. Assuming first-order reaction kinetics in terms of TOC, the expression for the reaction rate becomes as follows: (4) − ⅆ [ TOC ] ⅆ t = k 0 Exp ( − E a / R T ) [ TOC ] Hence, under supercritical conditions, the initial TOC concentrations at the entrance of the reactor were calculated from measured feed stock concentrations: (5) [ TOC ] 0 = C TOC 12 · ρ SC ( P , T ) ρ L where C TOC and [TOC]0 are the feedstock and initial reactant concentrations in mg/L and mmol/L, respectively. The TOC conversion term is defined in Eq. (2). After Eq. (4) is rearranged with respect to TOC conversion term, regression analysis of the catalytic hydrothermal decomposition data gives a first-order expression for the reaction rate. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor values predicted are summarized in Table 2 for Ru/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3, respectively. A comparison between the predicted and experimental TOC conversions is also shown in Fig. 13 . As it can be seen from the figure, the dashed lines that indicate a deviation of ±5% conversion from the 45° line contain most of the data points. Hence, it can be said that the proposed model fits satisfactorily with our experimental data."
11,Conclusion,"Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts were tested for hydrogen production by the gasification of 2-propanol in supercritical water. The experiments showed that catalyst usage improved the gasification yield, and at low temperatures and reaction times Pt/Al2O3 was much more selective for hydrogen production when compared with Ru/Al2O3. Since Ru/Al2O3 catalyst favored the methanation reaction, it consumed a part of the hydrogen produced and therefore, the hydrogen yield remained at levels of 10mol%. On the other hand, a gaseous product consisting of 96mol% hydrogen was obtained from the gasification of 0.5M 2-propanol solution, when Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was used."
