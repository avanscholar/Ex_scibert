0,Introduction,"According to the International Energy Agency in 2017, natural gas, oil, and coal represent 81.4% out of the total world primary energy supply [1]. The excessive use of fossil fuels has generated a great amount of environmental problems, mainly attributed to the generation of greenhouse gases such as CO2 [2]. Nowadays, the main challenge on energetics is the development of clean and renewable energy sources to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and, consequently, the reduction of the pollutants is of vital interest since we live in a non-controlled growth population, leading to severe health effects and climate change. In this sense, hydrogen (H2) is a potential candidate as a clean fuel, since it is an abundant and renewable element that has a greater energy potential than fossil fuels; besides it generates only water as combustion gas [3–6]. There are different routes for hydrogen generation; one of them is photocatalysis, which offers the opportunity to harvest solar energy by using semiconductor materials, capable to perform the water splitting into hydrogen [5–11]. Many semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported for hydrogen production from water and alcohols solutions. Among the different photocatalysts studied for hydrogen production, cadmium sulfide (CdS) is an appropriate semiconductor, since it has a narrow band gap (2.4 eV), which is suitable to absorb visible light; the conduction band-edge potential is more negative than the reduction potential of H2O/H2 [12,13], which favors the reduction of protons to H2 gas. However, the efficiency of the photocatalytic process is low since CdS presents a fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and photocorrosion [12,14,15]. To overcome these problems, different modifications have been proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activity, like the use of noble metals as co-catalysts [16–18], composites formed by CdS with other semiconductors [19,20], the use of non-metals as co-catalyts, as well as the coupling of CdS with carbon-based nanostructured materials [21–23] acting as an electron sink and preventing the recombination of charge carriers [24]. Among the graphene oxide (GO) applications in photovoltaic devices, solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors [25–28] to mention some of them, graphene-based materials have been extended to attend catalytic and photocatalytic applications [29–32], since its unique 2D structure with a high surface area provides special electronic transport properties such as an excellent mobility of charge carriers [26,33–35]. Additionally, GO sheets have functional oxygen-contained groups adhered on its surface, making possible to modulate their band gap by the incorporation of different semiconductors. The semiconductors use the functional groups as nucleation sites for growth and anchoring, allowing to control the particle size dispersion of the semiconductors and avoiding the formation of agglomerates. The use of graphene based nano-composites have been studied and proposed for different applications. In this work, we propose the modification of CdS semiconductors with GO sheets to perform the photocatalytic water-splitting under visible light and the superficial modification of these GO-CdS composites by metal nanoparticles such as nickel, a non-noble metal to extend the photoactivity of these composites."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O), nickel acetate (Ni(OCOCH3)2·4H2O), carbon disulfide (CS2), graphene oxide, butanol (C4H10O), ethylenediamine (NH2CH2CH2NH2), were supplied by Sigma Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Reasol, while methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H6O) were provided by Meyer. All chemicals were used without any further purification."
3,Photocatalysts preparation,"2.2 Photocatalysts preparation The materials were prepared by two different methods to evaluate the effect on the photoactivity. For the composites prepared by the in situ method (CdS-GO), the synthesis of CdS nanofibers was performed on a suspension containing dispersed GO sheets, while for the photodeposition method (CdS/GO) the synthesis of CdS was first performed and afterwards, proper amounts of GO were deposited using visible light [36]. Finally, nickel nanoparticles were photodeposited on the composites obtained by both methods, to evaluate the effect of metal nanoparticles on the photocatalytic hydrogen production. 2.2.1 Synthesis of CdS Cadmium sulfide nanofibers were synthesized by the precipitation method, using a mixture containing 10 vol% of water, 30 vol% of butanol and 60 vol% of ethylenediamine as previously described [37]. In a typical experiment, cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate was dissolved in the aqueous solution of butanol at room temperature under magnetic stirring for 15 min, afterwards ethylenediamine was added dropwise to this solution. Finally, carbon disulfide was added dropwise, in a molar ratio 1:1 of Cd:S. The obtained solution was heated up to 100 °C for 1 h under magnetic stirring, afterwards the solution was left to cool down at room temperature keeping the magnetic stirring. The yellow precipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with an aqueous solution of ethanol (50/50 vol%) and finally dried at 80 °C for 1 h. 2.2.2 Synthesis of GO/CdS composites by photodeposition The preparation was performed for 1, 3 and 10 wt% of GO on CdS fibers using visible light. In a typical procedure, proper amounts of GO were dispersed in ethanol by sonication using an ultrasonic bath (Bransonic 3510R, 42 kHz and 100 W) for 2 h. Then, 1 g of CdS, was dispersed on this suspension, and water was added to reach an ethanol–water solution (50/50 vol%). The solution was homogenized by magnetic stirring and degassed under a nitrogen flux of 80 mL/min for 30 min. Afterwards the suspension was irradiated using visible light of 4 LED lamps (λ = 450 nm and 4 W each) for 4 h, under magnetic stirring and nitrogen flux. Finally, the obtained materials were recovered by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C for 1 h. The samples were labeled as GO/CdS X wt%. 2.2.3 Synthesis of GO-CdS composites by in situ method Proper amounts of GO were used to obtain contents of 1, 3 and 10 wt% were dispersed on butanol by sonication for 90 min. Once the GO sheets were dispersed, the same synthesis procedure of the Section 2.2.1 was followed to obtain the growth of the CdS nanofibers on the GO sheets. The materials were recovered by filtration and dried at 80 °C for 1 h. These samples were labeled as GO-CdS X wt%, where X represents GO content. 2.2.4 Photodeposition of nickel nanoparticles The photodeposition of nickel nanoparticles was performed according to the previously reported methodology [38]. Briefly, in a 2.5 M methanol solution, 500 mg of the prepared composites were dispersed under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Proper amounts of nickel acetate were added to the methanol solution to obtain 0.5 wt% of Ni [39]. Afterwards, 500 mg of NaOH were added to the suspension and degassed under nitrogen flux for 15 min. The photodeposition was performed using 4 LED lamps (λ = 450 nm and 4 W each) and magnetic stirring under N2 flux for 4 h. After this time of light irradiation, the materials were recovered by centrifugation (9000 rpm), washed with ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 1 h."
4,Evaluation of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.3 Evaluation of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution In a typical procedure, 20 mg of the prepared photocatalyst were dispersed by magnetic stirring under N2 flow (80 mL/min) for 15 min in a homemade reactor containing an ethanol-water solution (1:1 vol) to remove the dissolved oxygen. After that, the solution was irradiated by 4 LED lamps 4 W each, of visible light (λ = 450 nm); the H2 evolution was evaluated on a Shimadzu GC-8 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a molecular sieve column of 5 Å."
5,Characterization of the materials,"2.4 Characterization of the materials The crystalline phase of the materials was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction on a Bruker D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation of 1.5406 Å, and 2θ range from 10° to 90° at 0.02° per second. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb 3-B apparatus. Prior to N2 adsorption, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 80 °C for 18 h. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded using a Shimadzu IRAffinity spectrometer equipped with attenuated total reflection (ATR), at a resolution of 8 cm−1 on the spectral region of 400–4000 cm−1 with 250 scans. In addition, Raman spectroscopy was performed on a WITec’s Raman microscope alpha 300R. The laser excitation was 532 nm and the intensity was adjusted to 2.3 mW. The optical properties of the samples were characterized on a UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) from 200 to 800 nm using a Varian Cary-100 spectrometer with an integrating sphere, where BaSO4 was used as reflectance standard. The band gap (Eg) of the samples was calculated using the Kubelka-Munk method [40]. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the materials were measured on a Scínco FS-2 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm. The nickel content on the composites was analyzed on a X-ray fluorescence spectrometer JSX-1000S with Rh Kα radiation source operating at 30 KV. The morphology and microstructures of the photocatalysts were determined using scanning electron microscopy (UHR FEI HELIOS NANOLAB 600) operated at 5 KV, and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM JEOL 2100) with an emission source of LaB6 and operated at 200 KV."
6,Results,
7,Crystalline structure,"3.1 Crystalline structure XRD patterns were recorded to determine the crystallographic phase of CdS and to investigate the influence of GO on the CdS crystallinity by the different synthesis methods used. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CdS, and the diffractograms of the composites prepared by both methods and for the composites after the nickel photodeposition. The diffraction peaks at 25.1°, 26.6°, 28.5°, 36.9°, 44.2°, 48.2° and 52.3° can be indexed as (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 2) planes of the hexagonal phase of CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049). The formation of the hexagonal phase and preferential growth along the c-axis onto the 002 plane is due to the use of ethylenediamine as template during the synthesis of CdS. However, the relative ratio intensities of the (1 1 0) and (1 0 3) planes were close to 0.87, suggesting the presence of the cubic phase of CdS. The samples containing GO show a reduction on the intensity ratio of the planes (1 1 0) and (1 0 3) up to 0.98, suggesting a preferential growth of the hexagonal phase; on the other hand, no evidence of the characteristic peaks of GO or rGO located at 11.2° and 24.5° respectively [21,41] was observed, this is attributed to the low concentration of GO on the samples. However, the XRD patterns show a small shift on the 002 plane compared to CdS, indicating that the presence of GO generates a small distortion on the crystal lattice of the composites. Besides, the XRD patterns of the materials prepared with GO and nickel nanoparticles do not show peaks associated to nickel, this is also attributed to the low content (0.5 wt%). Moreover, the crystallite size of all the samples was calculated by the Scherrer equation using the 002 plane, and the obtained values are summarized in Table 1 ."
8,Determination of the morphology and cristallinity of photocatalysts,"3.2 Determination of the morphology and cristallinity of photocatalysts The scanning electron micrographs of CdS (Fig. 2 a), composites prepared by photodeposition CdS/GO (Fig. 2b) and in situ method CdS-GO (Fig. 2c) are presented. From the SEM image of CdS (Fig. 2a) we can observe the CdS presenting a fiber shape, promoted by the use of ethylenediamine during the synthesis, these CdS fibers are agglomerated due to the effect of butanol used as solvent [37]. Fig. 2b) shows the micrographs of the GO/CdS 10 wt% sample, representing the most active material obtained for hydrogen production. The GO sheets show few structural defects such as edges and some wrinkles on the sheets, which may indicate the partial reduction of the GO sheets. On the other hand, the sample synthesized by the in situ method (Fig. 2c) show that the formation of CdS fibers was not affected by the presence of GO in the solvent during the synthesis. According to previous reports, the functional groups present on the GO sheets serve as a growth medium [32,42,43] for the CdS crystals, allowing a homogeneous distribution of the CdS fibers on the GO sheets which are almost completely covered. However, a portion of the GO sheet can be observed, showing some structural defects of edges and wrinkles, so the method does not lead to a total reduction of the GO. The micrographs of the composites prepared for both methods containing Ni nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 2d and e, respectively, the most active materials obtained for hydrogen production after the photodeposition of nickel nanoparticles. It can be observed that during the photodeposition of nickel the restacking of the GO sheets occurs, while for the Ni/GO-CdS samples prepared by the in situ method, no morphologic change on the GO structure is observed. Fig. 3 shows TEM selected images of the most active sample of Ni/GO-CdS 1 wt%. It can be observed (Fig. 3a) that the CdS synthesized on the GO sheets presents fiber shape morphology, with diameters between 6 and 18 nm, and a length of above 100 nm, in accordance with a previous report [37]. On Fig. 3b) the HRTEM image of the same sample is observed, the sets of lattice spaces with d-spacing at ∼0.243 and 0.291 nm corresponding to planes of CdS (1 0 2) of hexagonal phase and (2 0 0) of cubic phase, respectively. On the other hand, the interplanar distance at 0.240 nm corresponds to the (1 1 1) diffraction plane of the NiO. This suggests that during the photodeposition of Ni2+ on the CdS in alkaline solution, Ni(OH)2 is formed and can be reduced to Ni by the photogenerated electrons from the CdS. However, Ni is not stable and can be easily oxidized to NiO, so it is possible to obtain a mixture of Ni and NiO [38,44]. On the inset Fig. 3b), two diffractions patterns corresponding to (1 0 2) and (0 0 2) planes of metallic Ni in from the hexagonal phase were observed. Finally, the metal content for the materials modified by nickel nanoparticles was determined by X-ray fluorescence, and the reported values are in agreement with the nominal content of 0.5 wt%."
9,Textural properties of photocatalysts,"3.3 Textural properties of photocatalysts The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of CdS and the materials modified with GO are presented in Fig. 4 . According to the IUPAC classification, all the photocatalysts present type II isotherms, corresponding to non-porous materials and the adsorbent-adsorbate interactions are weak. Therefore, the isotherms have a H3 hysteresis loop type, characteristic of materials with non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles [45]. The specific surface areas of the materials were calculated by BET method and the results are summarized in Table 1. For the materials modified with GO prepared by photodeposition, the obtained values were 40 m2/g larger than bare CdS (173 m2/g), while the materials obtained by In-situ method presented smaller areas close to 100 m2/g. These results are associated to the distribution and morphology of the materials, as can be observed for the samples modified by photodeposition, show large GO sheets without a complete covering with CdS nanofibers causing an increment on the surface area, while for the materials synthesized by the In-situ method, the CdS nanofibers grow on the GO sheets and these ones are almost completely covered, originating a decrease on the surface area. The materials containing nickel nanoparticles present similar surface areas to the ones obtained for the composites without metal nanoparticles."
10,FTIR,"3.4 FTIR The FTIR spectra of GO and CdS materials modified with GO by photodeposition and In-situ methods are shown in Fig. 5 . The spectrum of GO presents absorption bands at 1720 cm−1 and 1030 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching mode of CO and CO of carboxyl group vibrations respectively [46,47]. The peak at 1250 cm−1 is related to the stretching mode of the epoxy group (COC). The broad peak between 600 cm−1 and 800 cm−1 corresponds to the CH bonding. Additionally, a peak located at 1581 cm−1 is observed, and it is attributed to the CC plane stretching in the skeleton of graphene structure [48,49]. FTIR spectra of CdS show an absorption band at 629 cm−1 related to CdS bonding. Besides, there are three peaks located at 1584 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of NH2 and the bands at 1324 and 1007 cm−1 correspond to the CN vibrations from the ethylenediamine used as template during the synthesis [37,50]. The samples modified with GO by both methods show the characteristic peak of CdS bond; the signals related to ethylenediamine are weak for the materials synthesized by photodeposition. On the other hand, the bands associated to the functional groups of oxygen present on the GO surface seem to decrease, which may indicate a partial reduction of GO and the signal corresponding to CC bond shifts to 1618 cm−1. Finally, the FTIR signals for the Ni/GO-CdS samples corresponding to oxygen functional groups, presented weaker signals than the ones observed for the sample GO-CdS. For the materials prepared by photodeposition (Ni/GO/CdS) there is also a reduction of the signals corresponding to the functional oxygen groups, and this behavior is more evident where some signals disappear as a result of the photoreduction of these materials, as for the GO sheets and also for the Ni nanoparticles due to the light irradiation. A broad peak observed between 3500 cm−1 and 3000 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl (OH) groups on the photocatalysts surface."
11,Optical properties,"3.5 Optical properties In Fig. 6 a), the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples are presented, it can be observed that all the samples exhibit a strong absorption along the UV–Vis light region with an adsorption edge at 510 nm. The samples containing GO presented an enhancement on the absorption along the visible region compared to bare CdS spectrum, attributed to the intrinsic black color of GO [51,52]; the materials prepared by the in situ method presented a higher absorbance of light in the visible region than the materials prepared by photodeposition For the materials containing nickel nanoparticles, presented a slight enhancement of the absorption along the visible region. The band gap energies of the materials were calculated using the modified Kubelka-Munk method [40]. For the CdS semiconductor, direct electronic transitions were considered for the value of n = 1/2. Therefore, in Fig. 6b) the Tauc plot and band gap energies were determined by extrapolating the slope; these values were calculated. There were no significant changes on the band gap energies obtained for the materials compared to bare CdS with values around 2.5 eV."
12,Photoluminescence (PL) analysis,"3.6 Photoluminescence (PL) analysis Photoluminescence (PL) can be used to investigate the migration, transfer and recombination processes of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in semiconductors. The photoluminescence intensity and the photocatalytic activity are strongly correlated. Low PL intensity suggests a decrease in the electron–hole recombination process, resulting in a higher photocatalytic activity [53]. Fig. 7 shows PL spectra of CdS and GO composites prepared by a) in situ and b) photodeposition and for the composites containing Ni nanoparticles. The CdS spectrum shows a broad peak between 480 and 560 nm and might attributed to the surface emission caused by sulfur vacancies [54,55]. The materials synthesized by in situ method (Fig. 7a), show a decrease in PL intensity as the GO content increases, suggesting a quenching of PL attributed to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from CdS and transferred to the GO and the reduction on the recombination. On the other hand, the materials prepared by photodeposition (Fig. 7b) present a similar PL intensity among the materials prepared by this method for the different GO contents, and could be attributed to a non-homogeneous distribution of CdS fibers on the GO sheets. Furthermore, PL spectra of materials containing nickel nanoparticles, the most active material for both synthesis methods, show for the material prepared by the in situ method (Ni/GO-CdS 1%), that the presence of Ni nanoparticles decreased the photoluminescence drastically compared to the sample GO-CdS 1 wt%, suggesting that nickel acts as an electron sink, reducing the recombination of electron-hole pairs. However, for the sample synthesized by photodeposition (Ni/GO/CdS 1 wt%) it was observed that the PL intensity is similar to obtained bare CdS, and it might be due to the sample has generated sulfur vacancies on the CdS structure attributed to the preparation method of photodeposition [54]."
13,Raman spectroscopy,"3.7 Raman spectroscopy Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of the GO, GO/CdS and GO-CdS samples. The GO presents two bands located at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 corresponding to D and G bands, respectively. The G band is characteristic of all carbon compounds that exhibit sp2 hybridization, due to of the stretching motion in the CC bond plane [56], while the D band suggests the presence of defects in the structure due to sp3 carbon hybridization, which leads to the rupture of the symmetric hexagonal network of graphene due to internal structural defects. These defects are attributed to oxygen functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl, or vacancies generated after reduction of GO. For the CdS materials modified with GO, two peaks at 293 and 590 cm−1 can be observed, corresponding to the longitudinal optical phonon modes (1LO and 2LO) of CdS. For the samples obtained by the In-situ method (Fig. 8a), the GO signals were not appreciated, the possible explanation is that this synthesis method could originate GO sheets almost completely covered by the CdS fibers. The Raman spectra of the samples presented high fluorescence caused by CdS, probably hiding the GO signals [57,58]. The GO/CdS samples prepared by photodeposition method (Fig. 8b), exhibited less interaction between CdS fibers and GO sheets, presenting a lower CdS fluorescence and two characteristic peaks of GO were observed at 1350 and 1580 cm−1. The ID/IG ratios were 1.09, 1.46 and 1.25 for the contents 1, 3 and 10 wt% respectively, showing an enhancement when compared to GO (ID/IG = 1.02), suggesting an increment of defects in the carbon network caused by the elimination of oxygen functional groups, as a possible evidence of the partial reduction of GO [56,59,60], in agreement with FTIR results."
14,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.8 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production of the materials synthesized by in-situ and photodeposition methods were evaluated under visible light, using ethanol as sacrificial molecule, and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . The presence of the sacrificial molecule is required since it acts as an electron donor to consume the photogenerated holes and prevent the photocorrosion of CdS. From Fig. 9a, we can observe that there was no improvement on the photocatalytic hydrogen production by the materials synthesized with 1 and 3 wt% of GO compared to bare CdS (1410 μmol/h g), although it was observed that the activity increased for the content of 10 wt%; where the hydrogen production was enhanced in a factor of 1.25 (1757 μmol/h g). On the other hand, the photocatalytic activity of the materials prepared by the In-situ method (Fig. 8b), showed a similar behavior, where for the sample of GO-CdS at 10 wt% presented the highest activity (2477 μmol/h g), enhancing the activity in a factor of 1.8 times compared to the bare semiconductor CdS. This result is mainly attributed to the distribution of CdS fibers on the GO sheets, by this synthesis method, where the fibers were grown on the carbon network increasing the contact area between both materials and therefore, an enhanced electron transfer from CdS to the GO sheets is observed by PL analysis. For the materials synthesized by the photodeposition method (GO/CdS), the GO sheets exhibited less structural defects as reported by Raman Spectra, the CdS fibers did not present a homogeneous distribution on the GO sheets, generating less contact area, which decreases the electron transfer, hindering their photoactivity. The effect of nickel nanoparticles deposited on the surface of these composites of CdS materials modified with GO by both methods, was studied for 0.5 wt% of Ni, and these results are presented in Fig. 10 a. The results showed that when Ni at 0.5 wt% was photodeposited on CdS, the hydrogen production increased from 1410 up to 3404 μmol/h g. When Ni nanoparticles were deposited on CdS/GO composites prepared by photodeposition, regardless on the GO content, hydrogen production was lower than production obtained with Ni/CdS sample, which is attributed to the morphology of the Photocatalysts as well as to the increased recombination of electron-hole pairs observed by PL analysis. For the materials synthesized by In-situ when Ni nanoparticles were deposited, these materials showed an enhancement on the photoactivity as follows: for the material Ni GO-CdS 1 wt% (8866 μmol/h g), increasing the hydrogen production of bare CdS in a factor of 6.3 and 10 for the GO-CdS 1 wt%. As previously discussed, these results are attributed to the resulting morphology obtained from the synthesis of the material with a more distributed covering of GO sheets by CdS nanofibers when the in situ method was performed, facilitating the interaction between GO sheets, CdS and Ni nanoparticles. Finally, the stability of the most active photocatalyst (Ni/GO-CdS 1%) was evaluated during three consecutive reaction cycles using the same ethanol-water solution and purging with N2 after each cycle (5 h); and these results are shown in Fig. 10b. It is observed that the material exhibits a decrease on the photocatalytic activity of approximately 16% and 38% for the second and third reaction cycle, respectively. The results suggest that this decrease may be due to the photocorrosion of the material; however the production after 15 h was higher than the one reported for bare CdS in only 5 h. A mechanism proposed for the hydrogen production reaction is depicted in Fig. 11 . The visible light promotes electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of CdS. The photogenerated electrons can be then transferred to Ni nanoparticles on the surface of the CdS nanofibers, to the carbon network of the GO sheets. These electrons can then react with H+ ions absorbed on the catalyst surface and reduce to H2. Since the hydrogen production increases with the addition of GO sheets and nickel nanoparticles, the enhancement is attributed to GO since it acts as an electron transport, while nickel nanoparticles can efficiently separate the photogenerated charges. On the other hand, the holes at the VB of CdS are consumed by the ethanol molecules."
15,Conclusions,"CdS nanofibers were synthesized and modified with GO by photodeposition and in situ methods and were evaluated for the hydrogen production from water-ethanol solutions under visible light (450 nm). The results showed that the modification of CdS with GO at 10 wt% presented an improvement on the photocatalytic hydrogen production in a factor of 1.25 and 1.8 for the photodeposition and in-situ methods, respectively, when compared to bare CdS, showing a more efficient contact between CdS nanofibers dispersed on the GO sheets when the in situ method was performed. When Ni was used as co-catalyst, the photoactivity of these composites relays mainly on the presence of the metal nanoparticles, being the most active the composite by the in situ method Ni CdS-GO 1 wt% showing that in this case the electron attraction is mainly attributed to the effect of this metal acting as a sink of electrons at low contents of 0.5 wt% of Ni. The obtained results allow us to elucidate that the synthesis by In-situ method increase the interactions of the CdS fibers and GO, improving the charge transfer between GO-CdS; and, the presence of Ni nanoparticles on the GO-CdS composites, increased the transfer of the photogenerated electrons acting as a sink of this species increasing on a factor of 6.3 the photoactivity of the in-situ GO-CdS composites."
