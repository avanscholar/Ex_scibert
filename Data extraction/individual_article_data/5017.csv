0,Introduction,"Castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) is an oilseed plant of the Euphorbiaceae family that due to its high phenotypic plasticity and capacity to adapt to a wide variety of climates [1], is currently cultivated in more than 30 countries [2,3]. The oil extracted from its seeds is the main and most valuable product, due to its particular physicochemical properties, such as high viscosity, physical and chemical stability and solubility in alcohol at low temperatures, which facilitate biodiesel production and allow its wide application in the chemical industry [4–7]. In order to guarantee the crop competitiveness and to satisfy the internal demands, research programs in several countries developed more profitable varieties, such BRS Paraguaçu in Brazil [2]. As many other crops, castor bean is affected by diseases that limit its productive potential. Bacterial leaf spot (BLS) caused by the gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. ricini [8] (Xar) is the only disease of bacterial etiology that appears in the literature amongst important diseases of the crop. The occurrence of BLS has been reported in several countries, including Russia, Japan, Korea, Uganda, and Brazil [9,10]. This disease is restricted to regions with high temperature and humidity [10], but can become relevant as a consequence of the expansion of the crop beyond semi-arid areas [11]. Bacterial leaf spot symptoms consist of small and circular (or sometimes angular) yellow spots on the adaxial leaf surface and water-soaked lesions on the abaxial surface. These spots gradually become dark and raised, appearing as necrotic spots surrounded by chlorotic haloes, whose centers sometimes dry out and fall off. The most severe symptoms are characterized by coalesced necrotic lesions extensively distributed on the leaf surface area (giving plants a blighted appearance). Affected leaves either become yellow and drop off or become dry but remain attached to the plant [9,10]. Due to the inefficacy and high cost of the chemical compounds currently available, the use of plant genetic resistance is the preferred alternative for bacterial disease management. But, to date, there are no reports on the resistance to BLS of the most widely planted castor bean cultivars in Brazil, including BRS Paraguaçu. Hence, good knowledge of the physiological and biochemical alterations caused by Xar on castor bean plants could provide insights to potentiate the mechanisms of host resistance. It is known that infection by pathogens can directly or indirectly affect several physiological processes in their host plants often leading to a reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency, which is frequently associated with a direct damage to the photosynthetic apparatus [12–14]. Alterations in physiological processes associated with photosynthesis cause an imbalance between light energy absorption, the Calvin Benson cycle and carbohydrates metabolism, such that inadequate energy dissipation can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in host tissues [13–17]. In turn, ROS accumulation in host tissue can activate oxidative processes such as membrane lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, enzyme inhibition, and damage to DNA and RNA [17,18]. It is also known that in plants under biotic stress, the oxidative burst represents a rapid host defense reaction at initial stages of the pathogen infection process [19,20]. Production of ROS is an important hallmark of successful microbe recognition and defense responses activation by plants [19–22]. ROS burst has been associated with overproduction of diverse reactive molecules, mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2 •-) [13–17], that can trigger an oxidative stress often leading to plant cell death. To balance these processes of production and removal of ROS, plants have a highly orchestrated antioxidant system that keep cells at a steady-state [17,19,21], which includes the function of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX) [15,21,23–25]. In addition, plants accumulate a series of carotenoids that play key roles not only in photoprotection but also in assembly of the photosystem and harvesting of light [26–28]. Most studies on alterations of the physiology and biochemistry caused by bacteria on their hosts have been conducted with model plants of the Solanaceae [13,14,29–31] and Brassicaceae [32] families, or with commercially important plants of the Cucurbitaceae [33,34]. The only study with the Euphorbiaceae family was conducted with cassava (Manihot esculenta). Whether similar alterations occur in other Euphorbiaceae species is not known. Because of its economic importance, castor bean represents an excellent choice to gain knowledge on this respect. In this study, the photosynthetic performance of castor bean plants inoculated or not with Xar was evaluated through measurements of leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging and measurements of the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments. In addition, the efficiency of the antioxidative system was studied by measuring the activities of several antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of several metabolites involved in the oxidative stress."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and growth conditions,2.1 Bacterial strains and growth conditions The phytopathogenic Xar ICMP 3031 strain [35] was the original source of the rifampicin-resistant CFBM-UFV-0021 strain used in all experiments (Supporting information). The CFBM-UFV-0021 strain was routinely grown at 28 °C for 24 h on solid 523 medium [36] supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 of the antibiotic.
3,Cultivar and plant growth,"2.2 Cultivar and plant growth Castor bean seeds of cultivar BRS-Paraguaçu were obtained from Embrapa Algodão (Campina Grande, PB, Brazil). Seeds were scarified with sandpaper and treated with carboxin + thiram 200 SC (250 ml per 100 kg seeds) [37]. Two seeds were sown in plastic pots containing 2 kg of a 2:1 mixture of Tropstrato® substrate (Vida Verde, Mogi Mirim, SP, Brazil) and soil, fertilized with single superphosphate. After emergence, seedlings with the first true leaves in each pot were thinned to one seedling and weekly fertilized with 70 ml of a Clark's modified nutrient solution (1.04 M Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 1 M NH4NO3, 0.8 M KNO3, 0.6 M MgSO4·7H2O, 6.9 mM KH2PO4, 9.3 mM KCl, 2 mM H3BO3, 2 mM ZnSO4·7H2O, 7 mM MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5 mM CuSO4·5H2O, 90 mM FeSO4·7H2O, and 90 mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) [38]. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse (relative humidity of 70 ± 5%, temperature of 25 ± 3 °C, and natural photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 900 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and watered daily."
4,Inoculum preparation and plant inoculation,"2.3 Inoculum preparation and plant inoculation The CFBM-UFV-0021 strain was grown on solid 523 medium supplemented with rifampicin (100 μg ml−1) at 28 °C. After 24 h, the bacterial cells were suspended in 10 mM MgCl2 solution, the suspension adjusted to an OD600 = 0.2 (approx. 1 × 108 colony forming units (cfu) ml−1 using a spectrophotometer BioSpectrometer® basic (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and Tween-20 (1 drop l−1) added. Before inoculation, 40-day old castor bean plants with four fully-expanded leaves were kept in a mist chamber at 25 °C during 24 h under darkness. The bacterial suspension was sprayed on both surfaces of the leaves with an atomizer Jet Master (Schulz, Joinville, SC, Brazil). Control plants were treated with 10 mM MgCl2 containing Tween-20. Inoculated plants were maintained in a mist chamber under the conditions described above for an additional 24 h. Then, the plants were placed inside plastic growth chambers in a greenhouse (relative humidity of 70–100%, temperature of 25–40 °C and 300–400 μmol photons m−2 s−1) until the end of the experiment. The luminosity inside the growth chambers was above the light compensation point for C3 plants."
5,Disease severity assessment,"2.4 Disease severity assessment Leaves were collected at 5, 11, and 16 dai and scanned at 600 dpi resolution with an HP scanner model PSC 1500 series (Hewlett-Packard, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) to obtain images that were processed using the QUANT software version 1.0.1 [39] to quantify the leaf area containing lesions. Symptoms on the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces were photographed under a stereomicroscope Stemi 2000-C (Carl Zeiss, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) coupled with a digital camera PowerShot A640 (Canon, São Paulo, SP, Brazil)."
6,Leaf gas exchange measurements,"2.5 Leaf gas exchange measurements Leaf gas exchange parameters were determined at 5, 11, and 16 dai, using a portable open-system infrared gas analyzer LI-6400XT (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) between 09:00 and 12:00 h (solar time) under artificial PAR of 1000 μmol m−2 s−1, external CO2 concentration of 400 μmol mol−1, and temperature at 25 °C. The net carbon assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g s) and transpiration rate (E) were estimated."
7,Chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence parameters,"2.6 Chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence parameters An Imaging-PAM M-Series chlorophyll fluorometer and the Imaging WIN software version 2.32 (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) were used to obtain the images and parameters of Chl a fluorescence on the leaf of each plant at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 dai. For quantitative analyses of Chl a fluorescence parameters, six foliar areas of interest of 2 cm2 each were analyzed and the results averaged. In the inoculated plants, these areas corresponded to representative symptomatic regions on each leaf. The sensor system used 44 high-power LED lamps (450 nm) to apply fluorescence excitation, actinic illumination and saturation pulses. These LEDs were arranged in pairs, each pair providing a red (660 nm), and a near-infrared (780 nm) LED. A CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (640 × 480 pixels resolution) was located above the leaf at an 18.5 cm distance. Plants were dark-adapted for 1 h before the measurements, then the leaf was exposed to a light pulse of 0.5 μmol m−2 s−1 (1 Hz) intensity to obtain the initial fluorescence image (F 0). Then, the leaves were exposed to a saturating pulse of blue light (470 nm) with an intensity of 2400 μmol m−2 s−1 (10 Hz) during 0.8 s to obtain the maximum fluorescence image (F m). Based on these initial measurements, the software performed the calculation and image of the maximum photosystem II (PSII) quantum efficiency (F v/F m = (F m–F 0)/Fm). Subsequently, the leaves were exposed to actinic photon irradiance (531 μmol m−2 s−1) for 240 s to obtain the steady-state fluorescence yield (F s). Next, a saturating blue light pulse (2400 μmol m−2 s−1, 0.8 s) was applied to achieve the light-adapted maximum fluorescence (F m’). The light-adapted initial fluorescence (F 0’) was estimated according to Ref. [40]. The energy that was absorbed by the PSII for dissipative processes was calculated as follows: effective photosystem II quantum yield, Y(II) = [(F m’ - F s)/F m’]; quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation, Y(NPQ) = [(F s/F m’) – 1] and quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation, Y(NO) = F s /F m [41–44]. The electron transport rate was calculated as ETR = Y(II) × Abs × 0.5 × PAR according to Ref. [45]; where Abs is the absorbance of the leaf and 0.5 is a coefficient that accounts for the partitioning of energy between PSII and photosystem I (PSI), which indicates that the excitation energy is distributed equally between the two photosystems [41]."
8,Concentration of photosynthetic pigments,"2.7 Concentration of photosynthetic pigments Six disks (0.2 cm2 each) were collected with a cork-borer from the leaf of each plant at 5, 11, and 16 dai to determine the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), and carotenoids. The leaf disks were placed in glass tubes containing 5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution saturated with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (5 g l−1) and kept at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. The absorbance of the leaf extracts was measured at 480, 649, and 665 nm using a spectrophotometer Multiskan GO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The DMSO solution saturated with calcium carbonate was used as a blank. The Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoids concentrations were calculated according to Ref. [46] and used to obtain values of total chlorophyll, Chl a/Chl b and Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratios."
9,Histochemical detection of ROS in leaves,"2.8 Histochemical detection of ROS in leaves Histochemical staining was conducted with four leaf disks (0.2 cm2 each) collected with a cork-borer from the leaf of each plant at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 dai. In situ localization of Xar-induced H2O2 and O2 •- using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT), respectively, was determined according to the methods described by Ref. [47]. The stained leaf disks were scanned at 600 dpi resolution with an HP scanner model PSC 1500 series (Hewlett-Packard, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) to obtain the images (Supporting information)."
10,Sample preparation for biochemical assays,"2.9 Sample preparation for biochemical assays For all biochemical assays, the leaf of each plant was collected at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 dai, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C until analysis. To grind the leaf tissue into a fine powder, two metallic beads were used in a mixer mill Retsch MM400 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) with frequency of 30 Hz during 1 min and 10 s such that the samples were maintained frozen at all times. The total reaction mixture used in biochemical assays was 1000 μl for MDA and 250 μl for all other assays. Absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer Multiskan GO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)."
11,Determination of antioxidant enzymes activities,"2.10 Determination of antioxidant enzymes activities A total of 0.2 g of leaf tissue was ground into a fine powder and homogenized in 2 ml of a solution containing 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14000×g at 4 °C for 15 min and the supernatant was stored a −20 °C until used to determine the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11), non-specific peroxidase (POX; EC 1.11.1.7) and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7). The SOD activity was determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the photochemical reduction of NBT [48] with some modifications. CAT activity was determined according to Ref. [49]. The APX activity assay followed an ascorbate oxidation method modified from Ref. [50]. POX activity was determined by measuring the purpurogallin produced from pyrogallol oxidation [49,51]. The GR activity assay followed a method described by Ref. [52] with some modifications (Supporting information). All enzyme activities were expressed based on the protein content of the analyzed tissue, which was determined using the method described in Ref.[53]."
12,Quantification of MDA,2.11 Quantification of MDA The oxidative damage in castor bean leaves was assessed based on lipid peroxidation and expressed as equivalents of MDA according to Ref. [54] (Supporting information).
13,Experimental design and data analysis,"2.12 Experimental design and data analysis Considering the destructive nature of some experimental procedures, a total of 85 plants were inoculated to be sufficient for disease assessment and estimation of the physiological parameters and biochemical assays. These plants along with the same number of non-inoculated plants were maintained in the greenhouse in a completely randomized design. In all cases, the fourth leaf of each plant, from base to top, was used at each evaluation time. Disease severity, chlorophyll a fluorescence, concentration of photosynthetic pigments, histochemical staining, and biochemical assays were conducted on a different set of each five non-inoculated and five inoculated plants at each evaluation time. Leaf gas exchange was measured on the same set of each five non-inoculated and five inoculated plants during the experiments. Disease severity on the fourth leaves of these plants was similar to those used for symptoms rating. The experiment was repeated once with similar results. Each experimental unit corresponded to one plastic pot containing one plant. Because of violation of ANOVA assumptions, data on leaf gas exchange, Chl a fluorescence parameters and concentration of photosynthetic pigments were subjected to the Mann-Whitney test (P ≤ 0.05) to compare the NI and I treatments at each evaluation time. Pairwise Mann-Whitney (P ≤ 0.05) was used to make comparisons among evaluation times within each treatment. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to determine the relationship among the variables and parameters evaluated. For timewise comparisons, data on enzymes activities and MDA concentrations were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) considering a 2 × 5 factorial experiment with two inoculation conditions (NI and I plants) and five evaluation times (3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 dai). Mean differences between evaluation times were determined using Tukey's test (P ≤ 0.05). F test (P ≤ 0.05) was used to compare the NI and I treatments at each evaluation time. Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab version 17 (Minitab Corporation, State College PA)."
14,Results,
15,Bacterial leaf spot severity,"3.1 Bacterial leaf spot severity The first disease symptoms appeared at 5 dai as small yellow spots on the adaxial leaf surface (Fig. 1 A and B, and M) and water-soaked lesions on the abaxial surface (Fig. 1G and H). These spots gradually became circular, dark, necrotic and surrounded by chlorotic haloes (Fig. 1C, D, I, J, and N). Sometimes the center of the spots dried out and fell off. The initial necrotic spots were observed from 8 to 11 dai. The most severe symptoms were observed at 15–16 dai and were characterized by coalesced necrotic lesions distributed on an extensive leaf area, which gave a blighted appearance to the leaves (Fig. 1E, F, K, L, and O). High disease severity resulted in leaves turning yellow, which either fell off or dried out but remained attached to the plant (Fig. 1O). The lesions were more numerous on younger than on older leaves (data not shown). The mean disease severity was 7, 8, and 30% at 5, 11 and 16 dai, respectively (Fig. 1M-O)."
16,Leaf gas exchange parameters,"3.2 Leaf gas exchange parameters There was significant reduction in the A values at 11 (60%) and 16 dai (93%) in inoculated compared to non-inoculated plants (Fig. 2 A). Significant reductions were also observed in g s values at 5 (11%), 11 (71%), and 16 dai (93%) (Fig. 2B) and in E values at 11 (55%) and 16 dai (86%) (Fig. 2C) in inoculated plants when compared to non-inoculated ones. No significant difference was observed in the leaf gas exchange parameters among the evaluation times for non-inoculated plants (Fig. 2A–C). Inoculated plants exhibited significant reductions in the values of all parameters as disease developed. Significant reductions in A of 61% and 93% were observed at 11 and 16 dai, respectively, compared to the initial value at 5 dai (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the g s values at 11 dai (76%) and 16 dai (93%) (Fig. 2B) and E values at 11 dai (58%) and 16 dai (85%) (Fig. 2C), were significantly reduced with respect to their values at 5 dai."
17,Chlorophyll a fluorescence,"3.3 Chlorophyll a fluorescence The Chl a fluorescence images revealed alterations in the photosynthetic capacity of castor bean leaves in response to Xar infection (Fig. 3 ). Based on these images, damage in the photosynthetic machinery was readily noticeable beginning at 8 dai for all parameters analyzed after the appearance of macroscopic disease symptoms (which occurred at 5 dai; Fig. 1A, B, G and H). Consistently, semi-quantitative analysis of Chl a fluorescence parameters showed that, when compared to non-inoculated plants, F v/F m values were significantly reduced by 9, 13, and 78% at 8, 10, and 15 dai, respectively, for inoculated plants (Fig. 4 A). Nonetheless, such an analysis also showed that significant differences in the Y(II) and Y(NPQ) parameters between inoculated and non-inoculated plants began only at 10 dai (Fig. 4B and C). Significant reductions for Y(II) values were noticed in inoculated plants at 10 (40%) and 15 dai (100%) compared to non-inoculated plants (Fig. 4B). For ETR values, a similar trend was observed (e.g., reductions of 45 and 100% at 10 and 15 dai, respectively, in inoculated compared to non-inoculated plants; data not shown). Conversely, for Y(NPQ) there were significant increases of 69 and 109% at 10 and 15 dai, respectively (Fig. 4C) and for Y(NO) significant increases of 9, 31, and 123% at 8, 10, and 15 dai (Fig. 4D) in inoculated vs non-inoculated plants. A progressive loss of photosynthetic capacity was evident during the evaluation time, due to an increase in disease severity in inoculated plants (Fig. 1M-O, 3, and 4A). There were significant decreases of 78 and 100% for F v/F m and Y(II) values, respectively, from the initial (5 dai) to the more severe symptoms observed (15 dai) for inoculated plants (Fig. 4A and B). The opposite was observed for Y(NPQ) and Y(NO), whose values increased by 60 and 137% in the same time-course (Fig. 4C and D). There was variation in all Chl a fluorescence parameters for non-inoculated plants throughout the time-course evaluated, but the differences were greater for inoculated plants (Fig. 4A–D)."
18,Concentration of photosynthetic pigments,"3.4 Concentration of photosynthetic pigments Compared to non-inoculated plants, significant reductions in total chlorophyll concentration (Chl (a + b)) at 11 (24%) and 16 dai (82%) (Fig. 5 A) as well as in carotenoids concentration at 11 (13%) and 16 dai (56%) were found for inoculated plants (Fig. 5B). Significant reductions in the Chl a/Chl b ratio at 16 dai (30%) (Fig. 5C) and in the Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratio at 11 (13%) and 16 dai (58%) (Fig. 5D) were also observed for inoculated in comparison to non-inoculated plants. During the time-course evaluated, significant reductions of 76% and 52% in total chlorophyll and carotenoids concentrations, respectively, were noticed between 11 and 16 dai for inoculated plants (Fig. 5A and B). Also, significant reductions of 29% in the Chl a/Chl b ratio (Fig. 5C) and of 50% in the Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratio between 11 and 16 dai (Fig. 5D) were observed for inoculated plants. Similarly, a small but significant reduction of 9% in the Chl a/Chl b ratio was observed for non-inoculated plants during the same time-course (Fig. 5C). In constrast, a significant increase of 7% in the Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratio occurred for non-inoculated plants during the same evaluation period (Fig. 5D)."
19,In situ localization of Xar-induced H2O2 and O2 •- in castor bean leaves,"3.5 In situ localization of Xar-induced H2O2 and O2 •- in castor bean leaves No DAB-stained areas were noticed in non-inoculated castor bean leaves regardless of the evaluation time (Fig. 6 A). In leaves infected by Xar, DAB staining led to the appearance of brown spots in the leaf tissue beginning at 5 dai (Fig. 6B and C), which were concomitant with the appearance of the initial disease symptoms (Fig. 1A, B, G and H). More intense DAB staining of infected tissue was more evident at 5, 10 and 15 dai when compared to non-inoculated one. Disks from inoculated leaves that were cleared with alcohol but not treated with DAB did not show brown spots as intense as the treated disks. The intensity of brown coloration and the extension of inoculated leaf tissue stained by DAB increased as the disease symptoms developed (Fig. 6C–F). The highest color intensity was noticed at 15 dai and these areas corresponded to necrotic lesions indicating high in situ accumulation of H2O2 (Fig. 6F). Nitro-blue tetrazolium staining was not observed in non-inoculated tissue over the evaluation time (Fig. 6G). Unlike DAB staining, NBT staining led to earlier formation of blue-colored spots in inoculated leaf tissue at 3 dai (before the appearance of the first disease symptoms), indicating the presence of O2 •- (Fig. 6H). These blue-stained areas were also observed concomitantly with the initial disease symptoms at 5 dai (Fig. 1A, B, G, H and 7I ). As the disease symptoms progressed, NBT stained areas were no longer observed (Fig. 6J-L), indicating that there was not accumulation of O2 •- in leaf areas with necrotic lesions. No blue staining was observed in leaf disks obtained from inoculated plants that were cleared with alcohol but not treated with NBT."
20,Concentration of MDA,"3.6 Concentration of MDA Increases in the concentration of MDA of 45 and 15% were observed at 10 and 15 dai, respectively, for inoculated compared to non-inoculated plants (Fig. 8 ; Table S1). Significant variation in concentrations of MDA, for both inoculated and non-inoculated plants, were noticed among the evaluation times (Fig. 7). The highest MDA concentration for inoculated plants occurred at 10 and 15 dai, which showed significant increases compared to the values observed at the other evaluation times (Fig. 7). The pattern of MDA concentration exhibited by inoculated and non-inoculated plants was similar with their maximum observed at 15 dai, but the increase for inoculated plants was higher (Fig. 7)."
21,Antioxidant enzymatic activities,"3.7 Antioxidant enzymatic activities Significant differences were found between plants inoculated and non-inoculated with Xar and among evaluation times for SOD, APX, and POX activities, and interaction between inoculation and evaluation time was observed for SOD, APX, POX and MDA (Table S1; Fig. 8). SOD activity was significantly higher at 15 dai (increase of 35%) (Fig. 8A) whereas CAT activity showed a significant decrease of 9% at 10 dai (Fig. 8B) in inoculated compared to non-inoculated plants. However, in general, no significant differences in CAT activity occurred between inoculated and non-inoculated plants during the sampling period (Fig. 8B). Significant increases were also observed for APX at 10 and 15 dai (increases of 37 and 30%, respectively) (Fig. 8C), and POX at 10 and 15 dai (increases of 37 and 116%, respectively) (Fig. 8D) in inoculated compared to non-inoculated plants. No significant differences in GR activity were evident between inoculated and non-inoculated plants during the evaluation time (Fig. 8E). There was significant variation in the activities of all enzymes evaluated in leaves of inoculated plants over the time-course of the experiment. The activities of SOD (Fig. 8A), APX (Fig. 8C) and POX (Fig. 8D) increased over time and achieved their maximum values at 16 dai (increases of 104, 30 and 194%, respectively, compared to their initial values at 3 dai). The highest enzymatic activities for CAT were observed between 5 and 10 dai, which were significantly different from those at 3 and 15 dai (Fig. 8B). For GR significant differences were observed between its highest value at 3 dai and its lowest values at 10 and 15 dai (Fig. 8E). Overall, no significant differences were observed for APX and POX activities (Fig. 8C and D) in non-inoculated plants over the time-course evaluated."
22,Principal component analysis,"3.8 Principal component analysis In order to explore the effect of Xar infection on the physiological processess of castor bean plants studied here in more detail, the data were subjected to PCA. One principal component (PC) explained most of the variation of the dataset (PC1 = 75.1%; PC2 = 6.8%) (Fig. 9 A and B). For the dataset analyzed, the formation of three well-defined groups was observed. The first group comprised values of non-inoculated plants throughout the time-course evaluated and values observed at 5 dai for inoculated plants, and the second and third groups comprised values observed at 10–11 and 15–16 dai, respectively, for inoculated plants (Fig. 9A). The first PC was characterized by positive scores for photosynthetic pigments (Chl a+b, Chl a/Chl b, carotenoids and Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratios), leaf gas exchange (g s, A, and E) and the Chl a fluorescence parameters F v/F m, Y(II) and ETR as well as by CAT activity. Negative scores in the first PC were observed for disease severity, the Chl a fluorescence parameters Y(NO) and Y(NPQ) in addition to the APX, SOD, POX activities and the MDA concentration (Fig. 9B)."
23,Discussion,"This study shows that Xar infection causes significant alterations in physiological and biochemical processes in leaves of castor bean plants. The values of the photosynthetic parameters analyzed were lower in infected leaves in comparison to non-infected ones. The lower g s values in inoculated plants indicated that drastic limitations occurred in the influx of atmospheric CO2, via the intercellular spaces, to the carboxylation sites in the chloroplasts, which consequently led to reductions in CO2 assimilation capacity (lower A values) coupled to a decrease in the concentration of photosynthetic pigments. Similar photosynthetic damages were observed in Solanaceous tomato plants infected with Xanthomonas gardneri [30] and Pseudomonas cichorii [31], and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and N. benthamiana plants infected with Pseudomonas amygdali pv. tabaci [13,14,29]. These results suggest that these plant physiological alterations are common in plants infected by bacterial pathogens. The reduction in photosynthesis (A values) in inoculated plants cannot be explained solely based on a reduction in g s. It may also be due to a decrease in mesophyll conductance [55] or to an impairment of the biochemical capacity of the infected leaves to adequately fix CO2 in the chloroplasts. This interpretation is supported by the reductions in the concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids (with concomitant lower Chl a/Chl b and Chl (a + b)/carotenoids ratios) observed for inoculated plants in which lesions expansion reduced the amount of green tissue available for photosynthesis. Similar physiological responses were observed in tomato leaves infected by X. gardneri [30]. According to Ref. [56]; Chl a fluorescence imaging provides a non-invasive and non-destructive method to measure heterogenous changes in photosynthetic metabolism in plants infected by pathogens. In the present study, the Chl a fluorescence images revealed changes in all parameters analyzed in inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated ones over the time-course evaluated. The damage on the photosynthetic apparatus was significantly more drastic as disease progressed. In previous studies, using Chl a fluorescence imaging, it has been possible to detect plant infection even before symptoms are visible by a naked eye [56,57]. Detection of changes in Chl a fluorescence parameters before the appearance of macroscopic symptoms was reported in the tomato (Solanaceae)-P. cichorii [31], N. benthamiana (Solanaceae)-P. amygdali pv. tabaci [29], melon (Cucurbitaceae)-Dickeya dadantii [34], and Arabidopsis (Brasicaceae)-P. syringae pv. tomato [32] interactions. However, in the present study, no changes in Chl a fluorescence parameters were observed before the appearance of macroscopic disease symptoms caused by Xar on castor bean leaves. These observations suggest that detection of physiological changes caused by bacteria on their hosts before symptom appearance by using Chl a fluorescence imaging may be dependent on the plant family. It is tempting to speculate that the difference observed in castor bean with respect to the other plants could be due to either differences in the timing of the host responses, the specific processes targeted by bacterial effectors or the magnitude of the alterations caused by specific strains of the pathogen. It was demonstrated by Ref. [58] that F v/F m provides a very useful relative measure of the maximum quantum yield of the PSII. Here, significant reductions in the F v/F m values starting at 8 dai were observed, which is an indication of the occurrence of photoinhibition in inoculated plants [43]. These observations agree with results obtained with plants belonging to other families [13,14,29–32,34]. In contrast, no significant differences in F v/F m values were observed in cassava plants inoculated with X. phaseoli pv. manihotis when compared with non-inoculated plants [59]. Considering that both castor bean and cassava belong to the Euphorbiaceae family, these results suggest that the host physiology is compromised in different ways during the infection process depending on the especific plant-bacteria interaction. Here, it is shown that Xar caused a stress on castor bean plants leading to a reduction of the PSII performance (lower values of Y(II)) and an oxidative damage likely due to lack or reduction of the transfer of energy absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments to the photochemical process. The increases in Y(NPQ) values suggest that regulated dissipation of the energy was insufficient to minimize photooxidative damage in infected tissue. According to Ref. [16], to maintain the CO2 assimilation process, plants have developed protection and repair mechanisms to prevent this photodamage. The first protection mechanism is non-photochemical quenching, a regulatory energy dissipation at the level of the photosynthetic primary reactions controlled by the proton gradient generated by the electron flow and the xanthophyll cycle. Higher Y(NPQ) values were reported by Ref. [30] for tomato leaves infected with X. gardneri. However, in such a case, a decrease in these parameters was noticed at 15 dai, which did not occur in the present study, even under high disease severity. This ineffective photoprotection mechanism likely induced a decrease in ETR values. Higher Y(NPQ) values in inoculated plants suggest either that the PSII reaction centers were somehow damaged or that the transfer of excitation energy from the antenna to the reaction center was impaired [43]. Increases in Y(NO) values observed in castor bean plants inoculated with Xar showed their inability to protect themselves against the damage caused by excess illumination. According to Ref. [16], the excess illumination excites chlorophylls, which can activate oxygen to its singlet state (or the photosynthetic electrons can be transferred to oxygen) resulting in high ROS production, such as the O2 •-, hydroxyl radicals, and H2O2, which in turn can cause the degradation of proteins, pigments, lipids, and nucleic acids [60]. Moreover, the increases in Y(NPQ) values in Xar-infected leaves were associated with a lower concentration of carotenoids, which protect the plants by avoiding the formation of highly reactive chlorophyll and O2 •- species, thus preventing photosystems and membrane photodamage [26]. The Chl a fluorescence images of infected castor bean leaves confirmed that the limitations on carbon assimilation were directly related to the damage of the photosynthetic apparatus. These results are also in agreement with findings reported for other plant species infected by bacteria [13,14,30,31]. Histochemical staining revealed that infection of castor bean leaves by Xar caused alterations in cell metabolism leading to an early O2 •- accumulation in leaf tissues at 3 and 5 dai. Similar results were reported by Ref. [33] for cucumber (Cucurbitaceae) leaves infected with P. amygdali pv. lachrymans. Consistently, in this study higher absolute values of SOD activity were observed in Xar-infected leaves compared to the non-inoculated control beginning at 8 dai, although a significant difference was observed only at 15 dai, at which times the images of in situ localization did not reveal accumulation of Xar-induced O2 •- in the symptomatic leaf areas. These results suggest that small increases in SOD activity were enough to remove the O2 •- generated in castor bean during Xar infection. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that such biochemical alterations are common in at least some plants infected by bacteria that cause leaf spots. In castor bean infected by Xar, this detoxification process seems to be efficient since no NBT-stained areas were observed in the histochemical localization assay after a small SOD induction at 8 dai. The dismutation of O2 •- to H2O2 and O2 by SOD transforms one reactive molecule (O2 •-) to another (H2O2). The H2O2 accumulation in infected leaves of castor bean plants observed from 5 dai, as revealed by the histochemical staining with DAB, is probably due to the dismutation process occurred between 3 and 5 dai as a strategy to remove the early O2 •- accumulation. The H2O2 produced in this reaction should also be balanced to keep the cells at a steady-state. In this scenario, the peroxidase enzymes play important roles in the removal of the excess H2O2 from the cells (generated spontaneously or resulting from the O2 •- dismutation process) [51]. APX is a specific peroxidase that utilizes ascorbate to reduce H2O2 to water removing H2O2 from chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria [50]. Here, the results indicated higher APX and POX activities in castor bean leaves infected by Xar at 10 and 15 dai. Nonetheless, this process seems to have been inefficient since in situ localization of Xar-induced H2O2 at 10 and 15 dai showed higher accumulation of H2O2 in the symptomatic leaf areas of inoculated plants. Similar H2O2 localization was observed in cucumber leaves infected with P. amygdali pv. lachrymans [33]. Consistently, the results of this study did not reveal significant increases of CAT activity in castor bean leaves inoculated with Xar suggesting that the activity of this antioxidant enzyme did not significantly contribute to H2O2 removal in infected cells. CAT is the main enzymatic H2O2 scavenger in photosynthetic cells converting H2O2 into water and molecular oxygen [49]. High GR activity, which uses NADPH to maintain ascorbate levels in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle [23], occurs in plants under oxidative stress [52]. Analyzing the response of the antioxidative system of tomato plants under infection by X. gardneri, an increase in GR activity was observed [30]. In this study, no significant differences in GR activity between non-inoculated and inoculated plants were found, suggesting that in castor bean plants the ascorbate-glutathione cycle may not be of great importance in the detoxification of the H2O2 generated during the infection by Xar. Membrane damage in plants under abiotic and biotic stress can be estimated based on the concentration of the product of MDA in affected tissue [61]. The increases of MDA concentrations at 10 and 15 dai in inoculated castor bean plants compared to non-inoculated ones indicated the occurrence of cellular damage as the disease progressed due the lipid peroxidation of the cell membranes. Overall, under the experimental conditions of this study, drastic photosynthesis- and antioxidative stress-related physiological changes of castor bean plants infected by Xar could be observed beginning at 10–11 dai, as indicated by PCA. In conclusion, based on the results of the present study, the infection by Xar resulted in drastic physiological alterations linked to the photosynthetic performance of castor bean plants which have not previously been reported to occur in other plant species, even those belonging to the same family. Photosynthetic reduction in castor bean plants was related to diffusional limitations due to the stomatal closure and probably to reductions in the biochemical activity at the chloroplasts level as well as to lower concentrations of photosynthetic pigments that compromised the capacity to fully absorb light. The activity of the antioxidant system of castor bean plants infected by Xar was inefficient to reduce the oxidative stress, mainly in the removal of the high levels of H2O2 generated during bacterial infection."
