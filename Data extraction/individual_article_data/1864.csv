0,Introduction,"It is well-known that global warming and climate change are related with the increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CH4 and CO2. Since 1750, the atmospheric concentration of CH4 has increased by 169%, and that of CO2 has increased by 49% (CO2.earth, 2019; Methanelevels, 2019). It is predicted that the atmospheric concentrations of CH4 and CO2 will continue to increase in the long-term future(Acer, 2019). Therefore, it is a great challenge facing us today to limiting the increasing atmospheric concentrations of CH4 and CO2. Meanwhile, the research reports of IPCC have pointed out that limiting warming to 1.5 °C is possible, however, great reduction of GHG emissions is necessary (Abanades et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016b). The GHG emissions is mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas (Norhasyima and Mahlia, 2018). Hence, many countries have tried to transform their energy systems from fossil energy to renewable energy (Niermann et al., 2019). Billion tons of municipal solid wastes (MSWs) are annually produced worldwide. However, most of them are directly landfilled without any processing, which generates various environmental problems associated with the landfill gas (LFG) emissions (Bosmans et al., 2013; Hao et al., 2008). The LFG is generated by anaerobic decomposition of the biodegradable compounds, which is composed of mostly CH4 (c.a. 50%), CO2 (c.a. 45%), N2 (c.a. 5%), and a small amount of other impurities such as O2, H2S, and non-methane volatile organic compounds. If the LFG is directly emitted into the atmosphere without any pre-treatment, then it will not only cause a large amount of GHG emission but also may result in challenging safety concerns since CH4 is a flammable gas. Therefore, the LFG should be collected and utilized to limit its negative effects on environment. In general, LFG is currently utilized as a fuel gas for direct heating and/or electricity generation, and the LFG utilization plants are currently being operated in some countries to produce heat and/or electricity (Broun and Sattler, 2016). Compared with the direct LFG emission without collecting and utilization, use of LFG for heat or electricity generation will greatly reduce the GHG emissions since the global warming potential (100-year) of CH4 is reported to be 28 times higher than that of CO2 (Ghgprotocol, 2019). However, both the direct heating and electricity generation methods still generate large amounts of CO2 emissions after LFG flaring. If the CH4 and CO2 contained in LFG are converted to value-added methanol, then both the CO2-equivalent reduction and profitable methanol production can be achieved simultaneously. Methanol is a vital platform raw material which can be used to produce various value-added chemicals such as acetic acid, esters, formaldehyde, and light olefins (Bertau et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Olah, 2005). It also can be used as fuel for direct methanol fuel cells or blended with gasoline. In general, methanol is mostly produced via a gas-to-methanol process using natural gas as the carbon source (Zhang et al., 2017). A typical gas-to-methanol process generally includes three units (i.e., a syngas production unit, a methanol production unit, and a methanol upgrading unit.) In the syngas production unit, various reforming technologies including steam methane reforming (SMR) (Oliveira et al., 2010), auto-thermal reforming of methane (ATR) (Shahhosseini et al., 2017), carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CDR) (Kathiraser et al., 2013), and partial oxidation of methane (POM) (Singha et al., 2017) can be used to generate syngas. However, all the aforementioned reforming technologies produce syngas with the syngas ratio of H2/(2CO+3CO2) deviating from 1, which cannot be directly used for the following methanol production (Olah et al., 2013). This implies that an additional syngas ratio conditioning unit is essential for further syngas ratio conditioning. Furthermore, the ATR and POM technologies use pure oxygen as the feedstock which requires expensive air separation units (Zhang et al., 2017). Considering these disadvantages of the aforementioned methane reforming technologies, in this work, we applied CO2/Steam-mixed reforming of methane (CSR) to co-produce syngas, of which the syngas ratio can be flexibly adjusted by controlling the two aforementioned methane reforming technologies (i.e., SMR and CDR). Recently, methanol production from CO2, biogas, or refuse derived fuel (RDF) have attracted significant attentions. Nguyen et al. (Nguyen and Zondervan, 2019) implemented the economic and environmental analysis of methanol production from the captured CO2 via CO2 reforming and hydrogenation technologies. They found that converting CO2 to methanol via reforming is the most appropriate direction considering the methanol production cost, while production of methanol from CO2 by using renewable hydrogen would be the proper choice for obtaining near-zero carbon emissions in the future. Kim et al. (Do and Kim, 2019) proposed a methanol production process by direct CO2 hydrogenation utilizing solar energy, and optimized the process configurations and operating conditions to maximize the methanol production via a sequential quadratic programming method. In addition, several alternative CO2-to-methanol process scenarios were established to find the optimistic conditions, under which the methanol minimum selling price was estimated to be around 0.53 $/kg. De Weireld et al. (Meunier et al., 2020) carried out a case study for CO2 conversion into methanol which included an amine-based CO2 capture unit, a water electrolysis unit, and a methanol synthesis unit, to evaluate the interest of the entire CO2 conversion into methanol process through a techno-economic analysis and environmental assessment. It was found that the proposed process significantly reduced GHG emission, and the profitability of the entire CO2 conversion into methanol process which strongly depended on the production costs of electricity and H2. Santos et al. (2018) simulated and optimized four methanol synthesis processes using different biogas sources including landfill, palm oil effluent, corn cobs and sorghum fermentation. For each case, a process optimization study was implemented to maximize the methanol production, and it was indicated that these processes greatly reduced the CO2-equivalent emissions, and the biogas from palm oil effluent seemed to be the most profitable case. Borgogna et al. (2019), suggested a waste-to-methanol process using RDF where the solid waste gasification was applied for syngas production, and implemented a simplified process simulation to evaluate the influence of waste composition on overall methanol production. It was found that conversion of waste into methanol rather than energy has higher environmental benefits, and the CO2 reduction rate could be up to 68% if the renewable power was applied in the proposed waste-to-methanol process. Very recently, Kim et al. (Lee et al., 2020) established two innovative LFG to methanol processes by using CO2 direct hydrogenation and methane reforming technologies, with and without additional H2 supply. It was found that the proposed LFG to methanol processes had high carbon and energy efficiencies of up to 92% and 69%, respectively. Meanwhile, the methanol production cost was estimated to be in the range of 392–440 USD/ton, which was comparable with the methanol market price. Although various studies on the methanol production from different carbon sources such as CO2, biogas, RDF, and LFG have been implemented. To our knowledge, no comparative studies on the development of sustainable LFG-to-methanol processes where the CSR technology is applied for syngas production, and the membrane separation or additional H2 supply is used for syngas ratio conditioning have been found in literature. Therefore, based on our previous studies on the gas-to-methanol processes (Zhang et al., 2016b, 2017), we now suggest another two LFG-to-methanol processes where the optimum syngas ratio (H2/(2CO+3CO2) = 1) is fulfilled by either supplying additional H2 (option 1) or pre-separating the surplus CO2 in LFG using membrane (option 2). Moreover, except the main components such as CH4 and CO2, LFG also contains inert gas N2. After the methanol synthesis, recycling the unreacted syngas to the methanol synthesis reactor reduces the CO2 emissions, and improves the total methanol production, however, it will also cause the accumulation of the inert N2 in the methanol synthesis loop which will increase the equipment costs. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to find an alternative way to more efficiently utilize LFG, which should substantially reduce the CO2 emissions in the current landfill industry, and to investigate the effects of unreacted syngas recycling on both the technical and economic performances of the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes to find their optimum process configurations. Both process modelling and techno-economic analysis were implemented to compare the energy efficiency, CO2-equivalent reduction rate, as well as the net present value (NPV), the internal rate of return (IRR), and the discounted payback period (DPBP) of both proposed LFG-to-methanol options. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was further carried out to ascertain the bottleneck factors of the profitability indicator IRR for both options, under different process conditions."
1,Material and methods,"The flowchart of the experimental procedures for the process simulation and economic analysis of the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes are illustrated in Fig. 1 , and the detailed methods are shown below."
2,Process modelling,"2.1 Process modelling A gas-to-methanol process generally includes several sections such as feeding, pre-treatment, reforming, compressing, methanol synthesis, recycling and methanol upgrading sections. Whereas, the pre-treatment and the methanol upgrading sections will not be included in the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes because of their minor effects on the overall performance of the entire LFG-to-methanol process, and they are available from the current chemical and energy industries. Therefore, in the present study, we excluded the pre-treatment and methanol upgrading sections in the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes. The schematic diagram of the processes used for modelling and the schematic process flow diagram of the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the two proposed options differ in the way applied for the syngas ratio conditioning. That is, in option 1, the LFG is directly reformed into syngas, and the renewable H2 is additionally applied to adjust the syngas ratio. While, in option 2, instead of using additional H2, a portion of CO2 in LFG was pre-separated for syngas ratio adjustment. In the proposed process models, CH4, CO2, N2, and O2 were selected as the representative components in LFG, and its detailed composition is shown in the supplementary information (see Table S1). Moreover, the Peng-Robinson equation was applied for the thermodynamic calculation, which is suitable for the simulation of the light gases, hydrocarbons and alcohols (Lee et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2016b). In the reforming section, the temperature and pressure of the reformer used in the two proposed options are 850 °C and 5 bar (gauge), respectively. In this case, the CH4, CO2, and H2O contained in the feed stream of the reformer are reformed into syngas via equations (1)–(3). (1) CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 , ΔH 298 K = 206 kJ/mol (2) CH 4 + CO 2 ↔ 2 CO + 2 H 2 , ΔH 298 K = 247 kJ/mol (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 , ΔH 298 K = - 41 kJ/mol The aforementioned reactions shown in equations (1)–(3) are in chemical equilibrium under the aforementioned reaction conditions because these reactions take place very fast under elevated temperature. Moreover, the RGibbs model was selected, and the “restricted chemical equilibrium” was applied for the simulation of the reformer. After reforming, the generated syngas further enters the following methanol synthesis section. Here, the syngas ratio of H2/(2CO + 3CO2) ranging from 1 to 1.01 should be fulfilled, as required by the following methanol synthesis (Shahhosseini et al., 2018). As we can see from Fig. 3a, in option 1, additional H2 was applied for the syngas ratio conditioning since the produced syngas is H2-deficient due to the excess CO2 in the LFG. However, in option 2, a portion of CO2 in LFG was separated for adjusting the syngas ratio instead of using additional H2. In the methanol synthesis section, the main reactions are shown in equations (4)–(6). In addition, the temperature and pressure of the methanol synthesis reactor were 250 °C and 50 bar (gauge), respectively. (4) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH, ΔH 298 K = - 90 . 5 kJ/mol (5) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH + H 2 O, ΔH 298 K = - 49 . 5 kJ/mol (6) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O, ΔH 298 K = 41 . 2 kJ/mol The Rplug model integrated with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) kinetic equations was selected to simulate the methanol synthesis reactor where the related kinetic parameters were obtained from the previous works (Lim et al., 2009). After methanol synthesis, the methanol product as well as the unreacted syngas were sent to the gas-liquid (G-L) separator. In the G-L separator, the unreacted syngas, together with the inert gases was obtained at the top outlet, and a liquid stream containing the crude methanol was obtained at the bottom outlet. After one-pass conversion, a certain amount of the unreacted syngas was recycled to the previous methanol synthesis reactor to further produce methanol, and the remaining portion of unreacted syngas was vented out to suppress the accumulation of inert components (e.g., N2 and CH4)."
3,Estimation of capital investment and product cost,"2.2 Estimation of capital investment and product cost Based on the obtained data from process modelling, we estimated the capital cost of the main pieces of equipment for the two proposed options at different recycle ratios (i.e., 0.6 to 0.95). Here, the capital costs of some equipment (e.g., the reformer and methanol synthesis reactor) were calculated using the six-tenth factor rule according to the reference cost. The capital costs for other equipment such as the heat exchanger, compressor and G-L separator were estimated as per the methods suggested by Peter and Walas et al. (Peters et al., 2003; Walas, 1990). Here, it should be noted that the equipment costs of the pre-treatment and methanol purification units were not included since they were excluded from the system boundary of the present study, which were estimated to account for approximately 10% of the total equipment costs according to the reference data on similar process system (Amirkhas et al., 2006). After obtaining the main equipment cost, we further estimated the total capital investment (TCI) via a ratio estimation approach, as shown in equation (7). When estimating the TCI, the ratio factors for fluid processing were adopted, as suggested by Peter et al. (Peters et al., 2003). (7) T C I = ( ∑ i = 1 n R F i + 1 ) × I E where RF i is the ratio factor for the direct cost, indirect cost and working capital; i is the item 1–3 in Tables 1 and 2 . I E refers to the delivered equipment cost, assuming a 10% delivery cost. The total product cost (TPC) was calculated via equation (8) according to the economic assumptions listed in Table 3 . (8) T P C = C M + C U + C O & M + C P & R + C D + C T & I + C P & G where, C M is the raw material cost, C U is the utility cost, C O&M is the operating & maintenance cost, C P&R is the patent & royalty cost, C D is the depreciation cost, C T&I is the local tax & insurance cost, and C P&G refers to the plant overhead cost & general expenses (Zhang et al., 2017). In TPC, the depreciation cost C D represents the TCI. In addition, the depreciation cost was calculated via a linear method where the recovery period and salvage value were set as 20 years and 5%, respectively. Moreover, a ratio estimation approach was selected to determine the other costs such as C O&M , C P&R , C T&I , and C P&G (Zhang et al., 2017)."
4,Economic analysis,"2.3 Economic analysis After the estimation of TCI and TPC, we further implemented the economic analysis, and three important economic performance indicators (i.e., NPV, IRR, and DPBP) were calculated for evaluating the economic performance of both proposed options. The NPV and DPBP are respectively determined by equations (9) and (10). (9) N P V ( t , n ) = ∑ t = 0 n C F t ( 1 + i ) n where t, n, i, and CF refer to the year of the cash flow, the total number of years, the discount rate, and the cash flow, respectively. Moreover, the IRR was determined by adjusting the discount rate i in equation (9) to make the NPV to be zero. (10) D P B P = N y + | C n | C p where, N y refers to the number of years after project initiation, at which the last cumulative discounted cash flow is negative, C n is the last cumulative discounted cash flow which is negative, and C p is the discounted cash flow of the year at which the cumulative discounted cash flow first becomes positive, respectively. During the profitability evaluation in the present study, the hurdle rate of IRR is set as 12%, and the base DPBP is set as 10 years, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Influences of recycle ratio on the process performance of the two proposed options,"3.1 Influences of recycle ratio on the process performance of the two proposed options For each of the two proposed LFG-to-methanol process options, we carried out five case studies to investigate the influences of the recycle ratio on the methanol production, the carbon and thermal efficiency, and the CO2-equivalent reduction rate. The process parameters and some of the obtained results of the two proposed LFG-to-methanol processes are listed in Tables S2–3. For the proposed options 1 and 2 shown in Fig. 3a and b, it can be imagined that as the recycle ratio increases, the increasing more unreacted syngas enters the methanol synthesis reactor. This will increase the methanol production and decreases the amount of vent gas as well. Fig. 4 distinctively shows that the methanol production of both options monotonously increases, and that of options 1 & 2 respectively increases from 493 to 700, and 345–508 kmol/h, when the recycle ratio increases from 0.6 to 0.95. This observation can be ascribed to the increased total conversion of the fresh LFG. In addition, the energy efficiency of the methanol synthesis process is of great importance on the sustainable development and cleaner production of the methanol industry. Therefore, two important energy efficiencies (i.e., carbon efficiency and thermal efficiency) were further calculated to quantitatively evaluate the technical performance of both proposed options. In a burner-type reformer, natural gas (NG) is generally used to provide the required heat. However, in this work, instead of using NG, the vent gas has sufficient heating values which can be used as a heating fuel. In this case, the energy efficiency could be further improved. The effects of recycle ratio on the carbon and thermal efficiencies are shown in Fig. 5 . It is worth noting that with the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.95, the carbon efficiency of option 1 is improved from 56.20 to 79.77%, and that of option 2 is improved from 39.26 to 57.87%. Meanwhile, the thermal efficiency of option 1 is improved from 52.87 to 75.78%, and that of option 2 is improved from 52.42 to 76.81%. This increase in the carbon and thermal efficiencies of both options is because the methanol production increases as the recycle ratio increases, and the increase in the heat required by the energy-intensive reformer can be compensated by the vent gas stream. Therefore, a higher recycle ratio seems to be beneficial for improving the carbon efficiency to 79.77 and 57.87%, and the thermal efficiency to 75.78 and 76.81% for both options 1 and 2 under the recycle ratio of 0.95, respectively. Apart from the carbon and thermal efficiencies, another technical performance indicator (i.e., the CO2-equivalent reduction rate) is also very important to the methanol production industry since it reflects the environmental friendliness of the related methanol synthesis processes. Compared with the direct emission of LFG, the conversion of LFG to methanol can substantially reduce the emission of CO2-equivalent. Here, it should be noted that within the current system boundaries of the proposed LFG-to-methanol processes (options 1 & 2), methanol is considered as a final product, and CO2 emissions caused by further burning or conversion of methanol is not included in this work. The effects of recycle ratio on the CO2-equivalent reduction rate are shown in Fig. 6 . As seen in Fig. 6, with the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.95, the CO2-equivalent reduction rates of options 1 and 2 increase from 92.87 to 96.71%, and 90.14–93.12%, respectively. This increase in the CO2-equivalent reduction rate is mainly because of the decrease in the amount of the vent gas stream when recycle ratio increases. Therefore, a higher recycle ratio seems to be also beneficial for improving the CO2-equivalent reduction rates, which are up to 96.71 and 93.12% for options 1 and 2 at the recycle ratio of 0.95, respectively. Based on the above observations, it can be concluded that both proposed options 1 and 2 are highly efficient processes for large scale CO2-equivalent reduction in both landfill and methanol production industries via converting the landfill gas to value-added methanol, and the elevated recycle ratio is preferred for both options, considering the carbon and thermal efficiencies, together with the CO2-equivalent reduction rate. However, the circumstances could be different when considering the process economy, which will be further discussed in detail."
7,Estimation of capital investment and product cost,"3.2 Estimation of capital investment and product cost After process development, we further implemented five case studies for each of the two proposed LFG-to-methanol processes to estimate the TCI and TPC under various recycle ratios. The overall stream results of the two proposed options at different recycle ratios are listed in Tables 4 and 5 . It is clearly shown that for the conversion of a given amount of LFG, the produced amount of methanol, and the net CO2-equivalent reduction monotonously increase, as the recycle ratio increases from 0.6 to 0.95. However, an increasing recycle ratio will also cause the increase of the equipment costs, especially for the relatively high recycle ratio ranges (0.8–0.95), which will be further discussed in detail in the following sections. Tables 6 and 7 show the estimated main equipment costs of the two proposed options under different recycle ratios. It is clearly shown that the main equipment costs of the proposed options 1 & 2 increase as the recycle ratio increases. With the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.95, the main equipment cost of option 1 increases from 22.65 to 36.69 M$, and that of option 2 increases from 21.75 to 34.47 M$, respectively. The increase in TCI of both options can be mainly attributed to the increase in the equipment cost of the methanol reactor. Moreover, option 2 has a slightly lower equipment cost compared to option 1, which is because of the lower capital cost of its methanol reactor, as can be confirmed from Tables 6 and 7 After the equipment cost estimation, the estimation of the TCI of the two proposed options were further conducted, and the derived TCI results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 As we can see, the TCI of the two proposed options increases as the recycle ratio increases. More specifically, with the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.95, the TCI of option 1 increases from 147.75 to 239.34 M$, and that of option 2 increases from 141.88 to 224.88 M$. Fig. 7 a and b shows the TCI of both proposed options based on the methanol production. As we can see, the TCI per methanol production first slightly decreases with the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.8, which is mainly due to the increase in methanol production. However, on the contrary, it increases with the recycle ratio further increasing from 0.8 to 0.95, especially for the case with recycle ratio of 0.95. This is mainly because of the substantially increased total capital investment, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 Fig. 8 a and b shows the TPC and its distribution of the two proposed options 1 and 2, respectively. As seen in Fig. 8a, the TPC of option 1 first decreases from 417.09 to 344.69 $/Mt methanol, with the recycle ratio increasing from 0.6 to 0.9 and then slightly increases to 346.43 $/Mt methanol, with the recycle ratio further increasing to 0.95. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 8b, the TPC of option 2 decreases from 246.05 to 222.33 $/Mt methanol, as the recycle ratio increases from 0.6 to 0.8 and then increases from 222.33 to 242.45 $/Mt methanol, as the recycle ratio further increases from 0.8 to 0.95. Furthermore, as for option 1, the raw material cost (especially for H2 cost) and the TCI related costs (e.g., the depreciation, operating and maintenance) account for the largest portion of TPC, which implies that the TPC of option 1 would be sensitive to the price of the H2 feedstock and the capital investment. While, for option 2, as seen in Fig. 8b, the TCI related costs occupy the largest portion of TPC and the raw material cost seems to be neglectable. This difference in TPC distribution is because option 1 uses expensive additional H2 as feedstock while option 2 separates the excessive CO2 for syngas ratio conditioning."
8,Economic evaluation,"3.3 Economic evaluation After the estimation of TCI and TPC, we further implemented the economic analysis according to the related assumptions shown in Table 8 , and the obtained economic evaluation results of both proposed options 1 and 2 under different recycle ratios ranging from 0.6 to 0.95 are shown in Tables 9 and 10 . As seen in Table 9, within the recycle ratio range of 0.6–0.95, the NPV of option 1 ranges from 10.60 to 47.53 M$, which is higher than zero. Moreover, the IRR of option 1 is in the range of 12.53–15.20%, which is higher than the hurdle rate of 12%. However, the DPBP of option 1 ranges from 11.72 to 17.74 year which is higher than the base DPBP of 10 years. Meanwhile, as seen in Table 10, with the recycle ratio ranging from 0.6 to 0.95, the NPV of option 2 ranges from 70.99 to 117.67 M$, which is higher than zero. Furthermore, the IRR of option 2 is in the range of 15.61–20.38%, which is higher than 12%. Moreover, within the recycle ratio range of 0.6–0.8, the DPBP of option 2 ranges from 7.25 to 7.50 year which are lower than 10 years. Therefore, option 2 with the recycle ratios of 0.6–0.8 is found to be the preferable cases, and it seems that option 2 with recycle ratio of 0.7 is the optimum case considering its highest IRR and lowest DPBP."
9,Sensitivity analysis,"3.4 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis of options 1 & 2 was respectively conducted under the recycle ratios of 0.8 and 0.7, aiming at exploring the influences of uncertainties of some vital factors (e.g., capital expenditure (CAPEX), methanol price, H2 price, CO2 allowance price, and utility cost), and the derived results are shown in Fig. 9 . As seen in Fig. 9a, for option 1, the CAPEX and methanol price are the most sensitive factors, and the prices of CO2 allowance and H2 are the medium sensitive factors. Meanwhile, as seen in Fig. 9b, for option 2, the CAPEX is the most sensitive factor, and the prices of methanol and CO2 allowance are the medium sensitive factors. However, for both options, the utility cost is found to be less sensitive compared with the prices of methanol, H2, and CO2 allowance as well as the CAPEX. Therefore, the prices of methanol, H2, and CO2 allowance as well as the CAPEX will be further investigated in detail, and the plant scale is selected instead of CAPEX in the following analysis. 3.4.1 Influences of methanol price on IRR Fig. 10 shows the influences of methanol price on the IRR of both options 1 & 2. It is shown that the IRR of both options decreases with a decreasing methanol price. As the methanol price decreases from 400 to 250 $/Mt, the IRR of options 1 and 2 decreases from 15.20 to 7.27% and 20.38 to 15.58%, respectively. In addition, the IRR of option 1 is found to be lower than that of option 2, and the difference in the IRR of both options 1 and 2 increases with the decrease of methanol price. This is mainly due to the use of expensive H2 in option 1, which substantially increases its methanol production cost. 3.4.2 Influences of CO2 allowance price on IRR In consideration of the ever-increasing stringent environmental protection policies, we also calculated the IRR of both proposed options at different CO2 allowance prices. As can be seen from Fig. 11 , the IRR of both options 1 & 2 decreases with a decreasing CO2 allowance price. As the CO2 allowance price decreases from 30 to 5 $/Mt, the IRR of options 1 & 2 decreases from 20.38 to 5.19%, and 25.50 to 11.12%, respectively. Furthermore, the IRR of options 1 & 2 is found to be lower than the hurdle rate of 12%, as the CO2 allowance price decreases to 15 and 5 $/Mt, respectively. 3.4.3 Influences of plant scale on IRR Fig. 12 illustrates the influences of plant scale (i.e., methanol production scale) on the IRR of both options. It is shown that the IRR of options 1 & 2 can be increased by increasing the plant scales. With the plant scale increasing from 1 × 104 to 1 × 106 tonne per year (TPY), the IRR of options 1 and 2 increases from 4.80 to 34.15%, and 11.05–45.92%, respectively. However, the increasing rate decreases within the plant scale range of 2.5 × 105–1 × 106 TPY. In addition, both options would be economically unfavorable when the plant scale decreases to 25,000 and 10,000TPY, respectively. 3.4.4 Influences of H2 price on IRR We also investigated the influences of H2 price on the IRR of option 1 since H2 price is also shown to be a sensitive factor, and the derived results are illustrated in Fig. 13 . As clearly shown in Fig. 13, the IRR of option 1 increases with the decrease of H2 price. As the H2 price decreases from 2500 to 100 $/Mt, the IRR of option 1 was improved from 15.20 to 22.76%. In addition, under the H2 price of 1000 $/Mt, the IRR of option 1 is determined to be 20.18%, which is comparable with the IRR of the baseline case of option 2 (i.e., 20.38%)."
10,Performance comparison of the two proposed LFG-to-methanol processes,"3.5 Performance comparison of the two proposed LFG-to-methanol processes As also mentioned previously, the two proposed options differ in the approach applied for syngas ratio adjustment. In option 1, additional H2 was used, whereas, in option 2, surplus CO2 was pre-separated to make the H2/(2CO+3CO2) ratio to be within the required range (i.e., 1–1.01). From the technical aspects, option 1 is beneficial compared with option 2 because it has higher carbon and thermal efficiency, higher CO2-equivalent reduction rate, and methanol production, as can be seen from Figs. 4–6. This is mainly because in option 2, a portion of CO2 in LFG was vented for syngas ratio conditioning, while, in option 1, the CO2 in LFG was converted by using additional H2. However, from the economic aspects, option 2 is superior to option 1 because it has higher NPV and IRR, together with lower DPBP, as listed in Tables 9 and 10. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis results shown in Figs. 10–13 indicate that the IRR of option 1 is generally lower than that of option 2. This is mainly because of the lower product cost of option 2, as can be seen from Fig. 8. It also should be noted that the IRR of option 1 could be comparable with that of option 2 if the H2 price could be lowered down to around 1000 $/Mt."
11,Conclusion,"To pursue a large-scale CO2-equivalent reduction in the landfill industry, we suggested two sustainable LFG-to-methanol process options 1 and 2 to efficiently convert the landfill gas to value-added methanol, where the syngas ratio conditioning was conducted via adding external H2 or pre-removing the surplus CO2 in LFG, respectively. A comparative technical study was carried out to determine the carbon and thermal efficiencies as well as the CO2-equivalent reduction rates of both proposed options. After that, an economic analysis was further implemented to determine the process profitability via indicators such as NPV, IRR, and DPBP. Moreover, five case studies for each proposed option with different recycle ratios ranging from 0.6 to 0.95 were carried out to find the optimum process configuration. The techno-economic analysis results clearly indicate that both options can be regarded as highly efficient processes for methanol production using landfill gas. Moreover, option 1 seems to be more energy efficient and eco-friendly than option 2, considering its higher energy efficiency and CO2-equivalent reduction rate. Whereas, option 2 is more economically competitive, considering its higher NPV and IRR, together with the lower DPBP. This work provides sustainable process routes for large-scale CO2-equivalent reduction in landfill industry via efficient conversion of landfill gas to value-added methanol. Instead of direct combustion of LFG, converting it to methanol can achieve the CO2-equivalent reduction and the methanol production simultaneously, which makes the landfill and methanol production industries become more sustainable and profitable, especially in the event of a future high carbon tax and low H2 price."
