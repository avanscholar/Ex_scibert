0,Introduction,"In the recent years, with the rapid progress of nanoscience and nanotechnology, inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted great interest due to their wide range of applications [1]. The NPs present excellent optical, thermal, electronic, mechanical and magnetic properties that obviously arise from their nanometer-scale [2]. So, nowadays, NPs are the indispensable material for industries and high-technological fields [3]. These nanomaterials may be synthesized from many materials by various techniques, such as electrodeposition, solvothermal method, sol–gel chemistry, co-precipitation and microwave methods [4]. Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), as an inorganic NP, has been widely studied because of various practical applications in fuel-cell technology, oxygen sensors, cutting tools, refractory materials, thermal barrier coatings, high temperature ceramics, gate dielectrics in metal oxide-semiconductor devices and polymer nanocomposites (NCs) [4–6]. Also, owing to its surface characteristics of having both acid–basic and redox functions, it has been widely applied as a catalyst in many reactions [4]. Pure ZrO2 is in three polymorphic forms in the equilibrium state: below ∼1170°C (monoclinic), in the temperature range of ∼1170–2370°C (tetragonal) and above ∼2370°C (cubic) [7]. One of the applications of ZrO2 and other NPs is their usage in the synthesis of NCs. Due to their high specific surface area, high polarity and incompatibility with the polymer matrix, NPs have a great tendency to agglomerate in the polymer matrix. So, controlling the stability of NPs in the organic media is a challenge [2,8]. Surface modification of NPs is a method used to overcome this problem. The modification recovers the interfacial interactions between the inorganic NPs and the organic matrix. Modification could be done through two ways; the first one is a chemical treatment in which a small molecule such as silane coupling agents is absorbed on the surface of NPs [9,10]. The second one is grafting polymeric molecules such as poly(methyl methacrylate) onto the hydroxyl groups on the surface of NPs via covalent bonding [2,11]. In this way, the polymers can perform as coupling agents preventing the accumulation of NPs in the polymer matrix. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a thermoplastic, versatile, semi crystalline, biocompatible and water soluble synthetic polymer. Its backbone is mainly composed of CC bonds and an OH group at every other carbon in the chain [12–16]. PVA was first synthesized by Hermann and Haehnel by hydrolyzing poly(vinyl acetate) in ethanol with potassium hydroxide in 1924 [16]. PVA has properties such as low electrical conductivity, good hygroscopic, adhesive properties, outstanding chemical resistance, improved optical properties, easy preparation, low proton conductivity and good biodegradability. These properties have resulted in a broad range of industrial products such as textile sizing and fishing, coatings, membranes and a protective colloid for emulsion polymers [14–20]. PVA was applied to coating Fe3O4 NPs to be used in magnetic drug targeting [21]. Also, PVA was used as the stabilizing agent to prevent the agglomeration of Ag2O and ZnO NPs [22,23]. Poly(amide-imide)s (PAI)s are one of the successful high-performance polymers with excellent mechanical and thermal properties at high temperature, good solubility in highly polar solvents, chemical resistance as well as solvent resistance [24,25]. They inherit favorable features from both polyamides and polyimides. These properties have made them appropriate for various applications such as sensors, surface alignment of liquid crystals, composite materials, membranes and many electrical types of devices [25]. PAIs are usually synthesized by polycondensation polymerization in which the solvents such as pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and chlorinated solvents are used. Most of them are toxic, flammable, harmful and hazardous [26]. So, in this study, we tried to synthesize PAI through a green method using ionic liquids (ILs) as the green solvents. ILs, due to their properties such as nonflammability, non-volatility, low vapor pressure, thermal stability and high ionic conductivity, have a high potential for polymerization. Molten tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) has been used as a readily achievable IL [26–29]. NCs, which are generally organic polymer composites with inorganic nanoscale filler, have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. They have provided new opportunities to investigate new functionalities and behaviors beyond those of the customary materials. NCs combine the features of the inorganic filler, such as thermal stability, and those of the organic polymer, such as flexibility [2,30–32]. So, the resultant NCs, due to some properties such as high thermal stability, strength, hardness, flexibility, slow biodegradation rate, low melt viscosity and gas impermeability, are highly required in different industries [33,34]. Also, they have been applied in many fields such as military equipment, stationary phases for chromatographic separations, catalysis and optical devices [31,32]. In the present study, we have tried to synthesize and characterize novel optically active PAI/ZrO2–PVA NCs (PZ–PNC)s through the ultrasonic method. At first, to prevent the agglomeration of ZrO2 NPs in the PAI matrix and improve their interactions with the polymer, the surface of them was treated by PVA as a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. The optically active PAI was fabricated during polycondensation reaction of biocompatible trimellitylimido-l-leucine diacid (DA) and 4,4′-diaminediphenylsulfone (DAS) under the green condition in the presence of TBAB and triphenyl phosphite (TPP) as the activating agents. Subsequently, PZ–PNCs were fabricated by adding different amounts of modified ZrO2 NPs (4, 8, 12wt%) into the PAI matrix under the ultrasonic irradiation. The obtained NCs were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."
1,Experimental,
2,Apparatus,"2.1 Apparatus The reaction was carried out by a MISONIX Ultrasonic XL-2000 SERIES (USA), with the frequency of 2.25×104 Hz and the power of 100W. The FT-IR spectra data for samples were reported by a Jasco-680 (Japan) spectrometer at a resolution of 4cm−1. They were scanned at the wavenumber range of 400–4000cm−1. Weight losses of the obtained samples were distinguished by TGA, on a STA503 TA (Germany) at a heating rate of 20°C/min, from 25°C to 800°C, under argon atmosphere. XRD patterns were achieved by a Philips X’pert MPD with a copper target operating at the current of 100mA and a voltage of 45kV and Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1542nm) in the range of 10–80° and at the speed of 0.05°min−1. The surface morphology of the samples was observed using TEM by a Philips CM 120, Netherlands, microscope with an accelerating voltage of 150kV and FE-SEM (Hitachi: S-4160, Japan). Inherent viscosity was determined using a Cannon Fenske Routine Viscometer (Germany) at the concentration of 0.5g/dL in DMF at 25°C."
3,Materials,"2.2 Materials PVA (Mw=75,000 and 99% hydrolysis) was purchased from Merck Chemical Co. (Germany). Nanosized ZrO2 powder with an average particle size of <50nm was purchased from Nanosabz Co. (Tehran, Iran). Other solvents and chemicals were obtained from Fluka Chemical Co. (Switzerland), Aldrich Chemical Co. and Merck Chemical Co. (Germany). TBAB (C16H36BrN, Mw=322.38g/mol, mp=100–103°C), trimellitic anhydride (1,2,4-benzene tricarboxylic anhydride) (TMA), 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone (C12H12N2O2S, Mw=248.31g/mol) and TPP were used as received without further purification."
4,Synthesis of PAI,2.3 Synthesis of PAI The DA and the sulfonated PAI were synthesized according to our previous work [35].
5,Preparation of modified ZrO2 NPs,"2.4 Preparation of modified ZrO2 NPs The surface modification of ZrO2 NPs was accomplished by PVA as follows: first, 0.1g of ZrO2 NPs and 6mL of deionized water were stirred and sonicated for 30min. Then, 0.01g of PVA (10wt% of ZrO2 NPs) was stirred with 6mL of deionized water for 30min at 90°C and sonicated for 30min. Afterward, these two solutions were mixed and sonicated for 2h. Finally, the resultant solution was dried at 60°C for 24h."
6,Preparation of PZ–PNCs,"2.5 Preparation of PZ–PNCs For the synthesis of PZ–PNCs, first, 0.1g of the synthesized PAI was dispersed in 20mL of ethanol and sonicated for 10min; then appropriate amounts of modified ZrO2 NPs (4, 8, and 12wt%) were mixed with the obtained suspension of PAI and irradiated by ultrasonic radiation for 4h. Finally, the solvent was removed and the obtained solid was dried in vacuum at 80°C for 3h."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of PAI,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of PAI Novel amino acid containing the aromatic PAI was prepared by a safe, fast and green method through the step-growth polymerization of the equimolar of biodegradable DA with DAS using molten TBAB as the green medium and TPP as the activating agent (Fig. 1 ). TPP can activate DA toward the nucleophilic substitutions by converting them to alkoxyphosphonium ions [24]. The existence of the amino acid in the polymer chain results in nonbiological macromolecules with biomimetic structures and properties [24]. The inherent viscosity of the obtained PAI was 0.25dL/g (measured at a concentration 0.5dL/g in DMF at 25°C). The FT-IR spectra of the neat PAI (Fig. 2a) showed absorptions around 3390cm−1 (NH stretching), 1588cm−1 (NH bending), 3114cm−1 (aromatic CH stretching) and 2925cm−1 (aliphatic CH stretching). The bands at 1775 and 1725cm−1 (asymmetry and symmetry, respectively) corresponded to the overlapped carbonyl groups of amide and imide to corresponded to the carbonyls group of imide and the peak at 1671cm−1 is related to carbonyl group of amide. The peaks at 1380 (CN) and 732cm−1 (CO out of plane deformation) were related to the imide heterocycle ring in the PAI molecule."
9,Synthesis and characterization of modified ZrO2 NPs,"3.2 Synthesis and characterization of modified ZrO2 NPs To employ ZrO2 NPs as the useful reinforcing agent in the polymer NCs, good dispersity and proper interfacial adhesion of them with the polymer matrix are necessary. So, in this study, at first, the surface of ZrO2 NPs was modified with PVA. The possible interaction between NPs surface and PVA could be through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3 ). FT-IR spectra of the pure ZrO2, the neat PVA and the modified ZrO2 with PVA are shown in Fig. 4 . In the FT-IR spectrum of the ZrO2 NPs (Fig. 4a), two characteristic peaks were observed at about 3300–3400cm−1 and 1631cm−1, which could be attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of hydroxyl groups on the surface of ZrO2 NPs. Also, an absorption band at 400–600cm−1, which was relevant to Zr–O, appeared. In the neat PVA spectrum (Fig. 4b), a broad peak around 3100–3500cm−1 could be seen that was related to the hydroxyl groups of PVA molecules and the adsorbed water. The peaks in the region of 2942cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of CH and CH2 groups; also, the absorption peaks at 1420cm−1 were due to the vibration of CH2 bonds in the PVA structure. Furthermore, a peak at 1713cm−1 could be seen that was relevant to the carbonyl groups of residual acetate groups remaining by the preparation of PVA from the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate). The spectrum of the modified ZrO2 (Fig. 4c) showed peaks of pure ZrO2 in the region of 400–600cm−1. In this spectrum, some bands at 2930, 1433 and 1629cm−1 could be seen that were related to PVA grafted on the surface of ZrO2 NPs, but these bands had been shifted in comparison with the pure PVA. Also, there was a broad peak at the 3100–3500cm−1 region that indicated the hydroxyl group on the surface of ZrO2 NPs and PVA. So, the FT-IR analysis confirmed the coating of PVA on the surface of NPs."
10,Synthesis and characterization of PZ–PNCs,"3.3 Synthesis and characterization of PZ–PNCs For the synthesis of NCs with improved properties, it is essential that NPs be well dispersed in the polymer matrix and have good interactions with it. So, in this investigation, ultrasonic irradiation and surface modification techniques were applied to help the dispersion stability of NPs in the polymer matrix and improve their interactions with the polymer matrix. Embedding modified ZrO2 NPs in the polymer matrix created some interactions such as hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups or PVA on the surface of NPs and the functional groups of PAI (Fig. 5 ). Finally, PZ–PNCs containing 4, 8 and 12wt% of modified ZrO2 NPs, with improved thermal and morphological properties were successfully synthesized using the ultrasonic irradiation. The FT-IR spectra of NCs with different amounts of modified ZrO2 NPs (4, 8, 12wt%) are shown in Fig. 2b–d. There were absorption bands in the 400–600cm−1 region in the spectra of the NCs that were related to ZrO2 NPs. Also, the spectra of NCs clearly exhibited the characteristic peaks related to PAI and the modified ZrO2."
11,XRD analysis,"3.4 XRD analysis The crystallinity of the pure ZrO2 NPs, the neat PVA, the modified ZrO2, PAI and PZ–PNCs was probed by XRD measurements. The XRD pattern of the neat PVA (Fig. 6b) illustrated a semicrystalline structure arising from the high hydrogen bond of the hydroxyl groups. In this pattern, two characteristic peaks were found for PVA: a highly intense peak seemed to be at about 2θ =20° and the other one with less intensity was at about 2θ =41°. The XRD pattern of modified ZrO2 (Fig. 6c) showed two main peaks of the monoclinic structure that were related to crystals planes (−111) and (111), thereby confirming the monoclinic structure of the modified ZrO2 NPs (Fig. 6). The XRD patterns of PAI, PZ–PNCs 4 and 8wt% are shown in Fig. 7 . The XRD pattern of PAI (Fig. 7b) did not show any sharp diffraction peak. By the comparison of the XRD pattern of PZ–PNCs (Fig. 7c and d) with the modified ZrO2, it was found that the morphology of ZrO2 NPs had not been distorted within the process. Furthermore, according to Fig. 7, with increasing the amount of the modified ZrO2 in the PAI matrix, the peaks intensities of modified ZrO2 were increased."
12,Microscopy characterization,"3.5 Microscopy characterization To investigate the shape, size and dispersion of NPs in the PAI matrix, FE-SEM and TEM micrographs and histograms of the synthesized materials were applied. The FE-SEM images of the modified ZrO2 NPs are shown in Fig. 8 . These images illustrated that the modified ZrO2 NPs were spherical in shape and had a uniform distribution. As can be seen, the mean size of modified NPs was estimated to be about 31nm. Fig. 9 shows the FE-SEM images of PZ–PNCs with different amounts of modified ZrO2 NPs (4, 8 and 12wt%) and the neat PAI. The images of PZ–PNCs (Fig. 9a–f) indicated that the coupling of PVA on the surface of NPs caused the modified ZrO2 NPs to be rather uniformly dispersed and embedded in the PAI and the agglomerations between them were reduced. The mean size of the modified NPs in the PZ–PNC 4wt% was about 15nm, while in the PZ–PNC 8wt%, it was about 23.86nm and in the PZ–PNC, 12wt% was calculated to be about 25nm. The photographs of the neat PAI (Fig. 9g and h) exhibited that the obtained PAI had a nanostructure morphology. TEM was utilized to prove the surface modification of NPs and the hybrid structure of PZ–PNCs. As shown in Fig. 10a and b, the modified NPs were core–shell in shape. In fact, ZrO2 NPs were covered by a nanometer-thick layer of PVA that was about 10nm, obviously confirming the coating of PVA on the surface of ZrO2 NPs. TEM images of polymer NC 4wt% (Fig. 10c and d) revealed that the modified NPs were approximately homogeneously dispersed in the PAI without any significant agglomeration."
13,Thermal degradation properties,"3.6 Thermal degradation properties Evaluation of the thermal properties of the modified ZrO2 NPs, PAI and PZ–PNCs was carried out by means of TGA under argon atmosphere, from ambient temperature to 800°C. TGA curve of the modified ZrO2 (Fig. 11 ) showed that the thermal degradation of modified ZrO2 passed through three weight loss stages. The initial weight loss, which took place below 200°C, was attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water. The second weight loss in the region of 200–450°C corresponded to the organization of a ‘polyacetylene-like’ structure from the polymer dehydration or elimination reactions of H2O. Finally, the last stage at 400–550°C could be linked to the degradation of the main chain of PVA; the carbon and hydrocarbons were yielded from further decomposition of polyene residues [36]. The results of TGA for the modified ZrO2 NPs showed 90% residue at 800°C. TGA curves of the synthesized polymer, PZ–PNCs 4, 8 and 12wt% are shown in Fig. 12 . The obtained TGA data, as summarized in Table 1 , contained T 5 and T 10 char yield at 800°C (CR) and the limiting oxygen index (LOI) based on Van Krevelen and Hoftyzer equation. TGA curves of the pure PAI and PZ–PNCs clearly exhibited that degradation of PZ–PNCs occurred around 300–450°C. In fact, they showed good thermal stability below 300°C. As can be seen in Table 1, the CRs of the PZ–PNCs 4, 8 and 12wt% were 46, 62 and 48, respectively, while CR for PAI was about 44.8. So it became clear that the CRs of the prepared PZ–PNCs were higher than the CR of the pure PAI, implying more thermal stability of the prepared PZ–PNCs in comparison with the pure PAI. This phenomenon is due to the good dispersion of ZrO2 NPs in the PAI and the organic solvent which could be obtained through the surface modification of ZrO2 NPs by PVA. According to the TGA data, by increasing the amount of the modified ZrO2 NPs in the PAI matrix, the CR of PZ–PNCs was increased, but the CR of PZ–PNC 8wt% was more than that for PZ–PNC 12wt%. According to these results, by increasing the amount of modified ZrO2 NPs up to a certain weight percent (8wt%), the CR of the PZ–PNCs was increased. So, in this study, PZ–PNC 8wt% was identified as the optimum weight percent. The flame-retardancy property of materials, which is the amount of oxygen required for combustion, is shown by LOI. Usually, materials with some LOI value higher than 26 show the self-extinguishing behavior. Van Krevelen and Hoftyzer equation [37] was applied to calculate LOI for PAI and PZ–PNCs. LOI = 17.5 + 0.4 CR where CR = char yield So, according to the obtained results in Table 1, the synthesized PAI and the achieved PZ–PNCs were considered as the self-extinguishing materials."
14,Conclusions,"In the present investigation, the surface of ZrO2 NPs was modified with the biodegradable and chemically stable PVA to prevent the agglomeration of ZrO2 NPs in the polymer matrix. The coupling of the PVA on the surface of ZrO2 NPs was confirmed by the FT-IR analysis. The XRD analysis implied that the crystalline structure of ZrO2 NPs was not changed after the modification. An optically active PAI was prepared by a green and simple efficient technique in the presence of TBAB/TPP as the green medium and the condensing agent. The modified ZrO2 NPs were embedded into the matrix of the synthesized PAI using the ultrasonic-assisted method as a quick, green and fast method. According to the TGA data, the obtained PZ–PNCs had a thermal stability superior to that of the pristine PAI. So, it was concluded that surface modification led to the better dispersion of NPs in the polymer matrix and improved some properties of the polymer such as thermal stability. Last but not the least, it is important to note that PVA and PAI used here were biocompatible and biodegradable, so the surface coating could be safe and the obtained NCs were expected to be environmentally benign and used for high technology in a safe manner."
