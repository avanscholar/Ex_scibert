0,Introduction,"The potential of lignocellulosic biomass conversion for the production of valuable chemicals and fuels has been acknowledged for decades. Lignocellulosic biomass offers a sustainable platform for chemical production from renewable feedstocks, one of those being furfural. Furfural has been recognized as a potential building block for production of multiple value-added chemicals and fuels. This chemical can be produced from hemicellulose, a part of lignocellulosic biomass [1–4]. A variety of reaction routes exist to convert furfural to many valuable products. One potential reaction route is hydrotreatment of furfural. Potential products through furfural hydrotreatment include furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and 2-methylfuran. These components have applications as solvents, resin materials, and specialty chemicals in medical industry, and even as biofuels [4,5]. Furfural hydrotreatment has a complex reaction scheme, and reaction conditions as well as catalysts applied in the reaction must be optimized to achieve the desired reaction route. Furfural hydrotreatment can be performed in gas or liquid phase, both having favorable properties. High yields of products have been achieved in gas phase reactions, but liquid phase reaction offers easier merging to upstream production of furfural [6,7]. The knowledge of reaction mechanisms and kinetics give valuable information about the desired reactions. The knowledge of kinetics is especially important to enable the scale -up of processes. For the kinetics, one of the important parameters is the hydrogen solubility in the reaction medium and furfural. Especially in the liquid phase processes, the amount of hydrogen dissolved can be a factor restricting the reactions from occurring. In addition, furfural hydrogenation experiments in the liquid phase can suffer from material balance uncertainties, which accurate phase equilibria models can substantially improve [5,8,9]. Furfural hydrotreatment reactions are usually studied in a solvent and one of the most applied solvents in the hydrotreatment studies is 2-propanol [10,11]. Hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol has been studied earlier for example by Lühring et al. [12] at 293.2K and Krüger et al. [13] at 298.15K. Hydrogen solubility in furfural has remained unstudied in the past. To attain important information for pure furfural and 2-propanol for kinetic studies, the measured hydrogen solubility data should be described with a model. With alcohols, including 2-propanol, many different predictive and equations of state models have been applied in earlier studies e.g. Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) [14] and Peng-Robinson (PR) [15–18]. The same models applied for 2-propanol might not be suitable for furfural due to molecular differences and characteristics. Thus, in this study the obtained hydrogen solubility data are tested with three equation of state models: SRK, PR, and Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) [19]. SRK and PR are cubic equations of state and are mostly recommended for gas-processing, refinery, and petrochemical applications [14,15]. SRK and PR in their traditional forms are suitable for nonpolar or mildly polar mixtures, thus the suitability for intermediately polar furfural is unclear. PC-SAFT is an equation of state model that uses second-order perturbation theory of Barker and Henderson [20,21] together with statistical associating fluid theory by Chapman et al. [22]. PC-SAFT is applicable for fluid systems of small and/or large molecules and the temperature and pressure range for this model is wide [19,23]. Oxygenated compounds or polar systems might cause problems to some predictive models, but PC-SAFT has been reported to function well in these cases [24–26]. PC-SAFT has been employed to model phase equilibrium and hydrogen solubility in a variety of liquids with excellent predictive capability [19,23–29]. This study reports new hydrogen solubility data in furfural and 2-propanol at temperatures of 323, 399, and 476K in the pressure range of 0.3–12.5MPa. Furthermore, a comparison of SRK, PR, and PC-SAFT models for predicting the hydrogen solubility in furfural and 2-propanol is conducted. This new data will provide important information for modeling furfural hydrotreatment reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The components and their purities are presented in Table 1 . Due to the low stability of furfural, it was purified with vacuum distillation procedure at 55mbar and bottom boiler temperature of 355K. Furfural was distilled into three fractions: light, middle, and the heavy distillate fractions. Light and heavy distillates were discarded and middle distillate was used in the phase equilibrium study. The amount of light distillate discarded was approximately 20% of the total amount distilled. The color of furfural before the distillation was light brown due to known resinification and oxidation reactions, but after the distillation the chemical was nearly colorless with some hint of yellow color. The purity of the distilled furfural was analyzed with gas chromatography. 2-Propanol and hydrogen were used without any purification."
3,Apparatus,2.2 Apparatus A continuous flow apparatus was applied to measure the solubility of hydrogen in furfural and 2-propanol. This apparatus has been described in detail by Saajanlehto et al. [30]. The temperature in the experiments was measured with a type K thermocouple and the standard uncertainty of the temperature measurements was ±0.2K according to a calibration. The thermocouple calibration was performed with a Pt-100 temperature probe and a Tempcontrol F200 thermometer. The pressure was measured with a pressure transducer (Trafag NAH 8253) and the standard uncertainty of the pressure measurements was ±0.02MPa according to a calibration. Calibration was performed with Beamex MC2-PE calibrator equipped with an external pressure module (EXT60). Both the thermometer and the pressure calibrator were calibrated by the Finnish National Standards Laboratory (MIKES).
4,Measurement procedure,"2.3 Measurement procedure The hydrogen solubility in pure furfural and 2-propanol were collected by employing the continuous flow apparatus. The measurements were made at the temperatures of 323, 399, and 476K in the pressure range of 0.3–12.5MPa. The highest temperature (476K) is a usual furfural hydrogenation temperature and thus chosen for the analysis. The lowest temperature (323K) is in a range, where the furfural reactions are assumed basically non-existent. The middle temperature (399K) was chosen in the middle of the temperature range to obtain information of the temperature behavior and amount of hydrogenated products as a function of temperature. Before the experiments, furfural or 2-propanol was weighed and degassing was performed for the component under vacuum in an ice bath for one hour to remove dissolved gases from the sample. Hydrogen+liquid with predetermined molar fraction of hydrogen was prepared within the continuous flow apparatus by injecting hydrogen gas into the liquid stream of furfural or 2-propanol. The limit of hydrogen solubility was determined by varying the gas flow of hydrogen and identifying the amount of phases (gas-liquid or liquid) within the view cell of the apparatus by visual observation. Fig. 1 a presents the two-phase region with a hydrogen bubble in a hydrogen solubility experiment with the continuous flow apparatus. Fig.1b presents the liquid phase. Thermal reactions of furfural were suppressed with the short residence time of the hydrogen+liquid mixture in the equilibrium cell. The residence time used in the measurements varied between 2.2 and 11.8min depending on the liquid flow rate. Sufficiency of residence time and settling of phase equilibrium was confirmed by repeating some of the measurements with varying fluid and gas flow rates. To confirm that no thermal reactions of relatively unstable furfural had occurred during the measurement, liquid samples were taken before and after the measurement and the samples were analyzed with gas chromatography. The quantitative analysis was performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Agilent 6890) and a Zebron ZB-wax Plus column (60m×0.25mm×0.25µm). The temperature ramp with GC was from 313.15K to 373.15K with the heating rate of 5Kmin−1 and from 313.15K to 503.15K with the heating rate of 20Kmin−1. Injection volume and temperature were 1µl and 503.15K, respectively. 2-butanol was used as an internal standard. The qualitative analysis of liquid phase components was performed with a GC–MS (Agilent 7890-5975) by applying a similar column and method. The mass spectra was recorded in electron impact ionization at 70eV."
5,Density and vapor pressure calculations,"2.4 Density and vapor pressure calculations For calculating the density and vapor pressure of pure liquid components, DIPPR correlations were applied [31]. The correlation equations and the parameters are presented in the Supplementary information (Eqs. S1 and S2, Table S1). The calculated uncertainty for furfural density from DIPPR datasets at low temperatures is less than 0.4% and for 2-propanol less than 0.07%. The values were calculated as standard uncertainties from reported values. The calculated standard uncertainty for pure component vapor pressure from DIPPR datasets for furfural is 3% and for 2-propanol <1.5%. The calculated vapor pressures are presented later together with the hydrogen solubility data."
6,Hydrogen solubility,"2.5 Hydrogen solubility Mole fraction of hydrogen in the total flow was calculated with Eq. (1) applying liquid and gas flow rates. (1) x H 2 = H 2 , FLOW V m L FLOW ρ L + H 2 , FLOW V m where x H2 is the mole fraction of hydrogen in the total flow, H2,FLOW is the hydrogen flow measured with a mass flow controller (cm3 min−1), Vm is the ideal gas molar volume (22 414cm3 mol−1), LFLOW is the volumetric liquid flow (cm3 min−1), and ρL is the liquid density (molcm−3). The average of hydrogen mole fraction of the first observed point in the gas-liquid region and last observed point in the liquid phase region was calculated to determine the hydrogen solubility into furfural or 2-propanol (Eq. (2)). The uncertainty components taken into account in the uncertainty estimate in Eq. (3) are presented in Table 2 . (2) x H 2 = x H 2 , L + x H 2 , GL 2 where x H2 is the solubility of hydrogen, x H2,L is the hydrogen mole fraction in the last point in the liquid region and x H2,GL is the hydrogen mole fraction in the first observed point in the gas-liquid region. (3) u ( x H 2 ) = L FLOW ρ L V m H 2 , FLOW V m + L FLOW ρ L 2 Δ H 2 , FLOW + - H 2 , FLOW ρ L V m H 2 . FLOW V m + L FLOW ρ L 2 Δ L FLOW + - H 2 , FLOW L FLOW V m H 2 . FLOW V m + L FLOW ρ L 2 Δ ρ L + x H 2 , L + x H 2 , GL 2 where u(xH2 ) is the uncertainty of the hydrogen mole fraction, ΔH2,FLOW is the uncertainty of the hydrogen flow rate, ΔLFLOW is the uncertainty of the liquid flow rate, ΔρL is the uncertainty of the liquid density. The last term on the right in Eq. (3) is resulting from the method determining the bubble point composition by taking the difference of composition from the last point in the liquid region and the first observed point in the gas-liquid region."
7,Results and discussion,"To investigate the hydrogen solubility in furfural and 2-propanol, data were collected at 323, 399, and 476K in the pressure range of 0.3–12.5MPa. Table 3 presents the experimental data points of hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol and Table 4 presents the hydrogen solubility in furfural. The repeatability of the experimental data points was evaluated by the repetitive measurements of two of the data points by varying the fluid and gas flow rates. The repeatability was excellent as can be seen from Table 3. Also, the well known trend in hydrogen solubility was observed, as the solubility increased as a function of increasing pressure and temperature. This trend is observed in several previous studies [17,32–35]. The experimental data were compared to the prediction with SRK, PR, and PC-SAFT models with Aspen Plus software [36]. Table 5 presents the pure component data applied for modeling. With PC-SAFT three parameters are required for all components: segment number (m), segment diameter (σ), and segment energy (ε/k). For furfural, pure component PC-SAFT parameters were regressed in Aspen applying vapor pressure and density data provided by NIST database [31]. Parameters for 2-propanol and hydrogen were obtained as such from Aspen software [36]. The modeling was performed first by applying binary interaction parameter value of zero and then by applying a temperature independent binary interaction parameter value from the regression. The binary interaction parameter values (kij ), average absolute deviation (AAD), and relative average deviation (RAD) with all the tested models are presented in Table 6 . AAD and RAD equations applied for calculations are presented in Eqs. (4) and (5). (4) AAD = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N | P i , measured - P i , calculated | (5) RAD = 100 N ∑ i = 1 N | P i , measured - P i , calculated | P i , measured where N presents the number of observations and Pi presents the pressure (MPa). In the comparison of SRK, PR, and PC-SAFT models in predicting hydrogen solubility in furfural and 2-propanol with binary interaction parameter zero, SRK model predicted the measured data the most accurately. However, the AAD and RAD values are relatively high, even SRK has RAD of 11.5% for H2 +furfural and 12.2% for H2 +2-propanol. On the other hand, as the binary interaction parameters were regressed, the PC-SAFT model predicted the measured data the most accurately with the lowest AAD and RAD values (Table 6). Further investigation of PC-SAFT data prediction indicated that the binary interaction parameters for H2 +furfural and H2 +2-propanol are temperature dependent. Due to this, binary interaction parameters were regressed individually for each temperature. Table 7 presents the applied binary interaction parameters for PC-SAFT at each temperature. The measured data for hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol, calculated vapor pressures of 2-propanol, as well as modeling with PC-SAFT with temperature dependent binary interaction parameters are presented in Fig. 2 . The experimental data points for hydrogen solubility in furfural, calculated vapor pressures of furfural, and the modeling with PC-SAFT are presented in Fig. 3 . PC-SAFT with temperature dependent interaction parameter for H2 +2-propanol predicted hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol well at the lower temperatures with an absolute average deviation of 0.21MPa at 323.4K and 0.32MPa at 399.1K. However, at 476.0K the prediction accuracy decreased to AAD of 0.79MPa. PC-SAFT with temperature dependent binary interaction parameter for H2 +furfural predicted hydrogen solubility well at the temperatures of 323.1, 399.2, and 476.1K. The absolute average deviation at these temperatures were 0.24, 0.33, and 0.31MPa, respectively. Furthermore, calculated vapor pressures of furfural and 2-propanol in various temperatures were observed to be well predicted with PC-SAFT. Hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol was measured by Lühring et al. [12] at 293.2K and Krüger et al. [13] at 298.15K at atmospheric pressure. Due to the higher measurement temperatures and pressures in this work, the hydrogen solubility data in the references is not directly comparable. In the study by Lühring et al. [12] hydrogen solubilities are presented as Henry‘s constants. This constant was applied to calculate hydrogen solubilities at the higher pressures. For data presented in the study by Krüger et al. [13], an assumption was made that the solubilities follow Henry‘s law. The results obtained in this study were plotted together with the literature data at two isobaric conditions (12.47 and 6.97MPa) as a function of temperature. The comparisons are presented in Fig. 4 . A clear trend is visible for hydrogen solubility in 2-propanol as a function of temperature, and the hydrogen solubility measurement data presented in this study is well in line with the literature data. The purity of relatively unstable furfural was analyzed after hydrogen solubility experiments. GC results indicated that only small amount of reactions of furfural occurred at 323 or 399K. However, at the reaction temperature of 476K more hydrogenation reactions were observed. GC–MS analysis indicated that the products formed at 476K were mainly furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran. Approximately 4.6% of furfural was analyzed to have converted into products during the measurement at 476K. The GC chromatograms of pure furfural and furfural after 399K and 476K experiments are presented in the Supporting information (Figs. S1–S3). The 2-propanol impurity presented in the Figs. S2 and S3 originates from the stabilization pump, as this component was applied to wash the equipment before the experiments. 2-butanol was used as an internal standard and is thus present in the GC graphs. The reactivity of furfural at 476K might have influenced the results slightly, which might also be an explanation for the smaller binary interaction parameter kij for furfural+H2 mixture in Table 7. However, the reactivity of furfural was considered negligible concerning the measurements and its effects on the modeling at 323 and 399K."
8,Conclusions,"This study investigated the formerly unstudied hydrogen solubility in furfural as well as hydrogen solubility in a commonly applied solvent, 2-propanol. The measurements performed for this study were conducted at the temperature range of 323–476K and pressure range of 0.3–12.5MPa. The measurements were compared to predictions by SRK, PR, and PC-SAFT models. From these, PC-SAFT model predicted hydrogen solubility data most accurately after binary interaction parameter regression. Without binary interaction parameter regression the PC-SAFT and other equation of state models lacked predictive capability. Thus, it can be concluded that the experimental data together with binary interaction parameter regression is very important to obtain predictive behavior with PC-SAFT or any other EoS for these components. Insignificant thermal reactions of furfural occurred at temperatures below 399K, but at 476K furfural hydrogenation products (furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran) were detected. The amount of reacted furfural remained under 5% during the experiments even at the highest temperature. The data presented in this paper provides important information for modeling hydrotreatment reactions of furfural for the production of chemicals and biofuels."
