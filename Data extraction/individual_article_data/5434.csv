0,Introduction,"The recent discoveries of the world's largest deepwater field in Brazil brought new challenges. The associated gas from pre-salt fields contains a significant amount of carbon dioxide that has to be removed before its use. This associated gas cannot be vented or burned due to the stringent environmental regulations. Furthermore, the costs associated with the separation of CO2 from natural gas stream are high. CO2 reforming of methane, the so called dry reforming of methane (DRM), is an interesting alternative to the use of associated gas through its conversion to synthesis gas and subsequent production of liquid fuels. During the last few years, the DRM has been intensively investigated for the production of synthesis gas [1]. One of the primary limitations of the dry reforming technology is the catalyst deactivation that occurs due to carbon deposition during the high temperature process [2,3]. Therefore, the development of a catalyst resistant to carbon deposition during CO2 reforming of CH4 is one of the main issues of this technology. Recent research efforts have focused on developing catalysts that minimize the rate of methane decomposition and/or CO disproportion. Carbon deposition is strongly dependent on the type of metal and support used [4,5]. Ni-based catalysts have been extensively studied for the DRM due to its low cost and high activity [3]. However, this metal is prone to coking and then the nature of the support plays an important role on the stability of catalysts for DRM. The literature reports that the use of ceria-based materials improves catalyst stability due to their high reducibility and oxygen transfer properties [5]. The support participates in the dissociative adsorption of CO2 near the metal particles, transferring oxygen to the surface of the metallic particle containing carbon deposits. Therefore, the support promotes the mechanism of carbon removal from the metal. Ni/CeZrO2 catalysts have been tested for methane conversion reactions [6–8]. However, the studies about DRM over Ni/CeZrO2 catalysts are scarce. Furthermore, ceria–zirconia supports exhibit very low surface area, which provides poor metal dispersion. This favors the formation of carbon deposits and catalyst deactivation [9]. To improve metal dispersion, ceria–zirconia may be deposited over a high surface area oxide such as alumina [10–12]. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the performance of Ni/Ce x Zr1−x O2/Al2O3 (x =0.5; 0.75; 1.0) catalysts for the production of syngas through DRM. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and oxygen storage capacity (OSC). In order to evaluate the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface during the reaction, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy analyses were carried out."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Alumina supports were prepared by calcination of bohemite (Puralox—Sasol) at 1073K in air flow for 6h. The alumina supported ceria and ceria–zirconia samples were prepared by co-impregnation of the alumina with an aqueous solution of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and zirconyl nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors of cerium and of zirconium, respectively. The samples were dried at 383K for 12h and then calcined in air flow at 1073K for 5h. The Ce x Zr1−x O2/Al2O3 samples were prepared with 20wt% of ceria or ceria–zirconia oxides and x =0.5; 0.75; 1.0. This ceria or ceria–zirconia content was chosen in order to cover completely the alumina surface [13]. Then, the catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain 10wt% Ni. The samples were dried at 393K and calcined under air (50mL/min) at 673K for 3h. The following samples were synthesized: (i) Ni/Al2O3 (Ni/Al); (ii) Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 (Ni/Ce/Al); Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3 (Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al); Ni/Ce0.50Zr0.50O2/Al2O3 (Ni/Ce0.50Zr0.50O2/Al)."
3,X-ray fluorescence (XRF),2.2 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) The chemical composition of each sample was determined on a RIGAKU RIX 3100 X-ray spectrometer with a rhodium tube operated at 4kW. Calcined samples (0.5g) were analyzed as self-supported wafers. The measurement technique applied was based on a calibration curve obtained using standards.
4,BET surface area,2.3 BET surface area The BET surface areas of the samples were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer by nitrogen adsorption at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen.
5,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"2.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the calcined and reduced/passivated samples were obtained with Cu Kl=1,5406Å) using a RIGAKU diffractometer. Data were collected under two different conditions: (i) over the 2θ range of 10° to 90° using a scan rate of 0.02°/step and a scan time of 1s/step; (ii) 2θ from 27° to 32°, at a scan speed of 0.02°/step and counting times of 10s/step. The Scherrer equation was used to estimate the crystallite mean diameter of CeO2 and Ni0 particles. For the measurements of the crystallite mean diameter of metallic Ni particles, the line characteristic of Ni0 (200) at 2θ =51.8° was used. The calcined samples were also reduced under pure hydrogen (30mL/min) at 1023K for 1h, purged under N2 at the same temperature for 30min and cooled to 298K. Then, the reactor was maintained at 209K, using a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and liquid nitrogen. Then, the catalyst was passivated with a 5% O2/He mixture for 1h at 209K [14]."
6,CO2 infrared spectroscopy,"2.5 CO2 infrared spectroscopy The infrared spectra of adsorbed CO2 experiments were conducted using a Magna 560-Nicolet equipment. The wafers containing around 20mg of support were first preheated under high vacuum at 773K for 1h. After this, and still maintaining the sample at 773K, the sample was oxidized under air flow (30mL/min) and submitted to vacuum during 30min. Then, the sample was cooled to room temperature and a first spectrum was obtained. Following this pretreatment, 10Torr of CO2 was introduced into the chamber for 1h. The sample was submitted to high vacuum at room temperature for 1h and a CO2 adsorbed spectrum was recorded. According to the literature [15], the optical density of the band of CO2 adsorbed at 1235cm−1 can be used as a quantitative measurement of the surface of the alumina that is not covered by ceria or ceria–zirconia."
7,Oxygen storage capacity (OSC),"2.6 Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) Oxygen storage capacity measurements were carried out in a multipurpose unit connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers, Omnistar). The samples (160mg) were reduced under H2 at 1023K for 1h. Then, the samples were cooled to 723K under He and a 5% O2/He mixture was passed through the catalyst until the oxygen uptake was finished. The reactor was purged with He and the dead volume was obtained by switching the gas to the 5% O2/He mixture. Finally the amount of oxygen consumed on the catalysts was calculated taking into account a previous calibration of the mass spectrometer."
8,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),2.7 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) TPR measurements were carried out in a homemade apparatus. The catalyst was pretreated at 673K for 1h under air flow prior to the TPR experiment in order to remove traces of water. The reducing mixture (2% H2/N2) was passed through the sample (80mg) at a flow rate of 30mL/min and the temperature was increased to 1273K at a heating rate of 10K/min.
9,Reaction conditions,"2.8 Reaction conditions CO2 reforming of methane was performed in a quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. In order to avoid hot spot formation or temperature gradients, catalyst samples (25mg) were diluted with quartz (100mg). Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced under H2 at 1023K for 1h and then heated to 1073K under N2. The reaction was carried out at 1073K and a WHSV=522h−1 over all catalysts. A reactant mixture with CH4:CO2 ratio of 1 and a flow rate of 100mL/min was used. The exit gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen 1010 column (Supelco). The methane and CO2 conversion was determined as follows: (1) X methane = n methane feed – n methane exit n methane feed × 1 00 (2) X CO 2 = n CO 2 feed – n CO 2 exit n CO 2 feed × 1 00"
10,Thermogravimetric analysis (TG),2.9 Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) Thermogravimetric analysis of the used catalysts was carried out in a TA Instruments equipment (SDT Q600) in order to determine the amount of carbon formed over the catalyst. Approximately 10mg of spent catalyst was heated under air flow from room temperature to 1273K at a heating rate of 20K/min and the weight change was measured.
11,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),2.10 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM analyses of the spent catalysts were carried out using a FEI Inspect S scanning electron microscope equipped with a secondary electron analyzer. The microscope was also equipped with an EDAX analytic system energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
12,Raman spectroscopy,"2.11 Raman spectroscopy Raman was used to characterize the nature of carbon formed after reaction. The Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRam 800/Jobin-Yvon, equipped with thermal conductivity detector (cooled at 203K with liquid N2) and excitation source of 632nm."
13,Results and discussion,
14,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 lists the Ni, CeO2 and ZrO2 content of all samples. The Ni loading obtained by XRF analysis was close to the nominal value (10wt% Ni) for all samples studied. The values of BET surface areas obtained for the supports and catalysts are also shown in Table 1. The addition of ceria or ceria–zirconia did not change significantly the alumina surface area. When Ni was added the surface area of the support decreased."
15,XRD,"3.2 XRD The diffratograms of the supports are shown in Fig. 1a. All samples exhibited the lines corresponding to γ and θ-alumina phases (γ-alumina—PDF no. 10-0425; θ-alumina—PDF no. 11-0517). Besides the peaks related to γ- and θ-alumina phases, it is also noticed the lines characteristic of CeO2 with cubic structure (CeO2—PDF no. 34-0394) for CeO2/Al sample. However, these lines were shifted to higher 2θ positions for Ce0.75Zr0.,25O2/Al and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al samples. According to the literature [16–19], this shift is an indication of the formation of a solid solution between the cerium and zirconium oxides. In order to determine the composition of the ceria–zirconia solid solution obtained, data collection with a slow scanning speed was performed and the result is presented in Fig. 1b. The diffratograms showed that the peak at 2θ =29.4° is symmetrical for all samples, indicating the formation of a homogeneous solid solution with the expected composition. Based on the methodology proposed by Kozlov et al. [16], we estimated the real composition of our supported ceria–zirconia samples. All samples exhibited solid solutions with compositions close to the expected nominal one (Ce0.78Zr0.22O2/Al and Ce0.49Zr0.51O2/Al, respectively). Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts. The diffratograms of the catalysts were similar to those obtained for the supports, revealing the presence of γ- and θ-alumina phases and CeO2 cubic phase. The lines characteristic of NiO cubic phase at 2θ =43.3° and 62.8° were also observed. However, the presence of nickel aluminate phase could not be rule out due to the proximity to the lines typical to γ-Al2O3 [20]. The diffratograms of the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . It is noticed the presence of the lines characteristic of γ and θ-alumina, ceria and ceria–zirconia solid solution phases. After reduction, the lines assigned with NiO phase were no longer detected. It is observed the appearance of the lines corresponding to metallic Ni phase at 2θ =44.5° and 51.8°. The crystallite sizes of CeO2 and Ni°, calculated using the Scherrer equation, were listed in Table 2 . For this calculation, the CeO2 (111) and Ni° (200) reflections were used. The most intense line typical of Ni° (111) at 2θ =44.5° was not used because it was not clearly distinguished due to the overlapping with the line characteristic of alumina. It was noticed that the CeO2 crystallite sizes of ceria–zirconia containing samples is smaller than the one obtained for ceria based catalyst. This result is in agreement with previous studies in the literature for ceria and ceria–zirconia based catalysts using bulk and supported oxides [17]. The addition of ZrO2 to CeO2 increases the thermal stability of the oxide, avoiding the sintering process during calcination. The Ni crystallite size was approximately the same for all samples (4.7–6.6nm)."
16,CO2 infrared spectroscopy,"3.3 CO2 infrared spectroscopy The values of the optical density of the band at 1235cm−1 and the degree of coverage of the alumina surface calculated through CO2 infrared spectra is presented in Table 3 . The addition of ceria and ceria–zirconia oxides decreased the optical density. Furthermore, the degree of coverage of the alumina surface significantly increased in the presence of zirconia. Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al exhibited the highest degree of coverage of the alumina surface. The same result was obtained by Silva et al. [11]. They proposed that zirconia spreads over alumina more efficiently than ceria, which could explain the higher degree of coverage of the alumina."
17,OSC,"3.4 OSC Table 4 displays the oxygen uptakes measured for all catalysts. The oxygen consumption due to Ni oxidation was discounted from these values. The incorporation of ZrO2 into CeO2 lattice increased the oxygen consumption. According to the literature [21], the oxygen storage capacity of cerium oxide is associated with the ability of cerium to act as an oxygen buffer by storing/releasing O2 due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. The presence of ZrO2 strongly increases the oxygen vacancies of the support, increasing its reducibility. The enhancement of oxygen vacancies is due to the high oxygen mobility in the solid solution formed, which was identified by XRD data."
18,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"3.5 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The reduction profiles of the supports are shown in Fig. 4a. No peaks are observed in the reduction profile of alumina that is a irreducible support (curve (a)). The reduction profile of the CeO2/Al sample (curve (b)) exhibited a continuous H2 uptake up to 1100K, which is attributed to the reduction of superficial ceria. The peak at 1215K corresponds to the reduction of bulk CeO2 to Ce2O3 [22]. Supported ceria–zirconia samples showed three peaks at 755, 825, 1200K (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al—curve (c)) and 750, 910, 1270K (Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al—curve (d)). Comparing these reduction profiles with the one of the CeO2/Al sample, it is noticed an increase in the hydrogen consumption at low temperature region and a decrease in the hydrogen uptake at high temperature region. According to the literature [13], the addition of zirconium to the lattice of ceria favors its reduction, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. The largest mobility of oxygen increases the reducibility of the cerium–zirconium mixed oxide. This result is in agreement with our OSC measurements. Fig. 4b displays the TPR profile of catalysts, along with the reduction profile of bulk NiO for comparison. The reduction profile of Ni/Al catalyst showed three peaks at 715, 890 and 1090K. The first two peaks were attributed to the reduction of bulk nickel oxide whereas the peak at 1029K corresponds to the reduction of NiAl2O4, highly dispersed. For Ni/CeO2/Al catalyst, the peaks at 700 and 850K were attributed to the reduction of NiO and to the reduction of superficial ceria promoted by the metal formed. The peak at 1218K is due to the reduction of bulk ceria. The TPR profiles of Ni/CexZr1-xO2/Al catalysts exhibited two peaks at 745 and 865K (Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al) and 710 and 850K (Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al). These peaks are due to the reduction of NiO as well as the reduction of CeZrO2 promoted by the metal. It is also observed a decrease in the hydrogen consumption at high temperature region (>1000K) that is characteristic to the reduction of bulk ceria. This result is attributed to the formation of the ceria–zirconia solid solution, which is reduced at lower temperatures [13]."
19,CO2 reforming of methane,"3.6 CO2 reforming of methane The methane and CO2 conversions as a function of time on stream (TOS) obtained for the CO2 reforming of CH4 over Ni/Ce x Zr1−x O2/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . Ni/Al and Ni/Ce/Al catalysts exhibited lower initial methane conversion that increased continuously and leveled off after 300min of TOS. For Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al and Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al catalysts, the methane conversion remained constant at around 70% during 24h of TOS (Fig. 5a). The CO2 conversion (Fig. 5b) also increased with TOS for Ni/Al and Ni/Ce/Al catalysts and remained constant for Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al and Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al catalysts. The H2/CO ratio values were approximately the same for all catalysts: 0.86 (Ni/Al); 0.75 (Ni/Ce/Al); 0.83 (Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al); 0.85 (Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al). The values of H2/CO ratio lower than 1.0 is likely due to the reverse of the water-gas shift reaction. The induction period on the dry reforming of methane has been observed for Ni-based catalysts [23]. Takanabe et al. [23] studied the performance of Ni and Co supported on TiO2 for the dry reforming of methane at 1023K. Based on XRD and XPS results, they proposed that catalysts lost activity at the beginning of the reaction due to the oxidation of metallic Ni particles by the CO2 of the feed. Then, the NiO particles formed were reduced again to metallic Ni particles by the syngas produced during the dry reforming reaction. The formation of metallic NI particles, that are the active sites for the dry reforming of methane, led to an increase in the methane conversion. In our work, XRD experiment after exposition of Ni/Al catalyst to CO2 stream was carried out in order to investigate the evolution of the phases present in the catalyst. Fig. 6 showed the XRD patterns of Ni/Al after exposition to different atmospheres: calcination, reduction and exposition of CO2. The calcined sample exhibited the lines characteristic of NiO that disappeared after reduction. After exposition of the sample to CO2, the line characteristic of Ni0 was no longer observed. On the hand, it is noticed the appearance of the line related to NiO phase. This result indicates that metallic Ni particles were partially oxidized at the beginning of the reaction for Ni/Al and Ni/Ce/Al catalysts. However, the induction period was not observed for Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al and Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al catalysts. This is likely due to the preferential oxidation of CeZrO2 mixed oxide that inhibited the oxidation of metallic Ni particles by the CO2 of the feed. One of the main drawbacks of the dry reforming of methane is catalyst deactivation mainly due to carbon deposition. In order to investigate the formation of carbon during the reaction, the post-reaction catalysts were characterized by SEM and Raman. Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of all catalysts after CO2 reforming of methane. It is noted the presence of carbon filaments over all catalysts. The mechanisms of carbon formation and the growth of filaments for steam and CO2 reforming of methane over supported Ni catalysts consist of methane dissociation on the Ni surface, producing highly reactive carbon species [9]. This carbon can undergo a number of processes, including (i) reaction with water; (ii) encapsulation of the Ni particle surface; or (iii) dissolution into the Ni crystallite followed by the nucleation and growth of carbon filaments (e.g., whiskers). In this last case, the catalyst remains active during the reaction. This is because the top of the Ni surface still remains exposed to the reactants and gas-phase intermediates. Our results were in agreement with the formation of these carbon filaments. Furthermore, it is possible to detect the presence of some regions without carbon filaments on the Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al catalyst. The Raman spectra of the used catalysts were presented in Fig. 8 . It is noticed the presence of three bands in the range between 1200 to 1700cm−1, which are associated with carbon formation. The band at around 1580cm−1, the so-called G-mode, is a measure of the presence of ordered carbon [24]. The presence of more disordered structures leads to the appearance of bands at 1357cm−1 (D-band), 1620cm−1 (D-mode) and 2450cm−1 (2D-mode) [25]. The D-band at around 1356cm−1 has been related to defects or the presence of nanoparticles and amorphous carbon [24]. Furthermore, the intensity of these bands is higher for Ni/Al and decreases when ceria and ceria–zirconia were added to the support. These results indicate a lower carbon formation over the ceria–zirconia supported catalysts. In order to understand this result, it is fundamental to shed light on the reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism for the dry reforming reaction has been extensively studied over a variety of catalysts comprised of different metal and support species [1,3,26–31]. Depending on the metal, support, and reaction temperature employed, various mechanisms were proposed. Bitter and co-workers [32] first reported that ZrO2 is a support that plays an important role on the reaction mechanism. Studies performed on Pt/ZrO2 catalysts have provided evidence for a dual path mechanism [5,33–35]. O’Connor and co-workers [35] have used DRIFTS to study the mechanism of CO2 reforming of CH4 over Pt/ZrO2. They proposed the CH4 dissociation occurs on the Pt surface and the resultant carbon species react with lattice oxygen species from the ZrO2. Then, the CO2 replenishes the lattice oxygen of the support. More recently, we have reported that the use of promoters such as cerium oxide improves the activity and stability of Pt/ZrO2 catalysts under severely deactivating reaction conditions [5]. These results were interpreted by the mechanism for CO2 reforming of methane over Pt/ZrO2, Pt/CeO2 and Pt/CeZrO2 catalysts involving a two independent paths [4,5,36]. The first path involves the decomposition of CH4 on the metal particle, resulting in the formation of H2 and carbon. The second path is the reaction of this carbon with oxygen to produce CO. This oxygen is formed during the dissociative adsorption of CO2 and reoxidation of the support. Therefore, in this dual path mechanism, the role of the support is very important. It participates in the dissociative adsorption of CO2 near the metal particles, transferring oxygen to the coked metal and greatly accelerating the removal of carbon from the metal. In our work, the lower carbon formation over Ni/Ce x Zr1−x O2/Al2O3 (x =0.75 and 0.5) catalysts could be attributed to their higher oxygen storage capacity. The higher oxygen mobility of the ceria–zirconia solid solution formed favors the mechanism of carbon removal, improving catalyst stability."
20,Conclusions,"The addition of zirconia to ceria improved the OSC due to the formation of a ceria–zirconia solid solution. Carbon deposition occurred over all catalysts. However, covering alumina with ceria–zirconia mixed oxide significantly decreased the amount of carbon deposited. This result is attributed to the larger degree of coverage of alumina by CeZrO2 oxide and the higher oxygen mobility of the ceria–zirconia solid solution formed. The higher reducibility and oxygen storage/release capacity of Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3 and Ni/Ce0.50Zr0.50O2/Al2O3 catalysts improves the effectiveness of the carbon cleaning mechanism."
