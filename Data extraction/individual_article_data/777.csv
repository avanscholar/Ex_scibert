0,Introduction,"Alcohols from biogenic resources are discussed as suitable biofuels for aviation and transportation applications. Biomass-derived furans might be an attractive biogenic resource for sustainable alcohol production. In a previous study (Sherbi et al., 2021), we reported an efficient bifunctional catalyst system (Pt/K3PW12O40), platinum supported on potassium phosphotungstate, for selective ring opening of various bio-derived furans like 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), methylfuran (MF) and furan showing high selectivities towards alcohol formation. In detail, we performed 2-hexanol (HXL) formation from DMF at 80 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure using n-decane as a carrier liquid. Hereby, DMF represents a model compound for ring opening hydrogenolysis of furans. Generally, the main products observed for DMF hydrogenation are 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) via a two-step ring-saturation hydrogenation of DMF with 2,5-dimethyldihydrofuran (DMDHF) as an intermediate, 2,5- hexanedione (HD) via oxidative ring opening to 3-ene-2,5 hexanedione followed by hydrogenation to HD, 2-hexanone (HXN) via ring opening using two moles of hydrogen or the desired HXL via ring opening using three moles of hydrogen. HXL can be produced as a primary product directly from ring opening of DMF or as secondary product through hydrogenation of HXN. Moreover, HXL can undergo consecutive dehydration to 1-hexene which, in turn, can be hydrogenated to n-hexane (HX). A detailed explanation of the reaction network of DMF hydrogenation can be found in a previous study (Sherbi et al., 2021). DMF hydrogenation in the liquid phase using mild reaction conditions has been investigated in terms of maximizing the yield of HXN (Louie et al., 2017) and DMTHF (Gilkey et al., 2016) before, but never for maximizing the yield of HXL as far as we know. The desired HXL is of major interest because it is discussed as a renewable C6 platform molecule for full-performance jet and diesel fuels. HXL can be mixed with other alcohols produced from biomass and used directly in a compression ignition engine (Kumar and Saravanan, 2016; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, it can be used as a co-feed with other C2–C11 alcohols for the production of jet and other heavy fuels (Greene et al., 2018). Cu–Mg–Al mixed oxides as catalyst where applied for gas-phase synthesis of high molecular weight compounds based on HXL, that can be used as liquid transportation fuels. The product pool was a mixture of ketones, alcohols and hydrocarbons with 160–200 g/mol average molecular weight, and up to 87% of the yield were obtained for compounds in the C9–C24 range. Around 70% of the products were C9–C15 compounds suitable for jet fuel applications and the rest as diesel substitutes (Luggren et al., 2016). HXL is also important for liquid phase C-C self-coupling that produces higher dimers with a yield of 79% and trimers with a yield of 11% at complete conversion (Shimura et al., 2013). Those C12–C18 alkanes or alkenes that can be synthesized from HXL either by C-C self-coupling and hydrodeoxygenation, or dehydration and oligomerization can be connected to the production of diesel fuels (Liu et al., 2015; West et al., 2009). Furthermore, HXL can react with levulinic acid to produce around 82% yield of hexyl levulinate at full conversion. This long-chain levulinate ester is considered as a valuable synthetic fuel (or fuel additive) which has a theoretical calorific value of 6558.5 kJ mol−1 and lower heating value (LHV) of 29.4 MJ L−1 which is very close to that of commercial gasoline (30–33 MJ L−1) (Jia et al., 2020). Furthermore, HXL can also be used in the perfume (Frerot, 2004) and tobacco (Hall et al., 1978) industries. The aim of the present study is to specify optimum reaction conditions for maximizing HXL production from DMF hydrogenation. Although the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method, in which the effect of each variable on a process while holding the others constant is studied provides a way for finding suitable operating conditions, a better way for finding the optimum conditions is the response surface methodology (RSM) that involves statistical DoE where all variables are varied together over a set of experimental runs (Khayet et al., 2011). The main disadvantages of the (OFAT) method according to Czitrom (1999) are : (i) Interactions between experimental variables cannot be estimated using OFAT; (ii) The experimental information exists in a smaller region of the factor space. This deteriorates the prediction of the response, and makes process optimization less efficient as the optimal solution is searched for over a smaller region in the factor space. This is the reason why RSM is considered as a more efficient way for optimization especially in chemical reactions where interactions between the variables under investigation always exist (Soravia and Orth, 2000). RSM also represents a very economic method in industry as it saves time and money through the lower number of experiments needed to extract the maximum amount of information about the system under investigation. It has been successfully applied in many different scientific fields such as technical chemistry, physics, biofuel production, CO2 capture, food engineering, chemical engineering, petroleum refining and environmental protection (Bhran et al., 2016; Cepeda and Calvo, 2008; Khayet et al., 2011; Myers et al., 2016; Nuchitprasittichai and Cremaschi, 2011; Olsen et al., 2012; Ravikumar et al., 2005; Sherbi et al., 2020; Soto et al., 2016; Voß et al., 2019). RSM is a collection of mathematical and statistical methods for empirical model building, analyzing and optimization of a process. It implies three stages: (i) experimental design, (ii) response surface modeling in order to determine the relationship between the variables and the response through regression, (iii) optimization (Karacan et al., 2007). The design expert software version (10.0.3) has been chosen in our study for experimental design, modeling and optimization because it offers a wide range of different classes of design including factorials, fractional factorials and composite designs. In addition, it provides a large number of analytical and graphical techniques for model fitting, optimization and interpretation. The Box–Behnken experimental design has been chosen in this study for determining the relationship between the responses (yield of each product gained from DMF hydrogenation) and the variables (temperature, H2 pressure and substrate/catalyst ratio). The Box–Behnken design was chosen in our study due to its higher efficiency reported by Ferreira et al. (2007) compared to other response surface designs like: central composite, Doehlert matrix and three-level full factorial design. Box–Behnken design is a three-level incomplete factorial design, described as a cube (see Fig. 1 ), which is composed of a central point and middle points of the edges, and requires number of experiments according to the relation N = k2 + k + Rc , where (k) is the factor number and (R c) is the number of replicates for the central point (Aslan and Cebeci, 2007). This means that in our case, three-level three-factorial Box–Behnken experimental design, 15 experimental runs, shown in Fig. 1, are needed. Consequently, a Box-Behnken experimental design is employed to model the relation between the yield of different products gained from DMF hydrogenation and the three process variables temperature, pressure and substrate/catalyst ratio. Statistical validation of the four models produced were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The response surface and contour plots generated by design expert software version (10.0.3) were utilized in order to analyze the reaction system and gain as much valuable information as possible. Finally, optimization and experimental validation were performed, in order to validate the models and to find out the optimum conditions for maximizing the HXL yield."
1,Experimental details and methodology,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification: 2,5-dimethylfuran (99% purity) as substrate, decane (99+% purity) as carrier liquid, 5 wt% Pt/C as commercial reference catalyst, as well as H2 (5.0) and N2 (5.0) from Linde AG as gases. Pt(acac)2, H3[PW12O40]•xH2O and KCl were used to synthesize the bi-functional catalyst (Pt/K3PW12O40) as described in a previous study (Sherbi et al., 2021)."
3,Catalytic experiments,"2.2 Catalytic experiments Hydrogenation of DMF was carried out in a 10-fold parallel reaction system using 21 mL stainless-steel (1.4571) high-pressure vessels equipped with magnetic stirring. The autoclaves were connected in parallel to a single hydrogen supply line via individual couplings and placed inside a heating plate in order to adjust the required temperature. The heating plate was equipped with a magnetic stirrer whereby magnetic stirrer bars could be used for mixing. Additionally, each reactor was connected to a rupture disk with a burst pressure maximum of 90 bar. For a typical reaction, decane (10.0 mL) as a carrier liquid, 0.1 g (0.001 mol) DMF as a substrate and 0.04 g (Pt/K3PW12O40) catalyst, (2 mg active Pt) were charged into the reactor providing a substrate to catalyst ratio of 100:1 mol (DMF)/mol (Pt). Afterwards, the system was purged three times with hydrogen gas to remove residual air. The stirrer speed was set to 330 rpm and electrical heating was switched on. When the desired reaction temperature was reached, the hydrogen pressure was increased to the required pressure and the stirring speed was set to 770 rpm in order to start the gas entrainment. This moment was set as starting time of the experiment. For the DoE studies, the temperature was varied from 60 to 100 °C, pressure from 5 to 15 bar and substrate to catalyst ratio from 70 to 130 mol (DMF)/mol (Pt). After the desired reaction time, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, after that a gas-phase sample was collected from the reactor in a gas bag to be analyzed. Then the reactor was vented and purged with nitrogen gas (three times) before opening it. The catalyst was separated from the liquid phase by filtration and the liquid phase was analyzed by GC."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis A Varian GC 450-TCD-FID equipped with a Shin Carbon ST column (2 m × 0.75 mm internal diameter) was used to analyze gaseous samples. Argon (pressure of 4.82 bar) was used as the mobile phase in the GC in order to transport the sample after injection through the column. The temperature program used for the column was: 40 °C (1.5 min),18 °C min−1 to 250, 250 °C (12 min). A Varian CP-3900 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) was used for performing analysis of liquid products. Product compounds were separated using a Factor Four capillary column (VF-WAXms, 30 m length, 0.25 mm diameter) coated with a 0.25 µm thick stationary phase with helium as a carrier gas. The operating conditions of the GC method used was: injection temperature of 250 °C, column temperature program:40 °C (6 min),10 °C min−1 to 250, 250 °C (2.5 min), detection temperature of 250 °C. An external standard (octane) was used in all samples for liquid GC measurements. Conversion of DMF and product yields were calculated as presented below in Eqs. (1) and (2). Mass balance for all experiments, based on carbon balances of each reaction, was > 95% using the applied analytical methods (1) Conversion ( mol % ) = number of moles of substrate reacted number of moles of substrate loaded X 100 % (2) Yield ( mol % ) = number of moles of product that actually formed maximum theoritical number of moles that can be produced X 100 %"
5,Design of experiments (DoE),"2.4 Design of experiments (DoE) As stated before, the DoE employed has been performed considering three independent variables: reaction temperature T (°C), pressure p (bar) and substrate to catalyst ratio S/C (mol (DMF)/mol (Pt)). Table 1 presents the controllable factors and their different levels in coded and actual values. The output response considered in the DOE is the yield (mole %) for each product in the reaction system calculated through Eq. (2). In order to investigate how the process variables affect the responses and to obtain models that represent the relationship between the responses and the variables, a Box-Behnken experimental design was performed with 3 factors and 3 levels. The 3-level 3-factorial Box-Behnken experimental design, shown in Table 2 , consists of 15 runs with 12 design points (middle points of the edges) and 3 center points for replication. A polynomial equation was used to produce the model predicting the response as a function of controllable variables. Usually a second-order polynomial model is used for Box-Behnken designs, so the responses become as follows (Khayet et al., 2011): (3) Y = b 0 + ∑ i = 1 n b i x i + ∑ i = 1 n b i i x i 2 + ∑ i < j n b i j x i x j + ζ where: Y is the predicted response, x i refers to the coded variables, b 0 , b i , b i i , b i j are the regression coefficients and ζ is the statistical error. For improving model's performance and ability for prediction in the current study, the model terms with insignificant coefficient depending on P-values were excluded. Also, some additional cubic terms were added to the models without overstressing the design or causing confounding (Soravia and Orth, 2000). The coefficients of the empirical models have been determined from the experimental data by the application of least square method using the Design Expert Software (version 10.0.3). Statistical validation and fit quality of produced models were examined by analyses of variance (ANOVA) using the same software. The coefficient of determination R2 and the statistical significance of the models using the F-test were reported. Optimization of reaction conditions for maximizing HXL production was carried out using the software's numerical optimization. Since four responses were gained in the modeling of DMF hydrogenation as presented later, the simultaneous optimization of all of them resulted in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. A numerical technique that can be used in case of several responses that should be optimized simultaneously is the desirability function approach, in which a multi-response problem is transformed into a single response problem (Soto et al., 2016). The desirability function approach consists usually of three steps: (i) Performing experiments and fitting the data for a number of responses; (ii) Defining an individual desirability function for each response; (iii) Defining the overall desirability and maximizing it in order to find optimum conditions. In our study, the experiments were performed according to Table 2, then the results were collected and used to produce the responses by response surface modeling. After all model responses Yn(z) are fitted to polynomial equations by response surface methodology, an individual desirability function dn(Yn(z)) is developed for each response as presented in Eq. (4). (4) d n ( Y n ( z ) ) = { 0 i f Y n ( z ) < L n ( Y n ( z ) − L n T n − L n ) s i f L n ≥ Y n ( z ) ≥ T n 1 i f Y n ( z ) > T n where z are the factors, Ln is the lower acceptable value of Yn(z), and Tn is the target value. The parameter s equals to unity for all responses in order to assign equal importance to each response. The total desirability function D(z), can be defined as the geometric mean of the individual desirability functions obtained for the r responses of interest, as presented in Eq. (5) (Soravia and Orth, 2000; Soto et al., 2016). (5) D ( z ) = ∏ n = 1 r d n ( Y n ( z ) ) r Eq. (5) represents our single response problem that can be used for finding the optimum conditions for our reaction system."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Response surface modeling of the product yields for DMF hydrogenation using Pt/K3PW12O40,"3.1 Response surface modeling of the product yields for DMF hydrogenation using Pt/K3PW12O40 In the first study (Table 3 ), we performed two reference experiments showing the superior activity of the Pt/K3PW12O40 catalyst (68.0% HXL-yield) compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (only 49.7% HXL-yield) under similar hydrogenation conditions. This data was set as reference point for further optimization. In the next step, four predictive models were tested to estimate the product yields of DMF hydrogenation using the Pt/K3PW12O40 catalyst as a function of reaction temperature T (°C), hydrogen pressure p (bar) and substrate to catalyst ratio S/C (mol (DMF)/mol (Pt)). The variables were changed from minimum to maximum values as presented in Tables 1 and 2 in order to build the Box-Behnken design shown in Table 4 . Based on the results of the Box-Behnken experimental design, the RSM was applied to find out the relation between the responses and the variables. In our case the best empirical models that can predict the yield of each product in terms of coded variables are given in Eqs. (6)–(9). (6) Y i e l d o f H X L = 66.12 + 13.61 * A + 11.88 * B − 7.66 * C − 10.24 * A B + 6.97 * A C + 9.45 * B C − 8.64 * A 2 − 8.95 * B 2 + 3.62 * A 2 B − 7.97 * A C 2 (7) Y i e l d o f H X N = 9.6 − 6.72 * A − 16.5 * B + 11.78 * C + 3.75 * A B − 5.57 * A C − 10.82 * B C + 7.04 * B 2 + 3.25 * C 2 + 3.94 * A 2 B (8) Y i e l d o f H X = 6.01 + 1.01 * A + 0.66 * B − 1.95 * C − 1.3 * A C + 2.38 * A 2 + 1.24 * C 2 − 1.51 * A 2 C (9) Y i e l d o f D M T H F = 18.98 − 1.21 * A + 4.74 * B − 1.08 * C − 1.17 * A B + 0.57 * A C − 2.3 * B 2 + 0.82 * C 2 + 0.91 * A B 2 − 1.96 * B C 2 where A, B and C are the coded values of the independent variables (T, p, S/C), 60 °C ≤T≤100 °C; 5 ≤ p ≤ 15 H2 bar and 70 ≤ Sub/Catalyst ≤ 130 (mol (DMF)/mol (Pt)). All analysis within the Design expert software are based on the coded equations presented in Eqs. (6)–(9 ). The empirical models obtained in terms of actual variables are presented in the supporting information (Eqs. (S1)–(S4)). The regression coefficients of the response models were calculated using the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method to minimize the sum of squares of the residuals. The best empirical model that fits the experimental yield data in each case was selected using a backward selection depending on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To improve the model performance, some terms were neglected depending on the P-value as the corresponding term will be more significant if its P-value is smaller than 0.05 (Cepeda and Calvo, 2008; Dc, 2001; Ravikumar et al., 2005). Some exceptions were done only if removing the term decreases the F-value or predicted R2 significantly. For example, removing the term C2 which has a P-value = 0.13, (see Table S10 in the supporting information) from DMTHF model will decrease the F-value of the model to 19, R2 to 0.96, R2 adj. to 0.91 and Pred. R2 to 0.48. On the other hand, if the term is included in the model the results will be of much higher significance as presented in Table 5 . Also, some higher order interaction terms were introduced without overstressing the models in order to enhance the prediction power. For example, the two significant terms A2B and AC2 in the HXL prediction model have a P-value = 0.03 and 0.002, respectively). Without them the F-value, R2, R2 adj. and Pred. R2 are only 19.34, 0.96, 0.91 and 0.6, respectively. On the other hand, when they are included in the model the results of F -value, R2, R2adj. and Pred. R2 were much better, (170.38, 0.998, 0.992, 0.875) respectively, as presented in Table 5."
8,Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or statistical analysis and validation,"3.2 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or statistical analysis and validation In order to statically validate the response surface models, see Eqs. (6)–(9) for adequacy, we used the analysis of variance (ANOVA). All ANOVA tables for each model are presented in the supporting information (see Tables S1-S12). The most relevant information from the ANOVA tables for all of the models are summarized in Table 5. The relationships used for determining the statistical estimators (i.e., F-value, P-value, R2, R2 adj. and pred.R2) can be found elsewhere (Joyce, 1982; Tomescu et al., 1984). The F-test, shown in Eq. (10), was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the empirical models. In case that the calculated F-value is greater than the Fcrit, the model gives a good prediction of the experimental data (Dc, 2001; Myers et al., 2016). (10) F v a l u e > F c r i t ( p − 1 , N − p , γ ) where p represents the number of terms in the model, N number of runs and γ = 0.05 In Table 5, the F-value for all models is found to be greater than the tabulated one (Fcrit(10,4,0.05) for HXL, Fcrit (9,5,0.05) for HXN, Fcrit (7,7,0.05) for HX, and Fcrit (9,5,0.05) for DMTHF). Moreover, the P-value for each model is used to judge whether the F-value is large enough to indicate statistical significance. For all of the models the P-value is smaller than 0.01 which indicates that they are statistically significant (Ravikumar et al., 2005). As already known the closer the determination coefficient (R2) is to 1, the better the model fits the experimental data, and all of the models in our study have shown R2 ≥ 0.968. Moreover, the predicted R2 values are in agreement with the R2 adj. values (i.e. The difference between them is less than 0.2).This implies that most of the significant terms have been inserted in the regression models (Khayet et al., 2011). The ANOVA table also presents the residual error for each model, which indicates the amount of variation in the response data left unexplained by the model (Ravikumar et al., 2005),and the lack of fit which is the weighted sum of squared deviations between the mean response at each factor level and the corresponding fitted value. A non-significant lack of fit (i.e. lack of fit P-value > 0.05) is desirable (Zafari et al., 2019), which is the case in all of the models except for the HXL-model .The significant lack of fit for the HXL-model can be ignored in our case because of the high pred.R2 and the experimental validation that will be discussed later. ""Adeq. Precision"" is also reported for each model, which measures the signal to noise ratio and compares the range of the predicted values at the design points to the average prediction error. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable and represents indication for an adequate model discrimination, which is the case for all of the presented predictive models. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the proposed models are adequate to represent the relationship between the responses (Yield % for each product) and the significant variables (T, p, S/C). Residual analysis, presented in (Figs. S1–S4), is also performed for each model in order to check the linearity of the model and assure that the residuals are independent from one another, identically distributed and have a constant variance. The response values calculated using the empirical models were compared to the experimental results in Fig. 2 also confirming the adequacy of the models to fit the experimental data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed models are validated from a statistical point of view and they can be considered suitable for making predictions and optimization."
9,Studying the impact of changing operating conditions on the product distribution,"3.3 Studying the impact of changing operating conditions on the product distribution After the statistical validation of the developed models in the previous study and before performing the optimization in order to increase the amount of the desired product HXL, we investigated the influence of changing the variables T, p, S/C on the yield of each product using the response surface and contour plots generated by the Design Expert software in order to analyze the reaction system and to gain as much valuable information as possible. Regarding HXL, Table S1 shows that all of the variables (T, p, S/C) are significant because they have a very low P-value. In order to investigate how each variable affects the yield of HXL, a response surface plot and contour plots were drawn. As can be seen from Fig. 3 (a) at a medium value of S/C = 100, increasing the temperature at low pressure or increasing the pressure at low temperature increases the HXL yield. This is in good agreement with previous observations, that increasing the temperature favors the desired ring opening leading to HXL and HXN over ring saturation which produces mainly DMTHF (Louie et al., 2017). Increasing the H2 pressure at constant T favors the consecutive hydrogenation of the ring-opened intermediate HXN to HXL (Louie et al., 2017; Sen and Vannice, 1988) finally leading to y higher HXL-yield. Moreover, higher HXL-yields can be also achieved by increasing both of them simultaneously. To explore the effect of changing the S/C ratio, three contour plots presented in Fig. 3(a)–(c) were drawn at S/C = 130, 100, and 70, respectively. Obviously, decreasing the S/C ratio (i.e. increasing the catalyst amount) results in an enlarging domain containing high yield of HXL (red domain) and shifting the maximum achievable yield to lower values of p and T. It is worth to note that for S/C = 70 (Fig. 3(d), increasing p and T to their maximum values simultaneously produces lower HXL-yield (yellow region) that can be attributed to the higher rate of dehydration of HXL to produce hexane. At higher S/C (Fig. 3(b)) the effect of increasing the temperature alone at low to moderate pressure becomes less significant and does not produce high yields of HXL unless the pressure is high as well. Two 3D response surface plots for HXN at S/C = 130 and 70 respectively are presented in Fig. 4 in order to investigate the effect of each variable on the HXN yield. From Fig. 4(a), increasing temperature or pressure decreases the amount of HXN produced. As can be noticed from comparing Fig. 4(a) and (b), higher amounts of HXN can be produced only in case of high S/C ratio. This is related to the fact that HXN is an intermediate that can be further hydrogenated to HXL and the existence of higher amounts of the catalyst will always lead to the hydrogenation of HXN to HXL. From Fig. 4(a), it is obvious that H2 pressure is a very significant variable. Decreasing p (H2) will prevent subsequent hydrogenation to HXL and allow for the production of higher amounts of HXN. Regarding the temperature, it has less significance which is noticeable in Fig. 4(a) and (b) that agrees with the P-values of each variable presented in Table S4 as p, S/C have lower P-values (0.0001) than T which has (0.0018). Regarding the HX yield, Table S7 in the supporting information presents the P-values of each factor. The p-value related to the pressure in the HX-model is 0.033. On the other hand, the P-values related to temperature and S/C ratio are (0.004,0.0009, respectively) which are much lower and make them more significant, especially the S/C ratio. Therefore, only one 3D response surface plot between T and S/C is presented in order to investigate the HX product distribution. As shown in Fig. 5 , decreasing the amount of S/C results in increasing the HX yield. Also, at low S/C ratio of 70, first increasing the temperature decreases the amount of HX until a temperature around 80 °C and then increases it again dramatically. The amount of HX increases to a maximum at very high temperature and low S/C. This behavior can be explained by the following behavior: (i) with increasing temperature, the amount of HXL produced increases which can further react to produce HX (Alharbi et al., 2015), (ii) low S/C ratio means that higher amounts of catalyst are present, therefore higher number of acid sites, which are responsible for dehydration of HXL, will exist in the reaction system and this will lead to higher HX yield (Alharbi et al., 2015; Aramendıa et al., 1999). As presented in Fig. 6(a)–(c), the effect of different variables on the DMTHF-yield can be seen. In general, increasing the temperature or decreasing S/C ratio increases the DMTHF yield slightly. However, the most significant factor that affects DMTHF production is the H2 pressure. Increasing the latter significantly increases the DMTHF yield, because the rate of ring saturation increases much more with increasing the pressure rather than the rate of ring opening (Louie et al., 2017). This also agrees with the P-values presented in Table S10 in the supporting information, where the P-value related to the pressure has the lowest value which means it is the most significant variable on the DMTHF-yield. A final conclusion after studying the effects of changing the variables on product distribution is that there is no conflict between the models and what is known from literature about the reaction system, which is another good sign that allows us to use them for prediction and optimization."
10,Optimization and experimental validation of optimum conditions,"3.4 Optimization and experimental validation of optimum conditions Based on the aforementioned statistical validation of the models, we proceeded with optimization in order to find the optimum conditions at which we can maximise our desired product HXL. Also, the ability of the proposed models to predict product yields has been confirmed in this study by performing additional runs under optimum conditions of maximizing HXL yield or minimizing the other products, as discussed later. In order to show the importance of performing optimization using response surface modeling technique instead of one factor at a time investigations (OFAT) technique, two interaction plots are presented for HXL-yield in Fig. 7(a)–(b), for S/C = 100 and 70, respectively, investigating the effect of temperature at low and high hydrogen pressure. Regarding moderate S/C = 100 in Fig. 7(a): (i) at low p = 5 bar, increasing the temperature is desirable and we have maximum HXL-yield at maximum value of T. (ii) However, at higher p = 15 bar increasing temperature does not affect the yield significantly. Regarding lower S/C value =70 (see Fig. 7(b): (i) at low p = 5 bar, HXL yield is directly proportional to T. (ii) On the other hand, at higher p = 15 bar, it is inversely proportional to T. Therefore, a compromise between different variables T, p, S/C should exist in order to achieve optimum conditions for maximising HXL-yield, which is not a suitable task for one factor at a time investigations (OFAT), but can only be achieved using DoE. The overall target of the optimization study is to find out the conditions that maximize HXL-yield and minimize other products. Simultaneous optimization of the four responses gained in the modeling of hydrogenation of DMF resulted in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. The desirability function approach where a multi-response problem can be transformed into a single response problem is used to achieve this target in a three step process as discussed before in Section 2.4 using design expert software. In the first step, the experiments were performed and the data were fitted, and this resulted in four responses Yn(z) which represent Eqs. (6)–(9) in this study. Secondly, an individual desirability function dn (Yn (z)), ranging between 0 and 1, for each of the four responses was defined using Eq. (4). Finally, the overall desirability function D(z) was defined as the geometric mean of the four individual desirability functions according to Eq. (5) and then maximized in order to find optimum conditions. The applied constrains to the experimental variables for the optimization of overall D(z) were set to be at the same range of the experimental conditions: 60 °C ≤ T ≤ 100 °C; 5 ≤ p ≤ 15 H2 bar and 70 ≤ Sub/Catalyst ≤130 (mol (DMF)/mol (Pt)). The constrains, target values, lower acceptable limits and the obtained numerical results for each individual desirability function and the overall desirability function are summarized in Tables S.13–14. Two different reaction condition sets, presented in entries 1 and 3 in Table 6 , were obtained from optimizing the overall desirability function for maximizing the HXL-yield and minimizing other product yields. The predicted HXL-yields were 70.6% and 68.3%, respectively. We used those reaction condition sets in two different laboratory experiments (entries 2 and 4 Table 6) in order to validate the models experimentally at those optimum conditions. We managed to produce HXL-yield of 70.6, 68.9% experimentally as predicted from the model. As seen in entries 2 and 4 the yields of HX and DMTHF were still high, therefore we preformed another optimization task where we minimized HXN, HX, DMTHF only without maximizing HXL-yield. As presented in entry 5, we obtained an optimum variable set of (83 °C for T, 5 bar for p (H2) and 88 for S/C) as a solution for this optimization problem. Another experimental validation for the predicted yields was performed at similar reaction conditions (entry 6). The ability of the models to perform predictions at different product ranges can be confirmed through the experimental validation presented in Table 6 entries 1–6. A quick glance at entries 3 and 6 shows that there is only one variable that is different in each case, namely the pressure (i.e. for minimizing the undesirable products low p is desirable and for maximizing our desired product HXL higher p = 15 is desirable). So, we decided to perform a further experiment, (entry 7), under similar reaction conditions starting with low p = 5 then increasing it to p = 15 after thirty minutes. As presented in entry 7, with the help of DoE and desirability function approach for optimization, we managed to achieve 77.4% HXL-yield at full DMF conversion."
11,Effect of H2 pressure and time-resolved investigations,"3.5 Effect of H2 pressure and time-resolved investigations In the last set of experiments, the influence of different gas phase compositions on the hydrogenation of DMF was investigated. In detail, we wanted to find out the correlation between the partial pressure of hydrogen and the total pressure of the reaction system. Therefore, we used different dilutions with nitrogen in the gas phase. In the beginning, we used a low total pressure of 5 bar with pure hydrogen atmosphere leading to 55.2% HXL-yield and still 23.6% HXN-yield (entry 1). Moreover 15.4% DMTHF-yield shows that a significant amount of hydrogen is consumed in the undesired ring saturation reaction. Interestingly, increasing the total pressure to 15 bar by simply adding 10 bar of inert nitrogen gas further increased the HXL-yield to 65.5% by simultaneous decrease of the HXN-yield (entry 2). However, the amount of DMTHF remained unchanged. By further increasing the hydrogen pressure to 15 bar (entry 3), the yield of HXL was only slightly increased to 68.9% whereby DMTHF-yield increased to 21.5%. This goes hand in hand with a decreasing selectivity for the desired ring-opening reaction. A control experiment in pure nitrogen atmosphere (entry 4) did not show any DMF conversion as expected. Moreover, further time-resolved experiments at extended reaction times were performed at different total pressures to study the kinetic effect of different gas atmospheres. A time-resolved experiment at a total pressure of 5 bar (pure H2) is presented in Fig. 8(a). Hereby, we can observe full DMF conversion already after 2 h reaction time. Moreover, HXN is formed as an intermediate with a maximum yield of 60% after 1 hour and a sharp decrease down to almost 20% after 3 h. Afterwards, its amount decreased constantly down to zero after 15 h. Furthermore, HXL is fastly formed after an initial phase of around 1 h by the consecutive hydrogenation of HXN upto almost 70% yield after 15 h. Additionally, small amounts of DMTHF (up to 15%) and HX (up to 10%) are slowly formed during the entire reaction time as side products. In comparison, the time-resolved experiment at a total pressure of 15 bar (5 bar H2 and 10 bar N2 shown in Fig. 8(b) does not show significant differences in reaction kinetics except for the faster conversion of DMF (already full conversion after 1 h) and a faster formation of HXL directly after starting the reaction. Therefore, we can conclude that the total pressure increases hydrogen solubility in the carrier liquid decane according to Henry's law. This increases the kinetics of the desired ring-opening reaction leading to HXN as an intermediate and consecutive hydrogenation to HXL. However, the undesired ring saturation reaction leading to DMTHF is not affected by the overall pressure. After this study and without any doubts, we can explain the reason for the highest yield of 77.4% HXL gained with the help of DoE in Table 6, entry 7. At the beginning of the reaction where most of the DMF conversion takes place and at low p = 5 H2, the formation of DMTHF is limited to a minimum by parallel maximising the ring opening reaction. After 30 min and with increasing the H2 pressure to 15 bar in the system, we overcame the mass transfer limitation of H2 and accelerated the rate limiting step, hydrogenation of ring-opened HXN to HXL, which increased the rate of HXL formation leading to a maximum overall HXL yield."
12,Conclusion,"Four predictive models that estimate different product yields of DMF hydrogenation using the catalyst Pt/K3PW12O40, in terms of temperature, pressure and substrate to catalyst ratio, were generated using response surface methodology applied to a Box-Behnken experimental design. The analysis of variance confirmed the adequacy of the models to fit the experimental data. Additionally, experimental validation of the models was performed at three different reaction condition sets. With the help of the response surface and contour plots generated by the Design Expert software, we were able to fully understand the effect of operating conditions on the yield of each product in the hydrogenation reaction. The desirability function approach for optimization was utilized in order to find the optimal conditions for maximizing HXL production. With those optimum reaction conditions reported in Table 6, entry 7 a maximum HXL yield of 77.4% was achieved at complete DMF conversion. Time-resolved experiments having two different total pressures managed to illustrate the reason for this high yield of HXL at the reported optimal condition. In addition, it revealed that DMF ring saturation and ring opening reactions occur in parallel not in series and that the ring opened products are produced directly from DMF not from DMTHF as an intermediate. Also, it showed that the rate-limiting step of the reaction leading to HXL as a product was the successive hydrogenation of the ring-opened product HXN to HXL, and that most of HXL produced resulted from the secondary reaction pathway, HXN hydrogenation to HXL, not from the primary reaction pathway of DMF ring opening and hydrogenation."
