0,Introduction,"Efficient transformation of solar energy into clean chemical fuels is of great significance for future civilization. For such a goal, the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen by means of water splitting is studied, especially over nanomaterials [1–3]. Cadmium sulfide is inexpensive and easy to synthesize. As an II–VI semiconductor, it is attractive for water splitting because its band gap (2.4eV) allows efficient absorption of visible light and the potentials for the reduction and oxidation of water lie within its band edges [4–8]. So far, CdS of different morphologies were developed for water splitting, including quantum dots (QDs) [9–11], nanorods (NRs) and nanowires (NWs) [12–17] as well as those of three-dimensional structures [18]. In general, CdS by itself does not perform well under visible light irradiation, and the creation of heterojunctions between CdS and a semiconductor of different kind is a promising way to achieve satisfactory activity. For that end, various CdS-based materials were studied for photocatalytic water splitting. Recently, we fabricated one-dimensional (1D) CdS decorated with MS2 (M=Mo, W) nanosheets that are efficient in water splitting [13,15]. On the basis of the results, we envisaged that the use of two-dimensional (2D) CdS nanomaterials could result in even better performance. Carbon nitride (C3N4) is a well-known photocatalyst with 2D layered structure. The optical band gap of this organic semiconductor was determined to be 2.7eV [19]. Over C3N4, it is possible to generate hydrogen and oxygen from water splitting under visible-light irradiation [20–23]. The performance of C3N4 nanosheets in photocatalysis and biosensing is attributed to the large surface area and charge transfer ability of the material. It was demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity and visible-light response of C3N4 can be effectively improved through the addition of a suitable semiconductor nanomaterial [24–29]. Comparing the band-edge position of CdS with that of C3N4, it is realized that the photogenerated electrons in C3N4 can transfer to CdS while the corrosive photogenerated holes in CdS can readily move to C3N4, achieving high separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers as a result. Despite the many reports on CdS-C3N4 composites [30–34], the coupling of 2D CdS with C3N4 nanosheets for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting has never been reported. Herein, we report the coupling of 2D porous CdS nanoplates with C3N4 nanosheets by a two-step method to generate CdS/C3N4 heterojunctions. The as-prepared CdS-C3N4 composites exhibit excellent activities under visible light (λ≥400nm). The intrinsic relations between performance and physical property of the composites were studied in the context of hydrogen generation from water splitting."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Phase structure,"2.1 Phase structure We have successfully synthesized ZnS(en)0.5 nanoplates, CdS nanoplates (CdS NPs) and CdS-C3N4 composites (Experimental section, Supporting information), and their XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. 1 . The nominal C3N4-to-CdS mass ratios adopted for this study were 5%, 10%, 20% and 30%, and the samples are labelled herein as 5% CCN, 10% CCN, 20% CCN and 30% CCN, respectively. One can see that ZnS(en)0.5 is successfully synthesized because the XRD pattern is identical with that reported in literature [34]. The data of CdS NPs indicates that the as-prepared CdS has a hexagonal wurtzite structure with P63mc space group and lattice parameters a=4.141Å and c=6.720Å (JCPDS no. 41-1049). It is worth pointing out that the relative intensity of the (002) peak at 2θ=26.5° of pure CdS sample is low in comparison with that of standard diffraction data, indicating that the CdS grows preferentially along the c-axis. The other six characteristic diffraction peaks are at 2θ of 24.8°, 28.2°, 36.6°, 43.7°, 47.8° and 52.8°, similar to those of standard data (JCPDS no. 41-1049). The XRD patterns of the CCN composites are similar to that of pure CdS plausibly due to the low signals of the C3N4 nanosheets. Nevertheless, the presence of C3N4 nanosheets in the composites can be confirmed by XPS, SEM, TEM and FT-IR analyses (see below and Supporting information)."
3,Morphological structure,"2.2 Morphological structure Fig. S3 depicts the SEM images of ZnS(en)0.5, CdS NPs, a-C3N4 and those of CCN composites. The TEM images were also collected to further determine the surface structures. As shown in Fig. S4a, the a-C3N4 is made up of small and thin nanosheets, in agreement with that observed by She et al. [28]. The CdS NPs are porous (Fig. S4b). Shown in Fig. 2a is the TEM image of 10% CCN, and obviously the surface of CdS NPs is covered with thin C3N4 nanosheets. Moreover, the EDX spectrum confirms the coexistence of CdS and C3N4. And there is no detection of Zn which confirms the complete removal of Zn."
4,Optical properties,"2.3 Optical properties From the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra (UV–vis DRS) depicted in Fig. 3 , it is apparent that all samples show absorption in the 200nm to 800nm range. The a-C3N4 has higher ability for the absorption of visible light mainly because of the nanosheets generated in ultrasonic exfoliation treatment as well as the porous structure created during acid treatment [28]. The curves of CdS NPs and 10% CCN show obvious red shift in comparison with that of ZnS(en)0.5. The results suggest that the CCN composites have visible-light-driven ability for catalytic actions. Fig. S6 shows the PL spectra of the samples recorded with a 350nm laser source. Apparently, 10% CCN shows lower PL intensity than CdS NPs, indicating that the recombination of electron-hole pairs has been substantially suppressed."
5,Photocatalytic properties,"2.4 Photocatalytic properties As for the photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen evolution upon visible light irradiation, the average hydrogen evolution rate of ZnS(en)0.5, CdS NPs, 5% CCN, 10% CCN, 20% CCN and 30% CCN are 0.1, 9.5, 13.1, 11.2, 3.1 and 3.0mmolh−1 g−1, respectively. The amount of C3N4 in the composites shows a great influence on photocatalytic activity. With the increase of C3N4 content, the CCN nanocomposites show increase of hydrogen evolution activity. However, it is noted that excess C3N4 on the surface hinders the light absorption of CdS, causing a reduction of photo-generated electrons. Furthermore, the dispersion of bulk C3N4 in a fixed volume of solvent is limited, and bulk C3N4 in excess could not be fully exfoliated. Both factors would result in decrease of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance of 10% CCN for hydrogen generation under monochromatic irradiation of 420nm was studied to obtain the apparent quantum yield (AQY). It is calculated to be 15.9% which is higher than those reported in the literature [30–32]. The excellent photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the rich presence of CdS/C3N4 heterojunctions as well as the porous structure. To investigate the stability of the CdS-C3N4 composites, four consecutive cycles of the photocatalytic reaction were performed and each cycle lasted for 3h (Fig. 4b). The hydrogen production in the first hour is lower than that of the last two hours. This might be due to Pt poisoning by CO originated in the degradation of lactic acid, commonly observed in fuel cell applications. When the light is turned off at the end of each cycle, the surface absorbs a large amount of CO which greatly reduces the availability of Pt to act as a cocatalyst. When the light is on again, the poisoned Pt is photoreduced back to Pt. In general, the photocatalytic activity remains almost stable in the recyclability test. The results suggest that the combination of C3N4 with CdS restrains the photocorrosion of metal sulfide."
6,Possible mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic activities,"2.5 Possible mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic activities Disregard that increase of plate thickness would lead to decline of specific surface area, we designed the porous CdS nanoplates for easy coupling with the C3N4 nanosheets. As described in the supporting information, the specific surface area of 10% CCN (68.9m2/g) is larger than that of pure CdS (50.7m2/g). Apparently, the thickness of the CdS nanoplates does not pose any negative effect on the catalytic activity of the 2D CdS/C3N4 composites. During the ultrasonic process, CdS nanoplates act as templates for the self-assembly of C3N4 nanosheets. According to Zhang et al. [30], C3N4 nanosheets tend to adsorb on the surface of CdS to minimize total interfacial energy. It was reported that in alcohols, C3N4 nanosheets undergo a regrowth process. In our reaction system, C3N4 nanosheets couple with CdS nanoplates in a close-knit manner. Moreover, relative to bulk C3N4, the flexible and ultrathin C3N4 nanosheets are more readily adsorbed on the CdS surface. Generally, photocatalytic activity is influenced by three essential factors: light-absorption ability, separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and amount of surface active sites. In this study, we achieved enhanced photocatalytic activity by combining CdS nanoplates with C3N4 nanosheets for hydrogen evolution. We ascribe the enhancement mainly to CdS and C3N4 synergism that facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The schematic of the energy-level configuration and photogenerated charge-transfer process is illustrated in Fig. 5 . Under visible light, the photogenerated electrons on the LUMO level of C3N4 readily move into the conduction band of CdS, while the photogenerated holes on the valance band of CdS transfer to the HOMO of C3N4. In other words, there is enrichment of excited electrons in CdS because in addition to the photogenerated electrons of CdS, there is the injection of energetic electrons from C3N4. And there is enrichment of electrons for water splitting. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes on CdS rapidly migrate to C3N4 and thus substantially alleviate the problem of CdS photocorrosion [30]. With specific surface area larger than that of CdS NPs, the CCN composites have more exposed active sites on the surface to assure better activity. Nonetheless, with the increase of C3N4 content, the excess C3N4 nanosheets prevent CdS from having direct contact with the reacting solution, thus hindering the energetic electrons in CdS from participating in the hydrogen-evolution reaction. Furthermore, the accumulation of excited electrons at the interface of C3N4 and CdS may lead to recombination of charge carriers. Consequently, photocatalytic activity decreases when C3N4 is in excess. We measured the photocurrent of CdS NPs, a-C3N4, 5% CCN, 10% CCN and 20% CCN (Fig. S7). The 10% CCN sample is the strongest in term of photocurrent intensity, implying highest efficiency for the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes."
7,Conclusion,Composites of 2D porous CdS nanoplates coupled with C3N4 nanosheets were prepared. The one with optimized C3N4-to-CdS mass ratio shows superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. The out-standing performance of the CCN photocatalysts is attributed to the porous 2D structures as well as to the heterojunctions created between C3N4 and CdS.
