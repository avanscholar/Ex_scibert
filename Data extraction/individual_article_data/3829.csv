0,Introduction,"Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been considered as the most feasible candidate for commercialization of fuel cell technologies [1,2]. Therefore, much attention has been paid on hydrogen production from various hydrocarbons and alcohols. Several routes for hydrogen production from hydrocarbons and alcohols include steam reforming [2–7], partial oxidation [8,9], auto-thermal reforming [10–12], and carbon dioxide reforming [13–15]. Among these reforming technologies, steam reforming of methane has been recognized as the most feasible process for commercial production of hydrogen, because hydrogen-rich gas (H2/CO=3) can be obtained (equation (1)). Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is mainly composed of methane, can serve as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure in modern cities may become more widespread in the future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential and on-board reformers in PEMFC applications. (1) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 , Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ / mol Nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in the steam reforming processes due to their high intrinsic activity and low cost [16,17]. However, nickel-based catalysts require high reaction temperature (>800°C), high reaction pressure (20–40bar), and high steam to carbon feed ratio (>3) to obtain a reasonable methane conversion and to prevent the catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming processes [16–18]. Undoubtedly, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for residential and on-board hydrogen production. Therefore, developing an efficient nickel-based catalyst with high activity and long durability is required for hydrogen production by low temperature steam reforming reactions. A number of nickel-based catalysts have been developed for use in the steam reforming reactions, with an aim of suppressing the carbon deposition and nickel sintering [19–24]. It has been reported that nickel catalysts finely dispersed on the surface of mesoporous alumina efficiently prohibited the carbon deposition and nickel sintering during the steam reforming reactions [23,25]. Thus, mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts have attracted much attention in order to achieve fine nickel dispersion [26–31]. Various preparation methods, such as sol–gel methods [26,27], impregnation methods [23,28], co-precipitation methods [29,30], and sequential precipitation methods [30,31], have been proposed for the preparation of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. It is expected that physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts are strongly affected by the preparation method. However, application of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts prepared by various methods to low temperature steam reforming of LNG has not been systematically examined yet. In this work, mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method, co-precipitation method, and sequential precipitation method for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of preparation method of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity for steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method, co-precipitation method, and sequential precipitation method, according to the similar methods reported in the literatures [23,25,29,30]. Typical preparation procedures for Ni–Al2O3 catalyst by impregnation method are as follows [23,25]. 5g of aluminum precursor (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 40ml of distilled water (Solution A). Solution A was slowly added into 50ml of distilled water to form a mixed solution (Solution B). When pH of Solution B was adjusted to 9 by adding ammonia solution for precipitation, a white precipitate was formed within a few seconds. After maintaining the resulting product at room temperature for 24h, a solid was recovered from Solution B by centrifugation and the solid was washed with ethanol. The solid product was dried overnight at 100°C, and it was calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield Al2O3 support. Ni–Al2O3 catalyst was then prepared by impregnating a known amount of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) onto Al2O3. The impregnated catalyst was dried overnight at 100°C, and then it was calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield Ni–Al2O3. The Ni–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by impregnation method was denoted as NiAl-IP. For the preparation of Ni–Al2O3 catalyst by co-precipitation method [29,30], 5g of aluminum precursor (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) and 0.678g of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) were dissolved in 40ml of distilled water (Solution C). Ammonia solution and Solution C were slowly added into 50ml of distilled water to form a mixed solution (Solution D). When pH of Solution D was kept at 9 by adding ammonia solution for co-precipitation, a blue precipitate was formed. After maintaining the resulting product at room temperature for 24h, a blue solid was recovered from Solution D by centrifugation and the solid was washed with ethanol. The solid product was dried overnight at 100°C, and it was calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield Ni–Al2O3 catalyst. The Ni–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method was denoted as NiAl-CP. Ni–Al2O3 catalyst was also prepared by sequential precipitation method as follows [30]. 5g of aluminum precursor (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 20ml of distilled water (Solution E) and 0.678g of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was separately dissolved in 20ml of distilled water (Solution F). Upon adding ammonia solution and Solution E into 50ml of distilled water at room temperature, a white precipitate was formed (Solution G). Ammonia solution and Solution F were then slowly added into Solution G to form a mixed solution. When pH of the mixed solution was kept at 9 for precipitation of nickel precursor, a blue precipitate was formed within a few seconds. After maintaining the result product at room temperature for 24h, a solid was recovered from the mixed solution by centrifugation and the solid was washed with ethanol. The solid product was dried overnight at 100°C, and it was calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield Ni–Al2O3 catalyst. The Ni–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by sequential precipitation method was denoted as NiAl-SP. The nickel loading was fixed at 20wt% in all the catalysts."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Chemical compositions of NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples were obtained with an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument, and pore size distributions of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples were determined by the Barret–Joyner–Hallender (BJH) method applied to the desorption branch of nitrogen isotherms. Crystalline structures of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.541Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to examine the reducibility of NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2ml/min) and N2 (20ml/min) was used for 0.1g of catalyst sample. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of reduced NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5ml/min) and argon (47.5ml/min) at 700°C for 3h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50ml/min) at 700°C for 15min. The sample was then cooled to 50°C under a flow of argon (50ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was determined by injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) periodically into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel dispersion and nickel surface area were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom and that cross-sectional area of atomic nickel is 6.49×10−20 m2/Ni-atom. The amount of carbon deposited on the used NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 =4.6:0.4:10:30, and total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000ml/hg. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas were calculated according to the following equations on the basis of carbon balance. (2) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (3) Hydrogen composition in dry gas ( % ) = F H 2 , out F H 2 , out + F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out + F CO , out + F CO 2 , out × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Textural properties of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples were examined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. Fig. 1(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples calcined at 700°C. All the samples exhibited IV-type isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of well-developed framework mesopores [32–34]. However, hysteresis loops of NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts appeared at high relative pressure compared to those of Al2O3 support and NiAl-IP catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1(b), pore size distributions of the samples were within the range of typical mesopore (2–50nm). Average pore size of the samples increased in the order of Al2O3 ≈NiAl-IP<NiAl-CP<NiAl-SP. Detailed physicochemical properties of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples calcined at 700°C are summarized in Table 1 . It is interesting to note that all the precipitation-involved samples (Al2O3, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP) showed high surface area (>228m2/g), large pore volume (>0.33cm3/g), and large average pore size (>4.3nm) compared to the impregnation-involved NiAl-IP catalyst. Surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl-SP>NiAl-CP>NiAl-IP. Among the catalysts examined, NiAl-IP catalyst exhibited the lowest surface area, the smallest pore volume, and the smallest average pore size, although Ni/Al atomic ratios in all the catalysts were nearly identical. This result indicates that mesopores of Al2O3 support were significantly blocked by the nickel species during the impregnation process, in good agreement with the previous results [35,36]. Thus, physicochemical properties of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were strongly influenced by the preparation method."
7,Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of calcined Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Al2O3, NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP samples calcined at 700°C. It was found that Al2O3 exhibited typical diffraction peaks corresponding to γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10-0425). NiAl-IP catalyst showed the diffraction peaks of nickel oxide (JCPDS 44-1159, solid lines in Fig. 2). This means that some nickel species were significantly aggregated during the high temperature calcination process through the reduction of textural properties of NiAl-IP catalyst (Fig. 1 and Table 1). However, no characteristic diffraction peaks indicating nickel oxides were observed in both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts. This result indicates that nickel species in both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts were finely dispersed on the surface of alumina support. A close examination of Fig. 2 revealed that (440) diffraction peak of Al2O3 (dashed line in Fig. 2) shifted to low diffraction angle in all the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Lattice parameters of Al2O3 support and NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts calculated from XRD peaks are listed in Table 2 . Lattice parameter of all catalysts was larger than that of Al2O3 (=0.790), indicating the formation of nickel aluminate phase in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts [37,38]. This is because nickel ions were readily incorporated into the lattice of alumina during the impregnation, co-precipitation, and sequential precipitation processes followed by high temperature calcination."
8,Crystalline structure of reduced Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.3 Crystalline structure of reduced Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of reduced NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts. For comparison, XRD pattern of Al2O3 is also presented in Fig. 3. Crystalline structure of reduced catalysts was quite different depending on the preparation method even though all the reduced catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel (JCPDS 04-0805). It was observed that (440) diffraction peak of Al2O3 (dashed line Fig. 3) moved back to the original diffraction angle in the NiAl-IP and NiAl-SP catalysts. As listed in Table 2, lattice parameter of reduced NiAl-IP and NiAl-SP catalysts was almost identical to that of Al2O3. In case of NiAl-CP catalyst, however, (440) diffraction peak of Al2O3 still appeared at slightly low diffraction angle, resulting in large lattice parameter of Al2O3 in the NiAl-CP catalyst (=0.797). This result implies that considerable amount of nickel aluminate in the NiAl-CP catalyst was not completely reduced during the reduction process. It can be inferred that interaction between nickel species and alumina support in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts would be different depending on the preparation method."
9,Metal-support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.4 Metal-support interaction in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the interaction between nickel species and support in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. TPR profiles of supported nickel catalysts are strongly affected by the nature of metal-support interaction [39,40]. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts calcined at 700°C. NiAl-IP catalyst exhibited three reduction peaks at 500, 590, and 770°C. Reduction band at 500°C is due to the reduction of bulk nickel oxide, while reduction band appearing at 590°C is associated with the reduction of nickel oxide interacted with alumina. On the other hand, reduction band at 770°C is attributed to the reduction of nickel aluminate phase. Both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts showed single reduction band at around 800°C, indicating the existence of nickel aluminate phase. It was found that reduction peak temperatures corresponding to nickel aluminate phase decreased in the order of NiAl-CP (825°C)>NiAl-SP (808°C)>NiAl-IP (770°C). This indicates that interaction between nickel species and alumina decreased in the order of NiAl-CP>NiAl-SP>NiAl-IP. Although considerable amount of nickel species in the NiAl-CP catalyst was not reduced even after the high temperature reduction process (Fig. 3), reduction peak temperature of NiAl-CP catalyst was only a little higher than that of NiAl-IP and NiAl-SP catalysts. This may be explained by the fact that two different types of nickel aluminate phase called ‘bulk nickel aluminate’ and ‘surface nickel aluminate’ can exist in the nickel catalyst supported on alumina [29,41,42]. It is known that surface nickel aluminate is readily reduced at around 800°C, while bulk nickel aluminate is difficult to be reduced [29,41,42]. Therefore, it is believed that NiAl-CP catalyst retained both surface nickel aluminate phase and bulk nickel aluminate phase, while NiAl-IP and NiAl-SP catalysts retained surface nickel aluminate phase."
10,Nickel surface area and nickel dispersion in the reduced Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.5 Nickel surface area and nickel dispersion in the reduced Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts are listed in Table 3 . The amount of hydrogen uptake on the surface of reduced catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl-SP>NiAl-CP>NiAl-IP. As a result, nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the reduced catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl-SP>NiAl-CP>NiAl-IP. Among the catalysts examined, NiAl-SP catalyst exhibited the highest nickel dispersion and the highest nickel surface area. This may be due to the fact that surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of NiAl-SP catalyst are large enough to form fine nickel dispersion as a surface nickel aluminate phase (Table 1 and Fig. 4). In the NiAl-IP catalyst, nickel species were readily aggregated during the reduction process because they were weakly bound to alumina (Fig. 4), resulting in the lowest nickel dispersion and the lowest nickel surface area. In case of NiAl-CP catalyst, it is believed that nickel species in the bulk nickel aluminate phase did not provide active nickel sites for hydrogen chemisorption."
11,Steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.6 Steam reforming of LNG over Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 5 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen compositions in dry gas with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts at 600°C. Both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance, while NiAl-IP catalyst experienced a significant deactivation during the steam reforming reaction. The reasons for high catalytic performance of NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts can be explained by their favorable physicochemical properties. High surface area, large pore volume, large average pore size of NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts (Table 1) reduced the internal mass transfer resistance of reactant and product during the steam reforming reaction. It is interesting to note that catalytic performance of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 5) showed the same trend with the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area (Table 3). It is known that dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbon species on the surface of active nickel site is a rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [43]. Therefore, high catalytic performance can be obtained by enhancing the number of active nickel sites on the surface of reduced catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, NiAl-SP catalyst with the highest nickel dispersion and nickel surface area exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas."
12,Characterization of used Ni–Al2O3 catalysts,"3.7 Characterization of used Ni–Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of NiAl-IP, NiAl-CP, and NiAl-SP catalysts obtained after a 1000-min reaction at 600°C. Both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts retained metallic nickel species (solid lines in Fig. 6). This means that metallic nickel species retained their electronic state even after the steam reforming reaction due to the strong interaction between nickel species and alumina in both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts. In the NiAl-IP catalyst, however, considerable amount of metallic nickel species, which weakly interacted with alumina, was re-oxidized into nickel oxide species, leading to a loss of active nickel sites for steam reforming reaction (Fig. 5). It should be noted that NiAl-CP catalyst exhibited a strong diffraction peak for graphitic carbon. As listed in Table 4 , the amount of carbon deposition in the NiAl-CP was extremely higher than that in the NiAl-IP and NiAl-SP catalysts. It is known that carbon deposition reaction requires relatively large number of adjacent active nickel sites compared to steam reforming reaction [43]. This means that steam reforming reaction can be preferentially enhanced by increasing nickel dispersion. Therefore, it can be inferred that NiAl-SP catalyst with the highest nickel dispersion exhibited strong resistance toward carbon deposition through an acceleration of gasification reaction between adsorbed intermediate carbon species and adsorbed steam (–OH2) or hydroxyl molecules (–OH). Although considerable amount of carbon species did not significantly affect the catalytic performance of NiAl-CP catalyst during a 1000-min reaction (Fig. 5), carbon species may gradually cause the blocking of active nickel sites during the long-term steam reforming reaction. Among the catalysts tested, it is concluded NiAl-SP catalyst prepared by a sequential precipitation method served as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG."
13,Conclusions,"Mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method (NiAl-IP), co-precipitation method (NiAl-CP), and sequential precipitation method (NiAl-SP) for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The effect of preparation method of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts on their catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated. Surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl-SP>NiAl-CP>NiAl-IP. Nickel species were strongly bound to Ni–Al2O3 catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase. All the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts retained reducible surface nickel aluminate phase, while NiAl-CP catalyst also retained non-reducible bulk nickel aluminate phase. Nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts decreased in the order of NiAl-SP>NiAl-CP>NiAl-IP. In the steam reforming reaction, both NiAl-CP and NiAl-SP catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance, while NiAl-IP catalyst experienced a significant deactivation in the steam reforming reaction. Among the catalysts tested, NiAl-SP catalyst with the highest nickel surface area showed the best catalytic performance. NiAl-SP catalyst also exhibited strong resistance toward carbon deposition."
