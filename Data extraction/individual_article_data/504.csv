0,Introduction,"According to a report of the World Health Organization on alcohol and health in 2018, more than 3 million people die of alcohol abuse each year in the world. In America, more than 15 million adults and 600 thousand adolescents suffer from alcohol use disorder with rising numbers (Liu et al., 2020). Excessive alcohol intake is the leading cause of alcohol-related diseases, such as gastric ulcers, gastric bleeding, alcoholic hepatitis, and liver cirrhosis (Shin, Kaiser, & West, 2020). As an organic solvent, alcohol is highly corrosive to the gastric mucosa, quickly destroys the mucous layer and mucous cells on the gastric surface, and affects the physiological environment of the healthy metabolism gastric mucosa. However, the mechanism of gastric mucosal damage caused by alcohol has not been fully elucidated. A large number of studies have shown that the process of alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause gastric tissue damage, decrease in antioxidant capacity, and the aggravation of inflammation (Simoes et al., 2019). Therefore, some antioxidant factors such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6, gastric mucosal defense factors such as PGE2 and NO play essential roles in regulating alcohol-induced gastric mucosal lesions (Chen et al., 2017). Some studies have focused on using compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities to alleviate the damage of alcohol-induced gastric mucosal, but only a few studies have used mucosal preparations for treatment. Wang, Zhu, Jiang, Wang, and Cui (2015) found that the mucoadhesive microspheres containing alkaloids could not only increase the residence time of alkaloids in the stomach of rats but also play a role in gastric protection by reducing the inflammatory response of alcohol-induced gastric mucosal lesion. Chitosan (CS), the deacetylation product of chitin, is a polycationic polysaccharide of natural origin. Because of its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity, it has been extensively applied in many fields, such as food, medicine, agriculture, and cosmetics (Rasul et al., 2020). Alginate (ALG) is a natural anionic polysaccharide derived from marine brown algae. Due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, water absorption, and chelating ability, it is widely used in biomedical fields, such as wound healing, hemostasis, drug delivery, and tissue engineering (Zhang & Zhao, 2020). The protonated amino group at the C2 position of chitosan easily interacts with polyanionic alginate by electrostatic interactions to form a polyelectrolyte complex, which has the excellent swelling capacity, bio-adhesion, and drug release performance. The CS/ALG-based hydrogels have been readily utilized in wound healing by holding blood rapidly, promoting tissue regeneration, and exhibiting specific performance (Hu & Xu, 2020). Tilapia collagen peptide (TCP) is derived from the tilapia tissues such as the skin, bone, and scale by chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. Compared with marine collagen, TCP has lower molecular weights resulting in easily being absorbed and strong water affinities. TCP has high potential nutraceutical and medicinal values because of their broad spectra of bioactivities such as antihypertensive (Lin, Alashi, Aluko, Sun Pan, & Chang, 2017), antioxidant (Fan, He, Zhuang, & Sun, 2012), antimicrobial (Pan, Tsai, Su, Hui, & Chen, 2017), and wound healing (Ouyang et al., 2018). However, due to the enzyme barrier, diffusion barrier, and absorption barrier of oral administration, its bioavailability is low (Harnedy & FitzGerald, 2012), and few works have used it for the treatment of the gastrointestinal injury. However, studies have shown that bio-adhesive polymer-carriers may be a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles (Han, Gao, & Sun, 2019). In this study, thiol-functionalized chitosan encapsulated nano-CaCO3 was dispersed in alginate solution to construct hydrogel precursors. In the presence of gastric acid, the hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in situ formed, swelled, and adhered to the gastric mucosa to form a protective barrier and released active peptides to reduce oxidation and inflammation, thereby exerting the protection effects against alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CS (Mw = 100 kDa, deacetylation ≥ 90%), ALG (Mw = 350 kDa, G/M ratio = 1/2, viscosity = 300–500 mPa·s), and nano-CaCO3 (70–100 nm) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; TCP was produced from the skin of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by composite enzymatic hydrolysis in our laboratory, and its molecular weight distribution and amino acid composition were shown in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The assay kits for malondialdehyde (MDA, A003-1-2), SOD (A001-3-2), CAT (A007-1-1), GSH (A006-2-1), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, H099-1), nitric oxide (NO, A013-2-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO, A044-1-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, H052-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, H002), interleukin-6 (IL-6, H007-1-2), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, A083-2-1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, A075-1-1) were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute of China and used according to the instructions. All other chemical agents were analytical grade and used directly without further treatment unless otherwise specified."
3,Preparation of gastric acid-response hydrogels,"2.2 Preparation of gastric acid-response hydrogels The preparation of N-acetylcysteine grafted chitosan (CS-NAC) was conducted according to the previous literature and modified slightly. Briefly, CS (0.50 g) was dispersed in deionized water (50 mL), and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBt, 0.35 g, 2.58 mmol) was added under magnetic stirring, and the solution was continuously stirred until the solution was clear. Subsequently, NAC (0.84 g, 5.16 mmol) and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC·HCl, 0.20 g, 10.32 mmol) were added. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 5 and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dialyzed in 1 mM HCl solution (containing 2 mM EDTA) for 3 days at 4 °C in the dark and then freeze-dried. The white samples of CS-NAC were obtained. In order to obtain a stable hydrogel triggered by gastric juice, the conditions were determined by investigating the physical form of the hydrogel precursor solution when it encountered the simulated gastric fluid. Simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) was prepared by referencing in a Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP, 2015) that HCl (3.84 mL) and pepsin (800–2500 U/mg, 10 g) were added into 800 mL distilled water, mixed well, and transferred into a volumetric flask to make the volume to be 1 L. The results in Table S3 showed that the optimal conditions for preparation of gastric acid-response hydrogels were SA concentration of 1%, MCS-NAC/MCaCO3 of 1:1, and MSA/MCS-NAC (CaCO3) of 15:1. It was obviously found that the hydrogel precursor solution under other conditions could not form an ideal hydrogel, which affected the encapsulation efficiency of TCP and treatment efficacy. CS-NAC solution (0.10 g/mL) was prepared by magnetic stirring after CS-NAC (1.00 g) dissolved in distilled water (10 mL). At 4 °C, the nano-CaCO3 suspension solution (0.10 g/mL) was dropwise added to the CS-NAC solution. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate was freeze-dried to obtain CS-NAC encapsulated nano-CaCO3 [CS-NAC (CaCO3)]. By high-speed mechanical stirring (3000 rpm) for 20 min and ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, 0.10 g of CS-NAC (CaCO3) was uniformly dispersed in the ALG solution (15 mL, 1%) to obtain the precursor solution of the hydrogel. When SGF was added, and the hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG in situ formed. TCP (4.00 g) was added into the hydrogel precursor solution by ultrasonic dispersion and blending, the in situ-forming hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP was obtained."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) The samples were prepared by KBr pellet and scanned by infrared spectroscopy (spectrum100, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, US). The wavenumber ranged from 4000 to 400 cm−1, and the resolution was 4 cm−1. 2.3.2 Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) The samples were treated with CD3COOD and D2O and determined by a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker Avance 400, Ultrashield). 2.3.3 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) The samples were sprayed with gold and scanned by the scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800). 2.3.4 Size and zeta potential The size of CaCO3 and CS-NAC (CaCO3), and zeta potential of CaCO3, CS-NAC, CS-NAC (CaCO3) and CS-NAC (CaCO3)/ALG were analyzed by dynamic light scattering through a laser particle size analyzer (Zetasizernano ZS90, Malvern, UK). The sample solution of CaCO3 and CS-NAC (CaCO3) was prepared for the 10-fold dilution with absolute ethanol while CS-NAC and CS-NAC(CaCO3)/ALG prepared for the 10-fold dilution with filtered purified water."
5,Rheological analysis,"2.4 Rheological analysis Rheology was performed according to the previous methods to characterize the viscoelasticity and viscosity of hydrogels. Samples were tested by a rheometer (DHR-2, USA) for dynamic viscosity in the linear viscoelastic region and modulus tests (frequency sweep and amplitude sweep) and recorded the elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″)."
6,Mucoadhesion determination,"2.5 Mucoadhesion determination The mucoadhesion of hydrogel was used to evaluate the adhesion of hydrogel to the gastric mucosa. The concentration of free mucin was measured by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) colorimetry. The appropriate amount of sample was put into the test tube, and 0.2 mL of periodate reagent was added and kept in the 37 °C water bath for 2 h; 0.2 mL of Schiff reagent was added, mixed well, and placed at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the absorbance was determined at 555 nm with the tube without mucin as the control. The standard curve of mucin was made, and the mucin content in the supernatant was calculated by reference to the above standard calibration curve."
7,Release property of TCP in vitro,"2.6 Release property of TCP in vitro The in vitro release of TCP from hydrogel was investigated according to the literature with slight modification. The hydrogel precursor solution of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP (5 mL) was added into SGF (5 mL) without pepsin to form a hydrogel, and then 20 mL of SGF without pepsin was added. The mixture was placed in an oscillator with a speed of 60 rpm at 37 °C (±0.5 °C). At the appropriate time interval, 1 mL of sample solution was collected and replaced with 1 mL of SGF without pepsin to maintain the same volume. The collected sample solution was filtered to remove the hydrogel fragments, diluted with distilled water, and measured. The amount of TCP released from the hydrogel was calculated by UV spectrophotometry. Simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) was prepared according to a Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP, 2015). 6.8 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) was added to distilled water and sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M) was used to adjusted pH to 6.8, pancreatin (10 g/L) was added and the total volume of solution was made to be 1 L. The release of TCP in SIF without pancreatin was similar to the above in SGF."
8,In vitro degradation determination,"2.7 In vitro degradation determination The degradation property of the hydrogel in vitro was investigated by means of weight loss under the simulated physiological conditions. The weighed hydrogel (m 0) was placed in a beaker containing 20 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 0.01% (w/w) lysozyme at a pH of 7.4 and shaken at 37 °C. Every 24 h, the PBS solution was replaced by a new one. During the specified time interval, the hydrogel was carefully removed, freeze-dried, and weighed (m t ). The mass percentage of hydrogel was calculated as follows: Mass percentage % = m 0 − m t m 0 × 100 % where m 0 and m t are hydrogel masses (g) before and after soaking in the simulated physiological solution, respectively. The degradation performance of the hydrogel in SGF and SIF were also performed and the protocol was the same as the above in the simulated physiological conditions."
9,Animal experiments,"2.8 Animal experiments 2.8.1 Animals and grouping Male KM mice (SsPF grade), weighing 20–25 g, aged 4–5 weeks, were provided by Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Foshan, China). The mice were reared in a room with controllable temperature and humidity (22–23 °C and 46–63%, respectively) and were allowed ad libitum access to drinking water and chow. After one week of acclimation, the mice were randomly grouped. For the hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP, CS-NAC and ALG were used as the matrix materials to construct an interpenetrating network skeleton, and the nano-CaCO3 was used as an excipient to release Ca2+ to solidify the CS-NAC/ALG, which encapsulated TCP with an activity of wound healing. To investigate the protection effects of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP on alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury in mice, six groups (16 mice per group) were set up for comparative analysis: normal, model, positive (Omeprazole, a commercial product), TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP. The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and ethical standards set by the ethics committee of Guangdong Medical University (SYXK (YUE) 20150147). 2.8.2 Alcohol-induced acute gastric injury in mice In animal experiments, according to the excellent practice dose volumes (10 mL/kg) and the maximal values (50 mL/kg) collected by Karl-Heinz Diehl (Diehl et al., 2001), we conducted preliminary experiments to adopt the optimal dose. The mice were gavaged with CS-NAC/ALG/TCP (10, 20, 30, 40 mL/kg), and then their food intake, defecation and death were observed regularly. The results showed that mice gavaged with CS-NAC/ALG/TCP (≥20 mL/kg) were abnormal, and their food intake and defecation volumes were decreased. It may be because CS-NAC/ALG/TCP absorbed a large amount of water in the stomach, and at the same time, it swelled and stayed in the stomach and was challenging to be emptied, causing the animals to suffer from bloating, anorexia, and lack of water. Therefore, the dose of 10 mL/kg was selected as the optimal gavage dose. The mice were gavaged with the tested substance (CS-NAC/SA, TCP, CS-NAC/SA/TCP, Omeprazole) at a single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight (BW), and the normal and model groups received an identical amount of distilled water. This gavage was once a day for seven consecutive days. On the sixth day, the mice fasted with free access to water. On the seventh day, after giving the tested substance, the mice were given Red Star Liquor (56% alcohol, v/v) at a dose of 13 mL/kg·BW to induce gastric mucosal injury, and the normal group was given an equal volume of distilled water. Two hours later, the mice were sacrificed, and the stomachs were collected for further analysis. 2.8.3 Alcohol-induced chronic gastric injury in mice The mice were gavaged with Red Star Liquor (56% alcohol, v/v) according to the gradient concentration (2 mL/kg·BW to 4 mL/kg·BW), and the normal group was given the corresponding volume of distilled water. The dosage of alcohol was adjusted according to the weight and mortality of mice per week. After alcohol administration for 1 h, the mice were given the tested substance (CS-NAC/SA, TCP, CS-NAC/SA/TCP, Omeprazole) at a dose of 10 mg/kg·BW and the normal group was given the distilled water. According to the above method, the mice were gavage once a day for eight weeks. The survival curve and weekly weight changes of the mice were recorded to feedback the health status of the mice. At the last gavage, the mice were fasted for 12 h with free access to water and were sacrificed. The stomachs of mice were collected for further analysis. 2.8.4 Macroscopic assessment The macroscopic morphology of gastric mucosal was observed, including gastric tissue integrity, surface smoothness, color, bleeding, erosion, and other abnormal conditions. After taking pictures of gastric tissue, the injured area of gastric mucosa was counted by Image-Pro Plus software that the bright red area was counted as the damaged one, and the injury area percentage of gastric mucosa was calculated as follows. Injury area percentage % = Area gastric injury Area gastric tissue × 100 % 2.8.5 Histopathological evaluations The gastric tissues were fixed with formalin solution (4%) and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under a light microscope. The scoring criteria for histological characteristics were as follows: (1) hemorrhage (blue arrow): 0–4 scores; (2) mucosal edema (red star): 0–4 scores; (3) epithelial cell loss (black arrow): 0–3 scores; and (4) inflammatory cell infiltration (yellow arrow): 0–3 scores. 2.8.6 Determination of MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH levels The gastric tissues were cut into small pieces, mixed with cold normal saline (1:9), and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C for use. The levels of MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH in stomachs were determined by using commercially available kits according to the instruction manuals. 2.8.7 Determination of cytokines in gastric tissues An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader was used to determine the levels of cytokines in gastric tissues, such as MPO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. The procedures of kits were performed according to the specifications of the manufacturers. 2.8.8 Determination of regulatory mediators in gastric tissues The regulatory mediators in gastric tissue such as PGE2 and NO were investigated. The ELISA kits were used to measure their levels in the homogenate of the gastric tissues. 2.8.9 Determination of ALD and ALDH activities A 10% liver homogenate preparation was obtained by mixing 1.00 g liver tissue with 9 mL ice normal saline on ice by cryomill (JXFSTPRP-CL, Shanghai, China) and centrifuging at 4000 rpm/min for 10 min. Liver tissue activities of ADH and ALDH were determined according to the instructions of ADH and ALDH kits."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis The data were processed by IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software, and the data expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Students' t-tests, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Preparation of gastric acid-response hydrogels,"3.1 Preparation of gastric acid-response hydrogels The preparation process of the gastric acid-response hydrogels was shown in Fig. 1A. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of CS, thiol functionalization of CS was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1B(a), the primary amino group on CS reacted with the carboxyl group of NAC to obtain CS-NAC via amide bond formation mediated by EDAC. Through adhesion and electrostatic interaction, CS-NAC could encapsulate nano-CaCO3 to yield CS-NAC (CaCO3) shown in Fig. 1B(b). Subsequently, a polyelectrolyte complexing hydrogel precursor was prepared by uniformly dispersing CS-NAC (CaCO3) into alginate solution (Hu, Wang, Zhang, & Xu, 2020). Once gastric acid was injected into the precursor solution, CS-NAC and ALG penetrated each other and in situ formed a three-dimensional hydrogel (CS-NAC/ALG) (Fig. 1B(c)). During CS-NAC dissolution, gastric acid gradually contacted and decomposed CaCO3 to release Ca2+, a classic egg-box crosslinking of calcium alginate was produced to form uniform hydrogel (Porter et al., 2021) which further enhanced the mechanical strength of the hydrogel. When TCP was added to the precursor solution, the gastric acid-response hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP would be obtained. In CS-NAC/ALG/TCP, CS-NAC and ALG are used as the matrix material of the hydrogel, and the nano-CaCO3 is used as an excipient to release Ca2+ to solidify the CS-NAC/ALG, which is a carrier. It can completely encapsulate TCP and release it continues to play the role of wound repair. Besides, CS-NAC also has the effects of hemostasis, antibacterial, and wound repair."
13,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations Fig. 2A showed the FTIR spectra of CS and CS-NAC. From the spectrum of CS, the broad absorption band at 3100–3500 cm−1 was the overlapped peaks which were attributed to the stretching vibrations of NH and OH. The peaks about 2900 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of CH on the CS chain. It could be observed that three characteristic absorption peaks of the amide group appeared at 1650 cm−1 (amide I, CO), 1590 cm−1 (amide II, NH), and 1370 cm−1 (amide III, CN). Compared with the CS spectrum, the infrared spectrum of CS-NAC showed a shifted peak at 3450 cm−1, indicating that the introduction of the sulfhydryl group weakened the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of CS. A new absorption peak at 2506 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of SH (Huang, Huang, Shen, & Shuai, 2020), confirming the successful sulfhydryl functionalization of CS. To further confirm the structure of sulfhydryl functionalization, 1H NMR spectra of CS and CS-NAC were performed. The spectrum of CS showed that a peak at 1.80 ppm corresponded to –CH3 of acetylated residues. The peaks at 3.16 ppm (H2), 3.55–3.95 ppm (H3–H6), and 4.70 ppm (H1) were observed, corresponding to the protons of chitosan pyran rings, which were consistent with the previous reports (Zhang et al., 2019). Compared with the CS spectrum, it could be found from the 1H NMR spectrum of CS-NAC (Fig. 2B) that the peak at 1.87 ppm was significantly enhanced, corresponding to the –CH3 present in both CS and CS-NAC entities. A new resonance at 2.80 ppm appeared, corresponding to the –CH2S– of NAC. According to the proton integral area ratio of –CH2S– to H2, it can be calculated the substitution degree of CS-NAC was about 9%. Taken together with the results of FTIR, these findings confirmed that the introduction of NAC to CS was successful. CS-NAC is a kind of polycationic electrolyte that can interact with the negatively charged nano-CaCO3 on the surface to form a coating layer by electrostatic attraction (Mallakpour & Khadem, 2018). In order to prepare a uniform hydrogel with excellent properties, CS-NAC (CaCO3) was prepared. The characterized results were shown in Fig. 3 . It could be found from SEM that pure nano-CaCO3 particles were almost cube-shaped with precise edges and corners, while CS-NAC (CaCO3) particles were almost round and had smooth surfaces with no edges and corners, thereby indicating that a CS-NAC coating layer was formed successfully on CaCO3. From the results of FTIR, the characteristic absorption peaks of CaCO3 appeared at 1797 cm−1 (CO stretching vibration), 1455 cm−1 (CO stretching vibration), 875 cm-1, and 718 cm−1 (in-plane deformation vibration). By comparing the spectra of CS-NAC (CaCO3) with those of CS-NAC and CaCO3, it was almost wholly presented as the prominent peaks (1797, 1455, 875, and 718 cm−1) of CaCO3 in CS-NAC (CaCO3), and a few characteristic peaks (3450, 2348 and 1100 cm−1) of CS-NAC could also be slightly observed, suggesting a low amount of CS-NAC in CS-NAC (CaCO3). The formation of CS-NAC (CaCO3) should be ascribed to the adhesion of CS-NAC and the electrostatic interaction. However, the electrostatic interaction was too weak to be detected by FTIR. In order to further confirm the formation of the coating layer and the occurrence of electrostatic interaction, we conducted the measurement of the particle size and zeta potential by using a Z-analyzer, and the results were given in Fig. 3C. As shown in Fig. 3C, the average diameter and zeta potential of CaCO3 were 158.7 ± 2.1 nm and −3.50 ± 0.52 mV, respectively. By coating CaCO3 with CS-NAC with a zeta potential of 21.31 ± 1.91 mV, the average diameter and zeta potential of CS-NAC (CaCO3) were 203.0 ± 6.8 nm and −3.09 ± 0.16 mV, respectively. When CS-NAC (CaCO3) was uniformly dispersed in ALG solution without H+, and its zeta potential became −22.13 ± 1.22 mV, indicating that ALG was located on the surface of CS-NAC (CaCO3), and may be useful for stabilization of the nanoparticles. Compared with CaCO3, both the average diameter and zeta potential of CS-NAC (CaCO3) were significantly increased (p < 0.01), which further suggested that a layer of CS-NAC was formed on the surface of CaCO3. Since CS-NAC was a polycationic polymer containing protonated amino groups (Al-Jbour, Beg, Gimbun, & Alam, 2019), the positively charged CS-NAC coated onto negatively charged CaCO3 particles through electrostatic interaction, thereby forming a thin layer at the interface. Therefore, the result of electrostatic interaction can reasonably explain the increase in particle size and zeta potential of CS-NAC (CaCO3). The characterized results of the hydrogels were presented in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4A showed the FTIR spectra of ALG, CS-NAC, CS-NAC/ALG, TCP, and CS-NAC/ALG /TCP. In the spectrum of ALG, the absorption peaks at 1594 and 1405 cm−1 were attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group (–COO−), respectively. By comparing the spectrum of CS-NAC/ALG with ALG and CS-NAC, a broader and stronger stretching vibration of OH at 3500–3200 cm−1 was observed, indicating the enhanced hydrogen bonds (Guo, Zhao, Zhou, Chen, & Yu, 2019). The absorption peaks of CS-NAC at 1649 cm−1 and 1591 cm−1 disappeared in the hydrogel due to the protonation of –NH2 into –NH3 + (Fernandez & Ingber, 2012). The characteristic absorption peaks of –COO− shifted to 1597 cm−1 and 1407 cm−1, respectively, suggesting that the physical crosslinking have occurred, including the ionic cross-linking of alginate with Ca2+ and the electrostatic interaction between COO− and NH3 +. From the infrared spectrum of TCP, the characteristic amide A and B bands of TCP were observed at 3300 and 3079 cm−1, respectively. The characteristic absorption peaks at 1650, 1534, and 1246 cm−1 were assigned to amide I, II, and III bands of peptides, respectively (Yang, Wu, Yi, & Wang, 2016). Compared with CS-NAC/ALG, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exhibited additionally the prominent characteristic absorption peaks of TCP at 3300 and 3079 cm−1, which indicated that TCP had been successfully encapsulated into the hydrogel. The microscopic morphology of the freeze-dried hydrogel samples was observed by SEM, and the images of CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP at the same magnifications were displayed in Fig. 4B. It was observed that two hydrogels had a porous structure with various pore sizes. By comparing CS-NAC/ALG/TCP with CS-NAC/ALG, it could be found that the introduction of TCP into the hydrogel did not make a difference in the hydrogel structure of uniform porosity. The porous spatial network was conducive to swelling and forming a thick barrier outside the gastric mucosa to prevent alcohol stimulation (Thakur, Govender, Mamo, Tamulevicius, & Thakur, 2017). In addition, it was favorable to the release of TCP for wound healing (Zhang et al., 2021)."
14,Rheology and mucoadhesion properties of hydrogels,"3.3 Rheology and mucoadhesion properties of hydrogels The rheological properties of the hydrogel samples were determined using three different methods. In Fig. 5(A) and (B), the storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G″) were described as functions of strain and angular frequency for hydrogels. As the independent variable changes, the curve intersected point of G′ and G″ was the critical point, indicating a sol-gel transition (Zhang et al., 2021). From the results of strain amplitude sweep shown in Fig. 5A, it was clearly found that the G′ curves of CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP intersected with the G″ ones at about 250% and 300% strain, respectively. The critical strain point of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP was higher than that of CS-NAC/ALG, which suggested that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP could withstand more significant deformation than CS-NAC/ALG. It was speculated that the introduction of TCP into the hydrogel produced more intermolecular non-covalent bonds. Gastrointestinal motility plays an essential role in the consumption of foods, digestion, and absorption of nutrients (Miron & Dumitrascu, 2019). Therefore, the excellent mechanical properties of a hydrogel can prolong its lifespan in the practical application for gastric mucosa protection. As shown in Fig. 5(B), in the angular frequency range, the hydrogels showed the specific rheological properties, and the storage modulus (G′) was higher than the corresponding loss modulus (G″) (Tang et al., 2020). Generally, the storage modulus was considered as a parameter indicating the strength of a hydrogel. Compared to CS-NAC/ALG, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exhibited higher G′ values, indicating that the introduction of TCP could strengthen the CS-NAC/ALG/Ca2+ network and was beneficial to protect the gastric mucosa. Fig. 5(C) showed the viscosity of the hydrogel versus the shear rate. In general, the shear viscosity of the CS-NAC/ALG/TCP was similar to that of CS-NAC/ALG. With the increase of shear rates, the apparent viscosity of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP and CS-NAC/ALG showed a linear downward trend, which might be due to the fact that the intertwined chain segments of CS-NAC and ALG were dissolved under the action of shearing force (Moeinzadeh, Park, Lin, & Yang, 2021). The hydrogel adheres to the gastric mucosa surface to better protect the gastric mucosa from the injury induced by alcohol. The mucoadhesion of the hydrogel samples was investigated by binding to mucin in SGF in vitro, and the results were displayed in Fig. 5(D). CS/ALG could bind to mucin, and the amount of mucoadhesion was 50.81 ± 3.43%, which could be plausibly explained that the amine group of CS was protonated and positively charged in SGF, thereby electrostatically interacting with the negatively charged mucus glycoproteins (Tawroong Chivangkul, Panuwat, Krisana, Sehanat, & Nongnuj, 2014). Compared to CS/ALG, CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exhibited significantly enhanced capacities of binding mucin (p < 0.01). The strong mucoadhesion of CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP should be due to the formation of SS and the enhanced electrostatic interactions between mucus and the hydrogels (Du et al., 2020). In addition, the hydrophilic groups in the hydrogels, such as hydroxyl and amino groups, can form hydrogen bonds with sialic acid in the mucin molecule to enhance the adhesion (Dhaliwal, Jain, Singh, & Tiwary, 2008). In comparison, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP had no significant difference in mucoadhesion compared to CS-NAC/ALG, which demonstrated that the introduction of TCP into the hydrogel had little effect on the mucoadhesion. Therefore, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP could adhere well to the gastric mucosa by virtue of its good mucoadhesion to form a barrier, thus exerting the protective effects on alcohol-induced mucosal damages."
15,TCP release and degradation of hydrogels in vitro,"3.4 TCP release and degradation of hydrogels in vitro Due to its three-dimensional porous structure, the polymer-based hydrogel has the function of carrying and delivering biologically active molecules, cells, or drugs (Xu, Yao, Fan, Zhou, & Wei, 2021). Fig. 6A showed the cumulative release of TCP from the hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in SGF (pH 1.2) and SIF (pH 6.8). In the first 15 min, 36.82% and 36.53% of TCP was burst released from the hydrogel in SGF and SIF, respectively. Subsequently, there was a rapid release between 15 and 60 min. After that, the release in SGF and SIF was still sustained and reached 95.20% and 98.39% after 6 h, respectively. These results demonstrated that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP was capable of TCP controlled delivery and had an excellent sustained-release performance in SGF and SIF, especially in SGF. At the initial stage of release, the sudden release was obvious, which should be the dissolution of TCP adsorbed on the surface of hydrogel. And then rapid release was followed, which may be due to the high porosity of the hydrogel and TCP's small molecular weights that can increase the diffusion coefficient of TCP (Wang et al., 2018). With the prolonged time, the hydrophilic gel layer of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP blocked the entry of water molecules, and the sustained-release of TCP was mainly attributed to the skeletal diffusion and gradual disintegration of the hydrogel. It can be supposed that the release kinetics of TCP from the hydrogel in vivo may be the result of the superposition of multiple effects, not necessarily based on a simple drug diffusion control (Acosta, Aranaz, Peniche, & Heras, 2003). In addition, the combination of CS and TCP could synergistically promote wound healing (Ouyang et al., 2018). However, due to the poor biological stability of TCP, it is vulnerable to microbial attack, resulting in the loss of bioactivities (Raftery et al., 2016). Therefore, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP can serve as a protective wall for TCP and exert a synergistic effect on the protection of alcohol-induced mucosal injury. The in vitro degradation of hydrogel samples was assessed by measuring the remaining weight of hydrogels. Fig. 6B and Fig. S1 showed the weight remaining profiles of hydrogels. As shown in Fig. 6B, in the simulated physiological solution (pH 7.4), it was clearly found that the hydrogels first expanded quickly and then gradually decomposed into small flocs. After degradation for 3 days, the remaining fragments of the hydrogel were almost invisible to the naked eye and the remaining fragment mass of the CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP were 28.22 ± 3.11% and 32.13 ± 2.62%, respectively. As for in SIF (pH 6.8), the remaining fragment mass of the CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in 3 days were 30.56 ± 1.89% and 34.09 ± 1.64%, respectively. By contrast, in SGF (pH 1.2), the remaining fragment mass of the CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in 3 days were 51.34 ± 1.70% and 60.49 ± 2.01%, respectively (Fig. S1). The rapid disintegration of the hydrogels was due to the electrostatic repulsion between the ionized carboxylate groups (Lin, Liang, Chung, Chen, & Sung, 2005), dehydration (Li et al., 2018), and decomposition. Particularly, the enzymatic degradation of lysozyme, a natural enzyme, was mainly manifested in the hydrolysis of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in chitosan (Cui et al., 2019). It could be found that the degradation rates of hydrogels in SGF were slower than those in SIF and simulated physiological conditions. The delayed degradation of the hydrogel and the concomitantly more sustained release of TCP in SGF indirectly reflected the protective effect of the hydrogel on TCP. Besides, a degradation comparison between CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP showed that the mass loss rate of CS-NAC/ALG was faster than that of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP, which indicated that the participation of TCP slowed down the degradation rate of the hydrogel, displaying the advantages of the composite CS-NAC/ALG/TCP."
16,Effects of hydrogels on gastric mucosa injury of mice,"3.5 Effects of hydrogels on gastric mucosa injury of mice Ethanol quickly penetrates into the gastric mucosa and affects the blood circulation in the mucosa by altering the levels of protective factors, which in turn leads to gastric injury, including gastritis, ulcers, perforations, and bleeding (Sowndhararajan & Kang, 2013). The visible results of alcohol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosal injury were shown in Fig. 7 . In the normal group, the gastric tissue of mice was intact with normal morphology, light red, and smooth mucosal surface, and no damage on the stomach was observed. In contrast, the model group showed extensive ulcer and edema. Mainly, severe bleeding injury and erosion were observed in the acute model group. The damaged areas of gastric mucosal in the acute and chronic injury were 28.06 ± 2.64% and 3.06 ± 0.15%, respectively, which were statistically significant compared to the normal group (p < 0.01). By comparing the positive group with the acute and chronic model groups, it could be found that the areas of gastric mucosal injury were obviously reduced with statistical differences (p < 0.01), but a small area of gastric mucosal bleeding was still observed. By treatment with TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP, there was slight gastric mucosa injury in mice, and the gastric mucosal damage areas in the acute injury were 10.03 ± 2.04%, 9.25 ± 0.38%, and 3.34 ± 0.71% respectively, and those in the chronic injury were 1.42 ± 0.06%, 1.2 ± 0.06%, and 0.66 ± 0.07% respectively, all of which were significantly different from those in the model group (p < 0.01). In particular, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP had excellent performance in the protection of alcohol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosal damage, and its recovery effect was close to the normal group. Due to the short residence time of drugs in the stomach, poor stability in gastric acid, or low permeability in the mucous layer, various oral drugs used to treat gastric ulcers, such as pills, tablets, and capsules, have been challenged (Wang et al., 2015). CS-NAC/ALG/TCP overcame those shortcomings and adhered to the gastric mucosa by virtue of its strong mucoadhesion to form a barrier, thereby preventing alcohol from irritating the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, it showed a sustained release of TCP and promoted mucosal wound healing. The morphology of gastric mucosa was further determined by histopathological HE staining. Meanwhile, the scores of histopathological characteristics were also assessed, and the results were shown in Fig. 8 . In the normal group, there was no damage to the gastric mucosa tissues. Whereas in the model group, it was clearly observed the alcohol-induced severe congestion, loss of epithelial cells, lamina propria erosion, necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration, which were the symptoms of the gastric ulcer (Bentley-Hewitt et al., 2020). The histologic scores of gastric mucosal in the acute and chronic model groups were 5.43 ± 0.46 and 4.08 ± 0.53, respectively, which were significantly different from those in the normal groups (p < 0.01). In the positive group, gastric mucosal damage was significantly attenuated, but a small amount of epithelial cell loss, bleeding, and inflammatory cell infiltration was still observed. In contrast, with TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP treatments, some mild damages were observed in the superficial epithelium of gastric mucosa and their histopathological scores of gastric mucosal in the acute and chronic experiments had significant differences compared to the model groups. Significantly, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP only showed a very shallow lesion in the gastric mucosa and had the lowest scores of histopathological characteristics. Mehanna et al. developed tadalafil-loaded limonene-based orodispersible tablets and achieved the dual gastric protection effect against alcohol-induced ulcers in the rat model (Mehanna, Mneimneh, Domiati, & Allam, 2020). In our previous work, we found that TCP could enhance the process of wound healing by reducing inflammation, promoting granulation tissue formation, and facilitating the rapid proliferation of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (Hu, Yang, Zhou, Li, & Hong, 2017; Ouyang et al., 2018). Elbialy et al. also demonstrated that TCP promoted the cutaneous wound healing process in rats due to its stimulating effect on recruiting and activating macrophages to produce chemotactic growth factors, fibroblast proliferation, and angiogenesis (Elbialy et al., 2020). Herein, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exhibited the synergistic effect of the antioxidant and wound healing activities of TCP and the barrier protective function of CS-NAC/ALG and had excellent prevention efficacy in alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury. In addition, in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of the material in vivo, the survival curve and body weight experiments were carried out. Survival curves of mice within 8 weeks were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and the results were shown in Fig. 1S(A). The findings indicated that TCP, CS-NAC/ALG and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP could improve the survival rate of mice in the process of long-term alcohol intake, especially the composite hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP had the most prominent effect, and its final survival rate was 1.5 times higher than that of the model group. And the results of the body weight change of mice were shown in Fig. 1S(B), compared to the model, the weight gain of mice in TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP groups increased significantly, especially in CS-NAC/ALG/TCP group, the weight curve was close to that of the normal group, suggesting that the composite hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP by combining TCP with CS-NAC/ALG had a synergistic protection effect against alcohol-induced injury and had the best performance."
17,Effects of hydrogels on antioxidant capacity,"3.6 Effects of hydrogels on antioxidant capacity Free radicals in the body attack the cellular target biomacromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and lipoproteins, leading to lipid peroxidation, thereby altering the composition of the cell membrane and aggravating the ulcerative and destructive damage to gastric tissues. SOD, GSH, and CAT can scavenge free radicals and reduce the oxidative stress status of gastric tissues (Katary & Salahuddin, 2017). MDA is the result of the ROS reaction, reflecting the severity of oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 9 , compared to the normal group, the model group significantly increased MDA levels and decreased the activities of SOD, GSH, and CAT in ethanol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosal injury, which suggested that ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury could trigger a severe state of oxidative stress. It could be due to the fact that excessive alcohol intake made the enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant defense systems in the body unbalanced and could not eliminate excessive free radicals. Treatment with the positive drug, TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP reduced the MDA levels and increased the activities of SOD, GSH, and CAT to varying degrees. In terms of the TCP group, it showed lower MDA levels and higher SOD, GSH, and CAT activities with respect to CS-NAC/ALG in acute and chronic gastric injury, revealing excellent antioxidant activity, which was consistent with our previous reports (Li et al., 2019). However, neither TCP nor CS-NAC/ALG improved the oxidative stress status as much as CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in acute and chronic gastric injury. Thus, it could be speculated that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exerted a synergistic effect on antioxidant activity to prevent alcohol-induced gastric injury."
18,"Effect of hydrogel on myeloperoxidase, pro-inflammatory factor levels, and regulatory mediators","3.7 Effect of hydrogel on myeloperoxidase, pro-inflammatory factor levels, and regulatory mediators MPO is a kind of hemoprotein secreted by activated neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue macrophages, which is associated with inflammatory diseases (Ruiz et al., 2021). A complex inflammatory response occurs during wound healing, involving the interaction of multiple inflammatory cytokines (Liang et al., 2019). Mostly, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, play an essential role in gastric tissue injury. To evaluate the influence of hydrogels on alcohol-induced inflammation of gastric mucosa, the expression levels of myeloperoxidase and three pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were determined. As shown in Fig. 10 A, the expression of MPO in the model group was significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) compared with the normal group. Treatment with the positive drug significantly reduced the expression of MPO in alcohol-induced chronic gastric injury (p < 0.05) while had no significant effect on the acute injury. Compared to the model group, a significant decrease in the expression of MPO was observed in groups of TCP, CS-NAC/ALG (p < 0.05), and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP (p < 0.01) in an alcohol-induced acute and chronic injury. Hamauzu, Kishida, and Yamazaki (2018) previously reported that Chinese quince jelly suppressed the MPO activity and exerted anti-inflammatory effects through the suppression of leukocyte migration. Therefore, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP might have anti-inflammatory activity by interfering with leukocyte migration. From Fig. 10B, C, and D, it could be found that the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels of the model groups in acute and chronic alcohol-induced gastric injury significantly increased (p < 0.01) compared to the normal group, which suggested that excessive alcohol intake could stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) to enhance the levels of inflammation (Wang et al., 2015). Similar to the expression level of MPO, the positive, TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in varying degrees compared to the model group. In particular, treatment with CS-NAC/ALG/TCP decreased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines to 740.82 ± 22.96 ng/L for TNF-α, 47.60 ± 1.36 ng/L for IL-1β, and 102.43 ± 2.60 pg/mL for IL-6 in acute gastric mucosal injury, and 650.01 ± 5.13 ng/L for TNF-α, 45.96 ± 1.21 ng/L for IL-1β, and 105.31 ± 1.78 pg/mL for IL-6 in chronic injury, all of which had significant differences compared to the model group (p < 0.01). The down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) was directly related to the alleviation of gastric mucosa injury in mice (Ruiz et al., 2021). CS-NAC/ALG/TCP showed the best anti-inflammatory efficacy, consistent with the histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa, which demonstrated that effective suppression of inflammation might be one of the mechanisms involved in the gastroprotective efficacy. PGE2 and NO, two critical defensive factors with cytoprotective effects in gastric mucosa, play an essential role in the regulation of gastric acid and mucus secretion, and their production is beneficial to the healing of the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesion. NO could inhibit leukocyte adhesion from weakening gastric mucosal lesions, preventing lipid peroxidation, and promoting the synthesis of PGE2 (Liu et al., 2017). PGE2 not only expanded blood vessels and increased mucosal blood flow but also increased the secretion of mucus and bicarbonate and formed a barrier that protected the epithelial cells of gastric mucosa from damage, thereby protecting the integrity of the gastric mucosa (Akanda & Park, 2017). The levels of PGE2 and NO were determined, and the results were shown in Fig. 10E and F. Compared with the normal group, when mice were gavaged with alcohol (model group), the PGE2 level was significantly decreased (p < 0.01), especially in alcohol-induced chronic gastric mucosa injury. In the positive group, the levels of PGE2 in alcohol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosa injury were significantly increased by 19.4% and 9.8% (p < 0.01) compared to the model group, which was in accordance with the previous study (El-Ashmawy, Khedr, El-Bahrawy, & Selim, 2016), indicating that one of the anti-gastric ulcer approaches of omeprazole was to up-regulate the expression of PGE2. By comparing to the model group, TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP increased the PGE2 levels significantly in alcohol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosa injury. It should be mentioned that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP exhibited in a superior manner to that of the positive. Similar to PGE2, the levels of NO showed an increase to varying degrees by treatment with the positive drug, TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP in alcohol-induced acute and chronic gastric mucosa injury. By contrast, in the chronic model of alcohol-induced injury, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP groups had the most significant increase in NO levels (p < 0.01) that was close to the normal group, which revealed the protection effect persistence of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP on alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury. Taken together, this finding showed that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP could significantly increase the production of PGE2 and NO in the alcohol-induced gastric mucosa injury. Xue et al. (2019) reported that Hedysarum polysaccharides could increase the levels of PGE2 and NO to promote gastric mucosal cell regeneration and protect the integrity of the gastric mucosa, thereby exerting gastric anti-ulcer effects. Therefore, we speculated that an increase in PGE2 and NO production might be involved in the gastric protective mechanism of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP against ethanol induced gastric injury."
19,Effect of hydrogel on the activities of ADH and ALDH,"3.8 Effect of hydrogel on the activities of ADH and ALDH ADH and ALDH are the main alcohol metabolic enzymes which metabolize about 90% of alcohol in the body. ADH catalyzes the conversion of alcohol into acetaldehyde. And then ALDH catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid, which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle system and is metabolized into water and carbon dioxide (Zheng et al., 2019). In vivo, ADH and ALDH activities can reflect the alcohol-metabolizing ability of hepatocytes. The results of ADH and ALDH activities in mouse liver tissue were shown in Fig. S2. Compared with the normal group, ADH and ALDH activities were significantly increased in the model group (p < 0.01), indicating that the liver had a normal metabolic function after the administration of alcohol. Compared with the model group, only ALDH activity significantly increased in the positive group (p < 0.01). In contrast, the activities of ADH and ALDH increased significantly in the TCP, CS-NAC/ALG, and CS-NAC/ALG/TCP groups (p < 0.01), showing that all the selected samples had significantly increased the activities of ADH and ALDH. Especially, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP had the best performance in improving the activities of ADH and ALDH (ADH 57.83 U/mg protein; and ALDH 17.58 U/mg protein). It was suggested that CS-NAC/ALG/TCP could increase the activities of ADH and ALDH in liver tissue to improve ethanol metabolism, thus exerting the protective effect of gastric mucosal injury."
20,Conclusions,"By encapsulating nano-CaCO3 with CS-NAC, the gastric acid-responsive in the situ-forming hydrogel of CS-NAC/ALG/TCP was successfully developed. It showed a sustained release of TCP, strong mucoadhesion, and excellent biodegradability in vitro. In the acute and chronic modes of mice, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP demonstrated superior protective effects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury by improving antioxidative status, suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing the gastroprotective factor production of PGE2 and NO, and increasing the activity of alcohol metabolism enzymes to improve alcohol metabolism. By contrast, in the chronic model of alcohol-induced injury, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP showed the protection effect persistence. Taking into account the above findings, CS-NAC/ALG/TCP has a promising development for treatment against alcohol-induced gastric injury."
