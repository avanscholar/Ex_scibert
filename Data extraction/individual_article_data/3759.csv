0,Introduction,"α,β-Unsaturated alcohols as main intermediates are widely applied in pharamaceutical, agrochemical and fragrance production [1–4]. Nowadays, α,β-unsaturated alcohols are mostly produced through α,β-unsaturated aldehyde reduced by the NaBH4 or AlLiH4 in industry. Although high yields of α,β-unsaturated alcohols could be obtained by such reduction, there are some serious drawbacks. First, the reaction conditions are difficult to be controlled. Second, the products are hard to be separated. Third, a large amount of environmental pollutants are generated and the modern industrial production requirements cannot be met. Selective catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes seems to be a suitable method to synthesize crotyl alcohol without use of toxic reductants. However, from thermodynamics perspective, the bond energy of CO (715kJmol−1) is greater than that of CC (615kJmol−1); and from kinetic perspective, the bond of CC bond rather than CO bond of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a preferential hydrogenation activity over most metal catalysts [5,6,7]. Therefore, the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with supported metal catalysts is still a challenge in heterogeneous catalysts [8]. To achieve a high selectivity, hydrogenation reactions are mostly carried on with supported group VIII metal catalysts. Numerous publications address that Pt [9], Ir [10], Au [11] and Ru [12–14] based catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. It is widely accepted that strong metal–support interface created by partially reduced support covering metal particles is beneficial to the activation of the CO bond. The reducible oxides, such as ZnO [15–17], TiO2 [18,19], CeO2 [20,21] or SnO2 [22,23] were tested as supports for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. Although these catalysts present a good selectivity to unsaturated alcohol, the activities are very low. Moreover, surface properties of supports are also crucial to the activities of the catalysts for selective hydrogenation. Last but not the least, catalyst deactivation is commonly observed for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde reaction [24], thus, the reason of deactivation is also worthy of investigation. In the present work, Ru/ZnO catalysts with different Ru contents were prepared and tested for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The effect of Ru content on the catalyst properties and consequently catalytic behaviors were investigated in detail, and the reason for the deactivation of catalysts was also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The support ZnO was prepared by homogeneous precipitation method. An 0.2M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.2M) was drop wise added into an 0.2M aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2M) at 60°C in water bath until the precipitation was completed, then the precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water, dried at 120°C for 12h and then calcined in air at 450°C for 2h. Finally ZnO with a surface area of 11m2 g−1 was obtained. The Ru/ZnO catalysts were prepared by impregnation of ZnO support with an aqueous solution of RuCl3 for 12h, with a nominal Ru content of x wt.% (x =0.5, 1, 3 and 5). Excess solution was removed by mild evaporation, and then the catalysts were dried at 120°C for 12h and calcined in air at 400°C for 2h. The catalysts were denoted as xRu/ZnO, where x refers to the weight percent of Ru (wt.%) in the catalyst."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations All the catalysts were reduced in ultra-pure H2 at 200°C for 1h before characterization as well as prior to the reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40kV and 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 20° to 80°, with a scanning step of 0.15°s−1. Elemental compositions of the reduced catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis on an ARLADVANT’X Intelli Power 4200 scanning X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The results were analyzed using UniQuant non-standard sample quantitative analysis software. Surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the modified BET method from the N2 adsorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195.7°C) on an NOVA 40000e Surface Area & Pore Size Analyzer. Before the measurement, the samples were out-gassed at 120°C for 4h under vacuum. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a JEM-2100F microscopy with a field emissive gun, operated at 200kV and with a point resolution of 0.24nm. The samples, previously reduced at 200°C, were suspended in ethanol. The dispersion was then immersed for 10min in an ultrasonic bath in order to disagglomerate the powder particles. Finally, one drop was placed on a formvar/carbon copper grid. Various regions of the grid were observed and the particle sizes were measured from the observation of 250–500 particles. CO chemisorption experiments were carried out on a Quantachrame CHEMBET-3000 instrument in order to determine the dispersion of Ru. The sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and a high-purity He (99.999%) gas flow of 70mlmin−1 was used as the carrier gas. Before CO chemisorption, the samples were reduced in a H2–N2 mixture (5vol% H2) stream at 200°C for 1h, cooled down to 30°C, and then cleaned up with a pure He gas flow for 1h at the same temperature. Then pulses of CO were fed into the stream of carrier gas with a precision analytical syringe. The acidic properties of the catalysts were researched by Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The experiment was conducted on a home-made apparatus. 50mg of catalyst was filled in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) prior to the measurement, and was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture at 200°C for 1h. Then it was cooled down to 50°C. A flow of NH3 was introduced for 30min. The gaseous or physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging Ar flow at 100°C for 90min. Then the sample was heated to 700°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. The total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid and back titration with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom-cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a VGESCALAB MK-2 spectrometer with Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The voltage and power for the measurements were 12.5kV and 250W, respectively. The spectra obtained, once the background was removed, were fitted to Lorentzian and Gaussian lines to obtain the number of components, peak position, and their areas. The adventitious C 1s line at 285.0eV was used as an internal standard. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurement was carried out in a quartz microreactor with 6mm inner diameter; 50mg of the used catalyst was placed in the middle of reactor. Using a O2 gas flow of 20mlmin−1 at rising temperature from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The outlet gas was analyzed on-line by mass spectrometry (Qic-20 Benchtop, Hiden Analytical). The mass numbers of 44 and 18 were selected to monitor desorption of CO2 and H2O, respectively. Raman spectra were collected by a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microprobe under ambient conditions. The excitation laser wave length was 514nm. The power of each laser line was kept about 3mW to prevent local heating effect and the resolution of the spectrometer was 1cm−1 with the diameter of the analyzed spot being ca. 1μm."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test Vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed in a fixed bed quartz tube (8mm i.d.) reactor at atmospheric pressure [25]. About 400mg of the catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before the catalyst performance test, the catalyst was reduced at 200°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow (99.999%, 20mlmin−1) and then it was cooled down to 120°C. Crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set maintained at 0°C before to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1062Pa), then crotonaldehyde at constant partial pressure was carried over the catalyst by hydrogen flow (26mlmin−1). The gas line was kept at about 110°C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) capillary column. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the catalysts were calculated as follows: TOF = Conversion crotonaldehyde × F crotonaldehyde Dispersion Ru × X Ru × 100 % where F crotonaldehyde refers to the amount of crotonaldehyde in the feed (mols−1) and X Ru refers to the content of Ru in the catalyst (mol)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition and phase of Ru/ZnO catalysts,"3.1 Composition and phase of Ru/ZnO catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ru/ZnO catalysts reduced at 200°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of the ZnO support are very strong, indicating that the support is well-crystallized. A weak diffraction peaks (2θ =44°) due to Ru [26] are observed when the Ru contents increase. Indicating the growth of Ru particles with increasing content. Table 1 lists specific surface area, Ru dispersion, particle size, the contents of Ru and Cl element in the catalysts. It is found that the Ru contents in all catalysts are close to the nominal values. And, the Cl content in the Ru/ZnO catalysts increases with Ru contents. The BET surface areas of the catalysts hardly change for the Ru/ZnO catalysts, ranging from about 8 to 11m2 g−1. The Ru particle sizes also increase with increasing Ru contents. Fig. 2 shows the representative TEM images of the ZnO and Ru/ZnO catalysts. Both the 0.5Ru/ZnO and 3Ru/ZnO catalysts were reduced at 200°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow. Based on these images, distribution of Ru particles is estimated. It is found that the Ru particles on the 0.5Ru/ZnO and 3Ru/ZnO catalysts are in the range of 15–20 and 70–80nm, respectively. Note that the Ru particle sizes determined by TEM are similar to that evaluated by CO chemisorption. The results are in good agreement with the CO chemisorption results, further confirming the growth of Ru particles with increasing Ru contents."
7,Surface acidity of the Ru/ZnO catalysts,"3.2 Surface acidity of the Ru/ZnO catalysts Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles and the amounts of acid sites of the ZnO support and Ru/ZnO catalysts. It can be seen that the ZnO support has a NH3 desorption peak (β) at around 425°C, suggesting that the ZnO support has surface acidic sites. With increasing Ru contents, the position of peak (β) shifts to lower temperature. This indicates that the strength of surface acid sites decreases as the Ru content increases. Meanwhile, when the content of Ru reaches to 3%, NH3 desorption peak (α) in low temperature area appears. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the amount of surface acid amount increases as the Ru contents increasing. When the content reaches to 5%, the amount of surface acid sites is the largest (1.94mmolg−1). From Table 1, it can be seen that the amount of surface acid sites shows a similar changing trend with the amount of chlorine element. Wang et al. [27] reported that the existence of chlorine atoms can improve ZrO2 surface acidity. Thus, it is proposed that the chlorine atom coming from the decomposition of the metallic precursor make catalyst surface acidity increase. And the extra surface acidity of our catalysts could be due to the generation of new compounds ZnO x Cl y , or Ru species not reduced to the metal state Ru completely, i.e. Ru n+ (RuCl x ) species in catalyst. Fig. 4 presents the XPS spectra of reduced Ru/ZnO catalysts. The largest peak in the spectra can be assigned to C 1s peak, which is instrument carbon pollution peak, since the peaks of Ru 3d3/2 cover the peaks of C 1s, only the peaks of Ru 3d5/2 are employed in the following discussion. The peaks in 279.9eV attributed to Ru0, 281.8eV corresponds to an electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+), these signals can be assigned to Ru in ruthenium chloride [28]. It indicated that not all Ru was reduced, there are both Ru and Ru n+ exist in catalyst."
8,Ru/ZnO catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.3 Ru/ZnO catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 5 shows the crotonaldehyde conversion and selectivities to hydrogenation products as a function of time on stream over the 3Ru/ZnO catalyst reduced at 200°C. The products are crotyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of carbonyl C=O bond), butanal (formed by hydrogenation of the CC bond), butanol (formed by hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds) and others (mainly C3 compounds formed by decarbonylation and C8 compounds formed by polymerization) [29]. As shown in the figure, the deactivation of catalyst is obvious, especially during the first 5h. The deactivation has been related to decarbonylation of the reactant molecule yielding carbon monoxide, which is strongly adsorbed on Ru surface and poison the catalysts during the reaction. Similar deactivation was also observed over Pt based catalysts and was attributed to the CO strongly adsorbed on surface Pt atoms [30,31]. In the quasi-steady state regime of the catalyst, a conversion of 9.0% is obtained after 30h reaction time. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases quickly during the first 1h and reaches a stable level (about 89%) afterwards. Table 2 summarizes the catalytic properties of the Ru/ZnO catalysts for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The deactivation rates of the catalysts were calculated according to the following: Deactivation rate = Conv . ( initial ) − Conv . ( steady ) Conv . ( initial ) × 100 % As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, the conversions of crotonaldehyde over Ru/ZnO catalysts decline with time on stream. This indicates that catalyst deactivation phenomenon exists. Meanwhile the catalysts with higher content of Ru deactivate faster than that with lower Ru content. As for the selectivities to crotyl alcohol, there are downward trend for 0.5Ru/ZnO and 1Ru/ZnO catalysts with time on stream. However, for 3Ru/ZnO and 5Ru/ZnO catalysts, the selectivities increase first and then keep stable. With increasing Ru contents, the conversion of crotonaldehyde, TOF values and deactivation rate increase. However, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol first increases and then decreases, and the highest selectivity is obtained on the 3Ru/ZnO catalyst. It is well known that the surface Lewis acidity plays an important role in the selectivity because these acid sites provide centers for the adsorption of crotonaldehyde via carbonyl oxygen, which is crucial for the formation of the desirable crotyl alcohol. However, too strong Lewis acid sites may be harmful for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol on 5Ru/ZnO is lower than that of 3Ru/ZnO, suggesting that large amount of chlorine at the catalyst surface would lead to a detrimental additional chlorination reaction and make the selectivity to crotyl alcohol decrease [32]. Fig. 6 shows the effects of particle sizes and surface acidic amount on TOF values of hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Ru/ZnO catalysts. It can be seen that TOF increases with particle size, which suggests that larger metal particles are benefit to hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Meanwhile, it is found that the surface acidic amount has a similar relationship with TOF, the larger amount of surface acidity will result in a higher catalytic activity. Many studies have shown that Lewis acid sites are beneficial to strengthen the interaction of catalyst with the CO bond of crotonaldehyde and therefore enhance the selectivity to crotyl alcohol [33]. Fig. 7 shows the effect of surface acidic amount on deactivation rate of Ru/ZnO catalysts. Although the increase of the surface acidic amount will lead to a higher catalytic activity, the deactivation rates of Ru/ZnO catalysts increase with the increase of surface acidic amount. This can be interpreted as that surface acidity center could be covered by carbon deposition during the reaction, which leads to the deactivation of catalysts. This result agrees with those reported catalysts for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, that is, the deactivation phenomena were assumed to occur as the formation of surface deposition, which block active catalyst sites [34]. In conjunction with the results shown in Fig. 6, it can be concluded that Lewis acid sites are beneficial to improve the initial TOF. However, too much Lewis acid sites make the deactivation of catalysts more easily. In order to further explain the reason for the deactivation of the catalysts, In situ CO poisoning experiment and TPO characterizations of the used Ru/ZnO catalysts were performed. CO poisoning experiment was carried out as follows: after the reduction of 3Ru/ZnO catalyst, 1.0ml CO was pulsed in the entrance of the reaction pipeline. From the result of poisoning experiment, it is found that the initial activity decreases from 79.5% to 55.5% after CO poisoning. This strongly suggests that the chemisorption of CO on the catalyst surface (most probably on Ru atoms) could drastically inhibit the activity. Similar findings were also obtained on other catalyst system such as Ir/ZrO2 in our previous work [35]. From the TPO profiles of the used 3Ru/ZnO catalyst (Fig. 8 ), it can be found that there are CO2 desorption peak and H2O desorption peak. Both of the two peaks are at 330°C, probably due to the oxidation of organic compounds. As for the Raman spectra (Fig. 9 ), we can see Raman vibrating peak at ca. 1600cm−1, the peak due to the carbon deposit peak [36], it indicates that there is carbon formation in the process of reaction. Therefore, it could be concluded that the general deactivation for the Ru/ZnO catalysts are due to the poison effect of CO adsorbed on the Ru atoms, deposition of organic compounds and carbon on the catalysts surface."
9,Conclusion,"The activity and selectivity to the primary products of crotyl alcohol in hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Ru/ZnO catalysts depend critically on the surface acidity and Ru particle sizes. With increasing Ru contents, the amount of surface acidity increased and then result in a higher initial conversion. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases first and then decreases with increasing the amount of surface acidity. The 3Ru/ZnO catalyst has the highest selectivity to crotyl alcohol (88.0%) and the activity (9.0%) after 30h of reaction time. The general deactivation for the Ru/ZnO catalyst is due to the deposition of organic compounds on the catalyst surface and poison effect of CO strongly adsorbed on the Ru atoms."
