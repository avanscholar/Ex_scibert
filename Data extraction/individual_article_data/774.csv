0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is the only rich source of non-food renewable carbon. Catalytic transformation of platform molecules derived from biomass into bio-fuels and value-added chemicals can significantly reduce anthropogenic carbon footprints on a global scale [1–6]. Furfural (FUR) is a biomass-based derivative that can be obtained by hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass raw materials (such as rice bran) with dilute acid [7]. However, since a large number of CC and CO groups in FUR may be hydrogenated to produce corresponding hydrogenated products, it is challenging to control the reactivity and selectivity of FUR to produce desired furfuryl alcohol (FOL) [8]. FOL is an important organic chemical raw material. It is widely used in petroleum, rocket fuel, synthetic fibers, adhesives, rubber, pesticides and foundry industries, especially for the synthesis of phenolic and furan resins with excellent functions [9,10]. In addition, conversion of FUR to FOL also can be achieved by connecting downstream products to synthesize more bio-fuels and value-added chemicals [11–15]. Generally speaking, there are two synthetic strategies used to catalytically hydrogenate FUR to FOL. In the first option, gaseous hydrogen is often used as hydrogen donor, transition metal catalysts (mainly noble metals Au, Pd, Ru, Rh, Pt, etc.) show good catalytic hydrogenation performance [16–21]. Owing to considerable safety risks, special facilities for transportation, storage and processing of high-pressure hydrogen are required, which is unfavorable for the development of sustainable biomass upgrading industries (especially in the initial stage) [22–24]. The second option-Catalytic Hydrogen Transfer (CTH)-uses alcohol or acid as hydrogen donor, making operation easier and experiment safer. In particular, easily available and inexpensive alcohols have dual roles as solvents and hydrogen donors during this procedure, which shows better practicality and economy than the former [25–28]. Several noble metal-based (such as Ru, Pt) catalysts have used in the hydrogenation of organic chemical molecules derived from lignocellulosic biomass and show good catalytic activity. Nonetheless, the cost of noble metals is relatively high [29,30]. On the other hand, several nickel-based catalysts show good activity [31,32]. However, compared with precious metal catalysts, it has a higher reaction temperature and lower selectivity, which has an important impact on the energy consumption of industrial production [33–37]. Therefore, it is worth studying to optimize and obtain mild reaction conditions and increase product selectivity. In this paper, some nickel-based catalysts doped with other non-noble metals (Mg, Al) were prepared, acid-base ratio can be adjusted by the addion of the latter, the Meerwein-Ponndorf -Verley (MPV) reduction of aldehydes has made great progress due to the synergistic effect of acidic, basic and metal sites. The introduction of Mg and Al causes the synergistic effect to adjust the acidity and basicity of catalyst: the introduction of Mg increases the conversion of furfural, which is due to the fact that Mg provides strong base sites for the catalyst; the introduction of Al increases the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol, which is due to the fact that Al provides a large amount of acid to the catalyst. The optimal acid-base ratio (0.73:1) and metal sites (Ni) achieve multi-centers collaborative catalysis. In addition, mesoporous structure and highest O defect/O lattice ratio (1.79:1) of this catalyst create more oxygen vacancies, which increase the adsorption sites of FUR, thereby making higher catalytic activity of NMA-2. Moreover, through kinetic studies, this excellent catalytic performance is related to activation energy (51.8 kJ/mol), which is lower than most reported CTH catalysts. In short, we have developed a simple catalytic synthesis route and provided a novel thought for the expansion and application of MPV reduction catalysis."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials FUR (AR), FOL (AR), methanol (AR), ethanol (AR), 1-propanol (AR), 2-propanol (AR), 1-butanol (AR), 2-butanol (AR), tert-butanol (AR), magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, zinc nitrate, cerium nitrate hexahydrate and cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The excess 20 % oxalic acid ethanol solution was quickly injected into the mixed alcohol solution of nickel nitrate, magnesium nitrate (zinc, cerium, cadmium) and aluminum nitrate under vigorous stirring at room temperature. An oil bath was used to evaporate ethanol from the gelatinous precipitate at 85 °C, and the colloid was dried overnight at 120 °C for 12 h, temperature was increased at a rate of 5 °C/min and calcinated at 150 °C for 1 h, 200 °C for 1 h, 300 °C for 1 h, and 360 °C for 4 h, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Using CuK α radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) to check the phase purity of various ratios of Ni-Mg-Al catalyst by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X'Pert PRO PANalytical). The detected diffraction pattern 2θ of catalyst was in the range of 5 to 80°, and scan rate was 0.5° per minute. The K-Alpha surface analysis system with X-ray monochromatization function was used to identify the surface type of the catalyst on Thermo Fisher ESCALAB250XI through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After vacuum cleaning the sample at room temperature, the spectrum was recorded, and the amorphous 284.8 eV (C 1s) carbon was used as the standard for calibrating the binding energy. The ASAP2020 instrument was used to perform nitrogen adsorption and desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) to determine the BET surface area of Ni-Mg-Al (NMA) catalysts with different molar ratios. Before measurement, the test samples were pretreated at 523 K for 6 h in a vacuum environment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope. Detecting the NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD of Ni-Mg-Al catalyst on Auto Chem II 2920 with thermal conductivity detector. Before CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD detection, 0.1 g sample was purged with carrier gas at 500 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to 150 °C. Introduce 10 % NH3 (CO2)/He gas into the instrument and perform chemical adsorption for 2 h at the required temperature. After the probe molecules were saturated, the sample was desorbed from 50 °C to 600 °C with ammonia or carbon dioxide at a rate of 10 °C/min."
5,Catalytic activity test,"2.4 Catalytic activity test The furfural (2.415 mmol, 0.2 mL), catalyst (50−150 mg) and 2-propanol (5−15 ml) were first placed into the reactor. Then, the reactor was purged with N2 gas for three times and then pressurized to the desired pressure of 0.1–1.5 MPa at room temperature. The autoclave was heated to the desired temperature (100−180 °C) with stirring at 700 rpm. After the reaction has progressed for a certain period of time, the reactor was taken out and quickly quenched to room temperature with flowing cold water, and the liquid sample after reaction was analyzed by a gas chromatography-hydrogen flame ionization detector, both using SE-54 Capillary column (30.0m × 0.25 μm × 0.25 μm). The FUR conversion, FOL selectivity and yield were calculated and defined as follows: F U R c o n v e r s i o n = F U R i n - F U R o u t F U R i n F O L s e l e c t i v i t y = F O L o u t F U R i n - F U R o u t F O L y i e l d = F U R c o n v e r s i o n × F O L s e l e c t i v i t y 100 Where, FURout was the concentration of residual FUR after reaction; FURin was the concentration of original FUR sample; FOLout was the concentration of residual FOL after reaction."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst screening and catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst screening and catalyst characterization Initially, the CTH of FUR-to-FOL was studied at 160 and 140 °C for 5 h with 2-propanol as H-donor. It can be seen from Table 1 that bimetallic Ni-Mg oxides shows higher activity, and bimetallic Ni-Al oxides shows higher selectivity, indicating that reactivity was increased by the introduction of Mg, and reaction selectivity was increased through the introduction of Al. Thus, it is possible to change the molar ratio of Mg/Al to obtain excellent catalytic performance. Accordingly, the yield of FOL can be improved through the synergistic effect of acid-base sites. Obviously, a highest FOL yield (97.6 %) was obtained on nickel-based NMA-1 (8:4:3) catalyst, which is higher than other nickel-based catalysts (Ni-Zn-Al (NZnA), Ni-Cd-Al (NCdA), Ni-Ce-Al (NCeA)) (Table 1, entries 1–4). Meanwhile, compared with the Cu-Mg-Al (8:4:3) (CMA-1) catalyst with good conversion and low FOL selectivity (byproducts mainly were tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and methyl furan), the results show that the metal sites of the Ni-based catalyst play an important role in selectivity (Table 1, entries 1–5). Thence, the NMA catalysts with different metal molar ratios (NMA-2 (5:3:2), NMA-3 (4:4:2), NMA-4 (2:4:4), NMA-5 (8:0:2) and NMA-6 (8:2:0)) were prepared. As shown in Table 1, when the catalytic performance was compared at 140 °C, NMA-2 is the most effective and obtains the highest FOL yield (97.5 %) and selectivity (99.0 %). This clearly shows that NMA-2 is the optimal catalyst for the production of FOL from CTH. Therefore, five NMA catalysts with different molar ratios were selected for characterization and analysis. Fig. 1 represents XRD curves of the calcined samples. As shown in the figure, XRD reflection of the calcined sample was set at 37.4, 44.7 and 63.3° attributed to nickel oxide [JCPDS.No. 65-5745] and Ni-MgO [JCPDS.No.34-0410], which are overlapped each other due to its highly dispersed nature. The reflections belonging to the Mg(Al)O magnesite phase similar to those of Ni-containing catalysts were observed, which is signed as NiO or Mg(Al)O [JCPDS.No.4-829] at 44.7 and 63.3°. In series of NMA catalysts samples, the peak of NiO increases slightly with the increase of the content of Ni, and decreases slightly with the doping of other metals (Mg, Al), this clearly indicates that dispersion of Ni decreases when the loading increases. The high dispersion of NiO is mainly due to the uniform distribution of Ni2 + under the action of the oxalate ligand. It is reported that the aluminum phase can interact strongly with NiO [38]. In summary, the well-dispersed NiO phase is formed and can maintain strong interaction with other metals (Mg, Al). In addition to the corresponding features for Ni-MgO, the XRD reflections at 37.4, 44.7 and 63.3° belong to the corresponding characteristics of NiO (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) [PDF#65-5745], respectively. According to the Sherrer formula, the diffraction of NiO (2 0 0) is about 11.2 nm, and the average crystallite size of catalyst particles was calculated to be roughly consistent with the TEM results. The structural and textural data of NMA catalysts with different metal molar ratios are given in Table 2 . Compared with tri-metal mixed oxides, bimetallic mixed oxides have larger specific surface area, average particle size and pore volume, which may be attributed to the less agglomeration caused by the interaction between different metals. Moreover, the surface area of the tri-metal mixed oxides was almost unchanged. Among them, the most active NMA-2 has a larger surface area of approximately 129.7 m2/g, a larger pore size (9.47 nm), and a larger pore volume (0.28 cc/g), these could be beneficial to the proceeding of the hydrogen transfer reactions. As shown in Fig. 2 A, in the low pressure region (P/P0: 0∼0.25), the interaction between the catalyst and N2 reveal weak, and all NMA catalysts show type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loop, which was ascribed to the presence of irregular mesoporous interparticle voids. In addition, as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2B, presence of oxalic acid ligand increases the molecular weight and metal spacing. Accordingly, pore size of the calcined sample was mainly distributed in the mesopore range, so that the sample has a larger specific surface area, pore size and pore size volume. In order to further confirm the surface morphology and particle size distribution of the catalyst, the NMA-2 sample was observed by TEM (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3a, particle size distribution range of the NMA-2 catalyst is 6−20 nm, and the average particle size is 11.2 nm, which was consistent with the calculation result of the Scherrer formula. As shown in Fig. 3b, the NMA-2 catalyst has a large number of pores, which corresponds to relatively large pore volume and higher specific surface area, as measured by BET. Fig. 4 represent the CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD curves of NMA catalysts with different molar ratios. A large number of acidic and basic sites are found in the NMA catalysts. Futhermore, Fig. 4A and Table 3 revealed that the addition of Mg makes catalyst have a strong base site (439.3 °C), as well as, Fig. 4B and Table 4 show that the addition of Al maked catalyst have a large amount of acid (13.81 mmol/g) at the medium strong acid site (272.6 °C). Thus, Al can greatly improve the acidity of catalyst. Moreover, the mixing of Ni-Mg-Al makes the surface acidity and basicity of catalyst tend to be stable. Consequently, acid-base ratio of catalyst can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of different metals. In short, combined with BET analysis, NMA-2 has a larger surface area, pore volume and pore size, so it can provide more acid-base sites and active sites, thereby having a better acid-base ratio to improve the activity of the catalyst. From the catalytic performance of Table 1 and Fig. 8b, it could be seen that NMA-2 is the best catalyst with an acid-base ratio (0.73:1). Hence, the experimental and characterization data could show that the optimal acid-base ratio (0.73:1) and metal site (Ni) can achieve multi-centers collaborative catalysis. The surface chemistry of NMA catalysts with different molar ratios was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Table 5 and Fig. 5 ). As far as the molar ratio of Ni/Mg/Al was concerned, there was no big gap between the surface value and theoretical value (Table 5). Except for the bimetallic catalysts (NMA-5, NMA-6), the surface molar ratios of trimetallic catalysts (NMA-1, NMA-2, NMA-3) were closer to expectation, which might be due to the interaction of metals that make the dispersion of catalyst more uniform. The molar ratio (3:1) of bimetallic catalysts (NMA-5, NMA-6) surface was lower than expected (4:1), which might be due to the higher Ni content compared with other metals. It was also possible that compared with Al3+ and Mg2+, Ni2+ species are more likely to migrate to the surface. In addition, it could be inferred that the high content of nickel ions (Ni2+) strengthened the synergistic effect of metal bonds and acid-base sites. In Fig. 5, the Ni 2p spectrum of prepared NMA catalysts showed two strong peaks at 854.4 and 872.4 eV, corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin-orbit lines, respectively. It could be observed that a satellite peak at 860.4 eV. These peaks refer to the ionic form of nickel (Ni2+), most likely in the form of NiO and Ni(OH)2 phases [39,40]. In addition, the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum also shows a peak at 853.7 eV, repesenting Ni+, respectively. The co-existence of Ni2+ and Ni+ favored the generation of oxygen vacancies. The conversion of Ni2+ to Ni+ is the main reason for the formation of oxygen vacancies, as shown below: 2Ni2+ + O2−→2Ni+ +□ (□ represents oxygen vacancy) [41]. In addition, Mg 1 s and Al 2p showed two strong peaks at 1301.3 and 70.4 eV, respectively. These peaks refer to the ionic forms of magnesium (Mg2+) and aluminum (Al3+), they are most likely in the form of MgO and Al2O3 phases. Therefore, the results were consistent with XRD data. As summarized in Table 5, the specific gravity of surface oxygen of NMA catalysts with different molar ratios exceeds 50 %. This indicated that oxygen plays an important role in the performance of the NMA catalyst activity. The O 1s spectra of NMA catalysts with different molar ratios all contain two peaks around 529.6 and 531.2 eV, which is attributed to lattice oxygen (O lattice), and adsorption Oxygen (O defect) related to oxygen vacancies, respectively [42]. Actively adsorbed oxygen distributes a part of electron density to other metal atoms in the form of unsaturated coordination, which causes the O 1s peak shifts to a higher binding energy [42,43]. As a consequence, the O defect / O lattice ratio provides a sensitive indicator of surface oxygen vacancy level. The O defect/O lattice ratios of NMA catalysts with different molar ratios are 0.91, 1.79, 1.32, 0.56 and 0.41, respectively. As expected, the O defect / O lattice ratio changes due to the change in the surface NMA molar ratio. Among them, NMA-2 has the highest O defect / O lattice ratio of 1.79 due to more oxygen vacancies, which provides more adsorption sites for reactants (such as furfural) [44,45]. As a contrast, NMA-1 with the lowest ratio of 0.91 affected the adsorption capacity of reactants on the surface of catalyst. In addition, comparing the data in Tables 1 and 5, we can find that the O defect / O lattice ratio is proportional to the catalytic activity."
8,Effect of hydrogen donor,"3.2 Effect of hydrogen donor Table 6 summarizes the CTH of FUR results using different alcoholsas hydrogen donors. When tert-butanol was used as the hydrogen donor, hardly observed FOL (Table 6, entry 7), because no hydrogen atom was provided to FUR beside from the hydroxyl group, it is difficult for tert-butanol and FUR form a cyclic six-member transition state at the acid-base position of the catalyst. In contrast, both primary and secondary alcohols can be used as hydrogen donors for CTH of FUR (Table 6, entries 1–6). In terms of FOL selectivity, secondary alcohols are the most effective (Table 6, entries 4 and 6), which might be related to the lower reduction potential of secondary alcohols. Compared with 2-propanol, the lower conversion of FUR in 2-butanol was attributed to the steric effect of the relatively long carbon chain [46–48]. Therefore, the results showed that 2-propanol had the best hydrogen supply capacity among the tested alcohols, and the FOL formation rate was as high as 381.4 μmolg–1 min–1."
9,Effect of catalyst dosage and solvent dosage,"3.3 Effect of catalyst dosage and solvent dosage The amount of catalyst was an important reference for evaluating the effectiveness of catalyst. As summarized in Fig. 6 a, as the catalyst dosage was reduced from 0.075 to 0.025 g, the conversion of FUR decreased from 72.4–12.7 %, while the selectivity to FOL remained above 90 %. As catalyst dosage increased from 0.075 to 0.1 g, conversion and yield of FUR increased correspondingly with the unchanged FOL selectivity. However, as catalyst dosage increased from 0.1 to 0.15 g, the conversion and yield of FUR decreased when the selectivity of FOL increased. Therefore, the preferred catalyst dosage was 0.1 g. In addition, the amount of solvent (H-donor) also had a certain effect on the catalytic performance. In any hydrogen transfer reaction, as the MPV reaction can be reversible by the Oppenauer oxidation reaction, the ketone formed by the sacrificial alcohol must be removed, or an excessive amount of alcohol must be added to avoid the reverse reaction [49]. As shown in Fig. 6b, when solvent dosage (H-donor) decreased from 10 to 5 mL, the conversion of FUR slightly decreased from 99.5–95.9 %. When H-donor increased from 10 to 15 mL, the conversion and yield of FUR were slightly reduced. Accordingly, 10 mL of solvent (H-donor) can already achieve the best yield."
10,Effect of reaction temperature and time,"3.4 Effect of reaction temperature and time By changing the reaction temperature and reaction time within the range of 100−180 ℃ and 0.5−7 h, the effect of the reaction temperature and time on the CTH of FUR-to-FOL were studied (Fig. 7 ). The reaction temperature and time were an important reference for the CTH of FUR-to-FOL. For instance, when temperature was increased from 100 to 180 °C, the conversion of FUR is increased from 37.0–99.0 % (Fig. 7). At the same time, at a lower reaction temperature (i.e. 100−140 °C), the conversion of FUR was significantly improved. In addition, a shorter reaction time (i.e. 0.5−3 h) also increased the conversion relatively greatly, while a longer time had less influence on the reaction effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimal reaction time and temperature are 140 °C and 3 h, respectively."
11,Effect of reaction pressure,"3.5 Effect of reaction pressure In terms of furfural catalyzed hydrogen transfer, reaction pressure is also an important factor affecting the CTH of FUR-to-FOL. It was studied that the reaction pressure influences the CTH of FUR-to-FOL by changing the N2 pressure in the range of 0.1–1.5 MPa. It can be seen from the Fig. 8 a that when the pressure increased from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa, the conversion of FUR increased from 89.2–99.6 %, and when the pressure was greater than 0.5 MPa, the conversion of FUR was almost unchanged. As a result, it was clearly proved that 0.5 MPa is the most suitable reaction pressure."
12,Reusability of the NMA-2 catalyst,"3.6 Reusability of the NMA-2 catalyst Reusability test of NMA-2 catalyst was carried out to evaluate its practical application. After each cycle is completed, the NMA-2 catalyst is separated from the reaction liquid by a centrifuge, washed twice with water and ethanol, and then vacuum dried for repeated use. As shown in Fig. 9 , after five consecutive cycles, the catalyst exhibited almost constant stability, and FOL yield decreased slightly from 96.8 %–88.6 %. In short, the catalyst has certain practical application value."
13,Substrate scope,"3.7 Substrate scope It has been proved that NMA-2 has excellent catalytic performance on the CTH of FUR. The range of various substrates was tested using other biomass-derived carbonyl compounds and representative aldehydes and ketones (Table 7 ). NMA-2 can effectively catalyze all detected carbonyl compounds to produce the corresponding alcohols in high yield. Wherein, NMA-2 catalyst can promote significant biomass-derived chemicals cinnamaldehyde to transfer hydrogenation reaction of lauryl alcohol with 92.5 % yield (entry 2). It is worth noting that the CTH of acetophenone requires a longer reaction time (entry 3). In addition, the electron withdrawing group attached to the aromatic ring at the para position improves the conversion of CTH reaction (entries 4 and 5). These results indicated that NMA-2 has great potential applications in organic synthesis and biomass conversion CTH reactions at mild reaction temperatures (Scheme 1 )."
14,Kinetic research,"3.8 Kinetic research The reaction kinetics of furfural (FUR) CTH in a batch reactor shows that the reaction rate is controlled by the transfer rate from furfural to furfuryl alcohol. In order to study the synthesis mechanism of the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol using mesoporous NMA mixed metal oxides as a catalyst, the reaction kinetics was studied in detail. Assuming that the furfural CTH reaction is a quasi-first-order reaction, the reaction rate equation can be simplified as: (1) - r F U R = - d F U R / d t Assume a system of first-order equations, and integrate Eq. (1) over time to obtain Eq. (2): (2) - ln F U R t = k t - ln F U R 0 We use Arrhenius Eqs. (3) and (4) to determine the activation energy for furfuryl alcohol (FOL) in the entire temperature range (100–160 ℃). Where k is the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy (kJ/mol), R is the gas constant (8.314 kJ/mol), and T is the temperature (k): (3) k = A ⋅ exp − E a R T (4) ln k = ln A − E a R T lnk is equal to the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1/T). By plotting -ln(1-x) with time t, the reaction rate constant (k) is calculated at preset temperatures (100, 120, 140 and 160 °C), assuming that the CTH reaction of FUR to FOL is first-order reaction (Fig. 10 a and Table 8 ). The fitted value of R2 is approximately equal to 1, indicating that the reaction rate constant(k) has a linear relationship with the concentration of FUR, so the reaction is a first-order reaction, as shown in Fig. 10a. In addition, according to the calculated reaction rate constants (k) at different temperatures (Fig. 10b and Table 8), the activation energy (Ea) of FUR transfer hydrogenation on NMA-2 calculated from the Arrhenius diagram is as low as 51.8 kJ/mol. Moreover, in terms of similar CTH systems, the Ea obtained in this work is close to or far lower than the Ea reported in previous literatures (Table 9 ) [37,50–53]. Obviously, considering conversion of FUR, FOL selectivity and Ea, the NMA-2 catalyst in this study shows comparable or even higher catalytic performance in FUR transfer hydrogenation than most reported Ni-based catalysts."
15,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.9 Proposed reaction mechanism As mentioned above, acidity and basicity are critical to the CTH reaction based on MPV reduction. The measurement of CO2- and NH3-TPD (Fig. 4) proved that there are a large number of basic and acidic sites in NMA catalyst. The CTH reaction of aldehydes and alcohols is generally considered to follow the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) mechanism, which requires a six-membered ring transition state to carry out hydrogen transfer. Because of its amphiphilic nature, carbonyl compounds are easily adsorbed by strong interactions [28]. Moreover, we speculate that this is also applicable to FUR, so a reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed for the CTH of FUR to FOL on NMA catalyst (Scheme 2 ). In the catalytic cycle, firstly, the acidic and basic sites of NMA activate 2-propanol (step A), and then the carbonyl group of FUR is adsorbed by metal sites (M) on the catalyst surface (Step B). Subsequently, hydrogen transfer occurs through the six-membered ring transition state, which is derived from 2-propanol, activated carbonyl group of FUR and metal sites on NMA (Steps C and D). Finally, the FOL product is formed with acetone (step E), where excess 2-propanol is added to avoid reverse reaction."
16,Conclusions,"In this work, NMA-2 catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method was confirmed to efficiently catalyze the CTH of FUR to FOL with high yields using 2-propanol as solvent and H-donor. Under mild conditions, the selectivity of FOL remains almost unchanged (∼99 %). Furthermore, through a series of characterization analysis, we found that the mesoporous nickel-based NMA-2 catalyst with high surface area, highest O defect/O lattice ratio and optimal acid-base ratio. Moreover, the optimal acid-base ratio (0.73:1) and metal sites (Ni) achieve multi-centers collaborative catalysis. The Ni-based catalyst can form value-added chemicals in a near quantitative yield from biomass-derived carbonyl compounds through direct hydrogen transfer. Through kinetic studies, this excellent catalytic performance is related to activation energy (51.8 kJ/mol), which is lower than most reported CTH catalysts. All the above results clearly show that NMA-2 catalyst can effectively catalyze intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions, and can be extended to other similar lignocellulosic biomass derivatives."
