0,Introduction,"Benzyl methyl ether (BME) is an asymmetrical ether [1] that exists naturally in spices, herbs, mints, dried fish products, mushroom, tea, juices and alcoholic beverages [2] and is also added to food and as a flavoring agent due to its pleasant fruity odor. Currently, there is no evidence (e.g. toxicity studies) to show that the consumption of BME at less than 540μg per person per day will cause any negative effect on the daily metabolism of humans [2]. In additional to the food industry, BME is also used as a solvent for organic compounds, a starting material for the synthesis of other organic compounds [3] and as a booster for gasoline combustion [4,5]. Ma et al. [5] suggested BME would be a good substitute for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in order to enhance gasoline combustion. This is because BME is practically known that insoluble in water [2] and has a higher solubility in gasoline than does MTBE [4,5], and so would likely be a safer oxygenate additive to fuel to regulate its properties. One of the conventional methods to prepare BME is by the Williamson ether synthesis. As shown below in Eq. (1), the neucleophile (alkoxide ion) is involved in a SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) attack on an unhindered primary alkyl halide and leads to ether production. The alkoxide ion is produced by adding a suitable alkali metal or hydride, such as sodium, potassium, or sodium hydride to the alcohol [1]. (1) where R is the phenyl or alkyl group, R′ is the alkyl group and X is a halide. Unfortunately, this reaction involves the use of toxic and corrosive reactants with the corresponding concern of environmental pollution and health risks [6,7]. In addition, as shown in Eq. (1) the amount of alkaline halide added must be at least equal to the amount of alcohol in order to allow a complete reaction to occur. As a result, the same amount of inorganic salt is produced that needs to be discarded as waste [8,9]. In order to achieve the desired green production of BME, the synthesis can be done with a nucleophile (alcohol) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over an acidic or basic catalyst, as reported extensively by Selva et al. [7–9] and Tundo et al. [10–12]. DMC is a non-toxic alkylating agent that can be used in place of the alkyl halides for less harmful methylation and carboxymethylation reactions [13]. The advantages of DMC are that (i) no extra solvent ever necessary because DMC is a good solvent for many organic compounds, (ii) the reaction is only slightly or not at all exothermic, and (iii) it does not lead to the production of harmful solid wastes, with methanol and carbon dioxide being the only side products which can be easily disposed off [8,12]. The DMC behaves as a carboxymethylating agent at low reaction temperature (90°C) and carboxymethylation reaction predominates [11,12]. In contrast, at a higher reaction temperature (160°C), DMC behaves as a methylating agent and methylation reaction predominates [11,12]. However, Selva et al. reported that the faujasite zeolite catalyst allows both methylation and carboxymethylation reactions to occur simultaneously at temperature 165–168°C [7]. Thus, the two main possible products formed are benzyl methyl carbonate (BMC) and BME, as shown in Eq. (2). Moreover, as the temperature is increased, BMC will undergo decarboxylation to form BME [7], as shown in Eq. (3). (2) (3) Even though experimental studies have successfully synthesized BMC using benzyl alcohol and DMC over zeolite, the reactions involved still remain unclear, especially those for the decarboxylation reaction [8]. The zeolite exhibit high surface area and uniform pore size, is able to control the diffusion rate of reactants and products and allow reactants pass through the catalytic active sites. A higher catalytic activity is found in the pore of zeolite due to the diffusion of reactants into the pore is often the rate determining step of a catalytic reaction. In order to predict the reaction pathway of benzyl alcohol and DMC in a zeolite catalyst system, theoretical studies are a powerful tool and can provide a better understanding and explanation of the complicated chemical reactions which are otherwise not possible to evaluate by experimental investigations alone [14–20]. Therefore, the interest of this study was to investigate the possible reaction pathway of BME production from benzyl alcohol and DMC over a NaX zeolite catalyst. From an industrial prospective, understanding the reaction mechanisms and pathway will provide a better foundation for optimizing the reaction conditions in order to achieve a more efficient, and so economically and environmentally viable process [17]. The aim of this study was to predict the optimized geometries of the different complexes in the transition state (TS) and ground state (GS) over a 3T or a 36T cluster of zeolite. The energy profile of the reactions was calculated and a mechanistic proposal for the methylation and carboxymethylation of benzyl alcohol over faujasite zeolite is discussed."
1,Methodology,"The monoclinic crystal structures of faujasite zeolite were constructed with the reference to the lattice structure proposed by Olson [21]. The 3T cluster [SiOAl(OH)2O(H)Si] represents the smallest cluster and the active site of the NaX zeolite [15–20,22] and is employed in this study to explain the interaction of the reactants with the zeolite active site where the reaction occurs [23]. For a more realistic investigation, we extended the zeolite framework to a 36T quantum cluster, based upon the 12T cluster of faujasite that is defined as a 12-membered-ring-windows that are connected to the active site of two supercages [15,16,18,20]. In each cluster, one of the silicon atoms in the faujasite zeolite is replaced with an aluminum atom [15] and the charge balancing cation (sodium atom) was added to the zeolite for neutralization [24]. The dangling bonds were terminated by H atoms [15,20,24,25] and the SiH bonds were fixed along SiO bonds at 1.47Ǻ [15,20]. For the 3T quantum cluster, the zeolite is partially optimized but the reactants are fully optimized by density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) as the basis sets. The 36T quantum cluster was calculated with the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p):UFF) method and further evaluated using the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p):PM3) method and the two energy profiles compared with each other as well with that obtained using DFT from the 3T quantum cluster. The active site of the 36T quantum cluster [SiOAl(OH)2O(H)Si] with the reactants were allowed to relax while the extended system was fixed at the Cartesian coordinates [15,16,18]. The frequencies were calculated to determine whether the species is at the GS or TS. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) [26] calculations were performed to ensure the products and reactants belong to any given reaction [23]. The frequencies were used to determine the partition functions of the rate constant calculations [27]. Calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 [28] software under a Linux operating system. GaussView 03 and Chemcraft softwares were used to view the geometry of molecules, vibrational frequencies and the IRC pathways."

3,Investigation of the reaction mechanism of benzyl alcohol with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over a faujasite zeolite,"3.1 Investigation of the reaction mechanism of benzyl alcohol with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over a faujasite zeolite The investigation of the reaction mechanisms between benzyl alcohol and DMC over a 3T or a 36T cluster of faujasite zeolite was performed using the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) and ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p): UFF) methods, respectively. The 36T cluster was also predicted with the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p): PM3) method and these results were compared to those obtained with the UFF method. The optimized geometries of the reactants and products over the NaX zeolite in their respective GS and TS are discussed. We propose that the methylation reaction contains two different pathways, the first (Pathway 1) involves two TSs, while the second (Pathway 2) only involves a single TS. For the carboxymethylation reaction, only one reaction pathway was found. The calculated energy profile was used to determine the likely kinetic stabilities of each reaction pathway. Lastly, the mechanisms for the methylation, carboxymethylation and decarboxylation reactions are proposed. 3.1.1 Adsorption of reactants onto the zeolite surface At the zeolite surface, the benzyl alcohol will undergo nucleophile activation [7], which results in an elongation of the OH bond. Meanwhile, DMC undergoes electrophilic activation, where OCH3 bond elongation is observed [8]. Fig. 1 shows the single benzyl alcohol adsorption structure (Fig. 1a), whereas DMC is observed to have two different adsorption structures (Fig. 1b and c). Initially, the separate optimization of benzyl alcohol and DMC over zeolite was performed to obtain their adsorption conformations [29]. The optimized adsorption structure of DMC by two oxygen atoms (Fig. 1b) is thermodynamically more favorable compared to the structure where adsorption is maintained by one oxygen atom (Fig. 1c), which is due to the existence of two electrostatic interactions, that between each Na+ ion and two oxygen atoms. Hence, we selected the former (Fig. 1b) structure to model the adsorption of DMC (as well as the benzyl alcohol) on the zeolite surface. 3T cluster results. Before the co-adsorption of both reactants, the NaAl distance was observed to be 2.742Å. For reference, the structure and atom numbering for benzyl alcohol, DMC and zeolite in the GS1 are shown in Fig. 2 . During co-adsorption in the GS1, the benzyl alcohol is observed to be in the same plane as the zeolite, whereas that for DMC is perpendicular to the zeolite. Also, the benzyl alcohol adsorbed weakly onto the zeolite surface through the Ozeolite Halcohol (O1H) hydrogen bond with a distance of 1.881Å. DMC was observed to be co-adsorbed nearby the zeolite surface, and the NaAl distance lengthened to 3.027Å. Overall, the zeolite structure did not alter much during co-adsorption of the reactants, with changes in the bond distances of less than 0.1Å. The theoretically calculated adsorption energy of the reactants over zeolite is −83.96kcal/mol. Subsequently, these co-adsorbed reactants will undergo a change to the TS1, where the benzyl alcohol moves nearer to the zeolite surface. ONIOM results. Before the co-adsorption of both reactants, the NaAl distance was 2.863Å, which is comparable to values of 2.911Å and 2.925Å obtained in a previous study with 12T and 84T quantum clusters of faujasite zeolite, respectively [16]. However, the NaAl distance for the density functional theory (DFT) level of calculation is 0.121Å longer than the value obtained over the 3T quantum cluster reported above. In the GS1, the adsorption structures of the benzyl alcohol and DMC over the zeolite surface are similar to those found over the 3T quantum cluster, where the benzyl alcohol is observed in the same plane with the zeolite active site and DMC is perpendicular to it. During co-adsorption of both reactants, the NaAl distance lengthened by 0.688Å and the benzyl alcohol was observed to be weakly adsorbed on the zeolite surface via the Ozeolite Halcohol (O1H) hydrogen bond, with a distance of 1.760Å, whilst the internal Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) bond was shortened to 0.987Å (Fig. 3 ). At the same time, DMC was co-adsorbed nearby the zeolite surface. The theoretical calculated adsorption energy of the reactants over zeolite is −47.87kcal/mol, which is significantly less exothermic (36.09kcal/mol) lower than the adsorption energy predicted over the 3T quantum cluster. The next step in the reaction pathway is the transition from the GS1 to the TS1. 3T cluster results. In the TS1, the Ozeolite Halcohol (O1H) distance decreased from 1.881Å in the GS1 to 1.658. At the same time, the NaAl distance increased slightly and the Na+ ion approached towards the Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) group. This resulted in the NaOalcohol (NaO3) distance slightly decreasing and the Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) bond of benzyl alcohol being weakened by the Na+ ion as it lengthened from 0.980Å to 1.000Å. Also, the Calcohol Calcohol (C1C2) bond is slightly elongated and the C1C2O3 bond angle broadened by 3.50°. However, DMC did not experience any significant bond parameter changes in the transition from GS1 to TS1. In general all of the AlO and SiO bonds of zeolite are lengthened in the optimized TS1 geometry. The computed activation energy is +45.11kcal/mol (Fig. 4 ). In the next step, the reactants are approach closer to one another in the GS2 and initiate the methylation or carboxymethylation reaction. ONIOM results. In the TS1, the benzyl alcohol was observed to be desorbed from the zeolite surface (Fig. 3), whilst the Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) bond was slightly shortened to 0.975Å. The conformation of the benzyl alcohol in the TS1 is different from that in the GS1, with the C1C2O3 angle being 4.3° wider than in the GS1. However, in general, the optimized bond parameters of DMC and zeolite did not change significantly from the GS1 to the TS1. The predicted activation energy at TS1 is +4.23kcal/mol (Fig. 4), which is 40.88kcal/mol less endothermic and more stable than the prediction in the small cluster of zeolite. In the next stage (GS2), the Na+ metal ion of faujasite reduced the benzyl alcohol to a benzyl alkoxide ion, as shown in Eq. (4) and the reactants subsequently move closer to one another to initiate the methylation and carboxymethylation reactions. (4) 3.1.2 Methylation of benzyl alcohol 3.1.2.1 Pathway 1: Methylation of benzyl alcohol with two TS The alkoxide ion formed in the previous stage (TS1) immediately attacks the unhindered primary alkyl group of DMC leading to the CO bond cleavage. Eventually, BME is formed and the methyl carbonate ion is protonated to produce methyl carbonic acid, as illustrated in Eq. (5). The methylation reaction occurs when the Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) and CDMC ODMC (C4O4) bonds are cleaved and is followed by the formation of the Oalcohol CDMC (O3C4) and ODMC Halcohol (O4H) bonds to produce BME and methyl carbonic acid in the TS2. (5) 3T cluster results. In TS2, the BME molecule moved away from the zeolite surface while the methyl carbonic acid is adsorbed onto the zeolite via a hydrogen bond. The ODMC Halcohol (O4H) bond distance is weakened and is observed to be longer in TS2 (1.066Å) than the usual OH bond length (0.96–0.98Å) (Fig. 3). The bond distances of BME and methyl carbonic acid in the TS2 are similar to those seen in the GS3. Between the TS2 and the GS3, the bond angles for BME and methyl carbonic acid did not differ much, whereas the bond angles for methyl carbonic acid changed slightly. For instance, the methyl carbonic acid, C3O5C5 angle was 2.1° wider in the TS2 than in the TS1. The activation energy is predicted to be +37.04kcal/mol (Fig. 4), which is supported by the IRC calculations. The obtained geometry of the methyl carbonic acid is that of an anti-conformation. Carbonic acid is very unstable in the gas phase and the anti-conformation state is less stable than the syn-conformation [30]. Therefore, assuming also the instability of methyl carbonic acid, it will react further to form a more stable compound. ONIOM results. In the TS2, the BME is observed moving far apart from the zeolite active site and the H atom of methyl carbonic acid formed a hydrogen bond with the O3 atom of BME at 1.564Ǻ (Fig. 3). Therefore, the O4H bond distance of methyl carbonic acid is observed to be 1.011Ǻ. In the GS3, the conformation of each species did not undergo any drastic changes and the optimized geometries are almost similar to the geometries in the TS2. Also, the optimized bond parameters for the extended 36T zeolite framework in the TS2 and GS3 are comparable over the 3T quantum cluster. However, the optimized geometry is not similar. The computed activation energy in the TS2 over the 36T quantum cluster is only +2.38kcal/mol (Fig. 4), which is 34.66kcal/mol more stable than the predicted energy at the TS2 over the 3T quantum cluster. The optimized structure of methyl carbonic acid in the TS2 is in the syn-conformation and it is different from the geometry observed over the 3T quantum cluster (anti-conformation). Although the methyl carbonic acid in the syn-conformation geometry is more stable than the anti-conformation one [31], previous theoretical studies have suggested that carbonic acid is less stable than the reactants (water and carbon dioxide) in the gas phase [31–37]. Here, we assume that methyl carbonic acid is less stable than methanol and carbon dioxide, and so the methyl carbonic acid will react further to form these two products with higher stabilities. The second TS (TS3) of the methylation Pathway 1 occurs when the methyl carbonic acid is deprotonated by the alkaline Na+ ion to form an anionic intermediate is shown in Eq. (6). Since the reactive step involves proton transfer significant H/D kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is expected. KIE is a measure for tunneling and it strongly depends on the donor–acceptor distance. For recent discussion concerning the relevance of tunneling in biocatalysis see the article, [38]. The lone pair of electrons of oxygen migrates to the adjacent carbon atom to form the CO bond and the CO bond will break simultaneously. Therefore, carbon dioxide is emitted and the alkoxide ion is protonated to become methanol. (6) 3T cluster results. In the TS3, the methyl carbonic acid has been converted to methanol and carbon dioxide, as shown in Fig. 3, where the optimized bond distances and bond angles seen in the TS3 are close to the optimized geometry in the GS4. Also, the BME compound remained stable in the reaction stage with the bond distances and angles in the TS3 being similar to those obtained in the TS2. The C3O5 bond cleavage of methyl carbonic acid leads to the formation of carbon dioxide and methanol. In the TS3, the methanol is then adsorbed on the zeolite surface through the Ozeolite Halcohol (O2H) hydrogen bond with a distance of 1.709Å. The O5H bond of methanol is weakened and is slightly longer than the usual OH bond distance. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide moves away from the zeolite surface and the predicted CO bond distances (C3O4 and C3O6) at the GS4 and TS3 were in the range of 1.16–1.17Å, which are close to the reported experimental values (1.162Å) [31]. The activation energy is deduced to be +37.62kcal/mol, as shown in Fig. 4. ONIOM results. In the TS3, the methyl carbonic acid is converted to carbon dioxide and methanol, with the optimized bond parameters obtained in the TS3 being in good agreement with the optimized geometry found in GS4. This shows that the BME formed in the previous TS (TS2) remained stable in the TS3. Moreover, the optimized bond parameters in the TS3 and GS4 are also similar to those found in the TS3 and the GS4 over the 3T quantum cluster. The BME and carbon dioxide are then observed to move away from the zeolite active site, while the methanol is adsorbed weakly on the zeolite surface via the Ozeolite Halcohol (O2H) hydrogen bond with a distance of 1.989Å (Fig. 3). This optimized geometry is similar to the geometry observed in the TS3 over the 3T quantum cluster (Fig. 3), but the computed activation energy is only +0.78kcal/mol (Fig. 4) and is 36.26kcal/mol more stable than the energy predicted over the 3T quantum cluster. 3.1.2.2 Pathway 2: Methylation of benzyl alcohol with a single TS Pathway 2 involves only one TS (TS4) to produce BME, compared to Pathway 1 that undergoes two TS (TS2 and TS3) and a different starting geometries of benzyl alcohol and DMC were modeled. Previous experimental work reported that at a higher reaction temperature (200°C), 99% of the reactants have been converted to BME [7]. We propose that the one step reaction for the methylation of benzyl alcohol and rearrangement of molecules to form BME, methanol and carbon dioxide, respectively, occur in the high reaction temperature, as shown in the following equation: (7) 3T cluster results. In the TS4, BME, carbon dioxide and methanol were formed where the bond parameters of BME obtained in the TS4 did not differ much from those calculated for TS3. In the TS4, the BME and carbon dioxide were observed moved apart from the zeolite surface. Nevertheless, the adsorption structure of the methanol onto the zeolite surface is similar to the observation in the methylation Pathway 1 (TS3), where the Ozeolite Halcohol (O2H) hydrogen bond was observed to be at 1.593Ǻ (Fig. 3) and the ODMC Halcohol (O5H) bond of methanol was weakened as it increased in length to 1.010Å. In this pathway (Pathway 2), the predicted activation energy is +41.00kcal/mol (Fig. 5 ), where it is higher than the activation energy of TS2 and TS3 of Pathway 1 at 37.04 and 37.62kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 4). The products formed in the GS5 are 3.95kcal/mol more exothermic than those products formed in Pathway 1 (GS4). In short, this reaction pathway is kinetically less stable compared to Pathway 1. Hence, Pathway 2 is not predicted to be favorable in the methylation reaction. ONIOM results. In the TS4, the methanol and carbon dioxide are formed and the bond parameters did not show any significant differences compared to those of the optimized geometries in the TS4 over the 3T quantum cluster. The BME and carbon dioxide are observed to be moving away from the zeolite surface but the methanol remains absorbed on the zeolite active site via the Ozeolite Halcohol (O1H) hydrogen bond with a bond distance of 1.809Å (Fig. 3), that results in the methanol O5H bond becoming longer than usual (0.993Å). This optimized geometry is similar to that found in the TS4 over the 3T quantum cluster (Fig. 3). The predicted activation energy in TS4 is +4.65kcal/mol (Fig. 5) and it is higher than the activation energy in the TS2 and TS3 of methylation Pathway 1. Therefore, methylation Pathway 2 is kinetically less stable compared to methylation Pathway 1 and it is not favored in the methylation reaction. The activation energy for the extended 36T zeolite framework is 36.36kcal/mol less endothermic compared to the computed energy over the 3T quantum cluster. 3.1.3 Carboxymethylation of benzyl alcohol DMC can act as both a methylating agent [6,9,12,13,39–41] and a carboxymethylating agent [12,40]. Also, the faujasite zeolite catalyst allows both methylation and carboxymethylation reactions to occur simultaneously at low temperature (165–180°C) [7]. The alkoxide ion will also attack the carbonyl group of DMC to produce BMC and methanol (e.g. Eq. (8)). When the CO bond of DMC is broken the benzyl alkoxide ion will produce BMC and the aliphatic alkoxide ion will bind with the proton (hydrogen) to form methanol. In the TS5, the Oalcohol Halcohol (O3H) and CDMC ODMC (C3O4) bonds are cleaved followed by the formation of the Oalcohol CDMC (O3C3) and ODMC Halcohol (O4H) bonds to produce BMC and methanol, respectively, as shown in the following equation: (8) 3T cluster results. In the TS5, a hydrogen bond of 1.835Ǻ exists between the H atom of methanol and the O6 atom of BMC. The optimized bond parameters of methanol obtained in the TS5 (Fig. 3) are similar to those in the GS6 and comparable to the values obtained in the GS4 and GS5. The computed activation energy of TS5 is +49.36kcal/mol (Fig. 6 ), which is much higher than the activation energy of the methylation reaction (TS2, TS3 and TS4). Therefore, the carboxymethylation reaction is kinetically less stable than the methylation reaction. This finding agrees well with the previously reported experimental data that revealed that the carboxymethylation reaction yielded a low percentage of products [7]. ONIOM results. In the TS5, the formation of BMC and methanol is observed, where the optimized bond parameters in the TS5 did not differ much from those in the TS6 and are also comparable with the optimized geometries observed in the TS5 and GS6 over the 3T quantum cluster. In the TS5, a weak hydrogen bond with a distance of 1.973Ǻ exists between the H atom of methanol and the O3 atom of BMC (Fig. 3). The computed activation energy of TS5 is +7.39kcal/mol (Fig. 6), which is kinetically less favored than both methylation pathways (TS2, TS3 and TS4) with values +2.38, +0.91 and +4.65kcal/mol, respectively. This finding agrees well with prediction made from the previous experimental data [7], and the theoretical evaluation presented here over a 3T quantum cluster reported above, that the carboxymethylation reaction is kinetically unstable compared to the methylation reaction. In short, the methylation reaction is more favorable. Previouse experimental results also indicated that at higher reaction temperatures (200°C), the BMC eventually convert to BME with side products carbon dioxide and methanol [7] as shown in the following equation: (9) 3T cluster results. For the decarboxylation reaction with 3T of quantum cluster of zeolite, we did not find any TS that underwent an intermediate stage, but rather the BMC was observed undergoes an exothermic reaction at the GS7 with −3.94kcal/mol (Fig. 4). At the GS7, the BME and carbon dioxide are observed moving away from the zeolite surface. The methanol which interacts with BMC in the GS6 is observed moving away from the BMC and is adsorbed on the zeolite surface via ODMC Halcohol (O2H) hydrogen bond (Fig. 7 ). ONIOM results. At a higher reaction temperature, BMC eventually converts to BME, carbon dioxide and methanol. The formation of carbon dioxide and BME via an intermediate in TS6 is supported by the similar bond parameters as that observed in the GS7. These values are also comparable with the optimized geometry observed in the TS6 and GS7 over the 3T quantum cluster. In the TS6, the optimized BME, methanol and carbon dioxide geometries are observed to be located besides one another and then they move slightly away from the zeolite active site, as shown in Fig. 3. Lastly, in the GS7, the methanol is found adsorbed on the zeolite surface via hydrogen bonding. The predicted activation energy for TS6 is +20.29kcal/mol."
4,Comparison between the 3T and 36T quantum clusters of zeolite,"3.2 Comparison between the 3T and 36T quantum clusters of zeolite In general, we have predicted optimized structures and energy profiles for the methylation and carboxymethylation reactions between the benzyl alcohol and DMC over a 3T or a 36T quantum clusters by theoretical investigations. Both of the clusters agree well with the findings summarized below. We found that the methylation reactions are possible to undergo two different pathways to form BME. The methylation Pathway 1 involved two TSs that underwent two intermediate stages. In the first TS of Pathway 1 (TS2), the desire product (BME) is formed with a carbonic acid as a side product. In the gas phase, the unstable carbonic acid will undergoes another TS (TS3) and further decompose to carbon dioxide and methanol. Also, the Pathway 2 is a one step reaction which only consist a single TS to produce BME with carbon dioxide and methanol. However, the calculated energy profile shown that the activation energy (TS2) in the methylation Pathway 1 less endothermic than the Pathway 2 (TS4) and it increased the stability of the species in the reaction. Moreover, only a pathway is found for the carboxymethylation reaction in both clusters. However, the 3T cluster only detected a TS but the 36T cluster detected two TSs in the reaction pathway. No TS was found in the decarboxylation reaction over the 3T quantum cluster can be explained as being due to the fact that the carbocation species are more electropositive compared to other existing species (carbon dioxide and alkoxide ion) and so the TS is easier to detect in a larger zeolite framework [36]. Besides, the predicted activation energy for both clusters at the carboxymethylation reaction (TS5) are more endothermic than both of the methylation pathways. This indicates that the formation of BMC is kinetically less favored than BME formation. Although the prediction of possible reaction mechanisms for methylation and carboxymethylation reactions are quite similar in 3T and 36T quantum clusters of zeolite, however, the predicted energies in the TS and GS for both clusters are not comparable. The 3T quantum cluster overestimated the TS and GS energies and the energies obtained were very high (approximately±30–40kcal/mol). Meanwhile, when an extended cluster of zeolite framework is applied, the predicted energies were highly reduced and this shows that the zeolite environmental is highly affecting the total energy of a system [42]."
5,Comparison between ONIOM methods with the UFF and PM3 level of calculation,"3.3 Comparison between ONIOM methods with the UFF and PM3 level of calculation An evaluated for the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p):PM3) method was made by using the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31g(d,p):PM3) method and the energy profiles were compared. Table 1 shows the energy difference over the 36T cluster obtained from the two different ONIOM methods of calculation (UFF and PM3). The adsorption energy of the reactants over the zeolite was found to be 9.70kcal/mol less exothermic by the PM3 method than by the UFF method. Other than that, most of the TS and GS energies obtained by the PM3 method did not differ by more than 2kcal/mol from those obtained by the UFF method. Moreover, the optimized structures of the complexes at the GS and TS by the PM3 method are comparable to those obtained from the UFF method, where the bond parameters did not show any drastic changes. Since both of the methods have shown similar results, we may suggest that PM3 and UFF methods can be used in combination with DFT to predict the adsorption energy, TS and GS energies for similar systems."
6,Rate constant,"3.4 Rate constant Canonical transition state theory was used to predict the rate constant, k [27,43,44]. The methylation and carboxymethylation reaction rate is expressed as in the following equation: (10) k = Γ ( k B T / h p ) N A ( Q TS / Q A ) exp ( - Ea / k B T ) where QTS and QA are the total partition functions for the TS structure and the reactants over a 3T or a 36T cluster of zeolite at temperature T, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, hp is the Plank’s constant, NA is Avogadro’s constant, and Ea is the activation barrier with zero point energy correction. The translational, rotational, vibrational and electronic partition functions were taken into account for the calculations [27,43]. The tunneling correction, Γ, is calculated by the following equation: (11) Γ = 1 + 1 / 24 ( hv ≠ / k B T ) 2 where v≠ is the imaginary frequency. The applied approach is closely related to the approximate method that found by the physicists Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin and called WKB method [45–47]. For more general treatment of tunneling but still limited to one dimension see Ref. [48]. 3T cluster results. The rate constant for the co-adsorption of reactants is fast, and the rate of reaction for methylation via reaction Pathway 1 is much faster than that for Pathway 2 (Table 2 ), due to the lower activation barrier in Pathway 1. This indicates that Pathway 1 more readily converts the reactants into products compared to Pathway 2. In Pathway 1, the conversion of reactants into BME and methyl carbonic acid (TS2) is 2.67-fold faster than the conversion of methyl carbonic acid into carbon dioxide and methanol (TS3). The carboxymethylation reaction, which occurs simultaneously with the methylation reaction, has a 3.74-fold faster rate of reaction than the methylation reaction by Pathway 1 (TS2) and a 44.2-fold faster rate than the methylation reaction by Pathway 2 (TS4). ONIOM results. When the extended 36T zeolite framework was applied, the overall calculated rate constants increased approximately 104–106-fold compared to those obtained over the 3T quantum cluster. This is because with the extended 36T zeolite framework, all of the species were fully surrounded by the zeolite with a high electron density and so the overall rate constant was increased. By using the ONIOM approach, the rate of co-adsorption of reactants increased 3.49×104-fold over that found for the 3T zeolite framework. In contrast to the findings over the 3T quantum cluster, in the extended 36T cluster the rate constant for methylation reaction via reaction Pathway 2 is 8.33-fold faster than that for Pathway 1, whilst the TS5 of the carboxymethylation reaction, which happens simultaneously with the methylation reaction at TS2, has a 3.58-fold faster rate. The decarboxylation reaction (TS6) was observed to be 1.33-fold faster than the carboxymethylation reaction (TS5)."
7,Conclusion,"The proposed methylation and carboxymethylation reaction mechanisms of benzyl alcohol with DMC over a 3T or a 36T extended zeolite framework were investigated theoretically via the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) and ONIOM (using both UFF and PM3 analysis) methods, respectively. Both frameworks concluded that the methylation Pathway 1, which involves two TSs, is more favorable than Pathway 2, which involves only a single TS, due to the lower activation energies of Pathway 1. Moreover, the methylation reaction is kinetically more favorable than the carboxymethylation reaction. This finding agrees with previous experimental studies that reported that the carboxymethylation reaction yielded a low percentage of products [7]. At the end of the methylation and carboxymethylation reactions, carbon dioxide and BME were observed moving away from the zeolite surface, whilst methanol remained adsorbed onto the zeolite via a hydrogen bond. In general, the extended framework largely decreased the adsorption energy and activation energies of every species. Also, the adsorption energy for the extended 36T cluster predicted by the PM3 method is less exothermic compared to that obtained with the UFF method. The rate constants over the 36T cluster were 104–106-fold faster compared to the corresponding rate constants obtained over the 3T quantum cluster. However, the adsorption energy for 36T cluster predicted by the PM3 method is less exothermic compared to the UFF method and both methods have similar optimized structures and close TS and GS energies."
