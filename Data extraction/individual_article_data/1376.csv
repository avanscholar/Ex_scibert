0,Introduction,"Exhaust from motor cars has been identified as a one of the major source of pollution and is becoming more unpleasant to the people inhabiting cities [1]. The low emission demands in the automobile industries as well as other pollution problems are the great concern in the 21st century [2]. High efficient vehicles are the simplest key to decreasing emissions [3]. However motor vehicles cause pollution due to a number of reasons, including emissions of NOx, SO2 and other particles [4]. Most of this pollution has a health impacts such as irritation in the breathing system, skin and eyes as well as environmental impact such as emissions of greenhouse gases [5]. Even with the continuous economic growth, most progressive industrialized countries have not increased their total energy consumption during the past three decades [6]. Yet, the energy use in transport sector keeps increasing in many parts of the world. Hydrogen as energy carrier on board for transportation was recognized because of its environmentally friendly nature [7]. The energy density of hydrogen is greater compare to other fuels and its energy yield is 122kJ/kg. This energy yield is 2.75 times more than other hydrocarbon fuels [8]. Management issues related to the hydrogen as an energy carrier includes its production, transmission, storing and usage [9]. The products of hydrogen combustion is water and can play a significant role in energy systems in the future. Consequently hydrogen is considered as a promising energy product and there has been a surge in funding devoted for research on the production, distribution, storage, and hydrogen use worldwide [10]. Therefore, hydrogen production is a matter of great importance in clean fuel production. The cost for present technology to produce hydrogen is more expensive than fuel which is in used now but production cost could decline if the market increases and knowledge of production is developed [11]. The total price of using the underground facilities for central hydrogen storage could be equal to those of natural gas storage facilities but the hydrogen transmission cost is probable to be to some extent higher than the natural gas transmission [12]. Currently, hydrogen is industrially produced from the fossil fuel and its production is based on natural resources as it main sources, such as natural gas (mainly) and naphtha [13]. Fig. 1 shows the different sources of hydrogen production. The catalytic steam reforming of natural gas or coal gasification are current well-established hydrogen production methods. These engineering processes cause emission of large quantity of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into atmosphere [14,15]. Due to the release of the greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) into the environment, its reflected as untenable or unsustainable. Hence the fuel cells, internal combustion engines and other applications of hydrogen could be a noble options for fuels, if it can be produced at high efficiency and made from renewable resources [16]. Pure hydrogen gas does not exist as a natural resource like natural gas and oil. Therefore, hydrogen is extracted from natural resources like water [17], coal gasification [18], natural gas [19], acetic acid [20], glycerol [21,22], butanol [23], ethanol [24], methane [25], naphtha catalytic steam reforming [26] and bio-oil [27]. In order to extract hydrogen from these existing resources, energy must be spent. Bio-oil is renewable and has benefit in the environment and hence preferred as source for hydrogen [28]. Recently, the unwanted and nonfuel component of bio-oil which are acetic acid and phenol, were selected as raw materials for hydrogen production [29â€“31]. Due to the presence of hydrogen ions, phenol is considers as an acid compound and it can act as a weak acid due to its stability as phenoxide ion [32]. Furthermore, the acidity of bio-oil is not suitable for engine fuel. Its major problems is that it serves as corrosive resistant materials for engine fuel. In order to solve this problem, the phenol in the bio-oil can be separated out and added value in others usage. For example, phenol becomes a source in the catalytic steam reforming (SR) for hydrogen production. The phenol and acetic acid as a source of hydrogen production are selected because they are the main bio-oil components with up to 38wt%. [33] and 30wt%. [34], respectively. Hydrogen production from phenol and acetic acid has attracted a considerable amount of attention, as demonstrated by the number of publications in recent years. Their non-inflammable nature makes them safe hydrogen carriers [33]. They are waste products which are the most representative constituents of the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil. Phenol and acetic acid can get a wide variety of microbes, such as bacteria, fungi and viruses [35]. They are reactive and corrosive compound of pyrolysis oil and are not suitable for the internal combustion due to the problem they cause to the engines. Phenol also can be found anywhere in the industrial wastewater, for example from textiles and pharmaceuticals industry [36,37]. Presently, the source of the production of hydrogen is mainly natural gas at high temperature. Though, the emission of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution are the problems of hydrogen production from natural gases. Consequently, the advantages of using phenol and acetic acid as a source of hydrogen production are their environmental-friendliness as well as being renewable and sustainable sources. Therefore, it would be beneficial for those interested in H2 production research to get an idea about the current status of this industry, including the chemical processes involved, suitable catalysts, supporting materials, operating conditions for high phenol and acetic acid conversion and hydrogen selectivity. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of literatures on major catalytic studies for H2 production by bio-oil derivative components such as phenol and acetic acid steam reforming and make through a comparative analysis."
1,Hydrogen and its application,"Hydrogen is found to be an important and most plentiful chemical element in the world [38] and comprising about 75% of the earth's elemental mass [8]. The production of hydrogen involves removing and isolating hydrogen at the purity level required for a particular use in the form of independent molecules. In spite of its simplicity, it is difficult to find hydrogen in its pure form. Generally, it is found in combined with further elements such as oxygen (H2O), carbon (CH4) or nitrogen (NH3). Therefore, we need a process to separate hydrogen from other elements. This can be achieved through some desired reaction processes. Hydrogen can also be separated from hydrocarbons such as, gasoline, natural gas, methanol and propane by using a heat-process (reforming) [39]."
2,Energy carrier uses,2.1 Energy carrier uses The usage of hydrogen as an energy carrier is on the increase. The low energy density by volume limits these uses of hydrogen. But there are many applications where the density is not a big deal. The advantages of hydrogen as an energy carrier include its low environmental pollution impact and diversity in usage. The possible disadvantage may be the high requirements for sealed containers and pipelines needed to prevent leakage.
3,Combustion uses,"2.2 Combustion uses Hydrogen can be used in motorcars like Otto and Diesel engines as a fuel in engines of conventional spark-ignition. The efficiency of engines which use hydrogen fuel is as high as the diesel or gasoline fuel. Hydrogen flame spreads rapidly from the core of ignition [6]. Table 1 shows the hydrogen and other fuels safety-related properties. Due to the energy density limitations, it is less appropriate for the pressure in the piston cylinders and the size of moving parts should be two to three times higher than gasoline engine. This causes problems in the space inside engine sections passenger vehicle [40]. Hydrogen can be combines with oxygen in fuel cells technology for electricity production. Appropriate amount of electric power can be generated by fuel cells through the conversion of the energy produced from chemical reaction. However the electricity production by fuel cell depends on the hydrogen supplied [41]. Fuel cells are a promising technology for use as a source of heat and electricity for buildings and as an electrical power source for electric motors propelling vehicles [42]. The technology converts renewable energy into electricity heat, and water with high efficiencies in an environmental friendly and CO2-neutral method [43]. The best performance of fuel cells is by using pure hydrogen [44]. Electricity can also be a significant energy carrier from hydrogen in the future. Some other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar can generate electric energy and hydrogen as well. The hydrogen can be stored until its required but cannot produce energy constantly. It can also be transported to places where it is required just like electricity [39]."
4,Hydrogen sources,"Currently, hydrogen can be produced from coal, natural gas and oil which are non-renewable sources [43]. It can be made from a variety of sources. Almost half of the hydrogen product is now obtained from catalytic gasification and thermal processes using natural gas as feedstock whereas the second largest source is naphtha and heavy oils [45]. In this discussion, only biomass will be highlighted."
5,Biomass as a renewable energy source,"3.1 Biomass as a renewable energy source It is a biological material from living, or recently living organisms. It is a plentiful and carbon-neutral renewable energy resource for the production of alternative liquid fuels and a variety of chemicals [46]. Biomass is accounts for about 35% of the energy consumption in the developed countries and about only 4% of the share energy consumption in the industrialized countries [43]. The positive effect of biomass use from a CO2 balance is straightforward [47]. The advantages of biomass usage include reduction in CO2 emissions levels, increase in the value of agricultural output due to crop residues conversion, replacing fossil fuels with sustainable biomass fuel and reduces costs of getting rid of municipal solid wastes [48]. Thermochemical conversion technology, gasification, pyrolysis combustion are methods used for well achieved conversion of biomass to energy resource [49]. Biomass combustion releases other pollutants such as SOx and NOx. These pollutants can be controlled through preventing their formation or by eliminating them from the outlet gases [50]."
6,Bio-oil,"3.2 Bio-oil The liquid product from biomass pyrolysis is known as biomass pyrolysis oil. Sometimes, they referred to as bio-oil, pyrolysis oil, or bio-crude. Biomass can be converted to bio-oil by modern process of pyrolysis technology [46]. The physical appearance of bio-oil is similar to crude oil. But the components of bio-oil are naturally oxygenated. Bio-oil is amulti-component mixture of different molecules sizes. It is derived from fragmentation and depolymerization of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin [51]. Bio-oil has a complex array of highly oxygenated components, which are nearly all oxygenated organic species. These include anhydro-sugars, acetic acid, ethanol, carboxylic acids, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, esters, furans, hydroxyaldehydes and hydroxyketones [52]. Phenol and acetic acid are the two major components of bio-oil which having about 38wt% [33,53,54] and 30wt% [34] of the bio-oil. Several researches have been done on the catalytic steam reforming of phenol and acetic acid separately. Previous works mostly reviewed steam reforming of ethanol [55], glycerol [56] and biomass [57] or acetic acid [58]. Most of these researches studied the effect of some parameters on the catalytic activity and production. Such as reaction temperature range for different supported catalysts, the metal nature and its carrier, coke formation on catalysts, time on steam and durability of catalysts."
7,Phenol,"3.3 Phenol Phenol is the 595 of the 1678 hazardous waste sites. It has been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) [59]. From phenolic resins and organic synthesis, phenol mixed with water gets released to the air as an in the process of its manufacture [60]. Phenols contain an â€“OH group bonded to one of the sp2 carbon atoms of a benzene ring. The phenol family includes the parent compound, phenol, as well as a wide variety of other compounds having additional substituents attached to the phenol ring [61]. In the steam reforming of phenol, phenol decomposition (Reaction (1)) and water gas shift reaction (Reaction (2)) are two the major reactions [62]: (1) C 6 H 5 OH + 5 H 2 O âŸ¶ 6 CO + 8 H 2 (2) CO + H 2 O âŸ¶ C O 2 + H 2 Several oxygenated compounds such as ethylene glycol [63], acetol [64], acetone [65], and also heavier aromatic such as phenol [7], xylene [66] and even glucose [67] have been tested as model compounds. In the coking trend, acetone exhibits the maximum level as a result of the striking difference in the performance of these light components [68]. Phenols performance under reforming conditions has also been investigated. They are reflected as components of lignin de-polymerization resultant. The best effective catalysts for the process are based on Rh over mixed metal oxide of Mg, Ce and Zr [69]. Table 2 illustrates the popular catalysts, supports and the steam/phenol ratio in the phenol steam reforming reaction. It is clear that support plays an important role in phenol conversion. The requirement of high S/C ratio (>10) (that is necessary to be used to avoid extensive coking) is one of the characterization of phenol. The complete conversion of phenol and 90% of hydrogen yield can be achieved at 700Â°C of stoichiometric temperature. Coking is one of the most severe problems the catalysts suffer results in their deactivation. This is because of the presence of the aromatic ring, which is very prone to coke formation [70]."
8,Schematic reaction mechanism of phenol steam reforming,"3.4 Schematic reaction mechanism of phenol steam reforming A simple reaction mechanism for steam reforming of phenol is shown in Fig. 2. The initial step in steam reforming is non-dissociative adsorption of oxygenates on the metal sites of the catalysts; the formed surface species subsequently reacts with water/hydroxyls that are, in most cases, activated on oxide supports [82]. According to this mechanism, phenol may be activated on the metal particle or on the support basic sites to produce the intermediate products (step 1) [7]. For catalyst with strong basic, there are low-coordination anions such as O2- presenting in edges and corners which are responsible for the formation of strong basic sites [83]. Thus, a rational explanation is supposed that the WGS reaction was promoted by facilitating the non-dissociative adsorption of water to provide hydroxyl group on Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst (step 2). The support would promote the migration of these OH groups towards the metal particle (step 3). Furthermore, the mobile oxygen species supplied by the support may participate in steam reforming reactions and prevent the formation of coke on the metal particles [84]."
9,Proposed pathway of phenol steam reforming reaction,"3.5 Proposed pathway of phenol steam reforming reaction Associated with these experimental data in our previous research [30,85], one possible pathway to gaseous products in phenol steam reforming process on Ni-Co/ZrO2 catalyst is proposed. As shown in Fig. 3, firstly, the dehydrogenation of adsorbed phenol molecules took place to form adsorbed âˆ—C3HxO species. Then Câ€“C bond cleavage underwent to form adsorbed âˆ—CHyO species, which could be dehydrogenated to form adsorbed âˆ—CO. the adsorbed *CO was removed by WGS reaction to produce CO2 and H2. Otherwise, desorption of âˆ—CO led in the formation of gaseous CO. Therefore, it assumed that the subsequent process of phenol steam reforming and WGS reaction occurred."
10,Acetic acid,"3.6 Acetic acid For a long time in history, humans have been producing and using acetic acid. Its name was gotten from the Latin name of vinegar called acetum. The vinegar is usually from the action of certain bacteria on dilute solutions of alcohol such as wine, in the presence of oxygen. The bacteria requires oxygen. The overall chemical change is the reaction of ethanol with oxygen to form acetic acid and water. CH 3 CH 2 OH + O 2 âŸ¶ CH 3 COOH + H 2 O Globally, the demand for acetic acid is around 6.5 million tones per year. Approximately, 1.5 million tones per year of the demand is met by recycling and the remainder is manufactured from petrochemical feedstock [86]. Recently, acetic acid can be obtained from biological sources but its generally uncompetitive. Numerous research has been done on the catalytic steam reforming of acetic acid. As mentioned previously, acetic acid was selected as a model compound for pyrolysis oil. Table 3 summarizes the reaction network of the acetic acid. It can be seen that the most common catalysts include Ni, Co and Ru. They result in the complete conversion of acetic acid with high hydrogen yield. The overall system of reactions which may be taking place during a steam reforming process are written in Table 3: With the rapid growth of research in steam reforming, it is a challenging task to review all the different literature on the subject matter. Nevertheless, a glance of the some of the reported works on acetic acid steam reforming using noble metal catalyst is displayed on Table 4."
11,Schematic reaction mechanism of acetic acid reforming,"3.7 Schematic reaction mechanism of acetic acid reforming A simple reaction mechanism for steam reforming of acetic acid is shown in Fig. 4, where it can be seen how acetic acid is proposed to decompose to COx and CHx, whereas the latter species can react with OH-species; forming hydrogen and carbon oxides. Meanwhile, coke formation takes place either through oligomerization [94] or decomposition, as indicated in Fig. 4, which is the main problem related with this process as it causes relatively shorter lifetime of the catalyst [91,95]."
12,Catalysts used for steam reforming of bio oil components,"There are several catalyst used for steam reforming of bio oil such as Ru/MgO-based [71], C11-NK [96], natural calcite materials [97], Ni/Al2O3 [98], Ni, Fe,Co and Pd [99], Ni/Mg/Al [100], Ni, Rh, or Ru [101], Coâ€“Ni [102], Coâ€“Ce/Al2O3 and Co-La/Al2O3 [87], Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Ni supported on Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3 and CeO2/Al2O3 [103], Co-Ir/CeZrO2 [104] and Fe [62]. Table 2 and Table 4 summarized the catalysts and supports which were used in the previous researches for phenol and acetic acid respectively. From comprehensive literature search and detailed analysis, it reveals that Rh and Ni showed good performance towards phenol and acetic acid conversion and hydrogen selectivity. This is due to their basic character. But in general, there are more catalysts used in steam reforming process of different feeds such as glycerol, ethanol and others. Noble metal catalysts are well known for their high catalytic activities. For ethanol steam reforming, Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt and Co has been widely investigated [105,106]. Ni based catalyst has displayed high activity for glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield [107â€“111]. Apart from noble metals, Ni is regarded as the most appropriate for catalytic steam reforming of ethanol. Ni has high activity for breaking Câ€“C bond and Oâ€“H bond. It also has high activity for hydrogenation, facilitating H atoms to form molecular H2 [112]. The interaction between adsorbed species and the metal Ni can be modified by the addition of alkali species, thereby further enhancing its steam reforming activity. However, Ni is less active for WGSR just similar to Rh. The combination of Ni and Co shows high steam reforming activity and high selectivity to hydrogen due to the fact that Co favours dehydrogenation and WGSR [113,114]."
13,Steam reforming for hydrogen production,"Hydrogen can be obtained using several technologies such as steam reforming (SR) [115], coal gasification [116], auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [117], dry reforming (DR) [118], partial oxidation (POX) [119], thermolysis [120] and electrolysis [121]. Table 5 shows the summary reforming technologies. Currently the dominant technology for the hydrogen production is hydrocarbons steam reforming. It is an issue of great significance in refinery as well as clean fuel production lately and produce syngas with a high H2/CO molar ratio [122]. Reforming in chemistry refers to the processing technique by which the molecular structure of a hydrocarbon is rearranged to alter its properties. There is an improvement of new techniques for production of hydrogen. This highly significant is due to the expectation in increased demand for hydrogen production, particularly from bio-renewable feed stocks [87,123]. Some previous researches studied the bio-oil component steam reforming such as ethanol [124], acetic acid [20], acetone [65], glycerol [125], butanol [126] and phenol [127]. They have found that the promising technique is the steam reforming which can achieve high bio-oil component conversion and high H2/Co2 product ratio as well. Fig. 5 depicts a schematic representation of the hydrogen production from biomass via steam reforming."
14,Bio-processes for hydrogen gas production,"Main bio-processes used for the production hydrogen can be categorized in three groups; which are water bio-photolysis by algae, hydrogen production of dark-fermentative and dark/photo-fermentation hydrogen production [129,130]. The use of these methods presents several advantages, since they are abundant renewable non-food materials and do not create competition for lands with food crops."
15,bio-photolysis,"6.1 bio-photolysis Photosynthetic production hydrogen from water is a biological process that can convert sunlight into beneficial and stored chemical energy by the following general reaction: 2 H 2 O â†’ 2 H 2 + O 2 Green algae, under anaerobic conditions, can either use hydrogen as an electron donor in the CO2-fixation process or evolve hydrogen. Hydrogen production by green microalgae requires few minutes to hours of anaerobic development in the dark to induce the synthesis and/or activation of enzymes involved in hydrogen metabolism, including a reversible hydrogenase enzyme. The hydrogenase combines protons (H+) in the medium with electrons (donated by reduced ferredoxin) to form and release hydrogen. Thus, green microalgae possess the genetic, enzymatic, metabolic, and electron-transport machinery to photoproduce hydrogen gas. The synthesis of hydrogen permits sustained electron flow through the electron-transport chain, which supports synthesis of ATP."
16,Dark-fermentative hydrogen production,"6.2 Dark-fermentative hydrogen production Biohydrogen production trough dark fermentation (DF) process has gained increased attention in last years, mainly due to process simplicity and possibility to convert a wide range of substrates. Moreover, hydrogen gas presents a high-energy yield (122kJgâˆ’1); its combustion generated only water vapor and its surplus can be stored and used when needed [131]. In this technique, diverse microbial organisms are employed to hydrolyze diversity of polymeric carbohydrates to form hydrogen and other products like butyric, lactic, acetic acids, etc. [132]. Hypothetically, maximum of 12mol of hydrogen can be found from the complete oxidation of one glucose mole. The amount of hydrogen production by dark fermentation highly depends on the pH value, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and gas partial pressure. Nevertheless, only 4 hydrogen mol can be achieved per glucose mole through dark fermentation method with acetate and CO2 as the other fermentation end products and this yield is obtained when the partial pressure of hydrogen is kept effectively low [133]. Due to the fact that solar radiation is not a requirement, hydrogen production by dark fermentation does not demand much land and is not affected by the weather condition. Hence, the feasibility of the technology yields a growing commercial value. In an another study, biohydrogen was produced from beverage industrial wastewater under different experimental circumstances, firstly by using pure cultures of Escherichia coli (XL1-Blue) and Enterobacter cloacae (DSM 16657), which resulted into remarkable increase in hydrogen production. To further clarify the particular reasons beyond the observed improvements in hydrogen generation, experiments were carried out with only E. coli (XL1-Blue) and nitrogen sources such as yeast extract and tryptone supplementation. The result of these tests was that both the applied nitrogen sources and the organism (E. coli) could independently improve hydrogen production. However, the most astounding increase occurred when they were utilized together with an optimal initial wastewater concentration determined as 5g/L [134]."
17,Photo-fermentation hydrogen production,"6.3 Photo-fermentation hydrogen production Photo-fermentation hydrogen production is an extremely hopeful method due to the gentle reaction conditions, high hydrogen production, use of solar energy and conversion of organic waste to hydrogen. Photosynthetic bacteria play a key role in the photo-fermentation process and their performance determines the utilization range and conversion efficiency of substrate to hydrogen. Thus, the screening of bacteria with a remarkable capacity for hydrogen production is crucial to the photo-fermentation hydrogen production process [135]. However, these processes have three main drawbacks: (i) use of nitrogenase enzyme with high-energy demand, (ii) low solar energy conversion efficiency and (iii) demand for elaborate anaerobic photobioreactors covering large areas. Hence, at the present time, photo-fermentation process is not a competitive method for hydrogen production."
18,Dark/photo-fermentation,"6.4 Dark/photo-fermentation A combination of processes of dark fermentation and photo-fermentation is an interesting approach for the maximum conversion of energy from carbohydrate rich substrates [136]. Using this method, a maximum yield of 14.2mol H2/mol sucrose was achieved by utilizing Clostridium pasteurianum and photosynthetic bacteria of Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 [137]. When the two systems are combined, the low molecular weight organic acids formed as intermediates from anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates (or organic wastes) are further used by the photosynthetic bacteria to produce H2 in a photobioreactor."
19,Choice of reactor,"Similar to other catalytic materials development, there have been several methods regarding the reactor and processes design. These methods came up in order to address the major problem of coke formation and enhance process performance. For study of catalytic reactions in laboratory, different reactors have been used. Laboratory reactors are mainly used for measuring reaction kinetics and catalyst activity at different conditions of temperature and pressure. For the continuous process of bio-oil reforming, the fluidized bed reactor is preferred. In the fluidized bed reactors, the deposited coke on the catalyst surface can be gasified easily. As a result, it allows for more continuous process [138]. Fluidized bed reactors are capable of handling large amounts of feed and catalyst. But fixed bed reactors were commonly used in previous researches with solid catalysts the for catalytic steam reforming process [139â€“141]. The packed bed or fixed bed reactors are most common used for study of gas phase reactants using solid catalyst for the synthesis of large scale basic chemicals and intermediates [142,143]. In addition to the valuable chemicals synthesis, fixed-bed reactors have been progressively applied in recent years for toxic and harmful materials treatment [142]. Fig. 6 shows a schematic flow diagram of fixed-bed reactor. It is typically made up of a cylindrical vessel packed with catalyst pellets. Moreover, it is easy to design, control and operate. The lower maintenance cost and reduced catalyst loss due to attrition and wear are other advantages of fixed bed reactor over the fluidized bed. These make the fixed bed reactor more preferred for hydrogen production from bio-oil components steam reforming."
20,Thermodynamic studies,"The composition of an exit gas stream and important process parameters affecting H2 yield are usually predicted through thermodynamic analysis. Ekaterini and Angeliki [145] performed a detailed thermodynamic analysis of H2 production via steam reforming of aqueous bio-oil fraction with ASPEN. The model compounds were acetic acid, ethylene glycol and acetone. The range of factors used in the study were temperature (400â€“1300K), pressure (1â€“20atm) and steam to fuel ratio (1â€“9). All the three model compounds were fully reformed even at low temperatures with maximum hydrogen yield ranging of 80â€“90% at 900K. Steam to fuel ratio positively affect the hydrogen content over the entire range of temperatures studied. Conversely, higher pressure decreases the hydrogen yield. Aline and Iduvirges [123] performed a thermodynamic modelling for hydrogen production from ethanol, glycerol, n-butanol and methanol. They used temperature range of 723â€“773K at pressures of 3â€“5atm. They found that at P=5atm and T=773K, it is possible to obtain H2 at concentrations over 97mol% along with CO content around 10ppm and a thermal efficiency greater than 76%. In addition, a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production was carried out [146]. The pressure was at a range of 1â€“5atm, temperature 600â€“1000K, and water-to-glycerol feed ratio 1:1â€“9:1. The study revealed that the best condition for producing hydrogen was at a temperature >900K, atmospheric pressure and a molar ratio of water to glycerol of 9:1. Under these conditions methane production is minimized and the carbon formation is thermodynamically inhibited."
21,Prospects of hydrogen in the future of the global energy scene,"As a well-known fact, global energy demand has been on rapid increase due to economic growth and industrialization. Fossil fuels such as crude oil, natural gas and coal are the major players in the global energy supply. Unfortunately, depletion of these fuel sources and the high CO2 emission into the environment due to their utilization have posed a great challenge to the future global energy scenario. These necessitate the search for alternative energy source which are renewable and carbon neutral. Hydrogen as an energy carrier is considered as a promising alternative energy source towards resolving the aforementioned challenges. Various hydrogen production technologies exist even though the cost of production is quite high. Gasification and flash pyrolysis of biomass and subsequent steam reforming of the pyrolysis oil are two major thermochemical processes for hydrogen production. The bio-oil pyrolysis route is more viable alternative compared to the gasification due to lesser cost of materials and process maintenance [147]. With appropriate support to the hydrogen production technology, the use of crude oil and coal will drop to 40.5% and 36.7% respectively by 2030 [148]. Fig. 7 depicts the cost of hydrogen based on various production processes."
22,Future focus,"Recently, researches related to steam reforming of bio-oil has taken new dimensions towards improving it to become an efficient candidate technology in the future global energy scenario. Tremendous effort are now being dedicated towards exploring further new materials as novel catalysts with high coking-resistance, good mechanical strength, high activity at even lower temperature with easy regeneration through excellent structure and composition design, tailoring the active sites for vital catalyst-support interaction, as well as optimization of the synthesis conditions. Better reactor configurations and scale-up procedures with highly improved process temperature control are also gaining grounds for enhancements of cost efficiency and flexibility of the steam reforming of the bio-oil derivatives for hydrogen production."
23,Conclusions,"In this work, an overview of phenol and acetic acid steam reforming process for hydrogen production is presented. From the studies reported so far, the process appears to be the ultimate option for hydrogen production. In addition to hydrogen, CO and CO2 as products from the phenol and acetic acid steam reforming, CH4 is also produced when acetic acid is used. From broad literature surveys and analysis, it can be seen that Rh and Ni are promising towards achieving high hydrogen production level from bio-oil derivative component with low coke formation using an appropriate catalyst support. In terms hydrogen production and long-term stability, ZrO2, La2O3 and CeO2 are recognized as suitable supports due to their basic character. Amongst the hydrogen production techniques, steam reforming of bio-oil using fixed bed reactor can be regarded as the most suitable method. To produce hydrogen by bio-processes methods, scaling up photo fermentation is too costly, whereas combining of dark and photo fermentation seems the most promising strategy for biological hydrogen production. By a combination of dark- and photo-fermentation systems, problems of the individual systems can be overcome, and the overall performance could be improved. It can be concluded that integrated systems will be much more efficient than the individual system."
