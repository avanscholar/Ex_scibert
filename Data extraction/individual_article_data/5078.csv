0,Introduction,"The increasing energy crisis and growing environmental pollution issues have promoted scientists to develop clean and sustainable energy solutions [1–12]. Water splitting, based on photocatalytic (PC) or photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology, have been regarded as a capable and effective way for the future environmental remediation and energy conversion as the used semiconductors can directly harvest and convert renewable solar light into high-energy–density chemical energy [13–20]. The entire photo(electro)chemical process is progressed under ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressures with relatively stable photocatalytic semiconductors to dissociate two H2O molecules into two H2 molecules one O2 molecule. Generally, photocatalytic H2/O2 production can be achieved by two routes: suspension photocatalyst systems and photoelectrode (i.e., photocatalyst immobilized on a conducting substrate) [16,21–23]. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two important half reactions of water splitting (Fig. 1 ). The exploration and development of H2-evolving and O2-evolving photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity and stability are extremely needed and important for boosting the water-splitting efficiency. Recently, various semiconductor photocatalysts, such as oxides [24,25], sulfides [26,27], and oxynitrides [28] have been widely developed and extensively studied based on photocatalytic principles. Currently, with the rapid growth of nanotechnology and various advanced characterization methods, 2D lamellar nanomaterials have aroused considerable attention, which is resulted from their unique lamellar structures, electronic properties and intrinsic activity of active sites [29–31]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcite-like materials, are composed of positively charged brucite-like host layers containing edge-sharing M(OH)6 octahedra, with intercalated anions confined in the interlayer hydrated galleries (Fig. 2 ). Briefly, the general molecular formula can be described as [M1−x 2+Mx 3+(OH)2(An−)x/n]x+·mH2O, where M2+ and M3+ are bivalent metal cation (e.g., Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+) and trivalent metal cation (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+, Ga3+, Mn3+) respectively, and An- are the counter ion (e.g., CO3 2−, Cl−, NO3 −, SO4 2−, PO4 3−) [32–34]. The metal octahedra in LDHs are bonded to each other through a metal–oxygen-metal oxo bridging linkage [35,36]. The presence of oxo-bridges are beneficial for the metal-to-metal charge migration which in turn act as a vital role for visible light redox reactions by mitigating undesirable electron-hole recombination [31,37,38]. In addition, the generated O–H bond perpendicular to the brucite layers in the coordination octahedron can react with holes of valence bands to produce OH, which is an important intermediate in photocatalysis oxidation reaction [39]. Moreover, the well dispersed positive charge of the octahedron is blocked within the brucite layers, which makes it an ideal host to implement electrostatic interactions with the intercalating anions. Those anions have been proved as the positive influence for enlarging specific surface area and different spaces among layers of LDHs and ultimately improve the photocatalytic performance by facilitating the essential reaction between the reactants and the photoinduced charge carriers [40,41]. Hence, LDH has been regarded as one of the most promising photocatalyst materials. In addition, other semiconductors (e.g. TiO2, BiVO4) coated with high redox activity LDH photo(electro)catalysts layers are crucial components for boosting the water oxidation/reduction performance of semiconductor-based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts [42,43]. The transitional metal elements (such as Fe, Co, and Ni) in LDH layers serve as the surface catalytic sites for oxygen generation process. The engineering of LDH-cocatalysts can give rise to the reduced photocurrent onset potential, enriched active sites, accelerated reaction kinetics, and suppressed corrosion [44]. The rapid development on LDH-based catalysts could be regarded as a “breakthrough” for renewable energy production and storage. Some excellent reviews related to the application of LDH-based advanced materials for water spilling, CO2 reduction, supercapacitor, and battery have been published. However, early reviews have mainly focused on the electrocatalytic water spilling using LDH materials [32,45–55]. Researches on indexed journals concerning the keywords “layered double hydroxide” and “water splitting” are in a great amount and increasing rapidly year by year between 2010 and 2020 (Fig. 3 ). In 2016, Zhao et al [56] published the extensive “Layered Double Hydroxide Nanostructured Photocatalysts for Renewable Energy Production” review covering 96 references, which comprehensively summarized the utilization of LDH derived materials for water splitting, CO2 reduction and alcohol photo reforming. Recently, the use of LDH-based materials for photo(electro-) catalytic applications has been reviewed by Jiao et al [57]. But the content of PC/PEC water splitting is thin and concise. Seen from Fig. 3, the ever-growing researches on the use of LDH catalysts in water splitting require the timely updates of recent research, especially in the direction of photo-catalytical water splitting. Hence, it is of great importance for us to summarize the advanced progress about using LDHs based catalyst for photo/photoelectro-catalytic water splitting in a more accessible and detailed way. Herein, this review contains the fundamental aspects of PC and PEC water splitting under UV–Vis and special focus is given to LDH-based efficient and affordable catalysts. The quite disperse literatures regarding LDH photocatalysts or photoelectrocatalysts have been classified as Bi/ter-nary LDH, α-Fe2O3/LDH, BiVO4/LDH, TiO2/LDH, WO3/LDH, CdS/LDH, MoSx/LDH, C3N4/LDH, and GO/LDH (Fig. 4 , and Tables 2 and 3 ). We will focus on the advantages as well as limitations of the most frequently used LDH based water-splitting photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts, major strategies applied to overcome these shortcomings. Special attention is placed on the most important design issues, the correlation among nanostructuring, composition engineering, physical/chemical properties, approaches, computational breakthroughs and functional mechanism that enable outstanding PC/PEC catalytic behaviors through rational engineering of nanoscale LDH photo-active materials. Finally, by integrating our systematic overview and analyses of all the representative related studies surveyed from 2015 to 2020, we will provide our insights for constructing robust LDH-based photocatalysts. The understanding and discussion presented in this review are believed not only beneficial for the rational design of efficient LDH based catalysts for PC/PEC water splitting system but also meaningful for other types of PC/PEC system used for solar energy conversion (e.g.CO2 reduction, N2 fixation) and water remediation (e.g. photocatalytic degradation, photoelectrochemical oxidation)."
1,Strategies to prepare LDHs,"In order to give the reader a comparative overview on the synthetic methods of LDH based semiconductors, the most-recent LDH catalysts that are applied as water splitting photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts are well summarized in Tables 2 and 3. By summarizing the methods provided in these literatures, the most frequently used methods are mainly Co-precipitation, hydrothermal method, sol–gel method, solvothermal method, and electrodeposition method (Table 1). The former methods (Co-precipitation, hydrothermal method, sol–gel method, solvothermal method) to prepare photocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic LDHs-based materials have been described in other reviews [57–61]. So in this section, we emphasized the characteristics of electrodeposition synthesis strategy. The LDH materials tabulated here are within the last six years (2015–2020) and particularly synthesized for suspending photocatalyst and photoanode."
2,Electrodeposition,"2.1 Electrodeposition Seen from Table 3, cathodic electrodeposition was the most frequently used method to prepare LDH photo-electro-catalysts. Cathodic electrodeposition is performed under a negative applied potential in a three-electrode cell setup as shown in Fig. 5 . Typically, the electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving corresponding metallic nitrate in distilled water. The shifting current can initiate the NO3 – reduction process at the cathodic surface during electrodeposition, leading to the generation of OH– ions. Ultimately, the pH level near the working electrodes increases, starting the precipitation of metal ions to generate LDHs films (Fig. 5). Recently, a series of high-purity LDHs materials prepared via electrodeposition method have been considered as an optional photo(electro-) catalysts. For example, Wang et al. [73] successfully synthesized two kinds of BiVO4/Ni-Co LDH heterostructure composites at −0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl and −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. It was obvious that the photocurrent of BiVO4/Ni-Co LDH (-1.0 V) photoanode was smaller than BiVO4/Ni-Co LDH (-0.7 V). This was due to the smaller LDH nanosheet formed on BiVO4/Ni-Co LDH (-0.7 V) surface, facilitating the hole transfer. Fan et al. [74] deposited the Ni-Co LDH on C3N4 surface under −1 V vs. SCE with different electric quantity of 5, 10, 15, 30 mC and denoted as g-CN/LDH-1, g-CN/LDH-2, g-CN/LDH-3 and g-CN/LDH-4, respectively. It was found that only small amount of LDH wrinkles generated in g-CN/LDH-1. As the LDH deposition electric quantity gradually increased to 10 mC, the LDH nanosheets were dispersed the entire g-CN film equably except for the top of the large g-CN spheres. The more deposited electric quantity led excess LDH nanoflakes to be anchored onto the whole g-CN framework, resulting in high recombination rate. Ultimately, the g-CN/LDH-2 displayed the superior photocatalytic O2 evolution."
3,Other synthesis strategy,"2.2 Other synthesis strategy The researchers have also tried other methods, such as drop casting [75–77] and sonication technique [78,79]. Sinclair et al. [77] used a drop casting method to deposit Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets (ca. 12 nm diameter) on BiVO4 photoanode. Typically, a certain amount of LDH or exfoliated LDH nanosheets solution was loaded on spin‐cast α-Fe2O3 or BiVO4 film coated FTO substrate by drop casting using a pipette. After drying at suitable temperature, these photoanodes can been directly used for further PEC research content. Li et al. [78] synthesized a catalyst for the coupling of ZnxCd1-xS nanoparticles with Co-Al LDH used a simple ultrasonic treatment. An ethanol solution containing these 2 contents were stirred for 30 min and further sonicated for 90 min under room temperature. Then the as-prepared solution was immersed in a water bath under 80 °C to evaporate the ethanol. The major advantage of this conventional method is short reaction time and positive effect on primary nucleation [80]. As demonstrated above, various reasonable methods have been used for fabricating the specific LDH photo(electro)catalysts. Although co-precipitation and sol–gel methods can construct functional LDHs in a large scale, it is not easy to prepare functional LDHs materials with the targeted micro-nano structure. In the cases of solvothermal and hydrothermal routes, the time-consuming of production and the requirement of using high temperature/pressure make both strategies costly, thus hindering their widespread application [66]. Alternatively, the electrodeposition method enables the fabrication process LDH-based photoelectrodes with a short time (hundreds of seconds) at room temperature. Due to the versatility and flexibility of substrates, a great number of core–shell nanostructures with the photoreactive or super conductibility substrate as core and high active LDH as shell can been well-designed. The large-scale photocatalyst synthesis accounts for the majority of studies on photocatalytic water splitting, the production of < 100 nm metal oxide, hydroxide, sulfide, and phosphate nanoparticles in the kg h−1 scale has been readily realized via the continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis method [81]. Combined with the high performance of LDH for PC/PEC hydrogen production, it is believed that more efforts shall be committed to translate the basic research findings to commercial applications."
4,Basics of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting,"Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two important half reactions of water splitting. For the HER and the OER reaction, the energy CB energy level has to be more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential (0 V vs. NHE) and the VB energy level needs to be more positive than the water oxidation potential (1.23 V vs. NHE), respectively. Photocatalytic water splitting mechanism can be elaborated as following steps (Fig. 6 )[82]: First, the electrons of LDHs can be excited and transferred from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) after activated by incident light. Meanwhile, the holes of LDHs are left in the VB, therefore generating electron-hole pairs (stage a and b). The photoinduced electrons and holes subsequently travel to the photocatalyst surface (stage c and d), while some of them recombined in this step. Finally, water molecules are oxidized by holes (stage e) or reduced by electrons (stage f) at the surface of LDHs catalysts. These steps affect the overall efficiency of water splitting based on a semiconductor-based photocatalyst. However, the major challenge in these steps is the charges (e-/h+) recombination and then the efficiency of HER/OER is restrained. Consequently, photocatalytic H2/O2 production is usually studied in the presence of sacrificial reagent to consume electrons or holes. Strategies such as metal codoping, constructing heterojunction, shrinking particle size have also been applied for suppressing recombination of charges carries [83]. The use of molecular photosensitizers in PEC system is another way to facilitate light-driven charge separation and has been extensively applied in TiO2 PEC system [84]. However, this strategy in LDH PEC device is far less developed. In a series of insightful fundamental studies by Xu et al., the reaction mechanism of LDHs for photocatalytic OER was investigated. H2O molecules can be easily adsorbed on the LDH sheets via the help of surface hydrophilic hydroxyl group. Then the adsorbed H2O molecules are deprotonized to generate hydroxyl radicals. The resulting hydroxyl radical is subsequently oxidized to yield *O, which then reacts with another H2O molecule for the generation of *OOH. At last, O2 is released from *OOH (Fig. 7 ). The free energy difference of all adsorbed intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) on the (003) surface of LDH was investigated by using the density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) method. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the combination of *O and H2O molecules to generate *OOH was the most difficult step to proceed for Zn2Ti-Cl-LDH, Cu2Ti-Cl-LDH, Cu2Cr-Cl-LDH and Co2Fe-Cl-LDH as ΔGC was the largest among the four steps. In other words, the rate-determining step was determined to be the generation of OOH* from O* for these four LDHs. In the meantime, the formation of *O was the most difficult step to occur for the other eight LDHs. By the DFT + U method, Xu et al. subsequently calculated the OER driving force of Ni2Cr-Cl LDH (0.594 eV), Zn2Cr-Cl LDH (1.051 eV) and Mg2Cr-Cl LDH (0.914 eV). The OER overpotential over models Ni2Cr-Cl LDH, Zn2Cr-Cl and Mg2Cr-Cl were determined to be 0.581 V, 0.910 V and 1.351 V, respectively. Therefore, Mg2Cr-Cl LDH owned a less driving force than its overpotential. Experimental observations further indicated the Mg2Cr-Cl LDH with no OER activity, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. Meanwhile, Ni2Cr-Cl LDH exhibited the highest photocatalytic active oxygen generation performance, reaching up to O2 generation rate 1037 μmol h−1g−1 [85]. An alternative route for H2O splitting is the photoelectrocatalysis, which integrates photocatalysis and electrocatalysis [58,86]. Since the photoelectrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production was first proved by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [87], PEC water splitting has aroused increasing attention in recent years. The water splitting mechanism over PC and PEC systems are in accordance with each other [88]. Compared to photocatalysis, the photoinduced electrons can jump from the VB of LDHs to the CB, and then be transported to the counter electrode (e.g., Pt) through the external circuit in PEC system. The holes reach the surface of the photoanode to oxidize water to produce O2 on the semiconductor surface, whereas the electrons at the counter electrode to reduce water molecules into hydrogen, as illustrated in Fig. 8 a. Therefore, the external bias potential can significantly facilitate the separation of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs, thus improving the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. However, only a small quantity of photogenerated holes join in water oxidation because the holes suffer decrease processes for charge recombination both in bulk and on surface, which finally reduces the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) transition efficiency of the PEC cell. As shown in Fig. 8b, the efficiency of the different procedures included in water oxidation on a photoanode availing the yielded photocurrent; sunlight absorption (ηabs), bulk charge separation (ηtr), charge transfer to the solid-electrolyte interface (ηct), and reaction efficiency i.e., Faradaic efficiency (ηF). Incident photonflux (Φ) and above various efficiencies are directly proportional to photocurrent (J) as: J = q.Φ.ηabs.ηtr.ηct.ηF, where, q is the elementary charge [89]. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) also is the anther crucial element to estimate photoactive behavior, meaning the photocurrent gathered each incident photon flux as a function of incident-light wavelength. The IPCE could be computed at a prospective bias voltage as: IPCE = 1240 J/(λ·I)·100%. where, λ corresponds to the wavelength of incident light and I is the incident light intensity [90]. As opposed to the PC system, the PEC cell generates H2 and O2 on the counter electrode (cathode) and the working electrode (anode), respectively (Fig. 8a). Thus this kind of spatial separation of H2 and O2 evolutions endow the PEC system with more practical, efficient, and safer properties than PC production systems. From Fig. 9 , it can be seen the favorable band alignment between LDH and other typical semiconductors. Integrating two or more semiconductors with well-matched band edge positions is a very efficient strategy to achieve efficient light absorption, electron transport, and photogenerated charge separation in case of semiconductors/LDH hybrids. Hence, in most cases, the LDH materials typically adopted for H2O photocatalytic H2/O2 generation have also been exploited for H2O photoelectrocatalysis."
5,Various LDH based materials towards light-driven water splitting,"We have searched all the PC/PEC water splitting studies conducted mainly between 2015 and 2020 on the application of various types of LDH photocatalysts with controllable composition. Considering the similar basic reaction steps and the pivotal role of catalysts in PC/PEC water splitting process, we clustered our discussion about these novel LDH based materials into four basic categories: Bi/ter-nary LDH, Metal oxides/LDH (α-Fe2O3/LDH, BiVO4/LDH, TiO2/LDH, WO3/LDH), Metal sulfide/LDH (CdS/LDH, MoSx/LDH) and Carbon materials/LDH (C3N4/LDH, GO/LDH). In addition, according to our recent review [62], Bi/ter-nary LDH, C3N4/LDH, TiO2/LDH, and Metal sulfide/LDH are also frequently used in heterogeneous photocatalysis for water depollution. Nowadays, the most commonly used LDH co-catalysts are Ni-Fe LDH (seen from table 3). To some extent, this is the direct result of four unique characteristics: (i) the earth-abundant of Ni and Fe [42,92,93], (ii) a reasonable narrow band gap energy [94], (iii) its transparency towards visible light irradiation [95,96] and (iv) excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for OER catalysis [46,97]."
6,Bi/ter-nary LDH,"4.1 Bi/ter-nary LDH Mostafa et al. [145] reported that the Co-Ti LDH nanorods is a promising photocatalyst to efficiently generate O2 under UV–vis and Infrared (IR) light without adding scavenger. The multilayered structure of Cobalt titanate nanorods LDH, surface, and interlayer water and interlayer carbonate molecules greatly improved the IR absorbance/transferring through the photocatalyst particles for maximum water splitting. Consequently, these nanorods were fairly active for IR irradiation and induced O2 production with a rate of 5300 μmol g–1h−1 at 55 °C for 3 h. Fu and coworkers prepared a series of active ternary Tb-Zn-Cr-LDHs with (Tb + Zn)/Cr ratio 2.0, while varying the Tb3+/(Tb3++Cr3+) atomic ratio to 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, and 5%, and tested them for oxygen evolution through photocatalytic water splitting under visible-light illumination. The most active material was found to be Tb-Zn-Cr-LDHs with Tb3+/(Tb3++Cr3+) ratio of 0.5% that exhibited two absorption bands in the visible region at λmax of 410 and 570 nm. Terbium had a great role in photoluminescence intensity, as the optimum amount of Tb dopant suppressed the recombination of electron-hole pairs, but become the electron-hole recombination centers with an excess amount. The ESR spectra confirmed that the peaks of DMPO-̇OH of Tb3+-doped Zn-Cr LDH materials is much stronger than the undoped Zn-Cr LDH. The increased OH generation was attributed to the fact that Tb in the LDH matrix played as hole acceptors to facilitate such charge injection and hence accelerated the surface oxidation process. Consequently, the introduction of Tb gave rise to an enhanced oxygen productivity from 543 mmol h−1 g−1 to 1022 mmol h−1 g−1 with the increase of Tb3+ doping from 0% to 0.5% at 40 °C for 60 min [102]. After the calcination between 400 ~ 700 °C, the pristine Zn-Al LDH was transformed into a two-phase composite (ZnO/ZnAl2O4 or ZnO/Zn6Al2O9) and the crystal size of ZnAl2O4 and ZnO slowly increased with the increase of calcination temperature. Although the higher calcination temperature resulted in a higher crystallinity of the material, the yield of H2 obtained over this photocatalyst was lower than that obtained with the material calcined at 600 °C. The major reason of better photocatalytic H2-production activity in the case of the Zn-Al MMO catalyst prepared at lower calcination temperature was the higher recombination rate of the ZnO/ZnAl2O4 heterojunction in comparison with that of ZnO/Zn6Al2O9 [146]. Furthermore, the effects of compensating anions (CO3 2–, Cl-, SO4 2- and NO3 –) on the performance of Zn-Cr LDH for photocatalytic O2 evolution from water with AgNO3 as a sacrificial agent were comparatively investigated. Among various interlayer anions, Cl--intercalated and SO4 2--intercalated LDH exhibited the highest and the lowest photocatalytic O2-production rate, respectively. After photocatalytic reactions, both Ag and AgCl particles were observed in Zn-Cr-Cl LDH, and the new formed Ag/AgCl/LDH composites were proved to be visible light active catalysts. The Zn-Cr-CO3 2– LDH owned twice the surface area of Zn-Cr-NO3 – LDH, but NO3 –-intercalated LDH possessed the more robust photocatalytic O2 evolution activity than that of CO3 2–-intercalated LDH [101]. The attempted use of organic molecules intercalated-LDHs for photoelectrochemical water splitting was reported by Zheng and co-workers in 2015. In their study, the interlayer of Zn-Al LDH was co-intercalated with inexpensive 4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DAS) (donor) and 4,4-dinitro-stilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DNS) (acceptor) anions, resulting in electron donor–acceptor (D-A) system after mixing. Because of the organic π*-π electron transition of guest anion, the resulting DAS-DNS/Zn-Al LDH organic–inorganic hybrid materials possessed the broad and strong optical absorption in the absorption of solar light. This kind of combination endowed the resulting photoanode with a 1.31% incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) at 365 nm and enhanced photo-generated current (4.67 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V vs. SCE) for water splitting. The researchers ascribed the outstanding PEC behavior to the 2D photo-induced electron transfer (PET) under UV–visible-light illumination between the co-intercalated DAS and DNS. In this host–guest configuration, the photo-generated electrons and holes were created by the PET process between DAS and DNS anions under illumination. Subsequently, photo-generated electron transferred from DAS to DNS anions due to the well matched energy level alignment, which is beneficial for the charge separation in the photoanode. Moreover, the positive-charged host layers and oxo-bridges in the LDH further facilitated the separation of electron-hole pairs during the PET process [116]. The attempted use of organic molecules intercalated LDHs for PC/PEC water splitting should been encouraged. In contrast with inorganic-intercalated LDH photocatalysts, the organic molecules intercalated-LDHs could improve the thermo/photostability of photocatalysts due to the UV-shield effect of host layers [147]. In this context, further exploration can been focused on the increased interlayer distance, the improved crystallinity and establishment of the intercalation structure [148]. Notably, the introduction of various defects (oxygen vacancy and cation vacancy) to catalysts surface would have a great effect on electronic properties. Oxygen vacancies can reduce photoelectron-hole recombination [149] and electrochemical impedance [150] and narrow the bandgap [151], which lead to the higher charge transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. Further to oxygen vacancies, metal cation vacancies also would be a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity, owing to their boosted H2O adsorption [152], various electron and orbital distribution [153]. Therefore, considering the effect of defects on the LDHs, it is expected that effects of the LDHs materials can enhance their PC or PEC water splitting performance."
7,Metal oxides/LDH,"4.2 Metal oxides/LDH 4.2.1 α-Fe2O3/LDH Earth-abundant hematite (α-Fe2O3) was extensively studied and has shown attractive OER performance, which is resulted from the favorable optical bandgap (2.1–2.2 eV) and suitable valence band level. However, the α-Fe2O3 photoanode still suffers from inferior PEC performance, mainly due to inferior charge transfer, short hole migration lengths and slow water oxidation kinetics. In response, surface modification of α-Fe2O3 with oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC) is a practical solution for accelerating the occurrence of surface reaction [97]. Except the most investigated expensive noble metals co-catalysts, the LDH materials have also been identified as the high-performance and cost-effective cocatalysts in photocatalytic H2/O2 production. Several means have been applied for the growth of oxy-hydroxide and LDH layers onto hematite nanocomposite, the most common being e.g. hydrothermal method [85,100,154], electrodeposition [123] or drop casting [104] and chemical bath deposition [121]. Notably, the p-type Co-Al LDH integrated with the α-Fe2O3 photoanode not only facilitated electron-hole separation via forming a p-n junction but also capably photoelectrochemical catalyzed the water oxidation reaction, resulting in reduced overpotential and enhanced PEC behavior [120–122]. Upon irradiance, the energy level matching between Co-Al LDH and α-Fe2O3 facilitated the transport of photo-generated holes from the VB of α-Fe2O3 to the VB of Co-Al LDH. These photogenerated holes were trapped by the low valence of Co2+ of Co-Al LDH to generate high valence of Co3+ or/and Co4+. As a consequence, Co3+ and/or Co4+ attended the oxidation reaction of the adsorbed H2O/OH− at the surface of LDH to produce O2 and regenerate Co2+. Simultaneously, the photoinduced electrons (e−) in CB of Co-Al LDH travelled to that of α-Fe2O3. The electrons further travelled to the Pt counter electrode surface through the external circuit, thereby resulting in hydrogen evolution [120,121]. To reveal the place where the water oxidation reaction occurs in α-Fe2O3/Co-Al LDH, 1D Co-Pi water oxidation cocatalyst was further deposited on α-Fe2O3/Co-Al LDH, and thus the interspaces between the Co-Al LDH nanosheets were covered with Co-Pi nanoparticles. The photocurrent of the resulting components significantly decreased, compared to those of α-Fe2O3/Co-Al LDH, primarily due to less immigration of photoinduced holes from Co-Al LDH to Co-Pi. Hence, the relatively layered and open nanostructures of LDH is prerequisite for α-Fe2O3/LDH as the PEC water oxidation process on α-Fe2O3/Co-Al LDH was proved to occur in the inner interlayers instead of on the Co-Al LDH surface. Interestingly, Co and Al played different roles in the PEC process. Co was believed to act as active reaction sites for PEC water oxidation and Al provided support for the double layered skeleton [119]. By coupling Co-Al LDH with a Fluorine anion doppped-Fe2O3 photoanode, a pronounced cathodic shift of up to 190 mV in the current onset potential relative to F-Fe2O3 was yielded, increasing their photocurrent density to as much as 2.46 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The doped fluorine anion can effectively remove the surface trapping states partially. Moreover, the surface defects of F-Fe2O3 can be passivated by the Co-Al LDH overlayer, hence leading to the Fermi-level pinning effect, which is beneficial for reducing the onset potential [121]. As further investigation, the PEC water splitting of hematite/Co-Al LDH photoanode was reported to be a function of the high charged and spatial anions of the interlayer guest. Chong and co-workers examined a general relationship between the PEC activities of LDHs/photoanode with the photocurrents of 4 different interlayer anions (PO4 3-,SO4 2-,NO3 –,CO3 2–). There is a slightly negative shift of the binding energy for CO2+ in PO4 3-–Co-Al-LDH/α-Fe2O3, indicating the presence of electron-rich Co sites in this configuration. Among these 4 photoanodes, PO4 3-–Co-Al-LDH/α-Fe2O3 presented the smallest diameter of the semicircular arc in EIS, indicating the fastest charge transformation. The PO4 3-–Co-Al-LDH/α-Fe2O3 photoanode also showed the largest charge separation efficiency, as the anion with higher charges between Co-Al LDH and α-Fe2O3 would cause much more enhancement on the internal static electric field. As a result, intercalation of the Co-Al-LDH/α-Fe2O3 with PO4 3- catalyst could not only achieve a photocurrent of 4.30 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, but also present the excellent PEC stability under 2 h irradiation in alkaline solution [120]. As compared with α-Fe2O3/Co-Al LDH and α-Fe2O3/Ni-Al LDH, the as-prepared α-Fe2O3/Ni-Co-Al LDH showed the smallest charge transfer resistance due to the local structure distortion of MO6 (M = Ni or Co) caused by the synergistic effect of Ni and Co. α-Fe2O3/Ni-Co-Al LDH showed a lower onset potential than either α-Fe2O3/Ni-Al-LDH or α-Fe2O3/Co-Al-LDH, which was resulted from the slightly lower formation energy barrier of M3+ƍ (M = Ni or Co, 0 < ƍ < 1) species than M4+ species [122]. The Al3+ ions in Ni-Co-Al LDH were inactive and only provided structural support, which is consistency with that of Co-Al LDH [119]. However, the excess loading amount of LDH forms a too thick layer that may hinder the light absorption of α-Fe2O3 and lead to bad charge transfer ability. The overlayer blocks the majority of holes, which leads to the formation of more recombination centers [123,124,155]. Particularly noteworthy was that α-Fe2O3 photoanode loaded with exfoliated Ni-Fe LDH monolayer cocatalyst presented 241 times higher electro chemical surface area than bulk LDH/α-Fe2O3, which is ascribed to the more uniform loading compared to unexfoliated LDH stacks. Exfoliation or delamination not only provides a larger number of exposed active sites, but also fabricates more edge and corner sites. As a result, exfoliation of LDH increased photocurrent density by 50%, along with a negative shift of the onset potential by 140 mA compared to stacked LDH [75]. Specifically, it deserves to be mentioned that the electronic band structure can be modified through delamination treatment as well [48]. Kim and co-workers applied a facile dry exfoliation using nitrogen plasma exfoliation of bulk Ni-Al LDHs method to fabricate ultrathin Ni-Al nanosheets of mono and dual layers with rich oxygen vacancies and doped nitrogen sites (Fig. 10 A). As shown in Fig. 10B, the nitrogen plasma etched Ni-Al LDH exhibited a thickness ranging from 1.37 nm to 1.91 nm, which is much smaller than that of the pristine bulk Ni-Al LDHs (3.90 nm to 6.01 nm). Two new peaks at 398.16 eV and 399.74 eV appeared in the XPS pattern of N-doped Ni-Al nanosheets, which can be referred to the metal-N(M-N) species ascribing to the substitutional N doping of the lattice O site and the N-O species from interstitial N doping (Fig. 10D). The peaks at approximately 531.4 eV were associated with oxygen vacancy (VO) in N doped LDH nanosheets (Fig. 10E). The presence of VO acted as additional catalytic active sites to improve the adsorption for water oxidation oxygen intermediates such as –OH and –OOH onto the nearby low-coordinated Ni ions having weaker metal–oxygen bonds. Besides, the doped nitrogen is beneficial for the adsorption of water oxidation intermediates on VO as the doped nitrogen will pull their electrons (Fig. 10F). On the one hand, oxygen vacancies and doped nitrogen can effectively increase charge carrier density at the interface. On the other hand, resistance at the interface for charge transfer was further decreased. As expected, the authors observed that the N-doped Ni-Al nanosheets/hematite photoelectrodes led to the impressive enhancement (about 40%) in photocurrent relative to that of the VO-rich Ni-Al LDH nanosheets/hematite (at 1.23 V vs RHE) [114]. Seen from Table 3, most of the α-Fe2O3/Ni-Fe LDH hybrid were prepared by electrodeposition and hydrothermal methods. However, due to the quite different redox potentials of Ni and Fe ions, the Ni/Fe ratio during electrodeposition is uncontrollable [156]. As for hydrothermal method, it is hard to control the thickness of LDH [157]. Hence, it is a major challenge to optimize highly-matched α-Fe2O3/Ni-Fe interface and this optimized “adaptive-interface” undoubtedly lead to the enhanced PEC properties. In addition, coupling α-Fe2O3/LDH photoelectrodes with noble metal (e.g., Au and Ag) can been regarded as an alternative method for enhancing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, due to both the formation of Schottky junctions and the surface plasmon resonance effects [158]. However, the performance of this ternary nanostructured photoanode has not been reported so far. 4.2.2 BiVO4/LDH Similar to the case of Fe2O3, BiVO4 is a capable photoanode candidate but BiVO4 also suffer from the sluggish electron mobility [159,160]. The large surface areas of BiVO4 nanofibers are beneficial for the uniform dispersion of LDH. LDH can be used as a stepping stone to extract holes formed from BiVO4 to the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby effectively facilitate holes-electrons separation and lead to enhanced performance for O2 evolution by water oxidation, which is also proved in the PL intensity of BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni-Co LDHs. Obviously, the relative electrochemical surface area of BiVO4 was increased dramatically after the deposition of Ni-Co LDH. After the LDH was successfully deposited onto the surface of BiVO4, the resulting composites showed the highest O2 generation activity of 443 μmol·h−1·g−1, about 18-times larger than that of pristine Ni-Co LDHs [161]. Remarkably, doping BiVO4 photoanodes with Mo6+ could not only increased the photocurrent density (1.26 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) for the 3% Mo-doped photoanode by 2.5-fold higher relative to bare BiVO4 photoanode (0.50 mA/cm2), but most interestingly a significant negative shift in the onset potential for the OER was measured with respect to pure BiVO4. To further minimize the aggregation of LDH on BiVO4 photoanodes surfaces, surfactants (SDS, sodium benzoate, citrate) were added into aqueous suspensions of Ni-Fe LDH nanocatalysts. The SEM/EDS images indicated that drop-casting aqueous Ni-Fe LDH nanosheet suspensions with surfactant reduced the aggregation on BiVO4 surfaces. Among systematically explored surfactants, the addition of citrate led the LDH catalysts to be more deposited evenly on BiVO4 surfaces, thereby improved photocurrent production more than that of SDS or benzoate surfactants. Due to the dipositive transition metal ions in LDH layers, citrate preferentially forms stable complexes with them. As a result, use of citrate surfactant in the preparation of BiVO4/Ni-Fe LDH photoanode ensured that authors used only a third of the mass loading relative to constructions without surfactants for a much enhanced photocurrent density [77]. In a more recent study, Y atoms were introduced into the nanosheets of Ni-Fe LDH (Fig. 11 a), the resulting ternary Ni-Fe-Y LDH was then deposited on a porous BiVO4 photoanode aiming for a better PEC activity and stability. For comparation, the materials scientists systematically deposited a serious of NiOOH, Y-NiOOH, Ni-Fe LDH, and Y-Ni-Fe LDH onto BiVO4 surface. Firstly, the band-gap energy of NiOOH was decreased from 2.52 eV to 1.83 eV with the introduction of Y element (Fig. 11b,c), originating from a more conductive electronic structure of Ni-Fe LDH. Notably, with the further incorporation of Y atoms, both NiOOH and Ni-Fe LDH showed an evolution to a metallic state, which was indicated by the finite density of states of the Fermi level (Fig. 11d,e). Secondly, the morphology of Ni-Fe LDH or NiOOH changed from nanoparticles to nanosheets layer with the combination of Y elements. Thirdly, Ni 2p XPS spectra exhibited a negative shift as Y was introduced, which indicated that an electron transformation from Y3+ to Ni2+/Ni3+ site. All the aforementioned factors endowed Ni-Fe-Y LDH/BiVO4 with a photocurrent density of 5.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and a maximum IPCE of about 80% at 450 nm. Importantly, the well-designed electrode achieved a photostability for more than 25 h in borate buffer, which can be deduced from a fast charge migration caused by the Y incorporation [162]. The beauty of this work is not only achieve the better PEC performance of the LDH/BiVO4 composites, but also put forward a general and facile strategy to tune the electronic property of LDH/BiVO4 catalyst. When the CdTe QD@ Ni-Fe LDH nanostructure was under irradiation, the photo-generated in the CB of CdTe QD traveled to the CB of Ni-Fe LDH as more negative CB value of the CdTe QD, thus improving the stability of QDs. Hence, the triadic CdTe QD/Ni-Fe LDH/BiVO4 photoanodes possessed two sets of consecutive Type-II band alignments, dramatically improving the separation of electron-hole pairs. It is worth noting that the loaded QDs enhanced the light harvesting rather than to increase the amount of catalytic sites as the photo-generated holes in QDs were extracted by LDH for the subsequent water oxidation at the LDH surface. In particular, the QD@LDH@BiVO4 exhibited a 200% higher IPCE than that of dyadic LDH@BiVO4 at 1.23 V vs RHE [125]. During the water oxidation half-reaction, it is well known that some active reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates generate before oxygen generation. These photo-generated ROS can be capable of selective oxidation of various substrates. When the graphene@CoAl-LDH@BiVO4 multi-composite was applied as photoanodes, O2 was not produced in substantial amounts in the presence of benzyl alcohol. On the one hand, the holes accumulated on the surface of photoanodes can directly oxidize the benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde (BAD) and then benzoic acid. On the other hand, the holes catalyzed water molecules into OH radicals and also activated BA to carbon-centered radicals, the resulting two kinds of radicals subsequently reacted with BA for the generation of benzaldehyde, with the selectivity above 99%. The authors further stated that the OH radicals adsorbed on the surface of catalyst rather than the free OH radicals played a key role on the high selectivity for BAD, as the addition of H2O2 into the reaction system reduced the selectivity [163]. Until now, most of the BiVO4/LDH nanomaterials present a type II heterojunction system, which have been confirmed to be outstanding to harvest visible light and efficient electron migration with less recombination. Only one study has focused on the BiVO4/LDH based Z-scheme heterojunction for PC water splitting [79]. Therefore, integrating BiVO4 and LDH with other semiconductors with Z-scheme construction will be more attractive in the future. It is also worth noting that very recently some comparative studies were carried out to demonstrate the high-performance of defect controlling [164–166] and facets exposing [167–169] in facilitating the charge separation efficiency, thereby enhancing the performance of BiVO4 based photocatalysts. Both strategies are highly desired as no studies on modulating the electronic structure of BiVO4/LDH to date have been explored for boosting photocatalytic performance. 4.2.3 TiO2/LDH TiO2 nanocrystal can act as excellent acceptor for photogenerated electrons with the fabrication of TiO2/LDH, which would provide the optional way to improve the photogenerated carriers separation and thus the photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, the full utilization of sunlight will be obtained because of the coupling of visible-light- responsive LDHs with UV-light-active TiO2 [105]. The TiO2/Zn-Al LDH sample showed an increase in the rate of electron transfer from VB to CB, owing to the a narrower bandgap energy of TiO2/Zn-Al LDH than that of TiO2. The resulting TiO2/Zn-Al LDH showed a O2 generation rates of 254.5 μmol h-1g−1 upon visible light irradiation, which is much higher than that of unary TiO2. After being calcined at 430 °C, TiO2/Zn2Al-LDH material was converted into a three-phase composite (ZnO, Al2O3 and TiO2) and the ZnO nuclei were homogeneously dispersed in the amorphous Al2O3. This good dispersed metal mixed oxide (MMO) solid exhibited a much better photocatalytic water oxidation activity (371 μmol h-1g−1) than that of TiO2/Zn-Al LDH precursor under visible-light illumination, which was ascribe to the large pore volume, high visible-light absorbance, high surface area, and decreased bandgap energy. The quantum efficiency of TiO2/MMO and TiO2/ZnAl-LDH was 84% and 66% at 400 nm, respectively [104]. Although, TiO2 combined with narrow-bandgap LDH can lead to the decrease of bandgap withing heterostructure. The intimate interfacial contact area in hybrid photocatalysts is another critical factor for better charge transfer at the interface. In this context, Min Wei and co-workers elaborately prepared a core–shell hybrid photocatalyst in which TiO2 hollow nanospheres serve as the core component and Co-Al LDH nanoplatelets serve as the shell component (Fig. 12 A). This configuration of materials endowed the TiO2-LDH samples with a larger surface area (285.5 m2 g−1) and a mesopore distribution in the range 2–5 nm, which are beneficial for the exposure of active sites. Due to the well-matched band structure and inner electrical field formed between LDH and TiO2, the photoexcited electrons migrated from the CB of LDH to the CB of TiO2; meanwhile, the photoinduced holes transferred from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of LDH. Specially, the average distance between the terminal oxygen atom in TiO2 surface and the hydrogen atom in LDH surface was only 2.04 Å. The target core@shell nanospheres showed an O2 generation rate of 2.34 mmol h−1g−1, which was almost 9- and 2-times higher than those observed for TiO2 nanospheres, and Co-Al LDH nanoplatelets, respectively. This was predominately ascribed to the efficient transfer and separation of the photoinduced charge carriers resulting from the intimate contact at the interfaces between LDH shell and TiO2 hollow nanospheres [105]. It is notable to point out that the core–shell structure also showed remarkable CO2 photo-reduction activity as well as high selectivity (against competitive H2 production). Most recently, Tonda et al. prepared TiO2/LDH core–shell hybrid via hydrothermal and calcination methods, which was similar to the treatments applied by Min Wei. The most difference between them was that the carbon spheres were first synthesized as the self-sacrificing template (Fig. 12B). The obtained TiO2/LDH core–shell hybrid was far superior to a different structure of TiO2/LDH hybrid catalyst systems in terms of CH4 production [170]. The unique core–shell geometric structure could grant an intimate interfacial contact area and enlarge the interfacial contact area, thus providing a broader platform for efficient charge transfer. The major production of CH4 rather than CO could be also ascribed to a substantial number of available electrons (required for CH4 formation) existing in the CB of TiO2 [171]. With the aforementioned advantages and outstanding performance of TiO2@LDH hybrids in mind, future work within this core@shell architecture may be directed towards the fabrication of surface defects such as Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies, the layer film thickness of the catalyst and doping the core–shell TiO2/LDH by various elements. In addition, the formation of surface hydroxyl groups can be promoted owing to the acidification of the TiO2 surface with H2SO4, which seemed to be beneficial to the CO2 reduction and the in-situ formation of LDH shell [172]. Therefore, we can reasonably speculate that the acidification of TiO2 surface may affect the product formation of TiO2/LDH core–shell hybrid in PC even PEC H2/O2 production. It was reported that the pristine Co-Fe LDH photoanode, with a Co/Fe ratio of 2, yielded a relatively low photo current of 1.38 mA/cm2 at 1 V Vs Ag/AgCl, which is mainly ascribed to the mutual shading between stacked LDH layers. After the LDH was physically mixed with titanate nanowires, the resulting sample presented a limited PEC activity with only 0.33 mA/cm2. Subsequently, the LDH was decorated on to TiO2 via coprecipitation method by added metal salts solution onto the TiO2 suspension for boosting the PEC performance. No layered structure was observed at low LDH to TiO2 weight ratios (<1), as Co and Fe ions were partial incorporated into the titanate structure during the hydrothermal process. The TiO2/LDH with a ratio of 1:1 enabled the uniform distribution of the LDH layers on TiO2 surface, leading to the enhancement of light absorption, decrement of the mutual shading between the layers, as well as the increased active surface area. As a result, the in-situ generation of LDH on TiO2 nanowires surface resulted in a photocurrent density of 3 mA/cm2 at 1 V Vs Ag/AgCl, in addition to a 220 mV cathodic shift in the onset potential for the oxygen evolution [115]. In a more recent study, the Ni-Fe LDH/TiO2 can be further converted into Ni-Fe MOF/TiO2 by in-situ etching under coordination environment with 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid. The new formed octahedral coordination mode within Ni-Fe MOF can expose a larger number of surface unsaturated active sites from Ni and Fe atoms, thus facilitating the water oxidation kinetics. The NiFe-MOF/TiO2 heterojunction photoanode produced a photocurrent density of 0.77 mA/cm2, up to 3.35 times higher than that of bare TiO2. In addition, the prepared photoelectrode presented excellent photostability under 4 h of continuous illumination and an charge injection of 92.8% and charge separation efficiency of 37.4% [173]. Aiming at designing the well-formed metal-oxide interfaces, Shao et al. [134] utilized a nanoscale catalytic nanoarrays from a thin LDH layer on TiO2 that forms a nanoscale TiO2/LDH interface to determine the influence of the adaptive-interface on PEC water splitting performance (Fig. 13 A). The authors synthesized two configurations via conventional electrodeposition (donated as TiO2/Zn-Fe LDH-E) and photo-assisted electrodeposition (donated as TiO2/Zn-Fe-LDH-PE) processes, and then found that both TiO2/Zn-Fe LDH enabled the higher photochemical performance than unary TiO2. Photo-assisted electrodeposition strategy, however, was superior to construct photocatalyst with high catalytic activity compared to the commonly electrosynthesis method. The major reason of better photocatalytic H2-production activity for TiO2/Zn-Fe-LDH-PE photoelectrode was higher uniformity and the well-defined plate-like morphology of LDH on the surface of TiO2 (Fig. 13B and C), which result in stronger interactions and thus, more efficient electron transfer. Photo-assisted electrodeposition treatment enhanced the photocurrent density of unary TiO2 and TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-E photoelectrode by up to 1.91 and 1.20 times at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. For TiO2/ZnFe-LDH system, a negative shift of the onset potential has also been observed (Fig. 13D). The increase of illumination power density from 0 to 100 mW cm−2 led to the increase of photocurrent density, indicating the crucial role of photo-assisted deposition in PEC performance (Fig. 13E). In particular, the LDH deposition time also played a significant role and a maximum photocurrent (1.51 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs.RHE) can be obtained for 100 s. Under the same LDH deposition time, the TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-PE assemblies showed a higher photocurrent density than that of TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-E configuration (Fig. 13F). To further illuminate the synergistic effect between TiO2 and Zn-Fe LDH on the enhancement of the electrode PEC performance, the average distance between the terminal oxygen atom in TiO2 surface was calculated and the hydrogen atom in Zn-Fe LDH surface was only 2.27 Å (Fig. 13G). Furthermore, the binding energy between them was as low as −9.96 eV. Such low interaction energy combined with short distance indicates an intimate interfacial contact. When TiO2/Zn-Fe LDH was irradiated and excited by illumination, the charge carriers firstly photogenerated in TiO2 and the induced holes on the VB of TiO2 rapidly transferred to Zn-Fe LDH. The electrons of Zn-Fe LDH tended to travel to the current collector through TiO2 owing to the electric potential difference (Fig. 13H). The incorporation of rGO into the TiO2/LDH was also achieved aiming to facilitate the superior charge separation. The PL intensity of these two peaks decreased sharply after the incorporation of Ni-Fe LDH or rGO, and further declined in the ternary TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH system. For ternary TiO2/rGO/LDH materials, rGO exhibited lower Fermi level than the CB of n-type TiO2, suggesting an energetically favorable transfer of electrons from TiO2 (CB) to rGO. With the rGO/LDH hybrid as co-catalyst, the LDH nanosheets receive holes and play as catalytic sites for O2 evolution, of which the graphene sheet act as “highway” for electron transport. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the enhanced photochemical performance of the overall TiO2/rGO/LDH composition was obtained [115]. 4.2.4 WO3/Ldh The effect of compositing LDH with WO3 has also been recently examined and also showed desired PEC performance, resulted from the reasonably-matched band structure between WO3 and Ni-Fe LDH [140]. The heterostructure WO3−X/Ag/Zn-Cr LDH photocatalyst was constructed by photo deposition method and an in situ coprecipitation approach for photocatalytic Tetracycline degradation and H2 evolution. The creation of defects resulted from surface oxygen vacancy in WO3−x and the direct Z-scheme-based mode of charge transfer regulated the optical and photoelectronic properties of the WO3−x/Ag/Zn-Cr LDH nanohybrids, resulting in the efficient spatial promotion of the generation, separation, and migration of photoinduced carriers. Eventually, the ternary heterostructure shows excellent visible light-driven H2 evolution (29.375 mmol g−1h−1) and Tetracycline removal (92% in 90 min) with high stability [174]. Further enhancements in terms of efficiency of water splitting devices have also been reported for a trinary integrating photoanode arrangement, with Fe2O3 ‘‘sandwiched’’ between WO3 and Ni-Fe LDH. Compared to WO3/Fe2O3, the optimized WO3/Fe2O3/Ni-Fe LDH has a decreased band gap, which is beneficial for extending absorption of visible light. When α-Fe2O3 (as the primary light-absorber) and WO3 (as an electron acceptor) came into contact, the n-n junction was formed at their interface. Upon irradiation, the band bending generated at the interface facilitated the carriers to spread in opposite direction until their Fermi levels arrive equivalence. The WO3 conduction band accepted photogenerated electrons transferred from Fe2O3, whereas the holes flow to the valence band of α-Fe2O3 from WO3 for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction. After the cocatalyst LDH loading, the obtained α-Fe2O3/WO3/LDH photoanode showed a photocurrent density of 3.0 mA·cm−2, which is 5-times and 7-times higher than that of WO3 and α-Fe2O3, respectively [141]. Most recently, aiming at exploring the critical role of WO3 exposed facets in the enhanced PEC performance, Ag nanoparticles was firstly deposited on the edged electron rich {020} and {200} facets of WO3 via a photoreduction manner, and then the Zn-Fe LDH nanosheets were preferentially dispersed onto hole-rich {002} facet via a electrochemical process [138]. The optimized geometries of {002}, {020}, and {200} facets of WO3 were illustrated in Fig. 14 a. Accordingly, the band gap energy of {002}, {020}, and {200} facet were calculated via DFT to be 2.344 eV, 1.119 eV, and 1.358 eV, respectively. Then valence band values were further calculated to be 1.895 eV, 1.098 eV, and 0.234 eV, respectively. Obviously, the {002} facet owned the more positive VB value relative to another two facets, indicating the photoinduced electrons on the CB of {002} facet will prefer to migrate to the VB of {200} and {020} facets (Fig. 14b). This migration model enabled the strongest oxidation capability for the photoinduced holes from {002} facet. Moreover, the charge carrier mobilities of electron and hole in faceted WO3 along the lattice a-, b-, and c- directions were calculated and displayed in Fig. 14c. The largest mobility of electron along the a- direction and the highest mobility of hole along the c- direction endowed the faceted WO3 with the successful photogenerated electron-hole separation. Under ultraviolet–visible irradiation, the photo-excited holes transferring along the c- direction will reach the {002} facet and then be captured by LDH. Meanwhile, electron generated on the VB of WO3 travelled to the edged {200} and {020} facets and the hot plasmonic electrons of Ag derived by the local surface plasmonic resonance were quickly injected into the CB of WO3. The extracted holes were ultimately used for the oxidation of Fe, which provides affordable active sites for water oxidation (Fig. 14d). It is worth noting that the salt chloride in seawater was beneficial for the photo-oxidation of H2O to O2. The enhanced PEC performance was ascribed to two facts. On the one hand, the redox process Cl− to Cl2 is a comparatively simple two-electron procedure, comparing with more complex four-electron redox process occurred in water oxidation. On the other hand, WO3 clearly exhibited a smaller solution resistance as the salt chlorides are stronger electrolytes compared to PBS, thus obtaining a faster interfacial charge transport in real seawater relative to that in PBS solution [138]. The research of WO3/LDH is still in the early stages and there is no doubt that coupling faceted WO3 films with LDH cocatalyst is a robust strategy to further boost PEC water splitting [175]. However, the controllable deposition of LDH cocatalyst onto monoclinic WO3 facets, including {100} and other high-index facets, is still a challenge. In addition, the combination of certain thickness and morphology of WO3 and LDH maybe another feasible way for achieving high PC/PEC performance. A deeper research of these effects of the selective facet exposure, morphologies, and WO3 crystallinity on the light absorption is urgently required."
8,Metal sulfide/LDH,"4.3 Metal sulfide/LDH 4.3.1 CdS/LDH Recently, a great progress has been made on LDH decorated by Metal sulfide for achieving improved photocatalytic performance and these examples include ZnS/Zn-Al LDH [176], CdS/Mg-Al LDH [177] and CdS/Ni-V LDH [178]. To overcome the disadvantage of limited bonding sites for loading QDs, the 2D Ni-Fe LDH nanoplates can be further broken into FeNiS nanoparticles via a sulfurizing treatment. Although, FeNiS samples showed the rough surfaces relative to the smooth surfaces of the Ni-Fe-LDH. A large number of CdTe/CdS QDs with particle size of ~3 nm can be evenly deposited on the surface of FeNiS nanoparticles because of the presence of more sulfur species. The H2 evolution rate of the FeNiS-CdTe/CdS QDs photocatalysts was an ~6 times enhancement (41.4 μmol/h), compared to that of FeNi-CdTe/CdS QDs (6.3 μmol/h). It was attributed to the more effective of FeNiS for hydrogen evolution and also the intimate combination between FeNiS and CdTe/CdS QDs for the rapid electrons transformation [108]. Compared to 0D-CdS, 1D-CdS exhibit not only controlled size and thickness, but also enable the carrier transportation in a unidirectional path. These properties are beneficial for reducing the carrier recombination rate and facilitating photocatalytic activity. Inspired by aforementioned advantages, Lee et al. prepared CdS/Ni-Fe LDH nanocomposites through ultrasonication method and demonstrated that 2D Ni-Fe LDH is anchored on the edges of CdS nanorods. This strong interfacial contact equipped the obtained CdS/NiFe nanocomposites with an efficient pathway to prolong the lifetime of photoinduced electrons by regulating the electron transformation from CdS to Ni-Fe LDH, which ultimately reduced H+ for production of H2. Consequently, CdS/Ni-Fe LDH exhibited a much enhanced evolution rate of hydrogen (72 mmol g−1h−1), compared to that of Ni-Fe LDH (0.09 mmol g−1h−1) and CdS (2.4 mmol g−1h−1) [107]. In specific, doping 2D CdS nanorods with P can not only reduce the resistance of pure CdS, but also elongate the lifetime of the charge carries. It was attributed to the mid-gap at the bottom of the CB of CdS. Subsequently, the highly dispersed Ni-Co LDH nanoplatelets on the surface of P-CdS nanorods could further improve the lifetime of electrons, due to the formation heterojunction between P-CdS and Ni-Co LDH. Thus, the visible-light catalytic H2 production of P-CdS/LDH was about 45 times that of the pure CdS [109]. Pirkarami et al. constructed 3-D CdS@NiCo LDH core–shell photoelectrocatalyst supported on the Ni foam for overall water splitting [179]. The Ni-Co LDH were grown vertically on 3-D CdS nanowires, resulting in an increased surface area and active sites on photoelectrocatalyst. Under visible light radiation, the electrons generated from the CdS core can been effectively transferred to the Ni-Co LDH shell and the gaseous products can been rapidly released, which is resulted from the highly-conductive shell and particular layered structure of CdS@NiCo LDH. Therefore, this novel catalyst showed a current density values of 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 132 mV for OER and 379 mV for HER respectively. Admittedly, the great developments have been made for the constructing efficient CdS/semiconductors photocatalysts. However, Cadmium is a big concern to environment and human body. In addition, severe photo-corrosion of CdS caused by holes also hinder their use in PEC-related applications [180]. Hence, restricting the leach of Cd and photo-corrosion in PC/PEC process is a primary issue. Potential solutions can been focused on two aspects: (1) constructing Z-scheme structure to accelerate the consumption of VB-holes on CdS; and (2) the core shell structure can be constructed to stabilize the CdS core. 4.3.2 MoSx/LDH Recently, MoSx materials including crystalline MoS2, Mo-S molecular complexes, and amorphous MoSx (2 < x < 3) have been identified as promising alternatives to noble metals for HER due to its high activity and earth-abundance [181–183]. LDH can also be regarded as active substrate for the uniform dispersion of MoS2 catalyst, which will not only enhance the catalyst distribution but also modify the electronic properties of the catalytic sites of deposited MoS2 catalysts, resulting in targeted photocatalytic H2 evolution performances. Parida et al. constructed an innovative type of 2D-2D direct Z-scheme heterojunction consisting of p-type MoS2 and n-type Ni-Fe LDH via electrostatic self-assembled chemistry and in situ hydrothermal method. Under visible light excitation, the intensities PL peak of terephthalic acid solution for MoS2/Ni-Fe LDH (MSLDH) heterojunction composites are obviously much higher than those in pure Ni-Fe LDH, which can be attributed to the construction of 2D and 2D heterojunction to improve OH production. Meanwhile, there were no intense peaks detected in MoS2, demonstrating its inefficiency in producing OH radicals. If the typical heterojunction system showed in Fig. 15 a is the photocatalytic reaction mechanism of MSLDH composites, the photogenerated holes are injected into the VB of MoS2 with positive potential from the VB of Ni-Fe LDH with negative potential, the negative positive VB of MoS2 in MSLDH than E(OH/OH− = +1.99 eV vs NHE) was not capable to generate OH. Alternatively, the Z-scheme heterostructure system could be demonstrated as the photocatalytic mechanism, and the electrons of Ni-Fe LDH conduction band can be transferred to the valence band of MoS2. This kind of Z-scheme structure is conducive for photoinduced charge carriers to transfer to the higher potential energy band rather than accumulate on the lower energy band, leaving photogenerated electrons and holes with high redox abilities for participating in surface redox reactions [62]. As a result, the average H2-evolution rate of Ni-Fe LDH alone was enhanced by 10.9 times, reaching up to 550.9 μmol/h by the decoration of MoS2 [94]. Notably, when the Mg-Al LDH nanoplate was utilized as a support for amorphous MoSx, neither Mg nor Al metal sites can initiate the chemical interaction with MoSx, and hence only a few of stacked MoSx nanoparticles were deposited on the edges of Mg-Al LDH, resulting in an uneven dispersion of the MoSx catalyst and then leading to low photocatalysis H2 evolution activity. While with Co-Al LDH as a support, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the obtained Co-Al LDH/MoSx catalyst was 13 times enhancement that is 450 μmol/h, than that of unsupported MoSx. Moreover, Co-Al LDH was superior to Ni-Al LDH and Mg-Al LDH as a support for anchoring MoSx catalysts for photocatalysis H2 evolution. The reaction between unsaturated Co sites and [MoS4]2- enabled the firm anchoring of formed MoSx on the one hand, and activated the unsaturated S atoms of MoSx by forming additional highly active CoMoS sites on the other hand [110]. Notably, metal sulfide/LDHs have recently exhibited a high photocatalytic H2 production activity. However, there are few examples of efficient metal sulfide core–shell nanostructured metal sulfide/LDHs photocatalytic system for hydrogen production so far. The interactions between the core and shell apparatuses can greatly enhance physical and chemical properties, provide active interfaces, and even produce new synergetic properties [184]. For example, other semiconductors with specific facets can further react with desirable {0001} facets of CdS nanoplates to generate core–shell nanohybrids through the self-assemble process, resulting in the reduction of large lattice mismatch at the interface [185]."
9,Carbon materials/LDH,"4.4 Carbon materials/LDH 4.4.1 C3N4/Ldh Recent literatures also revealed that highly stable coupling of g-C3N4 with other layered structure semiconductor material resulted in a remarkable enhancement for photocatalytic performances [186–191]. An intimate contact and a strong electronic coupling between common layered structures of C3N4 and LDH greatly increases the system’s photocatalytic activity [111,192]. Moreover, the long-term photostability and photocatalytic properties of LDH can be further improved via the support of highly stable g-C3N4 by the delocalized conjugated π structure, endow it with high charge separation and transportation [193–197]. The notable synergetic effect between LDH nanosheets and C3N4 led to many advantages of the resulting inorganic/organic hybrid composites (Fig. 16 ), such as: (i) assembling two layered semiconductors to generate a hybrid semiconductor catalyst not only separates the photoinduced electron-hole pairs but also produces active sites for the H2 and O2 evolution, (ii) the layered structure is established capable of absorbing water and swelling up to some extent which maximizes the surface area, and (iii) the high conductivity of g-C3N4/LDH nanohybrids is beneficial for its superior charge transportation capability [193,198,199]. For illustration, the pristine Ni-Al LDH material exhibited visible light photocatalytic activity with an H2 evolution rate of 3.17 μmol g-1h−1 in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA). In comparison, addition of a certain amount of C3N4 (30 wt% loading of C3N4 over LDH) onto the surfaces of the LDH resulted in a dramatical enhancement in photocatalytic H2 evolution, yielding 3170 μmol g-1h−1, which was 100 and 1000 times higher than pure g-C3N4 and pristine Ni-Al-LDH, respectively. Since the CB of C3N4 (−1.29 eV) was more negative than that of LDH (−0.94 eV), the photo-induced electrons at the CB of C3N4 could readily inject into the CB of LDH across its interfacial conjugation. Due to the more positive position of the VB edge potential of LDH (+1.57 eV), as soon as the photo-induced holes are formed on the VB of LDH, they can directly travel to the VB of C3N4 and then can be captured for the oxidation of TEOA. Therefore, the mechanism for separation the photogenerated electron-hole pairs followed the conventional type-II heterojunction [200]. Notably, the nitrogen evolution was always accompanied with the oxygen evolution, as the valance holes can be also utilized for self-oxidization of C3N4. Benefiting from the fast transformation of holes from C3N4 to Ni-Co LDHs surface, the selectivity for water oxidation for O2 production of C3N4 increased from 52% to 91% in the presence of LDHs [111]. The introduction of Fe-Ni-LDH onto the g-C3N4 nanosheets surface also led to an increased hydrogen production activity from 0.022 mmol g-1h-1 to 0.337 mmol g-1h−1. To further boost the performance of LDH/g-C3N4, the Ni-Fe LDHs were sulfuretted to Fe-Ni-S nanoparticles and subsequently deposited on the g-C3N4 surface by a hydrothermal method. For comparation, the Fe-Ni-S/g-C3N4 nanohybrids exhibited an increased hydrogen production activity to 1.152 mmol g-1h−1, which is about 25.6 and 4 times than that of Fe-Ni-LDH and Fe-Ni-LDH/C3N4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic capacity the of Fe-Ni-S/g-C3N4 for H2 production was attributed to the fact that the Fe-Ni-S transferred the photo-generated electron to the solution, and the S covalent binding with Fe-Ni alloy in the complexes served as the host lattice to inhibit the photo-corrosion [99]. The morphology of g-C3N4 could also improve its light absorption as well as charge separation, and thus optimize the photocatalytic activity. The in-situ growth of carbonate-intercalated Zn-Cr LDH over ruptured tubular structured graphite-like carbon nitride has been first constructed by Aboubakr et al. [39] through co-precipitation method. The higher amount of LDH in the Zn-Cr LDH/C3N4 resulted in lower band gap, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher electron-hole pairs separation ability. Exactly, the ability for separation of electron-hole pairs of the resulting Zn-Cr LDH/C3N4 was 5- and 2-folds higher relative to bulk g-C3N4 and ruptured tubular g-C3N4 [39]. The amount of CN loading in C3N4/LDH played a pivotal role for semiconductor photocatalysts, as the high contents of g-C3N4 may hindered the photocatalytic activities of the C3N4-LDH composites. The reasons have been reported in several aspects, including (i) an increase in the opacity of the catalyst, (ii) the larger size and thickness of layered structure, (iii) the weakened the bond between LDH and g-C3N4 leading to the damage of the heterojunction, (iv) the active sites that hindered the transportation of photo generated charges were diminished [193,198]. Additionally, morphology tuning of C3N4 can be used as a strategy to reduce the bandgap and enhance charge separation, thus improving photocatalysis performance of g-C3N4 [201,202]. Recent research studies on C3N4/LDH have been mainly focused on 2D/2D configuration (seen from table 2). Herein, we tentatively suggest a further investigation of 3D C3N4 (hollow spheres), 1D C3N4 (nanofibres), and 0D C3N4 (quantum dots) hybridization with LDH. There has been considerable research about photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction via C3N4/LDH materials [203]. But the research of photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production and nitrogen fixation over C3N4/LDH photocatalysts is quite limited, thus more studies in both fields are encouraged. 4.4.2 GO/Ldh GO/LDHs nanocomposites have wide applications ranging from supercapacitors [204], adsorbents for wastewater [205], CO2 reduction [206,207]. With particular attention, assembling RGO with Co-Al LDH can facilitate the separation rates of the photo-generated electrons and then extend the longevity of charge carriers. Under visible-light irradiation, the as-prepared CoAl-LDHs/RGO showed an enhanced H2 production of 1571.84 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 3.5-fold higher relative to pure CoAl-LDHs [208]. Parida et al. firstly prepared GO/C3N4 and then annealed at 550 °C under flow of N2, attaining a perfect N-doped graphene matrix. The ternary N-GO/C3N4/Ni-Fe LDH heterojunction was formed by an electrostatic self-assembly of Ni-Fe LDH nanosheets on the surface of GO/C3N4. The ternary heterojunction possessed the lower PL intensity, reduced arc of the Nyquist plot and higher photocurrent density than those of C3N4/LDH, demonstrating the importance of N-rGO solid state mediator in charge transportation of two semiconductors. In particular, both DMPO-O2 − and DMPO-OH high-intensity signals were observed by N-rGO/C3N4/Ni-Fe LDH. While the electrons on the CB of Ni-Fe LDH was not negative enough to produce O2 − and HO2 radicals. Hence, superoxide radicals were generated on the CB of C3N4, due to the more negative CB edge potential of C3N4 (−0.54 V vs. NHE). These findings demonstrated the electrons in the CB of Ni-Fe LDH can be recombined with holes generated by the VB of C3N4 over N-rGO surface. Hence, the N-rGO/C3N4/Ni-Fe LDH operated via the Z-scheme carrier transfer mechanism between Ni-Fe LDH and C3N4, which is different from the type-II mechanistic path exhibited by other C3N4/Ni-Fe LDH photocatalysts [99,193]. Accordingly, the N-rGO/C3N4/Ni-Fe LDH exhibited superior O2 production rate of 640 μmol g-1h−1 and H2 production rate of 1254 μmol g-1h−1, which are 1.44 times and 1.7 times higher than C3N4-LDH, respectively [113]. By assembling 2D graphdiyne (GYD) with 2D planar g-C3N4 and Ni-Fe LDH OER catalyst together, a new strongly attached ternary photoelectrode g-C3N4/GDY/Ni-Fe LDH can be fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. Due to the face-to-face contact between GDY and g-C3N4, a built-in electric field generated with a direction from g-C3N4 to GDY in equilibrium state. The photogenerated holes transferred easily from g-C3N4 to Ni-Fe LDH owing to the GDY behaving as a conductive electron transport “highway”, and ultimately oxidized the water to generate oxygen. As expected, a high photocurrent density of 178.66 µA cm−2 (at 1.4 V vs RHE), as well as a maximum IPCE of 3.59% at wavelength of 350 nm were obtained for this elaborately designed photoelectrode. Furthermore, the coupling interaction between 3d transition metal atoms and the carbon–carbon triple bonds and carboxyl bonds in GDY prevented its photo-corrosion, retaining about 95% of its photocurrent for 3600 s of stability testing [209]. In comparison with 2D graphene, 3D graphene aerogels matrix exhibits more efficiency for electron migration and charge separation. This remarkable advantage of 3D graphene aerogels was predominantly attributed to its unique hierarchically porous structure, which is beneficial for mass transfer, and reducing the transport limitation of electrolytes, together with other advantageous attributes such as multidimensional electron transport pathways, and outstanding electrical conductivity. Hou et al. constructed a 3D macroscopic hierarchical structure comprised of nitrogen deficient porous g-C3N4 (DPCN), employing 3D N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) as an electron mediator and Ni-Fe LDH as OEC. The surface area of the 3D DPCN/NRGO/NiFe-LDH hybrid sample was calculated and the amount was 85 m2 g−1, which was significantly higher than those of PCN (31 m2 g−1), DPCN (43 m2 g−1), and DPCN/NRGO (69 m2 g−1). Such type of layered aerogel feature and flexible structure not only induce more reaction sites and provide the transport pathways for efficient charge transfer but also decrease distance for the charge transportation, thus facilitating the charge separation efficiency. Furthermore, the nitrogen vacancies in C3N4 could extend the light absorption range via tuning the band position of C3N4 effectively. Benefiting from these advantageous features, a high photocurrent of 162.3 μA cm−2 at 1.4 V and a maximum incident photon-to-current efficiency of 2.5% at 350 nm under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved [142]."
10,Summary and outlook,"Designing and preparing highly active and stable photocatalysts are crucial to enhance the efficiency of OER and HER. Recently, Layered double hydroxide derived materials have shown prospective potential to be the candidate for photoanode/photocatalyst, which is resulted from their changeable 2D lamellar structure, various component of electrochemical active transition metal ions, visible light response, and tunable intrinsic electronic structure. The recent reports of the synthetic methods and application of LDH based materials in PC and PEC water splitting have been well summarized in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. This article has systematically summarized recent achievements in the engineering and fabrication of LDH-based nano-catalysts as well as highlighting structure–activity and chemical composition-performance relationships in PC/PEC water splitting reactions. We censoriously focused on the current progress and development of the most frequently used LDH based materials (Bin/ternary LDH, C3N4/LDH, TiO2/LDH, WO3/LDH, BiVO4/LDH, α-Fe2O3/LDH, Metal sulfide/LDH, and WO3/LDH) for photocatalytic and PEC water splitting. In spite of the significant achievements described above, opportunities and invigorating perspectives in the design, synthesis, and future research of nanostructured LDH-based photocatalysts, which is outlined in Fig. 17 . (i) Due to the outstanding adsorption capacity and high photocatalytic activity of LDHs toward to pollutants, it is trustworthy for LDHs catalysts that photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production when organic pollutants acted as the sacrificial agent to consume photogenic holes. However, we have found the studies on this topic were limited [210–212]. That is quite meaningful to apply LDH based photocatalyst for PC/PEC hydrogen generation and environmental remediation applications (degradation of emerging pollutants or the disinfection) simultaneously and more attempts in the field of are encouraged. (ii) There is a large space for us to fabricate “adaptive-interface” in the heterostructure of photoanodes. More effective integrating treatments for the interface optimization between the semiconductors and LDHs, which would greatly inhibit the charge carrier recombination and transfer across the intimate interfaces, will be potentially applied to realize integrated PEC systems. Feasible methods include fabricating defects or vacancies, nanostructuring, rational selection of conductive supports, photo-assisted electrodeposition technique, interfacial modulation, controlling particle structure and size, etc. (iii) Beyond the regular bulk hexagonal morphology of LDHs, 3D hierarchical morphology, can achieve reduction of diffusion length of electron-hole pairs, a high light-harvesting capabilities [213], the exposure of active sites, less agglomeration [214], and a rich aperture for gas transformation [215]. Therefore, the synthesis of LDH-based photocatalysts by the kinds of morphology engineering is worthwhile. As for a core–shell structure, the LDHs can act as either shell component or core materials. The wide selection of skeletons made 3D LDH (core@shell, yolk@shell) materials with some unique physicochemical properties, such as excellent hydrophilicity for adsorption of water molecules and the release of oxygen molecules [216]. (iv) The combination of nanosheet LDHs with other semiconductor generated binary hybrids, offering a reliable way for further improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Beyond binary hybrid materials, multi-hybrid LDH based nanostructures may provide outstanding properties. We can see from Table 2 and Table 3, the current research studies have been focused on the binary systems. Note that Graphene Quantum Dots, which has become one of the hottest topics for material science, are capable of decomposing water for H2/O2 evolution under visible light illumination [217,218], the elaboration of single-layer LDHs/Graphene Quantum Dots based ternary materials is expected to be able to provide more opportunities for enhanced PC/PEC performance. (v) At present, the transformations of chemical states of metal ions in LDHs during the PEC water splitting process are the main route to clarify the OER mechanism. However, the evolution of the surface structure of LDHs, the component variations within bin/ternary hybrid systems, as well as the formation of intermediates have not been fully addressed. In this context, in situ structural and electrical characterization techniques are urgently needed for deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms as well as reaction processes of the PEC-HER and PEC-OER at the molecular/atomic level. It is highly desirable to address the above issues in order to better realize the control of the types and quantities of active sites. (vi) DFT method enable the full examination of structure–property relationships of LDHs catalysts [219–221] and Xu et al have already realized the effective theoretical and experimental combined method to screen possible LDH photocatalysts for oxygen generation in PC cell [85,222]. In a more recent study, Sun and co-workers offered an intelligent method that comprised of a integration of machine learning and optimization to guide DFT, offered an intelligent method that comprised of a integration of machine learning and optimization to guide DFT, and the optimized DFT was applied to screen the covalency competition in spinel oxides, with a mean absolute error of 0.05 eV [223]. Bear these encouraging findings in mind, active machine learning across intermetallics is definitely of significant potential to fabricate and screen LDH catalysts for PC/PEC water splitting."
