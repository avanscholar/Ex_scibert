0,Introduction,"Alcohols are very important building blocks for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 1 Although many applications require racemic alcohols, the need for enantiomerically pure alcohols is growing because of their significance as intermediates for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and advanced materials. 2 Catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones has recently emerged as a viable means of synthesizing chiral alcohols. 3 Due to the operational simplicity, the easy availability of reductants, and the high enantioselectivities, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of ketones has been extensively studied during the last decade. 4 The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones has recently been developed as an alternative method to asymmetric hydrogenation for the production of chiral alcohols. 5 Hydrogen transfer reactions are mild procedures for the reduction of ketones in which a substrate-selective catalyst transfers hydrogen between the substrate and a hydrogen donor or acceptor, respectively. Furthermore, the donor (e.g. 2-propanol) and the acceptor (e.g. a ketone) are environmentally friendly and also easy to handle. 6 For the past ten years, an efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones has been developed using chiral Rh(I), Ir(I) or Ru(II) complexes as catalyst precursors and iso-PrOH/KOH as the hydride source. 7 There have been a large number of chiral ligands prepared for asymmetric transfer hydrogenations. 8 Chiral β-amino alcohols are useful building blocks for biologically active compounds 9 as well as important auxiliaries and ligands in asymmetric synthesis. 10 Amino alcohols continue to be of importance in modern synthetic chemistry, not only because of their biological properties, but also because of their wide range of synthetic applications. 11 Hence, the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched amino alcohols has been extensively studied. In particular, amino alcohols derivative catalysts have received much attention and used in many asymmetric catalysis reactions, and they have shown powerful utilities in the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. 12 We have had an ongoing interest in the synthesis and use of optically active ligands in asymmetric catalysis, especially phosphorus-based and related chiral modifiers. 13 Many effective chiral ligands, especially phosphinites, aminophosphines, and phosphine, have been synthesized. 14 In recent years, we have reported the synthesis and applications of a number of modified Ru(II) catalysts for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, which contain well designed groups formed by the reactions between chiral ligand components and the η6-arene ring. 15 Herein we report the synthesis of novel phosphinite ligands and their application in the Ru(II)-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various ketones. A comparison of the results obtained with the newly synthesized ligands and those of the corresponding Ru(II) complexes is also discussed. The comparison concerns the structural features of ligands, four of their ruthenium complexes, and the hydrogenation results. Furthermore, a discussion concerning the role played by phosphinite coordination on the ruthenium center and the possible mechanism of this transformation is also included."

2,Synthesis and characterization of the amino alcohols and phosphinite ligands,"2.1 Synthesis and characterization of the amino alcohols and phosphinite ligands The strategy used herein was to prepare modularly designed, highly active phosphinite ligands based on amino alcohol skeletons. Initially, (S)-(+)-2-hydroxypropyl p-toluenesulfonate was synthesized with the reaction of (R)-α-phenylethylamine and (S)-(+)-2-hydroxypropyl p-toluenesulfonate under an argon atmosphere with the described procedure and the compound identified using 1H and 13C NMR, etc., which were consistent with the data previously reported in the literature. 16 The reaction of (S)-(+)-2-hydroxypropyl p-toluenesulfonate with (R)-α-phenylethylamine was concluded with the product (S)-1-[N-(R)-α-phenylethyl]amino-2-propanole 1 with good yield. Since C 2-symmetric catalysts generally enhance the enantioselectivity of the reaction by reducing the number of competing diastereomeric pathways because of the homotopic nature of the ring coordination sites of the complexes formed by the catalysts, compound (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-hydroxypropyl][(1R)-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-ol 2 was also synthesized with the ring opening of enantiopure terminal (S)-propylene oxide with (R)-1-phenylethylamine 17 (Scheme 1 ). It is well-known that epoxides are versatile building blocks that have been extensively used in the synthesis of complex organic compounds. Their utility as valuable intermediates has been further expanded upon with the advent of asymmetric catalytic methods for their synthesis. 18 The products were fully characterized by several spectroscopic methods: LC-ESI-IT-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and elemental analysis. The assignment of the 1H chemical shifts was derived from 2D HH-COSY spectra and the appropriate assignment of the 13C chemical shifts from APT and 2D HMQC spectra. The results were given in Section 4 with full details. Furthermore, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and LC-ESI-IT-TOF MS spectra of amino alcohols also given in Supporting Information (SI). To investigate the influence of the relative configuration of the modular skeleton of ligands, the mono and C 2-symmetric bidentate phosphinites were prepared in accordance with the method reported in the literature. 19 The synthetic procedure for the preparation of the phosphinite ligands 20 is shown in Scheme 1. Chiral monodendate C 1-symmetric ligand 3 was synthesized by hydrogen abstraction from described chiral amino alcohols 1 by Et3N and the subsequent reaction with one equivalent of Ph2PCl in anhydrous CH2Cl2 under inert argon atmosphere. To improve and compare the catalytic activities of C 1 and C 2-symmetric ligands, a novel C 2-symmetric phosphinite ligand (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yl diphenylphosphinite 4, which has a modular skeleton, was prepared via hydrolysis. 21 Typical spectra of these ligands are illustrated in Supporting information (SI) and for details see the Section 4. It well known that phosphinites are generally unstable and decompose gradually to give an oxide and the hydrolysis product diphenylphosphinous acid, Ph2P(O)H. Furthermore, the 31P–{1H} NMR spectrum also displays the formation of PPh2PPh2 and P(O)Ph2PPh2, as indicated by signals at about δ −15.8 ppm as singlet and δ 35.2 ppm and at δ −21.4 ppm as doublets with 1 J (PP) 224 Hz, respectively. 22 However, a solution of these ligands in CDCl3, prepared under anaerobic conditions, is stable (up to 48 h) and decomposes very slowly to give oxide and the hydrolysis product diphenylphosphinous acid, Ph2P(O)H. 23 These two compounds are also very stable in air atmosphere for up to 24 h because of the well-designed structures. The progress of this reaction was conveniently followed by 31P–{1H} NMR spectroscopy. The signals of the starting materials PPh2Cl at δ = 81.0 ppm disappeared and new singlets appeared downfield due to the phosphinite ligands. The 31P–{1H} NMR spectra of the free ligands are 24 in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds, respectively. 25 The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of these ligands are also conclusive. The resonance assignments were made on the basis of 1H–1H COSY, NOESY, and 1H–13C COSY experiments. Typical spectra of these ligands are illustrated in Supporting information (SI) and for details see the Section 4. Following a similar procedure described by, Regadec et al., 26 ruthenium(II) complexes of the phosphinite ligands, (S)-1-[N-(R)-α-phenylethyl]amino-2-propanol, 1 and (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-hydroxypropyl][(1R)-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-ol 2 were readily prepared in quantitative yields by reacting the appropriate phosphorus ligands with either [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 or [Ru(η6-benzene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 precursor as outlined in Scheme 1. The ability of dimers {[Ru(arene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2} to form mono- or binuclear complexes of general formula [Ru(η6-arene)Cl2L] is well-known. 27 For the synthesis of ruthenium(II) complexes 5 and 7, [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 was initially chosen as a starting material, which was prepared from the reaction of the commercially available α-phellandrene(5-isoprophyl-2-methylcyclohexa-1,3-diene) with RuCl3. 28 The p-cymene ligand is particularly informative with respect to the symmetry of the three legged fragment. 29 Especially, one of the most available arene ligands in ruthenium chemistry is p-cymene, whose NMR signals are very sensitive to the symmetry of organometallic compound. 30 Thus, when it is η6-coordinated to a ML2L′ metal fragment (Cs symmetry) the 1H and 13C NMR spectra are very different from that of η6-coordinated to a ML1L2L′ fragment (C 1 symmetry). 31 In this case, the steric hindrance of amino alcohol phosphinite ligands seems to prevent free rotation of p-cymene ligand around the arene-Ru axis. 32 In most cases, the shape, chemical shifts and coupling constants of NMR signals, together with the complete assignment of signals (by using COSY and NOESY NMR techniques) of the p-cymene group can give valuable information about the symmetry of the complexes. 33 In addition, the detailed analysis of NOE interaction between p-cymene and other ligands can give valuable information about the relative orientation of different groups in the molecule and thus establish the stereochemistry of the complex (for details see the Section 4). After the preparation of the second precursor [Ru(η6-benzene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 by the reaction of cyclo-1.3-hexadiene with RuCl3 in aqueous solution, we synthesized (2S)-1-{[(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yl diphenylphosphinito[dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium (II)], 6 and (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yldiphe-nyl phosphinitobis[dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)] 8 complexes with high yields. The reactions of Ru(II) precursors with ligands are depicted in Scheme 1. The poor solubility of the starting benzene derivative causes a decrease in the yields of the complexes 6 and 8, which are more conveniently prepared by the reaction of the phosphinites with the monomeric adduct [RuCl2(C6H6)(NCCH3)]. 34 The initial color change, i.e., from clear orange to deep red, was attributed to the dimer cleavage most probably by the phosphinite or bis(phosphinite) ligand. 35 All complexes were isolated as indicated by singlets in their 31P–{1H} NMR spectra at approximately (δ) 106–109 ppm, in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds (Fig. 1 ). 36 It is noteworthy that the 31P–{1H} NMR signals of ligands and complexes do not differ significantly. 37 These complexes are highly soluble in CH2Cl2, slightly in hexane, so they can be crystallized from CH2Cl2/hexane solutions. The structure of P-coordinated complexes 5–8 is supported by spectroscopic data; all 1H, 31P–{1H} NMR and 13C NMR spectra are given in the Supporting Information (SI). The 1H NMR spectra data of complexes are consistent with the proposed structures. The 1H NMR spectra of these compounds clearly exhibit signals corresponding to the aromatic rings. The arene resonances are well resolved, as found in the previously reported for mononuclear or binuclear arene complexes. In the 13C–{1H} NMR spectra of complexes, J(31P–13C) coupling constants of the carbons of the phenyl rings were observed, which are in agreement with the literature. 38 In the compounds, the coupling between i-carbons and the phosphorus is relatively large, at approximately 1 J (PC) 50 Hz, while the coupling between o-carbon and the phosphorus relatively small, at approximately 2 J (PC) 10 Compounds 5–8 were further confirmed by IR spectroscopy as well as microanalysis, and found to be consistent to expected to structures (for details see the Section 4)."
3,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"2.2 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones It is generally assumed that transition-metal-catalyzed hydrogen transfers involve metal hydrides as key intermediates. All ruthenium complexes 5–8 most likely follow the well-established mechanism via a metal alkoxide intermediate and β-elimination. 39 It is well-known that chlorides can be easily replaced by a hydride with an alkoxide displacement/β-hydride elimination sequence. 40,41 This mechanism is depicted in Scheme 2 for catalyst 7 as a representative example. According to the literature, Ru(II)-arenes are good precursors for catalytic transfer hydrogenation processes. 42 Among the recently developed efficient transition-metal-catalysts, 43 is the Ru(II)-TsDPEN system reported by Noyori et al., 44 who suggested that an NH moiety in the ligand may promote a cyclic transition state through hydrogen bonding to a ketone substrate. 45 It therefore appears that the formation of a metal–ligand bifunctional catalyst can greatly increase the substrate affinity to the catalyst active site and induce high enantioselectivity. Earlier results from Noyori et al. and Lemaire et al. with different ligands also showed a similar ‘NH’ effect (Fig. 1). 46 Thus, we expected that the new complexes would form a cyclic transition state similar to that suggested by Noyori, Backvall, Morris, etc., and highly enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of simple ketones might be realized. 47 Complexes 5–8 were selected as precatalysts, i PrOH/KOH as a reducing system, and acetophenone as a model substrate (Scheme 3 ). Thus, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our Ru(II) complexes, we first deeply investigated the optimal conditions starting with 2-acetophenone as a standard test reaction. Results for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones with catalysts, 5–8 are collected in Table 1 . Catalytic experiments were carried out under argon using standard Schlenk-line techniques. To an i PrOH solution of each complex, appropriate amounts of acetophenone and KOH/ i PrOH solution were added at room temperature. The solution was stirred, and the reaction was monitored by GC. The reactions proceeded to give (R)- or (S)-1-phenylethanol in 10–20% conversion with 56–87% ee’s after stirring at room temperature for 72 h. An increase in the reaction time to 120 h resulted in 17–43% conversion with 54–85% ee’s. Due to the reversibility at room temperature, a prolonged reaction time led to a slight decrease in enantioselectivity. However, when the reactions were carried out at 82 °C for less than 1 h, all complexes showed satisfying catalytic activities (up to 396 TOF values) and enantioselectivities (Table 1, entries 9–12). Although the lower reaction temperatures should have a beneficial effect on the enantioselectivities, slightly higher asymmetric inductions (70–93% ee’s) were observed at 82 °C, which may attributed to the shorter reaction times. These results clearly indicate that the reaction temperature plays an important role on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. The complexes were very active catalysts, leading to quantitative conversions to (R)- or (S)-1-phenyl ethanol with a catalyst/base ratio of 1:5 (Table 1, entries 13–16). A control experiment in the absence of base did not lead to meaningful conversion (Entries 5–8). Replacing KOH with NaOH slightly decreased both the reaction rate and enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 9–12[e]). Increasing or decreasing the base:Cat. ratio from 5:1 to 9:1 or 3:1 slightly decreased the reaction rate with a slight loss of enantiomeric purity of the product (Table 1, entries 13–16). From the results, it can be seen that generally, complexes 7 and 8, which include C 2-symmetric phosphinite skeleton showed higher catalytic activity than complexes 5 and 6 which do not contain the C 2-symmetric phosphinite skeleton. It has been suggested that the C 2-symmetric catalysts enhance the enantioselectivity of the reaction by reducing the number of competing diastereomeric pathways because of the homotopic nature of the ring coordination sites of the complexes formed by the catalysts. 19 Furthermore, the complexes (2S)-1-{[(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yl diphenylphosphinito[dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium (II)], 6 and (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yldiphe-nylphosphinitobis[dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)], 8 which have a benzene fragment are more active than complexes 5 and 7 which include p-cymene fragment. The good ee obtained for the initial reduction of acetophenone motivated us to keep employing Ru-benzene complexes. These results clearly indicate that the skeleton of the ligands and the fragment attached to the Ru(II) center are responsible for the high conversion (up to 99%) and enantioselectivity (up to 93 ee %), whatever the exact reaction mechanism. The best results were obtained in the (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yldiphenylpho-sphinitobis[dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)] 8 catalytic system with up to 93% ee and 99% conversion. Under the optimum conditions, aromatic ketones are hydrogenated with high enantioselectivity and the same mode face selection. Table 2 illustrates conversions of the reduction performed in a 0.1 M of i-PrOH solution containing 5–8 and KOH (Ketone/Cat./KOH = 100:1:5). One can easily see from the results that a range of acetophenone derivatives can be hydrogenated with high enantioselectivities. Substitution of the phenyl ring of the acetophenone substrate led to a marked change in the catalytic activity and ee %, i.e., the electronic properties (the nature and position) of the substituents on the phenyl ring of the ketone caused the changes in the reduction rate and enantioselectivity. It is well-known that the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents of the aryl ring of the ketone decreases the electron density of the CO bond so that the activity is improved, thus resulting in easier hydrogenation. 48 Thus, the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as CF3 or NO2, of the aryl ring of the ketone, resulted in improved activity with good enantioselectivity (Table 2, entries 1–16). On the contrary, the introduction of an electron-donating group, such as a methyl or methoxy group, decelerates the reaction with similar enantioselectivities, whatever the position of substitution (Table 3 , entries 17–36). It can be seen from Table 2, that ortho-substituted acetophenones can dramatically increase the enantioselectivity, while meta- and para-substitution to acetophenones have a detrimental effect. As expected, the lowest enantioselectivity was observed in case of p-methoxyacetophenone, whereas the highest one was found in case of o-methoxyacetophenone (96% ee). Overall, the chiral efficiency attains a very high level in the asymmetric reduction of aromatic ketones and compares well with the recently discovered catalyst systems. 49 Due to their efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives, complexes 5–8 was further investigated in the transfer hydrogenation of a variety of ketones to converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols under the optimization conditions. Table 1 shows several examples of the asymmetric reductions tried using this method. The reaction of methyl/alkyl and methyl/aryl ketones gave the chiral alcohol products in acceptable chemical yields and enantiomeric purity. We carried out further experiments to study the influence of bulkiness of the alkyl groups on the catalytic activity and selectivity (Table 3, entries 1–16). A variety of simple aryl/alkyl ketones were transformed into the corresponding secondary alcohols, and it was found that the activity and selectivity were highly dependent on the steric hindrance of the alkyl group. Reaction of methyl/alkyl ketones possessing a bulky alkyl substituent proceeded rather sluggish and led to a decrease in enantioselectivity. As the bulkiness of the alkyl group increases from ethyl to sec-butyl, the enantioselectivity decreases. Lower activity and enantioselectivity were obtained in the case of methyl sec-butyl ketone (Entries 13–16, 61–80% ee), 50,51 as expected. When the size of alkyl group increased, the activity and selectivity decreased. 52,53 In addition, as can be seen from Table 3, the highest enantioselectivity was observed with 1-naphthyl methyl ketone (up to 97% ee, entries 17–20). In that case, a high TOF value (TOF: 396) and the highest enantioselectivity, up to 99% ee, were obtained for catalyst (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yldiphenylphosphinitobis[dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)] 8. Furthermore, hydrogenation of the ketones including cyclohexyl group was very slow and the enantioselectivities were remarkably low (Table 3, entries 25–32)."
4,Conclusions,"Herein we have reported new chiral phosphinite ligands, which form highly efficient and practical catalysts with ruthenium precursor for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aryl/alkyl ketones. High conversion and enantioselectivity were obtained in the catalytic reaction. We believe that for ligands 1 and 2, the NH moiety of the coordinated ligand may behave as suggested in Noyoriꞌs system, in which hydrogen bonding exists between ketone substrates and ligands. The high catalytic activity and enantioselectivity for this kind of ligands show great potential for further exploring similar system and achieving outstanding stereoselectivity for a wider scope of ketone substrates. The simplicity and efficiency make it an excellent choice as a catalyst for the practical preparation of highly valued alcohols via catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones."
