0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an essential raw material for chemical, petrochemical, petrol, iron and steel industries [1]. In recent years, hydrogen has become more interesting due to its application as an energy vector, particularly for its use in fuel cells. However, as the hydrogen molecule cannot be found free in nature, it should be obtained from other energy sources using various technologies. Though, depending on the raw material used, the hydrogen production could origin big amounts of CO2. Using renewable raw materials as ethanol, CO2 formed could be recycled by photosynthesis phenomena and, in this way, CO2 emissions would be reduced. Besides being a renewable raw material, ethanol presents other advantages as its almost null toxicity, its high content of hydrogen in its molecule and the possibility of being produced from sugarcane and lignocellulosic waste. On the other hand, steam reforming is the most popular process in the world to produce hydrogen [2]. Particularly, ethanol steam reforming (Eq. (1)) is a strong endothermic process and, ideally, only CO2 and H2 are produced. However, non desirable products appear during hydrogen production as CH4 and CO. Ethanol is consumed mainly by dehydrogenation and dehydration, to acetaldehyde and ethylene respectively. Low temperatures and low space times favor the formation of these intermediates [3,4]. Due to the strong endothermicity of the process a great amount of energy must be provided. Heat could be provided externally, using the same alcohol as a fuel in a burner, or pure oxygen or air could be fed to burn a portion of the ethanol inside of the reactor [5]. To achieve thermal neutrality, 0.61 mol of oxygen per mole of ethanol must be fed. This process is known as autothermal reforming of ethanol (Eq. (2)). (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ H = 173 kJ / mol (2) C 2 H 5 OH + 1.78 H 2 O + 0.61 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 4.78 H 2 Δ H = 0 The first thermodynamic study of the ethanol–water system was that of Garcia and Laborde [6]. The operation region where carbon can be formed was estimated considering a homogeneous system. They applied the nonstoichiometric thermodynamic analysis. The second work was carried out by Vasudeva et al. [7]. They obtained the same results except in the coal-forming region since they included the reaction of carbon formation in the system under study. Years after, Mas et al. [8] carried out a stoichiometric study on the same process. They analyzed two different scenarios: (i) CO as primary product and (ii) CO2 as primary product. Those results helped to interpret experimental results with the objective of elucidating reaction mechanism. Other authors analyzed the ethanol–water system using Gibbs energy minimization method, with emphasis on the coal formation [5,9,10]. With respect to the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol, Liu et al. [11] studied the equilibrium composition using the Gibbs energy minimization method. They obtained thermal–neutral conditions for three different temperatures, 700 K, 900 K and 1100 K. A different approach to the thermodynamic of the autothermal steam reforming of ethanol was published by Rabenstein and Hacker [12]. The goal of this paper is a comparison between the ethanol steam reforming, the ethanol partial oxidation and the oxidative steam reforming. Jin et al. [13] studied the hydrogen production via oxidative steam reforming of ethanol in a dense tubular membrane reactor. The reactor was divided into multi-sub-reactors, and the Gibbs free energy minimization sub-model in ASPEN PLUS was employed to simulate the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol process in the subreactors. In this work, a detailed thermodynamic study of the autothermal reforming of ethanol using the total Gibbs method is presented. Productions of H2, CO2, CH4 and CO are analyzed. The study of carbon formation was carried out considering carbon (C) into the set of species chosen for the analysis of the equilibrium composition."
1,Theory,"The estimation of equilibrium products distribution could be performed by a stoichiometric method that is based on the calculation of equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions involved. When the reactions scheme is unknown, a more direct method is based on minimizing the total Gibbs energy, d G T , P t = 0. This method should incorporate as restriction the conservation of the total number of atoms of each element. First, a single phase system will be analyzed and then the presence of carbon will be considered."
2,Gibbs function minimization,"2.1 Gibbs function minimization It seeks to minimize the Gibbs function, Eq. (3), at constant pressure and temperature, subject to the restrictions given by the balance of elements, Eq. (4). (3) G = ∑ i μ i n i i = 1 , 2 , … , N C (4) ∑ i n i a i k − b k = 0 k = 1 , 2 , … , N e In the case of the autothermal reforming of ethanol, elements are: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (N e = 4); and the species are: ethanol, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water, acetaldehyde, ethylene, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon where appropriate. The minimum in G, which is a scalar function, is found when its gradient in species space is zero, Eq. (5). (5) ∂ G ∂ n i = 0 i = 1 , 2 , … , N C Eq. (5) is by definition of chemical potential, ∂ G ∂ n i | T , P , n j ≠ i = μ i , or by derivation of Eq. (3), ∑ j ( ∂ μ i ∂ n j n j ) + μ i ."
3,Method of Lagrange multipliers,"2.2 Method of Lagrange multipliers Equation (5) is added to the constraint, Eq. (4), according to the Lagrange multipliers method, Eq. (6). By adding nil, the objective function Λ still is equal to G, but now restrictions have been added to the mathematical problem. The quantity of multipliers is N e. In this way, the space of solutions is expanded from N C to N C + N e, because multipliers are unknown. Now, it is necessary to make the gradient of the expanded objective function Λ equal to zero, Eqs. (7) and (8). (6) Λ = G R T + ∑ k [ λ k ∑ i ( n i a i k − b k ) ] (7) ∂ Λ ∂ n i = 0 i = 1 , 2 , … , N C (8) ∂ Λ ∂ λ k = 0 k = 1 , 2 , … , N e Equations (7) and (8) take the following form, (9) ∂ Λ ∂ n i = μ i R T + ∑ k a i k λ k i = 1 , 2 , … , N C (10) ∂ Λ ∂ λ k = ∑ i ( n i a i k − b k ) k = 1 , 2 , … , N e The last Ne equations, Eq. (10), are the restrictions, which are now included to the system being solved. The problem is to numerically find values of ni and λk that make F zero. Because this function is not linear, a scheme must be implemented to find the roots. If the Newton–Raphson method is used, it will be necessary to find the Jacobian matrix of F, Λ Hessian. Hence, the expressions of ∂ 2 Λ / ∂ n i ∂ n j , ∂ 2 Λ / ∂ n i ∂ λ k and ∂ 2 Λ / ∂ λ k ∂ λ m must be developed. To obtain the Jacobian matrix, J, it is necessary to calculate the Hessian of Λ, Eqs. (11)–(13). To obtain the Hessian, the functionality between the chemical potential, μi , with each nj is needed, Eqs. (14) and (15). (11) ∂ 2 Λ ∂ n i ∂ n j = 1 R T ∂ μ i ∂ n j i , j = 1 , 2 , … , N C (12) ∂ 2 Λ ∂ n i ∂ λ k = a i k k = 1 , 2 , … , N e (13) ∂ 2 Λ ∂ λ k ∂ λ m = 0 m = 1 , 2 , … , N e (14) μ i = μ i θ ( T , P ) + R T ln ( P ) + R T ln ( n i n T ) P = 1 atm (15) n T = ∑ i n i The first two terms of the right member of Eq. (14) are constants because they just depend of T and P, Eqs. (16) and (17). (16) ∂ μ i ∂ n j = R T ( δ i j n i − 1 n T ) (17) ∂ 2 μ i ∂ n j ∂ n r = R T ( − δ i j δ i r n i 2 + 1 n T 2 ) Eq. (17) does not need to be calculated because by Eq. (11) the Hessian of Λ turns to be the gradient of μ. Finally, the function F is described in Eq. (18) and the Jacobian matrix is detailed in Eq. (19). (18) F ̲ = ( 1 R T μ ̲ + A ̲ ̲ λ ̲ A ̲ ̲ n ̲ − b ̲ ) (19) J ̲ ̲ = ( 1 R T ∇ μ ̲ A ̲ ̲ T A ̲ ̲ 0 ̲ ̲ ) As the Jacobian matrix was calculated above, now the solution can be obtained by Newton–Raphson method, Eq. (20). (20) ( n ̲ λ ̲ ) ( k + 1 ) = ( n ̲ λ ̲ ) ( k ) − ( J ̲ ̲ − 1 • F ̲ ) ( k ) This scheme is repeated for each temperature, taking as the initial value the last one which was calculated at the previous temperature. This way the algorithm is much more efficient."
4,Presence of carbon,"2.3 Presence of carbon In this case the solid phase should be distinguished from the gaseous phase. The following assumptions will be considered for the carbon. 1 Low vapor pressure, n C g = 0 , 2 Graphitic form, μ C 298 K = 0 , 3 Pure carbon in the solid phase, unitary activity. Thus, in gas chemical potential expression, Eq. (14), the total number of moles, Eq. (15), does not include carbon, hypothesis 1, Eq. (21). From hypothesis 2 and 3, carbon chemical potential, Eq. (22), is independent from the amount of any other species in any phase, Eq. (23). (21) ∂ μ i ∂ n C = 0 (22) μ C = μ C θ ( T ) (23) ∂ μ C ∂ n i = 0 On the other hand, Eq. (4) does not distinguish between phases, neither does Gibbs function, Eq. (3). Maintaining N C as the number of gaseous species, elements of F are obtained from Eqs. (9) and (10), taking into account that Eq. (9) has now N C + 1 elements and matrix A has the extra column N C + 1. This approach cannot restrict n C to positive values. Therefore, this problem is solved applying Eq. (20) with changes in ∇ ¯ μ ¯ and F until a negative value of n C is detected. This value must be the last one of the iteration at a certain temperature, not one in an intermediate step. In this case the system is modified in the following way, − n C = 0 − (N C + 1) row and column of Jacobian matrix are annulled, except the (N C + 1, N C + 1) element which will be 1. − The N C + 1 element of F is canceled. The system is always solved for the case in which carbon is present and when n C becomes negative modifications explained above are applied."
5,Results and discussion,"Based on experimental results, species considered in this study are: ethanol, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water, acetaldehyde, ethylene, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon. Thermodynamic analysis was carried out varying temperature from 400 K to 1200 K. Reactor feed conditions are described with water to ethanol molar ratio (R) and oxygen to ethanol molar ratio (Ro). R was varied between 0 and 9, while Ro was studied in the range of 0–1.5 with increments of 0.25. In the whole range of temperatures studied, under R and Ro values analyzed, ethanol conversion was higher than 99.9%, so it can be considered that ethanol conversion was complete in all cases. Production of the intermediates, acetaldehyde and ethylene, in the equilibrium was insignificant. Production of H2, CH4, CO and CO2 as well as carbon formation are defined in Table 1 . Results on hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production, and carbon formation, are detailed below."
6,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production For the whole range of feed conditions analyzed, hydrogen production increases with temperature. If we study this behavior on the ethanol steam reforming reaction (Ro = 0), we can see that a maximum appears for R > 3 (Fig. 1 a). The maximum occurs at a lower temperature when increasing R value. Moreover the value of the maximum grows up in the same direction. The addition of oxygen in the feed discourages hydrogen production as expected. In Fig. 1b results for Ro = 0.5 are shown. For T > 600 K the value of hydrogen production starts to be significant and from this value it increases rapidly to the aforementioned maximum. Fig. 2 shows the effect of adding oxygen in the feed for R = 5. This value of water to ethanol molar ratio was chosen as a reference based on the simulation of the hydrogen production process for being used in a PEM cell. Reactions involved in this process are ethanol steam reforming (ESR), water gas shift reaction (WGS) and preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (COPrOx). Water to ethanol molar ratio and reaction temperature affect the efficiency of the first reactor and, therefore, the whole process. High temperatures and high R values negatively affect the efficiency. It was found that with a ratio of 5, good efficiency accompanied by high hydrogen yield is achieved [14]. For the whole range of Ro studied curves of hydrogen production vs. temperature exhibit the same behavior until the maximum in hydrogen production is reached. The temperature at which the maximum occurs decreases with the increase in oxygen in the feed, and as already stated the value of that maximum decreases."
7,Methane production,"3.2 Methane production The only product that competes with H2 for hydrogen atoms is methane. Then, their productions are expected to present opposite behaviors. When there is not oxygen in the feed stream, at low temperatures the amount of methane is important, and then decreases to negligible values at approximately 900 K. This behavior is consistent with that of hydrogen and agrees with those results previously reported in Ref. [6,8]. For R > 5 methane production decreases as the amount of water in the feed increases. This behavior is consistent with that obtained experimentally by Comas et al. [3]. This occurs in the whole range of temperatures. However, for lower values of water to ethanol molar ratio the behavior is different (Fig. 3 ). When the value of R is increased from 0 to 3, methane production becomes higher in almost the whole range of temperatures. When R is increased from 3 to 4, methane production increases from 400 K to 500K. For temperatures higher than 500 K the behavior of methane production decreases when the amount of water in the feed increases from 3 mol of water to 4 mol of water per mol of ethanol in the feed. Evidently for R > 5, water in the feed promotes the consumption of methane by the steam reforming reaction. In Fig. 4 the effect of the oxygen in the feed over the methane production for R = 5 is shown. The increase in the content of oxygen in the feed stream decreases the production of methane. Also the temperature at which methane almost disappears decreases with the addition of oxygen, probably due to methane combustion."
8,Carbon monoxide production,"3.3 Carbon monoxide production Considering that the hydrogen produced could be used in PEM fuel cells, it is desirable that the content of CO in the mixture obtained in the reforming reactor is sufficiently low to reduce the purification costs of the mixture. For all feed conditions under study CO production increases with temperature (Fig. 5 a). It is observed that for R values bigger than 2, CO production decreases as water content in the feed increases. For lower values of R, it presents an opposite behavior. When the amount of oxygen in the feed is increased the CO produced at low values of R becomes more important than the CO produced at higher values of R for the same Ro value (Fig. 5). The increase in water content in the feed favors the WGS. This explains the drop in the CO production when R is bigger than 2 and there is no oxygen in the feed. Adding oxygen causes the production of water by total oxidation, which enables WGS to take place, even when R is lower than 2. The consumption of CO occurs even if R is equal to 0. As the oxygen to ethanol molar ratio increases, the production of CO decreases because the total oxidation becomes more important as the oxygen increases. It should be noted that below 700 K the CO production is negligible for all conditions studied."
9,Carbon dioxide production,"3.4 Carbon dioxide production For all conditions studied, the carbon dioxide production presents a maximum over the temperature, which is attributable to the reversibility of the WGS reaction. This maximum occurs at approximately constant temperature for all water to ethanol molar ratios. By increasing the water content in the feed, the amount of CO2 produced increases. The amount of CO2 produced per mol of ethanol in the feed significantly increases when Ro is increased from 0 to 1. This increase may be due to the oxidation of CO to CO2 which is favored by increasing the amount of oxygen in the feed. The effect of adding oxygen in the feed is clearly seen in Fig. 6 . There is a shift to lower temperature values at which the maximum in CO2 production occurs by increasing Ro."
10,Carbon formation,"3.5 Carbon formation An important phenomenon that occurs during the hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming reaction is carbon deposition over catalyst active sites. This phenomenon causes the decrease in the activity and/or the increase in the reactor pressure drop making impossible the process to continue. Thermodynamic study proves that water to ethanol molar ratios lower than 4 and low temperatures favor coal formation (Fig. 7 ). When R is bigger than 5 there is no carbon formation. The addition of oxygen in the feed contributes to reduce carbon formation in all conditions under study. In Fig. 8 is represented the effect of adding O2 at 600 K for different values of R. Reducing carbon deposition, the useful life of catalysts could be extended. Comparing carbon formation regions obtained in previous works of our group [6,8] with the result obtain in the present work it can be observed that this new region is in agreement with that calculated by Mas et al. (Fig. 9 ). It can be concluded that considering carbon into the set of species a result closer to the stoichiometric method is obtained."
11,Conclusions,"A thermodynamic study of autothermal reforming of ethanol using the Gibbs energy minimization method was presented. It was found that from the product set supposed, ethylene and acetaldehyde are almost negligible under studied conditions. Main products are H2, CO2, CH4 and CO. Ethanol and oxygen are fully converted. For water/ethanol ratios higher than 3, hydrogen production reaches a maximum with the temperature. The addition of oxygen in the feed discourages hydrogen production. The temperature at which the maximum occurs decreases with the increase of oxygen in the feed, and the value of that maximum decreases. As the oxygen to ethanol molar ratio increases, the production of CO decreases because the total oxidation becomes more important. Finally, below 700 K the CO production is negligible for all conditions studied. The coke can be depressed by increasing the ratios of O2/ethanol and H2O/ethanol; working in these conditions the useful life of catalysts would be increased."
