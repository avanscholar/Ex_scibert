0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as a clean energy carrier, can be produced from various domestic resources [1,2]. In the long term, photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors offers a promising way of hydrogen production [3–5]. Although conspicuous progresses have been made in the past decades, designing and synthesizing photocatalysts with high-activity and stability are still challengeable [6]. One major deficiency for the available photocatalysts is low transfer and separation efficiency of photo-excited charge carriers that reduces the photocatalytic performance [7]. To improve H2 evolution in the photocatalytic water splitting, new materials and strategies are constantly being explored, with an aim to achieve effective separation of photo-induced hole and electron pairs in semiconductors under light irradiation [8–12]. Junction structure material could effectively separate charge carriers due to its unique feature of interfacial built-in electric field. Thus, it is of prominent significance to develop high-active hetero/homo-junctions. Among all three types of junctions, staggered band alignment (type-II), can effectively separate photo-induced charge carriers at the crossing interface, and further enhance the photocatalytic performance [13,14]. The behaviors of heterojunctions in the photocatalytic reaction have been discussed in the reports of Ejhie [15,16]. Although the heterojunction could greatly improve the photocatalytic activity, the interface problem, associated with the mismatches of lattice and electron transport, does exist [17,18]. Different from heterojunction, the homojunction has a continuous bending structure because of involving the same component and perfect lattice match, which could further lower the mobility resistance of photo-generated carriers [19]. So far, several crystalline homojunctions have been reported like, p-n TiO2, Bi5+-self-doped Bi4V2O11, facet-based ZnSn(OH)6, meso-g-C3N4/g-C3N4 [20–23]. Comparatively, amorphous homojunctions are barely explored, even though amorphous materials exhibit interesting features like flexible structures that could facilitate charge carrier migration and lower energy barrier, unsaturated active reaction sites to increase H2 evolution activity [24–27]. Moreover, some amorphous oxides have the capability to adsorb a large number of water molecules and hydroxyl groups that play a vital role in photocatalytic water splitting [28]. Therefore, designing amorphous homojunction catalyst is extraordinarily promising, though challenging. Herein, we for the first time report the preparation of an amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction by anchoring TaOx(OH)y nanoparticles (NPs) in situ onto TaOx(OH)y sphere (SP) with an aim to obtain a more powerful photocatalyst. Both TaOx(OH)y NPs and TaOx(OH)y SP show a p-type feature, signifying that once being excited by light, electrons could migrate directly to semiconductor surface, and then be quickly captured by water to generate H2. The obtained TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP exhibits a greatly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production in compariation with that of bare TaOx(OH)y SP, TaOx(OH)y NPs, commercial P25 (TiO2) and crystalline Ta2O5 (C-Ta2O5). The efficient charge separation and a type-II staggered alignment band at the interface of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction are examined by the steady-state surface photo-voltage/ transient photovoltage (SPV/TPV) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). These findings open up a new direction of exploiting new high-efficiency junction materials for potential photocatalytic applications."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tantalum (V) chloride (TaCl5, 99.8% metals basis) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, and commercial crystalline Ta2O5 (C-Ta2O5) from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai). Commercial TiO2 (P25, Degussa, Germany) was used as a refer sample.

Once forming a transparent solution, a certain amount of concentrated ammonia solution (0.5 mL or 1.0 mL) was added dropwise into this transparent solution. Some white flocculent precipitates were produced during the addition of ammonia solvent. Then obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL in capacity). After reacting at 180 °C for 20 h, the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature. The white products were washed and dried in air for 12 h. The final sample was denoted as TaOx(OH)y NPs-0.5 or TaOx(OH)y NPs-1.0 (0.5 and 1.0 denote the addition of ammonia are 0.5 and 1.0 mL, respectively)."

Then, 2 mL absolute ethanol was added for a sufficient mixing. The mixture was ground in an agate mortar for 30 min. The obtained product was finally dried in air for 12 h and kept for the following use. The final sample was denoted as Mix."
7,Photocatalytic H2 production test,"2.6 Photocatalytic H2 production test Photocatalytic H2 evolution property was carried in a closed gas circulation system Labsolar-III (Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd., China) with an external-irradiation photoreactor cell (Inside diameter: 7.1 cm, Total volume: 250 mL). Methanol (5 mL) and distilled water (45 mL) and the catalyst (0.05 g) were put into the above reactor after ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. The mixture solution was treated with a constant stirring (500 rpm) during the catalytic test. Then the reactor was sealed with a rubber septum and the temperature was controlled to be 15 °C by a low temperature thermostat during the whole photocatalytic reaction process. A xenon lamp Microsolar300 (PE300BF, light control mode, UV output: 2.6w) is used as the incident light source, photoreaction is operated for 10 h and the distance of lamp to solution is 9.5 cm. The spectral radiance map of xenon lamp is shown in Fig. S1. The amount of produced H2 is detected with a gas chromatographer (Shanghai, GC-7900, TCD, Ar carrier). The photograph of our reaction device has been provided in Fig. S2."
8,Materials characterization,"2.7 Materials characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out by Rigaku D/MAX2550 powder diffractometer with Cu K α radiation ( λ = 0.15418 nm) from two theta of 10–80° at a scan rate of 2°/min. The acceleration voltage and applied current were 40 KV and 15 mA, respectively. The morphologies of the samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F electron microscope) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips-FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20 microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV). The thermo gravimetric analysis (TG) was performed with a NETZSCH STA499F3 QMS403D/Bruker V70 instrument from room temperature to 1000 °C (20 °C/min) in air, and an attached mass spectrometer (MS) was used to detect the evolving gases. The elemental analysis was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS elemental analyzer. Fourier transfer infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were carried out on a Bruker IFS-66 V/S system from 400 to 4000 cm−1. All spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1 for a total 32 scans. Prior to recording the IR spectra, the samples and KBr were mixed with a mass ratio of 1:150, treated at 100 °C for 24 h in the vacuum oven to evaporate the involvement as much as possible. After that, 30 mg of the homogeneous mixture (sample and KBr) were taken out for later IR use. For FTIR peak deconvolution, the spectra were fitted with Gaussian function, and R2 value for each fitting curve was greater than 0.95 in the deconvolution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on an ultrahigh vacuum ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Ka hν = 1486.6 eV). All binding energies were calibrated by reference to C1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. Brunauer – Emmett – Teller (BET) specific surface area of the products were obtained from nitrogen adsorption-desorption on the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M apparatus at 77 K. The distribution of the pore volume and pore size were calculated from the Barret – Joyner – Halender (BJH) adsorption branch. All of the samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h prior to the nitrogen adsorption. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (U-4100, Shimadzu, Japan) over the range of 200–800 nm using BaSO4 as a background. The band gaps were estimated by extrapolating a linear part of the plots to (αhν) 1/2 – hν = 0. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a He-gas (I) (21.22 eV) discharge lamp. A −5.0 V bias was applied to enable accurate determination of the low-kinetic-energy photoelectron cut-off. The electron binding energy scale was calibrated using the Fermi edge of clean silver. The resolution was 0.2 eV. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were measured with a PLS 920 Edinburgh (England) spectrofluorophotometer equipped with a continuous Xe-900 lamp ( λ ex = 325 nm). The steady-state surface photo-voltage (SPV) measurement system consisted of a monochromatic light source, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a sample cell, and the data process equipment. A 500 W Xenon lamp and a double-prism monochromator were applied to provide the monochromatic light. A low chopping frequency (23 Hz) was used in the conventional testing. The SPV sample cell had a sandwich-like structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/mica/sample/ITO. A laser radiation pulse (355 nm from a third harmonic Nd:YAG laser) was as the excitation source when recorded the transient photovoltage (TPV) spectra. The two measurements were all performed in air at room temperature."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Preparation and structure characterization of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction and other counterparts,"3.1 Preparation and structure characterization of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction and other counterparts 3.1.1 SEM, TEM and XRD analyses TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction was synthesized by a solvothermal method followed by a concentrated ammonia treatment as illustrates in Fig. 1 A. The surface of TaOx(OH)y SP is quite smooth (Figs. 1a and S4a). When a little amount of concentrated ammonia was added, the surface layer of TaOx(OH)y SP was dissociated gradually, and TaOx(OH)y NPs were in situ formed (Fig. S4c). Then, TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction was formed since TaOx(OH)y NPs were in situ anchored onto the surface of TaOx(OH)y SP. As clearly demonstrates by TEM and SEM images, TaOx(OH)y NPs have been successfully affixed on the surface of TaOx(OH)y SP (Figs. 1b and S4b). Careful observation for TEM images of the homojunction surfaces (Fig. 1c–e) reveals that TaOx(OH)y NPs are clinging to the sphere, and most of nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the TaOx(OH)y SP surface. Homojunction structure is also confirmed by TEM and the corresponding elemental mapping images. As shown in Fig. 1f, big sphere is surrounded by nanoparticles. The elemental mappings of Ta and O are all homogenously distributed in the inner sphere and outer nanoparticles. All these results suggest that the as-prepared TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP is a homojunction. For comparison, morphology of the reference sample Mix is also examined, as illustrates in Fig. S4f, in which nanoparticles are clearly seen on the sphere surface. When increasing the amount of ammonia to 0.5 mL, TaOx(OH)y SP completely dissociated into TaOx(OH)y NPs (4–10 nm) (Fig. 1g). Further increasing the ammonia amount to 1.0 mL, nanoparticle size remains unchanged as that of the previous TaOx(OH)y NPs-0.5 (Figs. 1h, S4d and S4e). XRD patterns are detected to investigate the crystallinity, phase composition of samples. For all the TaOx(OH)y samples (Fig. S3a), there are no any sharp peaks, but only two broad diffraction peaks located at two theta of 28° and 55°, indicating the amorphous nature, as previously reported [29,30]. Similarly, the HRTEM image (inset of Fig. 1h) and SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 1c) measured for TaOx(OH)y NPs-1.0 and TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction also confirm their amorphous nature. Comparatively, the XRD pattern of C-Ta2O5 is identified as the orthorhombic Ta2O5 with a high crystallinity (Fig. S3b). When changing the solvothermal reaction time but fixing the reaction temperature at 180 °C, the homojunction structure between TaOx(OH)y NPs and TaOx(OH)y SP do not alter (Fig. S5). It should be noted that TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction cannot be obtained at room temperature. This distinct phenomenon demonstrates that TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction construction is mainly controlled by a thermodynamic process. 3.1.2 TG-MS and elemental analyses To examine the chemical species involved in our samples, we carried out TG-MS and CHNS elemental analyzer. Two kinds of signals at m/z = 18 and 44 are detected during the heating process in MS curve, assigned to the exhaust gas of H2O and CO2 [31]. As shows in Fig. 2 , a slight weight loss below 100 °C is observed accompanied by a small broad exothermic peak in DSC curve (Fig. S6b). According to the recorded MS signal vs temperature, the weight loss could be ascribed to the removal of physical adsorbed water [32]. Interestingly, a bump of H2O signal can be also distinguished at about 350 °C in MS data, indicating the presence of OH− in the homojunction [33]. The release of H2O in a wide temperature window (40–400 °C) with a broad peak around 135 °C and a bumped emission at 350 °C suggests that H2O gases are evolved from different functional groups, i.e. adsorbed water, crystal water, and hydroxyl groups, respectively. Although CO2 signals are clearly seen at 365 and 413 °C, the sample just gave a slight weight loss at temperature above 350 °C. Because the release of trace CO2 is out of sync with H2O, CO2 signal can be attributed to the decomposition of trace carbonates bonded to hydroxyl-related groups. Elemental analysis by CHNS elemental analyzer also shows that the contents of C (<2.8 wt%) and N (<1.2 wt%) are rare indeed (Table 1 ). These conclusions are also supported by the following FTIR and XPS analyses. Additionally, the small sharp CO2 peak at ca. 740 °C in the MS data may be raised from the combustion of elemental carbon that are left from the decomposition of carbonates at lower temperature [34]. This could also be understood by strong and fast exothermic reaction at about 740 °C (Fig. S6b) when amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction correspondingly transforms into crystalline oxide [29]. TG-DSC curves of the other TaOx(OH)y samples are displayed in Fig. S6. Except C-Ta2O5, all TaOx(OH)y samples exhibit similar weight loss and exothermic behavior. For comparison, the changes of weight loss are also plotted in Fig. S6f. All TaOx(OH)y samples gave the total mass loss amount of about 10 wt%, while C-Ta2O5 do not show any obvious mass change. Since the majority of weight loss comes from water (adsorbed, crystal or OH), it can be anticipated that TaOx(OH)y is more hydrophilic than C-Ta2O5. 3.1.3 FTIR analyses FTIR spectra are recorded to further identify the state of water and other possible adsorbed species. As shown in Fig. S7, C-Ta2O5 exhibits several typical characteristic peaks of Ta-O and Ta-O-Ta bonds at 1000–400 cm−1 [35]. Moreover, there is no any significant absorption in the IR spectrum of C-Ta2O5 over 4000–3000 cm−1, demonstrating the absence of H2O associated groups and other organic residues [36] and its clean surface feature. Compared to C-Ta2O5, several new vibrations are observed in the spectra of TaOx(OH)y samples (Fig. 3 a and b). The broad vibrations in the region of 3800–2000 cm−1 can be well deconvoluted into three signals (Fig. 3a) using Gaussian function [37]: maximum transmission at 3642 cm−1 for the vibration of OH group in the structure, and other two broad peaks for crystal water and absorbed water [38]. Different from C-Ta2O5, the presence of crystal water and hydroxyl group in TaOx(OH)y samples could shed new on their unique natures. The bands at 3300–3200 cm−1 are dominantly attributed to OH in the structure of TaOx(OH)y. Although the rocking mode of N-H also exhibits a vibration band in the region of 3300–3200 cm−1 [39], its contribution to the observed band for our samples should be less because the total content of N is below 1.2 wt%. Another three small peaks in the range of 3000–2700 cm−1 are typical stretching modes of C-H due to the adsorption of C species on the sample surface [40]. FTIR spectra in Fig. 3b shows the enlarged peaks centered at 1000–400 cm−1, corresponding to Ta-O-Ta stretching mode. All vibrations shifted towards higher wavenumber in comparison with C-Ta2O5. A new peak centered at 515 cm−1 (denoted as peak I) is indentified, which could be ascribed to the vibration of Ta-O-H (metal - hydroxyl) in the structure analogous to other basic metal oxides [41,42]. Relative intensities of this peak to the Ta-O-Ta stretching mode are illustrated in Fig. 3c. Among the four TaOx(OH)y samples, TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction displays the highest intensity ratio, which might be related to the special structure of homojunction. 3.1.4 XPS and elemental mapping analyses The chemical composition and valence states of elements are determined by XPS. As seen in Fig. S8, survey spectrum of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is same as that of C-Ta2O5, consisting of Ta, O elements except for the adventitious carbon. The binding energy of C-Ta2O5 located at 27.72 and 25.82 eV can be assigned to Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2, respectively. O 1 s locates at 530.63 eV (Fig. S8b). Ta 4f for TaOx(OH)y samples, shifts to high binding energy compared to C-Ta2O5 (Fig. 4 ), which could ascribe to the influence of OH in the structure as confirmed by FTIR and TG – MS, instead of the high-valence tantalum ions [35]. Moreover, the binding energy of Ta 4f7/2 for TaOx(OH)y SP is higher than that of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP and TaOx(OH)y NPs. Regarding to the constant binding energy difference between Ta 4f core level and the valence band edge for TaOx(OH)y samples, the shift of Ta 4f could alters the energy position of valence-band maximum (VBM) and the Fermi level in TaOx(OH)y [17,43]. The detailed band position will be estimated basing on the data of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in the later analysis. Atomic ratios of Ta, O elements for all samples derived from XPS data are summarized in Table S2. The experimental ratios of TaOx(OH)y are all higher than the stoichiometric (O/Ta = 2.5), due to the presence of OH and crystal water, agreeing very well with the TG-MS and FTIR results. As shown in Fig. S9a, peak for C1s located at about 285.8 eV is ascribed to C-OH [36], much weaker than that at 284.6 eV for the adventitious carbon. Comparatively, N 1s core level shows a weak peak centered at about 404.6 eV, which could be assigned to N-H bond [44] (Fig. S9b). Weak C and N signals that are detected by XPS and EDX mapping (Fig. S10) should come from the adsorbed species on the surface of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP."
11,H2 evolution of TaOx(OH)y samples in absence of any cocatalyst,"3.2 H2 evolution of TaOx(OH)y samples in absence of any cocatalyst To assess the superiority of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction, the photocatalytic performance of TaOx(OH)y SP, TaOx(OH)y NPs, Mix, C-Ta2O5, and the most widely used photocatalyst P25 are compared. The photocatalytic performance is evaluated by H2 production from 10% methanol aqueous solution without any cocatalyst deposition. As shown in Fig. 5 , TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction exhibits a distinctively higher H2 evolution rate than TaOx(OH)y SP and TaOx(OH)y NPs. For example, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of the TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is 311.1 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 5 times higher than 66.8 μmol g−1 h−1 for TaOx(OH)y SP. We also test the photocatalytic performance for the a physical mixture of TaOx(OH)y SP and TaOx(OH)y NPs, and found its H2 evolution rate is only 155.0 μmol g−1 h−1, far below to that of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP sample. Therefore, solvothermal treatment process could strengthen the formation of homo-interface in TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP system, which could facilitate the transport and separation of photo-generated charge carriers, and further enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution. Furthermore, H2 evolution rate of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is much higher than the reference material C-Ta2O5 (7.6 μmol g−1 h−1) and commercial P25 (0.3 μmol g−1 h−1). The photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of all samples are summarized in Tables 2 and S3. Therefore, amorphous homojunction construction could be an effective strategy to improve photocatalytic H2 production. Stability of photocatalysts is also a very important parameter for the practical application [45]. TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction sample as a representative is subjected to the stability test. As shown in Fig. S11, this homojunction has a high stability, keeping the high activity even extending more than 60 h. The morphology of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is also preserved even after a long time reaction (Fig. S12)."
12,Specific surface area,"3.3 Specific surface area Specific surface area is one of critical factors to affect the photocatalytic activity of catalyst. Specific surface areas of all samples are determined by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements. All N2 isotherms obtained for the TaOx(OH)y samples are type-IV pattern, a characteristic of micro-mesoporous materials [46]. Specifically, isotherms of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP with a capillary condensation between 0.8 and 1.0P/P0, exhibits a IV type curve with an H3-type hysteresis loop. Therefore, TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP is indicated co-existent with macropores and mesopores [47]. TaOx(OH)y NPs has an H2-type hysteresis loop in the range of P/P0 = 0.4–0.8, which could be attributed to its high degree mesopores as generated from nanoparticles [48]. Notably, the pore volume increases slowly from TaOx(OH)y SP, TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP to TaOx(OH)y NPs, implying a mild volume expansion accompanying with a shape alternation. The pore size does not show obvious change except for TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP. Detailed information about BET surface area, pore volume and pore size are given in Table 2. The lowest BET surface area of 122 m2/g is offered by TaOx(OH)y SP, followed by 134 m2/g of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction and 130 m2/g of TaOx(OH)y NPs-0.5, and the largest one, 171 m2/g for TaOx(OH)y NPs-1.0. The average pore size distributions are all narrow and locates around 2–5 nm (Fig. 6 b, Table 2). Although TaOx(OH)y SP and TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction have similar BET surface area, size distribution and amorphous feature, their H2 evolution rates are very different (Table 2, Fig. 5). Moreover, increasing the ammonia amount from 0.5 to 1.0 mL brings about a slight increase of BET surface area, but the photocatalytic activity of TaOx(OH)y NPs-0.5 and TaOx(OH)y NPs-1.0 are almost the same. These results clearly show that the photocatalytic activity for amorphous TaOx(OH)y samples should be mainly dependent on the feature of photocatalyst itself (i.e. homojunction structure), instead of the specific surface area."
13,Photo-induced charge carrier separation and transfer behavior,"3.4 Photo-induced charge carrier separation and transfer behavior Surface and transient photovoltage spectra are the effective methods to investigate the photo-induced charge carrier separation and transfer of semiconductor materials [49]. To further understand the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TaOx(OH)y samples, especially for TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction, the photovoltage and photoluminescence spectra were taken on TaOx(OH)y and C-Ta2O5 samples. As shown in Fig. 7 a, negative SPV signals are observed in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm for all of TaOx(OH)y samples, and their corresponding phase spectra straddle the degree of 90–180 (Fig. 7b). Comparatively, C-Ta2O5 exhibits a positive narrow response from 300 to 340 nm, and its relevant SPV phase value is located at the degree of 0–90° (Fig. 7b). Positive SPV response means that holes accumulate at the surface, a typical feature for the n-type materials. The negative signal represents a movement of photo-induced electron toward the interface, giving a p-type nature [50]. Based on these, C-Ta2O5 could be identified as a n-type feature, while TaOx(OH)y as a p-type. Regardless of the different carrier types of C-Ta2O5 and TaOx(OH)y, the trend of SPV intensity follows the order: TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction > C-Ta2O5 > TaOx(OH)y NPs > TaOx(OH)y SP, which is not in accordance with the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5). As well known, the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the separation of photo-induced charge carriers as well as the nature of material (i.e., homojunction and OH concentration for our TaOx(OH)y). Separation and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers are further monitored by TPV. Fig. 7c displays the normalized TPV spectra of all TaOx(OH)y samples, and all the signals are negative, suggesting a accumulation of electron at the interface and further confirming their p-type nature. The maxima time of TPV provides important information about the recombination time of photogenerated charge carriers [51]. As depicts in Fig. 7c, the maxima time follows the order: TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP > TaOx(OH)y NPs-1.0 ≥ TaOx(OH)y NPs-0.5 > TaOx(OH)y SP. The largest maxima time observed for TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP suggests that homojunction has the slowest recombination of charge carriers, in favor of the enhanced photocatalytic activity. PL spectra are also effective to monitor the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [52]. In Fig. 7d, the PL intensity of TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is the lowest, indicating that this homojunction could suppress the electron-hole recombination, thus presenting the highest photocatalytic activity [53]. The consistent results from PL, SPV and TPV reveal that the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers governs the photocatalytic activity of amorphous TaOx(OH)y partly. UPS can determine the fundamental band edge positions [54], such as the Fermi level (EF) and the valence band maximum (EV). Based on the band structure information, we can further shed light on the nature of the promoted separation and transport of photo-generated carriers. From these UPS data in Fig. S13, we can determine the secondary electron cut-off energy (Ecut) and valence band levels with respect to EF for all TaOx(OH)y samples. The value of work function (φ) is calculated by the equation of φ = hν − Ecut + EF, where hν (21.22 eV) is the fixed incident photo energy of He I source. In view of this, EF and EV (with respect to vacuum level (EVAC)) are obtained, as shown in Fig. 8 a. The conduction band minimum (EC), in terms of the equation Eg = EV – EC, is calculated to be −1.85 eV for TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP, intermediate between that of −1.68 eV for TaOx(OH)y SP and −2.09 for TaOx(OH)y NPs. The value of Eg acquired by the absorbance edge from UV–vis absorption spectra [55–57], is given in Fig. S14. The obtained relative energy position are depicted clearly in Fig. 8a. All EF are positioned closer to the EV compared to EC, pointing out their p-type characteristics [58], which is in accordance with SPV and TPV conclusion. TaOx(OH)y SP has a large work function relative to TaOx(OH)y NPs. Accordingly, the energy level alignment at TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction interface is deduced, as plotted in Fig. 8b. The typical type-II staggered the band alignment (up-shift of both EC and EV for TaOx(OH)y SP relative to the anchored TaOx(OH)y NPs) can well facilitate the separation of electrons and holes [59,60]. When exposed to light, electrons would transfer from TaOx(OH)y SP to TaOx(OH)y NPs, and the holes move in an inverse direction simultaneously, which would build a space charge region at homojunction interface. The continuous homojunction facilitates the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes from one component to another. Additionally, for our homojunction sample (Fig. S15), we do not observe canyon or pinnacle-like energy barrier that often appears at the interface of heterojunction and impedes carrier movement. Hence, the photo-generated carriers in amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction can be easily separated, thus leading to the improved photocatalytic activity."
14,Conclusions,"Amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction is first constructed to enhance the photo-charges separation in both bulk and interface of photocatalysts. Comparing to with traditional crystalline heterojunction, amorphous homojunction has matched contact interface and flexible motion paths that are all beneficial for boosting photo-generated carrier separation [17,18]. Specifically, TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction leads to 5, 2 and 40 folds enhancement over TaOx(OH)y SP, TaOx(OH)y NPs or C-Ta2O5 on photocatalytic H2 production, even 1000 times higher that of commercial P25 without any cocatalyst. Also amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction exhibits a much higher activity than that of NiOx loaded amorphous Ta2O5 samples reported in literature [61]. Furthermore, the perspicuous band alignment (type-II staggered) of amorphous TaOx(OH)y NPs/SP homojunction provides new understanding for the enhanced separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, thus promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution. The results reported in this work open up new opportunities for the design of advanced amorphous junction materials for energy and environmental applications."
