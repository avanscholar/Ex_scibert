0,Introduction,"The significant growth of demand for clean energy has motivated scientists in the field of energy science to pursue alternative methods for power generation [1–7]. Hydrogen has been considered as a promising energy carrier as it possesses substantial energy density. Moreover, hydrogen is environmentally friendly and certainly can contribute to a clean and sustainable environment [8–11]. There are several ways to produce hydrogen, preferably from renewable energy sources. Currently, steam reforming of hydrocarbons or alcohols is widely used for the mass production of hydrogen [12–17]. Nevertheless, there is a desire to develop renewable hydrogen production technologies. Hence, electrolysis has been explored as a potential method to produce hydrogen because the energy input to the electrolysis process can be derived from renewable energy sources [12]. In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the electrolysis of water as a source of pure hydrogen production [18–23]. However, the amount of energy required for the water electrolysis is significantly higher. The theoretical cell potential for hydrogen evolution through water electrolysis process is 1.229V. Therefore, the electrolysis of alternative liquids like alcohols has been explored to reduce the amount of energy needed [24,25]. Moreover, the electrolysis of alcohols can be considered environmentally friendly if bio-alcohol is used as the fuel [11,26]. There are several studies done on hydrogen generation through methanol electrolysis [27–29]. However, methanol is very toxic in nature. Among all the other alcohols, ethanol is a suitable candidate for transportation and stationary applications, due to its high energy density and non-toxicity compared with methanol. The energy densities of ethanol and methanol (LHV) are 29MJ/kg and 19.7MJ/kg, respectively. Moreover, huge potential for easy production of ethanol through fermentation of sugar-containing materials [30] inspired us to choose ethanol electrolysis. The two half-cell reactions of the electrochemical reforming of ethanol are presented in Eq. (1). (1) a . CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 12 H + + 12 e - b . 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 with ΔH =+348kJ/mole ethanol and ΔG =+96.9kJ/mole ethanol. The number of electrons transferred during the reaction is 12. Hence, the theoretical cell voltage for ethanol electrolysis, obtained from the Gibbs free energy equation E EtOH =ΔG/n, has become 0.08V. This leads to less energy requirement compared to water electrolysis resulting in higher energy efficiency. All the studies performed in the past on electrolysis of ethanol for hydrogen production have been purely experimental in nature [31]. To-date, there is no mathematical modeling study on ethanol electrolysis found in the literature. This is, perhaps, the first computational fluid dynamics study on the ethanol electrolysis based on PEM electrolytic cell. This study formulates an isothermal, two-dimensional and single phase model of the electrolysis of ethanol with detailed process of flow of the water–ethanol solution, electrochemical reactions and species transport within the electrolytic cell. Furthermore, the effect of the feedstock flow rate and operating voltage on the species composition and cell performance is studied and discussed."
1,Theory,"The two-dimensional schematic of a PEM ethanol electrolyzer and the computational domain are shown in Fig. 1 . The electrolyzer cell includes anode and cathode flow channels of straight type, anode and cathode electrodes and an electrolyte, which is sandwiched by the electrodes. Pt/C is considered to be the electrocatalysts used. Water–ethanol mixture is supplied to the anode side and hydrogen is generated in the cathode compartment. Ethanol molecules are oxidized in the presence of water molecules into carbon dioxide and protons as presented in Eq. (1). Twelve electrons are involved in this electrochemical reaction. The electrons react with protons transported through the membrane and generate hydrogen at the cathode catalyst layer. The generated hydrogen molecules diffuse out of the cathode electrode to the cathode flow channel. CO2 molecules produced at the anode side are transported out by the residual ethanol solution stream. The crossover of the ethanol molecules from the anode side to the cathode may also take place. Ethanol molecules transported to the cathode side are oxidized at the cathode. The current produced due to the oxidation of ethanol at the cathode side is considered as the parasitic current (ip ). When this occurs, there is a mixed potential at the cathode due to concurrent oxidation and reduction processes. Because the flows in the channels of a PEM electrolyzer have small Reynolds number, they are assumed to be in laminar regime. In addition, the steady state condition is considered for the computational fluid dynamics model. The charge balance is solved in the electrodes and the membrane with Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. (2) - ∇ · σ eff s ∇ φ s = 0 (3) - ∇ · ( σ m ∇ φ m ) = 0 where σ eff s , φs , σm , and φm are the electric conductivity and the potential of the porous electrodes and the membrane, respectively. The membrane conductivity is a function of the water content of the membrane λ, i.e., the concentration ratio of water to sulfonic acid group in the membrane. The following experimental expression for the conductivity of Nafion membrane has been presented by Springer et al. [32]. (4) σ 30 = 0.5139 λ - 0.326 , for λ > 1 where σ 30 and λ are the membrane conductivity in Sm−1 (measured at 30°C) and water content of the membrane, respectively. The conductivity at any given operating temperature can be calculated using Eq. (5). (5) σ m = exp 1268 1 303 - 1 T σ 30 The flow in the porous media of the gas diffusion layers of the PEM fuel cell is modeled by Darcy’s law (Eq. (6)), where the pressure gradient is the driving force. (6) ∇ p = - μ κ u + μ ε ∇ 2 u where u, kp , μ, ε, and p are the velocity vector, permeability of the porous media, viscosity of the fluid, porosity and pressure, respectively. The governing equations and the boundary conditions are summarized in Fig. 1b. The boundary condition for the mass and species at the anode membrane/catalyst layer interface are presented in Eqs. (7) and (8). (7) ρ u E = - i 12 F M H 2 O + M E - M CO 2 - n H 2 O - n E (8) ρ u ω E - ρ D E ∂ ω E ∂ y = - i + i p 12 F M E where the fluxes of ethanol and water through the membrane and ip are calculated by Eqs. (9)–(11), respectively. (9) n E = iM E F α H 2 O ω E + ρ D E ω E - ω E cath t mem (10) n H 2 O = iM H 2 O F α H 2 O (11) i p = 12 Fn E M E The parameters used in the simulation of ethanol PEM electrolyzer are presented in Table 1 . The relationship between the current density and the cell potential are studied combining the electrochemical and computational fluid dynamics. The electrochemical potential of the PEM ethanol electrolyzer can be calculated by Eq. (12). (12) V = E + η ohmic + η act , a + η act , where E, ηohmic , ηact , a and ηact , c are the equilibrium potential, the ohmic overpotential, the anode activation overpotential and the cathode overpotential, respectively. The activation overpotentials are dependent on the kinetics of the reactions at the anode and cathode electrodes. The relationship between the cell overpotentials and current density are expressed by Butler–Volmer equation [33]. The ohmic overpotential, representing the potential loss due to electrons and ions transport, is calculated using Ohm’s law."
2,Numerical method,"The governing equations are solved numerically using finite element method. There is coupling between the flow velocity and the species transport and current distribution modules. Once the velocity field is obtained, the species transport and current distribution equations are solved. The former determines the concentration of species at different components of the cell. The fluid properties including density, thermal conductivity and diffusivity are updated according to the calculated compositions at each iteration. It should be reminded that the local current density values obtained from current distribution module are used as the source terms in other modules. The iterations are continued till convergence is reached for the governing equations. The ethanol electrolyzer model was developed and solved using COMSOL multiphysics. The grid independency has been checked in this study. It was concluded that the results do not change remarkably when the number of mesh elements is more than 14,000."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Model validation,"4.1 Model validation To validate the numerical model, the results obtained from the modeling are compared with the experimental data obtained from the literature [31] under the same conditions. The simulations are carried out at 20°C and atmospheric pressure. The flow rate of ethanol mixture is 2mlmin−1. Fig. 2 presents the numerical results compared with the experimental data obtained from [31]. It can be seen that there is a reasonable agreement between the experimental data and simulation results. The discrepancy between the simulation and experimental data is more obvious in the high current density end. This could be due to the mass transport losses in the presence of carbon dioxide bubbles generated in the anode side. The dynamic of carbon dioxide bubbles is not taken into account in the simulation study. Fig. 3 shows the local current density distribution in the ethanol electrolyzer operating at potentials of 0.8V and 1V. It can be seen that the current density increases along the electrode length with the increase in operating potential. Also, the local current density decreases along the cell length. This is due to the consumption of ethanol and formation of products (protons and carbon dioxide) according to Eq. (1). It should be noted that Eq. (1) is the ideal ethanol oxidation reaction. In practice, it has been found, evidenced with in situ infrared spectroscopy and chromatography analysis, that ethanol oxidation in this potential domain produced mainly acetaldehyde (2H+) and acetic acid (4H+) [34,35]. The effect of inlet flow rate on the local current density distributions at operating potential of 1V is presented in Fig. 4 . In the case of different inlet flow rates, the local current densities along the electrode length do not show any remarkable differences. The local current density, at higher inlet flow rate, decreases less significantly along the cell length compared to that of lower inlet flow rate. Fig. 5 presents the ethanol mass fraction along the electrode length over diffusion layer/catalyst layer interface for ethanol inlet velocities of 0.005m/s, 0.01m/s, 0.03m/s and 0.05m/s. The mass fraction drop increases with decreasing the inlet velocity. This is due to higher consumption of ethanol at a lower velocity since the detention time of the ethanol would be higher at a lower inlet flow velocity. The effect of the operating temperature on the electrolyzer cell performance is presented in Fig. 6 . Apparently, the increase in the operating temperature improves the performance of the cell. It can be seen that the activation overpotential reduces at higher temperatures, which is due to the improvement of reaction kinetics at higher temperatures. The impact of membrane thickness on the electrolyzer performance was studied using three different thickness; Nafion 112 (0.076mm thickness), Nafion 115 (0.127mm thickness), and Nafion 117 (0.174mm thickness). From Fig. 7 , the cell performance is found to follow the order: Nafion 117>Nafion 115>Nafion 112. The shapes of the polarization curves imply that the surface resistances corresponding to the three membranes used are close to each other. The difference in the performance is mainly due to the fact that thicker membranes reduce the ethanol crossover and, thereby reducing the parasitic losses and improving the cell performance. In other words, the parasitic loss due to ethanol crossover outnumbers the effect of reduced ohmic loss with thinner membrane. It is observed that there is a remarkable gap in performance between of the cell made of Nafion 115 and that of Nafion 117. Applying Nafion 117 brings about a significant difference in the cell performance as compared to Nafion 115. The rate of hydrogen generation and the productivity ratio defined by Eq. (13) are presented in Fig. 8 . (13) γ = V H 2 · LHV Q + V E · LHV E where V H2, VEt , Q, LHVH2, and LHV Et are the specific hydrogen generation/ethanol consumption rates (m3 s−1 cm−2), electrical power consumption (kJs−1), the low heating value of hydrogen at standard conditions (10,218kJm−3), and heating value of ethanol (21,560kJm−3), respectively. The specific hydrogen generation rate is the rate of the hydrogen generation per unit area of the electrolyzer cell. The energy consumption for the electrolysis process Q is calculated by multiplying the applied potential by the current produced. The specific rate of hydrogen generation (calculated from the simulation results) and the productivity ratio are plotted versus the operating potential of the electrolytic cell operating at room temperature in Fig. 8. The membrane is considered to be Nafion 117. It can be seen that the productivity ratio increases with the increase in operating potential. However, it flattens at operating potential about 0.8V. On the other hand, the specific rate of hydrogen generation strictly increases with the increase of the operating potential. The operating potential of 0.94V is considered to be the optimum cell potential leading to reasonable productivity rate and specific hydrogen generation rate of 1.5cm3 min−1 cm−2. At potentials higher than 0.94V, the hydrogen generation rate increases, while the productivity ratio does not improve and it is almost fixed at 1.48. This also should be noted that, practically, there is a potential limit over which the membrane electrode assembly may detach."
5,Conclusion,"Computational fluid dynamics simulation of ethanol electrolytic cell has been carried out using finite element method. The model developed is the first numerical investigation of such electrolysis process. The simulation leads to a better understanding of the phenomena which occur in the ethanol electrolytic cell. The model is able to predict the polarization (current–potential) behavior of the cell, and also the current density and species distribution along the cell at different operating conditions. The simulation results are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data available in the literature, especially in the low current density range. It was found out that: (1) the cell current density increases with increase in the operating potential; (2) the local current density decreases along the cell length; (3) the increase in the operating temperature improves the performance of the cell; (4) in the case of different inlet flow rates, the local current densities do not show any remarkable difference; (5) the cell performance was found to follow the order: Nafion 117>Nafion 115>Nafion 112, which is due to the fact that thicker membranes reduce the ethanol crossover and, thereby reducing the parasitic losses thus improving the cell performance; (6) the productivity ratio increases with the increase in operating potential, however, it flattens at operating potential of about 0.8V. On the other hand, the specific rate of hydrogen generation strictly increases with the increase of the operating potential. (7) For the cell with Nafion 117 as the membrane, the operating potential of 0.94V is seem to be the optimum cell potential leading to reasonable productivity rate and specific hydrogen generation rate of 1.5cm3 min−1 cm−2."
