0,Introduction,"Nowadays contamination of aquatic environments with hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from different industrial activities, which has been caused some serious problems to environmental safety and human health, has become a great concern (Yu et al., 2018; V and Ak, 2016). Many methods, such as alkaline precipitation, extraction, biofilm technology, etc. (Wang et al., n.d.; Ozcan et al., n.d.; Pazos et al., n.d.), have been demonstrated efficient for Cr(VI) removal. Due to simple operation and low cost, the alkali precipitation process is still the most popular method for purification of high concentration of Cr(VI) wastewater until now. However, the alkali-treated Cr(VI) wastewater still contains a few Cr(VI) ions (ppm level) owing to the incomplete precipitation, which should be further purified before discharging. Nowadays, the wastewater that contained a low content of Cr(VI) has been usually treated by ion exchange (Yunqing et al., 2007), membrane filtration (Juang and Shiau, 2000; Huang et al., n.d.), adsorption (Guan, 2019), etc. Among them, adsorption technology seems to be an effective and economical method because of its convenient operation, low energy consumption, and less secondary pollution (Bhattacharya et al., 2008). However, economical operating cost from the use of low-cost adsorbents is a major concern for practical deployment. Due to the advantages of inexpensive, efficient, and creating relatively little sledges, activated carbon (AC) has a long history of being used for wastewater purification. Recently, except the nature of the high surface area, large porosity and well-developed internal pore structure consisting of micro-, meso- and macropores, activated carbon (AC) also has some surface functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups (Bhatnagar et al., 2013)) which can significantly link with many pollutants by electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding. It makes AC be paid more attention in the environmental field. Traditionally, AC can be produced by oxygen-free carbonization of some carbonaceous rich feedstock, such as grass, wood, nutshells, and coal (Suganya and Kumar, 2018; Shoaib and Al-Swaidan, n.d.). In addition, with the popularisation of the circular economy, the concept of “treating waste with waste” has been won undivided admiration. As a carbon-rich solid waste, large amounts of paper sludge have been generally disposed of by landfilling and burning in China which has a little or even zero economic value. As an organic carbon-riched feedstock, paper sludge can be used for activated carbon production to bring some value-added benefits more or less. The paper sludge-based active carbon has been already reported for enrofloxacin adsorption in water (Jaria et al., n.d.) and the maximum adsorption capacity of 44.44 mg/g has been reached. However, few studies regarding the removal of Cr(VI) by paper sludge-based activated carbon has been reported as far as per the literature review. Conventional methods for preparing activated carbon include physical activation, chemical activation and physical-chemical activation (Salas-Enríquez et al., 2016). During physical activation, large amounts of pores in AC could be obtained only by carbonizing precursors under an inert atmosphere to remove non-carbon elements and the followed activating in the presence of suitable gasifying agents (CO2 or steam) at a high-temperature range of 700–1100 °C (Kirtania et al., n.d.). Compared with physical activation, chemical activation and physical-chemical activation allow a relatively mild preparation temperature (400–700 °C) in the presence of chemical activating agents. Moreover, the processes can also yield more AC, which have become the main preparation methods. The commonly used chemical activators, including KOH, ZnCl2, NaCl, K2CO3, and other molten salts (Xia et al., n.d.; Sun and Webley, n.d.), perform oxidation-reduction reaction at a fixed activation temperature for etching the precursors to form 3D carbon skeleton. After removal of the above-intercalated metal compounds, the abundant microporous and mesoporous structures can be created. Hence, in this study, with physical-chemical activation method, paper sludge waste has been converted into activated carbon-based adsorbents for purifying Cr(VI)-contained water. The main focus of this work was to investigate the adsorption ability of the paper sludge-based activated carbon (psAC) for removing Cr(VI) (10–100 ppm) in water. The influence of activation process parameters on the structure and adsorption ability of psAC has been also deeply studied. The optimal condition for Cr(VI) adsorption was carried out with using batch experiments. The equilibrium isotherms, adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics have been also studied. Besides, for better dealing with the undesired Cr-contained psAC adsorbent waste, it has been firstly doped by Cu species for the synthesis of CuCr/psAC catalyst for furfural (FF) hydrogenation and the catalytic performance has been also evaluated."
1,Experimental materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Paper sludge was kindly provided by Yunjing Forestry and Pulpmill Company, Ltd., Co. in Puerh, China. All the analytical-grade reagents include potassium dichromate, diphenylcarbamide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetone, furfural, and methanol were purchased from Shanghai McLean Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. All requested concentrations were prepared by diluting the standard stock solution. Deionized water was used throughout the work."
3,Preparation of psAC,"2.2 Preparation of psAC Before the physiochemical activation process, the paper sludge was ground and screened to obtain uniform powders (60–80 mesh). During physical activation, 5 g of the treated powder was put into a porcelain crucible and transferred into a N2-filled tube furnace. Then heated it at 500 °C for 60 min with the heating rate of 10 °C/min for gradual removal of non-carbon species and simultaneously forming carbon skeleton structure. After cooling to room temperature, the above physical-activated carbon precursor was well-mixed with some molten salts for the next chemical activation process, which was carried out in the tube furnace at 600 °C/N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Then, the cooled activated carbon was immersed with 1 M HNO3, filtered with 400 mesh screen, washed extensively with deionized water and dried in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h. Finally, the treated solids (labeled as psAC) was screened with a 100-mesh sieve for the next Cr(VI) removal test. The specific activation parameters have been shown in Table S1."
4,Batch Cr(VI) adsorption experiments,"2.3 Batch Cr(VI) adsorption experiments Batch experiment studies were carried out by taking 100 mL of the solution with the desired concentration of Cr(VI) (10–100 mg/L) and desired weight of psAC (0.2–2.0 g/L) in 250 ml conical flasks. Then set the rotation speed of the reciprocating shaker to 150 rpm, pH was adjusted using 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. After 48 h, the supernatant was filtered through a needle filter and then the absorbance of the filtrate at the wavelength of 540 nm was measured by UV spectrophotometry for analysis the Cr(VI) concentration (Guan, 2019). Desorption studies were carried out as follows. After the system reached the adsorption equilibrium, the Cr(VI)-contained psAC were separated by a filter, and the adsorbent was washed with deionized water to remove unadsorbed Cr(VI). 50 ml 0.2 M of HNO3 was added to the Cr(VI)-contained AC with magnetic stirring at 150 rpm for 3 h. The desorbed Cr(VI) in aqueous was filtered and analyzed as before. Each group of experiments were independently repeated three times. The adsorption efficiency (%; removal efficiency) and the adsorption capacity (qe; mg/g) were calculated by the following formulas: (1) Adsorption efficiency % = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 % (2) q e = C 0 − C e V / m"
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization SBET of psACs was measured by the nitrogen adsorption and desorption method (Quantachrome, Autosorb-iQ, USA). Zeta potential analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments, USA) was used to analyze the effect of pH on the potential of the adsorbent. The SEM image of the sample was obtained by a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope from Merlin, Germany. SEM-EDS (s4800, Hitachi) was used to analyze the surface elements of Cr(VI)-contained psAC. X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8ADVANCE) and XPS (escalab 250xi, Thermo) were investigated to explain adsorption behavior. Surface functional group analysis was performed using FTIR (Nicolet Magna-IR 830). Before the FTIR test, the sample was dried overnight at 120 °C."
6,Cu-Cr/psAC catalyst preparation and the further FF hydrogenation test,"2.5 Cu-Cr/psAC catalyst preparation and the further FF hydrogenation test FF is a critical organic chemical intermediate, which can prepare various organic chemical products such as furfuryl alcohol (FFA), pentanediol, pentadiene, ketones, and methyltetrahydrofuran (Jia et al., 2018). The traditional CuCr catalyst has excellent properties for furfural hydrogenation to prepare furfuryl alcohol (Yan and Chen, 2013). Thus, the psACs after Cr(VI) adsorption (Cr/psACs) have been used as a precursor for the preparation of CuCr bimetallic catalyst, as described next. 1 g of the Cr/psACs contained 50 mg/g Cr was first impregnated in 50 mL 1.275 g/L of Cu (NO3)2 solution. Then, the mixtures were stirring at 60–80 °C for 7 h until dry. Lastly, the prepared powders were continued to dry in an oven at 80 °C, ground to obtain 100–120 mesh FF hydrogenation catalyst powders (denoted as Cu-Cr/psACs). During catalytic testing, 0.025 g of Cu-Cr/psACs and 0.025 g of FF with 0.210 ml of methanol were added successively into a 4-mL stainless steel reactor. Then, 2 MPa H2 was injected into the reactor as a hydrogen source. Afterward, the sealed reactor was put into a sand bath (model SBL-2) which has been heated to 150 °C within 2 min. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. In this study, repeated measurements were taken at each data point. Two parameters, i.e., the conversion of FF (the mass of the reacted FF divided by the initial FF, %wt.) and the selectivity of the FFA (the mass of the produced FFA divided by the initial FF, %wt.), were determined for evaluating the catalyst performance."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Activators selection,"3.1 Activators selection As known, the adsorption capacity of porous material is strongly related to the adsorption site number. In this study, as a candidate adsorbent with higher removal capacity for Cr(VI), psACs should have a wider surface area and expose more adsorption sites outside. Therefore, during the chemical activation process, five molten salts have been used for increasing the specific surface area (SBET) of physical-activated paper sludge-based carbon, as shown in Table S1. By comparing the SBET of the prepared psACs, the molten salt with the best activation effect could be selected. It should be pointed out that the other activation conditions, such as the mass ratio of carbon to molten salt, activation temperature, etc. were fixed as same as in the literatures (Yin et al., 2019; Wang and Kaskel, 2012; Yu et al., 2019). The key results have been listed as below. Firstly, the prepared psACs after physical-activated at 500 °C for 1–5 h exhibited relatively low SBET, which should be activated by further chemical treatment. Second, as a usual chemical activator, KOH did not show its excellent capacity for pore expansion in this work. Moreover, the high addition of KOH has been even unconducive to the formation of micro/meso-pores due to its high corrosivity at high temperatures. This phenomenon also occurred when using Na2CO3-K2CO3 mixed salt with the carbon to molten salt ratio of 1:6. Also, all of the chosen NaCl-KCl mixed salts have been exhibited disappointing performance for pore-expansion. Besides, although both of the pure K2CO3 and other Na2CO3-K2CO3 mixed salts with different mass ratios have gratifying effects for modification of physical-activated carbon, the Na2CO3-K2CO3 mixed salts have still chosen considering the economic aspect. To determine the best mole ratio of Na2CO3 to K2CO3, the SBET of the prepared psACs with different mole ratios have been also compared. As in Table S2, it can be known that the SBET of psACs could reach to a maximum (i.e., 1430.8 m2/g) at 800 °C for 1 h with the mole ratio of Na2CO3 to K2CO3 fixed at 1.3:1 (equals to 53.3:41), which was different with the ratio (i.e., 59:41) in many references (Rao et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2018). Afterward, the effect of chemical-activation temperature on the pore-expansion has been also investigated. Normally, for pore-expansion of AC, the activation process has been always controlled at the total-molten-state temperature range (>750 °C) of Na2CO3-K2CO3 salts with the mole ratio of 1.3–1.4: 1 (Li et al., 2020). The largest SBET of psACs obtained at 800 °C for 1 h in Table S2 strongly verified this point's reasonability. However, the psACs obtained at only 600 °C with a solid-liquid coexistence phase of Na2CO3-K2CO3 salts also showed an 801.1–1123.1 m2/g of SBET with different ratio of Na2CO3-K2CO3 salts, which reflected that even if it does not reach the full melting state, the solid-liquid coexistence phase region may be also able to etch AC for pore-expansion at relatively low temperature. The further comparisons showed that with chemical activation at 600 °C for 1 h by controlling the Na2CO3-K2CO3 salts mole ratio of 1.3:1, the psAC with relative large SBET can be obtained more economically. The N2 adsorption-desorption behavior of this psAC has been displayed in Fig. 1 , which concluded that the psAC had an excellent specific surface area (1123.1 m2/g) with a pore diameter of ~4.1 nm."
9,Structure and morphology analysis,"3.2 Structure and morphology analysis The morphology of the raw material (paper sludge), the prepared psAC, and the Cr(VI)-contained psAC were analyzed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the morphology of paper sludge (Fig. 2a) was as flake-like, bulk-like and a relatively smooth surface with no obvious holes. However, the prepared paper sludge-based AC (psAC) showed an irregular cavities structure with a wide size distribution, as seen in Fig. 2b, which indicated that new holes were formed in paper sludge after physicochemical activation. According to the literature, the successful tiny-hole generation can be owing to the diffusion of the pyrolysis gases, e.g., H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4, etc. In Fig. 2c, it can be obviously found that the new scaly particles loaded onto the psAC surface and some of the relatively tiny holes also blocked, which indirectly reflected the successful adsorption of Cr(VI). The EDS mapping analysis results of psAC after adsorbing of Cr(VI) have been described in Fig. 2d–i. Mapping results showed that C atoms were distributed homogenously on the back paper which arises from the carbon skeleton of psAC. The associated-like spectra of O atoms directly reflected the existence of abundant oxygen functional groups, e.g., CO, -OH, C-O-C, etc., on the carbon skeleton of psAC. Besides, the Na and K species from molten salts also clearly evidenced the existence of residual Na and K compounds in the psAC host. Furthermore, the Cr elemental mapping image (Fig. 2i) indicated that Cr(VI) contaminants have been homogeneously distributed in the whole host of psAC which can be used as catalyst precursor for the further FF hydrogenation. The EDS point scan analysis results also illustrated that there were C(55.46 wt%), O(18.72 wt%), Na(0.56 wt%), K(3.14 wt%), and Cr(9.40 wt%) elements in the psAC adsorbent (Fig. 2k). Moreover, the non-principal elements included Si (4.47 wt%) possibly introduced from plant fiber raw materials, P (0.70 wt%) attributed to biochemical wastewater treatment section, S (2.22 wt%) and Al (6.34 wt%) originated from pulping & papermaking process, have been also detected. The XRD patterns of the paper sludge, psAC, and the Cr(VI)-contained psAC were shown in Fig. 3a. The XRD spectra exhibited that there existed some main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 23.0°; 29.3°; 39.3°; 43.1°; 48.4°; 57.3° that could be attributed to the (012), (104), (113), (202), (116), (122) planes of calcite respectively (Skubiszewska-Zięba et al., 2017). After physiochemical activation, the prepared psAC has been immersed with 1 M HNO3 for the removal of residue Na2CO3 and K2CO3, while the calcite-type CaCO3 has been also washed out. Thus, the diffraction pattern of the psAC has lost all the original calcite characteristic peaks. The new appeared diffraction peaks at 20.8°, 26.3°, 36.3°, etc., could be identified as the peaks for graphite (311), (002), and carbon (Zhang et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2010), respectively. Furthermore, the coexisting peaks with a broad diffraction curve have been strongly indicated that the psAC consisted of both a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase. The other new-observed peaks with weaker intensity at 31.2° and 32.9° could correspond to the generation of cristobalite and the calcium silicate hydrates (CSHs) (Siddique et al., 2016; Shamsudin et al., 2017). After adsorption of Cr(VI), almost all of the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peaks have been weakened, which directly showed the successful combination of Cr(VI) and the psAC. To further analyze the surface chemical composition of Cr(VI)-adsorbed psAC, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed. The high-resolution XPS spectra and their fits in Cr 2p, C 1s, and O 1s regions were shown in Fig. S1, Fig. 3b–d. In Fig. 3b, it can be seen that after Cr(VI) adsorption, the Cr 2p3/2 intensity peaks located at 579.6 eV were corresponding to Cr(VI) and 577.6 eV proved the existence of Cr(III) oxidation state (Tran, 2019). Therefore, the Cr 2p XPS results suggested that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) occurred during psAC adsorption. In Fig. 3c, the C 1s peak was begun at 280.0 eV and ended at 292.0 eV, which could be split into four single peaks and identified as the carbon group at 284.8 eV (CC, sp2), 285.8 eV (CC, sp3), 286.1 eV (CO) and 289.1 eV (-COOH) (Davydov et al., 2014). In Fig. 3d, the O 1s peak was begun at 526.3 eV and ended at 538.6 eV, which could be split into 3 peaks that represented the CO at 531.7 eV and -C-O- (contains C-O-C and C-O-H types) at 532.6 eV (Yu et al., 2007). The XPS results proved that there existed an abundance of oxygen functional groups in psAC, which has been also further supported by the next FTIR spectroscopy analysis as described in Fig. S2. FTIR was performed to analyze the chemical bonds presented in the prepared psAC. From the FTIR spectra, it could be found that there are abundant functional groups in the raw materials, such as CO (1637 cm−1), -CH2 (2927 cm−1), CN (1425, cm−1) and CO3 2− (873 cm−1), etc. (Mokhtari et al., 2018). After physical activation, the changes in functional groups were minimal. But after molten salts activation, the peaks changed sharply. In detail, the observed broad peaks at 3431 cm−1 could be assigned to -OH and water (Seyedzadeh et al., 2017). Due to the strict waterproof during the FTIR test, such large broad peaks indicated that the psAC contained a lot of -OH. The broad peaks at 1559 and 1212 cm−1 correspond to CC and CC, CO respectively (Dubal et al., 2012). After the adsorption of Cr(VI), the peak position of the hydroxyl group had a blue-shift, indicated that the hydroxyl groups played a role for Cr(VI) adsorption. According to the literature, the hydrogen bond forming between hydroxyl/carbonyl groups on activation carbon surface and Cr(VI)-contained groups in aqueous solution, which is responsible for the efficiency adsorption."
10,Cr(VI) adsorption studies,"3.3 Cr(VI) adsorption studies 3.3.1 Effect of adsorbent dosage and pH Various factors affecting Cr(VI) adsorption, e.g., psAC addition (i.e., adsorbent dosage), pH, etc., have been investigated. Firstly, removal behavior of Cr(VI) at the initial concentration of 20 mg·L−1 was studied at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h in simulative wastewater (pH = 5.25) with different doses of the prepared psAC, which was vital to get the best adsorption capacity/removal efficiency of Cr(VI) trade-off resulting in optimum adsorbent dosage. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Cr(VI) removal efficiency was gradually increased with increasing the psAC addition and reached to a good removal efficiency (>92.5%) at the psAC addition of >1.0 g·L−1. Besides, the pH of the solution can affect the surface charge and ionization of absorbent to change the removal capacity of adsorbents for electronegative Cr(VI), which has been also deeply investigated. Generally, the main forms of dichromate anion in aqueous are HCrO4 − and Cr3O7 2− at pH of 1–6, and CrO4 2−at pH of 7–10 (Yang et al., 2019). The simulated wastewater with an initial Cr(VI)'s concentration of 20 mg/L was obtained by diluting the standard stock solution, and the results were shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4b, it can be easily observed that the adsorption of Cr(VI) on psAC depended strongly on the initial pH. The maximum removal efficiency, which was up to 97%, could be achieved within a pH of <6.0. However, the Zeta potential of the adsorbent (in Fig. 4c) is electropositive only at a pH range of 1–4.8, which further illustrated that the adsorption was not based on electrostatic attraction but hydrogen bonding by the surface oxygen functional groups. According to the above results, in the rest study, 1.0 g·L−1 of psAC and the natural pH (~5.25) have been selected as the optimum conditions for the next studies. 3.3.2 Adsorption kinetics studies To study the mechanism of the Cr(VI) adsorption process, kinetic adsorption experiments with the initial Cr(VI) concentration of 15 mg/L were preformed at 25 °C. The adsorption capacity of psAC was measured in the contact time range from 0–100 h. The psAC addition was fixed at 1.0 g/L. As seen in Fig. 5a–d, the Cr(VI) adsorption kinetics curve has been fitted by pseudo-first-order model, pseudo-second-order model (Fig. 5a), intra-particle diffusion model (Fig. 5b), and Elovich model (Fig. 5c) respectively. Normally, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics exhibit the information of reaction dynamics and adsorption types, e.g., chemisorption and physisorption, while intra-particle diffusion and Elovich model fitting was used to evaluate the transport process and adsorption on heterogeneous adsorbents. The above models can be, in turn, expressed as the equation listed below (Zhang et al., 2019). (3) q t = q e 1 − e K 1 t (4) q t = K 2 q e 2 1 + K 2 q e t t (5) q t = K dif t 1 / 2 + C (6) q t = 1 β ln 1 + αβt Table S3 presented the fitting results for the Cr(VI) adsorption on psAC while the visual analysis results have been described in Fig. 5. Besides, from the Fig. 5a, it can be known that the R-square value (R2) of pseudo-second-order was higher than that of the pseudo-first-order model, which indicated that the rate-limiting step might be a chemisorption process (Liang et al., 2019). In Fig. 5b, partial R2 of the three obtained straight lines were <0.9, while the lines have not been passed through the origin, verifying the Intra-particle diffusion is not the only step to control the adsorption process. The results described in Fig. 5c clearly exhibited that the adsorption efficiency can be well fitted with the Elovich model with the highest R2 of 0.9975, suggesting the existence of chemical effect (including hydrogen bonding) between Cr(VI) and psAC in the heterogeneous adsorption process. Combined with FTIR analysis, it could deduce that the Cr(VI) adsorption process over the inner/outer surface of psAC was dominated by hydrogen bonding. 3.3.3 Adsorption isotherm studies In addition, the Langmuir (Eq. (7)) (Vaghetti et al., 2009) and Freundlich (Eq. (8)) (Pang et al., 2011) adsorption isotherm models have been also employed for illustrating the adsorption mechanism. The fitting results and related parameters were shown in Fig. 5d and Table S4. Langmuir isotherm is applicable for monomolecular layer adsorption on a homogeneous system, which has been widely used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity for pollutants. However, the Freundlich equation is always employed for adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces with various classes of adsorption sites, together with various adsorption energy levels. (7) q e = Q max K L C e 1 + K L C e (8) q e = K F C e 1 n The adsorption of Cr(VI) on psAC demonstrated that the R2 value in the Freundlich model was higher than in the Langmuir model, which implied that the adsorption process on psAC involved a heterogeneous surface with many cavities, oxygen functional groups. Besides, the maximum adsorption capacity of psAC calculated by Langmuir fitting was 54.04 mg/g. Compared with other reported AC adsorbents listed in Table S5, the prepare psAC in this study showed an acceptable adsorption performance. 3.3.4 Thermodynamic study Although equilibrium constants were used in several papers to obtained enthalpy changes, entropy changes, free Gibbs energy and other thermodynamic parameters, but it is inaccurate to randomly choose an equilibrium constant to calculate. Yu Liu et al. (Yu, n.d.; Liu and Xu, 2007; Liu and Liu, 2008) compared a variety of calculation methods to calculate ∆G° (such as calculation of ∆G° from Langmuir equilibrium constant, Flory-Huggins equilibrium constant, Frumkin equilibrium constant, etc.) concluded that for neutral adsorbates, adsorbates with a very weak charge or a dilute solution of charged adsorbate, using the Langmuir equilibrium constant for calculation of ∆G° and subsequent determination of ∆H° and ∆S° is numerically correct and suitable for this study. In this case, the Langmuir equilibrium constant could be applied for the determination of ∆G°(Eqs. (9) and (10)). More importantly, a perfectly straight line was found between ln KL and 1/T, and this allows determination of ∆H° and ∆S° by using Eq. (11) (Table 1 ). (9) ∆ G 0 = − RT ln K L (10) ∆ G 0 = ∆ H 0 − T∆ S 0 If Eq. (11) is inserted into Eq. (10), it becomes (11) lnK L = ∆ S 0 R − ∆ H 0 R 1 T The ΔG0 values at different temperatures were all negative, suggesting that the adsorption of Cr(VI) on psAC was spontaneous. The ΔG0 values decreased when the temperature increased, which indicated that the spontaneous degree also increased with the temperature increasing. Besides, the calculated ΔH0 and ΔS0 values in Table 1 were both positive, which confirmed that the adsorption mechanism was indeed endothermic. According to the value of ΔH0 (21.39 kJ/mol), the Cr(VI) chemisorption on psAC can be further verified as a hydrogen bonding-controlled process. Hydrogen bonds are characterized by interaction energies in the range from 5 to 30 kJ/mol (Todres, 2013). 3.3.5 Proposed Cr(VI) removal mechanism The high adsorption capacity of psAC toward Cr(VI) was not only dominated by the high SBET, but the oxygen-containing functional groups formed during the carbon activation process, it greatly improved the Cr(VI) removal efficiency. Based on the analysis results of FTIR, XPS, Zeta potential, adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, etc., the Cr(VI) adsorption mechanism of the prepared psAC has been shown in Fig. 6 . It can be divided into the following steps: (1) The small radius of HCrO4 − and Cr2O7 2− were firstly adsorbed into the micro-channel surface of psAC. (2) The hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the inner/outer surface of psAC would form with HCrO4 − and Cr2O7 2− by hydrogen bonding. (3) Partial of the adsorbed Cr(VI) have been simultaneously reduced to nontoxic Cr(III) by hydroxyl and other oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e., electron donors). 3.3.6 Effect of co-existing ions on Cr(VI) removal In actual effluent treatment, ion selectivity is an important factor to judge the practical feasibility of adsorbent (Liu et al., 2019). In this study, several common anions (Cl−, SO4 2−, NO3 2−) and cations (Ca2+, K+, Na+) in wastewater have been investigated as seen in Fig. 7a. The experiments were carried out under the optimal conditions as mentioned above. The results showed that under the optimal conditions, these additional ions have no significant effect on Cr(VI) removal efficiency, which confirmed that the psAC can be used as an efficient adsorbent for purification of industrial chromium-containing wastewater. 3.3.7 Reusability Moreover, the investigation of the reusability of the prepared psAC was also performed by adsorption of Cr(VI) for four times under the optimal conditions mentioned above. Before reusing, the Cr(VI)-contained psAC should be immersed in 0.2 M HNO3 for 3 h at 25 °C and 150 rpm and followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C overnight for reactivation. Fig. 7(b) showed that the adsorption efficiency was significantly reduced till three cycles, maintaining at >72% after four cycles. 3.3.8 Potential application of the waste psAC in FF hydrogenation As a further use of Cr(VI)-contained psAC waste adsorbent, a CuCr catalyst was prepared for application in FF hydrogenation and the time-dependent results were shown in Fig. 8 . It can be easily seen that the FF conversion increased with the time increasing while the FFA selectivity first increased then decreased with the increase of reaction time. The highest FFA selectivity of 62.1% was reached at 5 h with the FF conversion of 96.6%. According to the literature, owing to the further conversion of FF into other byproducts including methyl levulinate, the downtrend of FFA selectivity after 5 h could be reasonable. Although the CuCr catalyst prepared from the waste psAC adsorbent has not exhibited the remarkable catalytic performance for FF hydrogenation, comparing with the traditional CuCr catalyst reported other literature (Villaverde et al., 2013), it also provided a good example for reutilization of the waste Cr-contained AC adsorbents."
11,Conclusion,"The paper sludge-based active carbon has been prepared by a physicochemical activation technique, which exhibited a remarkable removal performance for the wastewater of low Cr(VI) concentration with the maximum adsorption capacity of 54.04 mg/g at 25 °C. The batch experimental, characterization analysis and kinetic, isotherms, and thermodynamic studies co-verified that the removal process of Cr(VI) on psAC surface was a chemisorption process and dominated by hydrogen bonding under acidic condition. Lastly, The waster Cr(VI)-contained psAC has been also applied in furfural hydrogenation and exhibited an acceptable catalytic performance. Therefore, this study offers new opportunities in investigating the technical-economic feasible method for simultaneous treatment of industrial wastewater of low Cr(VI) concentration and the paper sludge."
