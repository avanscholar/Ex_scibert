0,Introduction,"The increasing depletion of fossil resources has prompted people to find sustainable resources and routes to replace their applications in chemical, energy and other industries. As the richest renewable resources in the world, biomass has attracted great interests in producing fuels, medicines, plastics and value-added chemicals [1,2]. Among them, the production of polyols such as ethylene glycol (EG) and 1, 2-propanediol (1, 2-PDO) from biomass is especially worthwhile because of their various uses in the production of polyester fibers, resins and serving as antifreezes and coolants [3–5]. Hydrolysis, hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of typical biomass, such as monosaccharides, polysaccharides and their alcohols, to produce polyol chemicals over catalysts have been widely studied [6–9]. At present, the catalysts used in the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass and model compounds to polyols can be mainly divided into three categories: Ni-based catalysts supported by metal oxides [10–12], noble metals or hydrogenation catalysts modified with noble metals [13–15] and tungsten-based hydrogenation catalysts [16–18]. Among them, Ni-base catalysts supported by metal oxides have been widely used because of their excellent hydrogenation performance and low cost. Historically, Raney Ni was employed as the catalyst for hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol due to its low-cost [19]. However, the single nickel-based catalyst has low reactivity and selectivity, and it was easily poisoned. Thus, researchers turned their attention to load nickel on the support to improve its catalytic performance and obtained better results. Ni-based catalysts supported on various supports such as Al2O3, diatomaceous earth, TiO2, SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, MgO and MCM-48 were exploited and the catalytic performance showed that the type of supports played a key role in the distribution of the products [20–24]. Wang et al. confirmed that 20% Ni/ZnO catalyst can completely convert cellulose and the yield of glycol can reach 70.4% [12]. Miao et al. reported a one-pot conversion of microalgae to glycol over Ni-ZnO catalyst with a yield of 37.0% at 523 K for 3 h with 6.0 MPa of H2. To improve the yield of 1,2-PDO and EG, MnO x was introduced as the promoter into Ni-ZnO catalyst and the 41.5% yield was obtained with 100% conversion of microalgae. The introduction of MgO was proved to promote the function of ZnO supporter on the bond-breaking at C3–C4 position. The total yield of glycol reached up to 53.6% when MnO x -promoted nickel-based catalyst was employed for direct hydrogenation of microalgae (Chlorococcum sp.), and the MnO x promoter was found to stabilize the catalyst structure by preventing the Ni catalyst particles from aggregation [11,25]. As the C2 and C3 products of hydrogenation of biomass, the EG and 1,2-PDO are obtained from the C–C bond cleavage at C2–C3 and C3–C4 positions of C6 sugars. To reveal production process of 1,2-PDO and EG over Ni-based catalyst, the concise pathway based on a series of analysis for the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass to glycols is as follows: Biomass hydrolyzed into monosaccharides or oligosaccharides under the attack of protonic acid. The obtained C6 sugars were further converted into glycolaldehyde via retro-aldol reactions, which was finally hydrogenated to EG. Moreover, glucose could also isomerize to fructose, and fructose could produce two C3 intermediates (1,3-dihydroxyacetone and pyruvaldehyde) through retro-aldol reactions. 1,3-dihydroxyacetone and pyruvaldehyde were further hydrogenated to glycerol and 1,2-PDO [26]. Wang et al. [12] proved that the hydrolysis process is the rate-determining step for the hydrogenation of cellulose into glycols over Ni-ZnO catalyst. Based on 13C NMR, GC–MS and HPLC qualitative analysis, MgO-ZnO favored isomerization of glucose to fructose. Meanwhile, C1 position of EG, the C1 and C3 positions of 1,2-PDO were labeled with 13C, which is attributed to a C–C bond cleavage at d-1-13C-glucose's corresponding position through retro-aldol reaction [27,28]. At the same time, we found a new pathway which underwent a one-step hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol, which was confirmed to be able to convert into EG [11,25]. In this work, we investigated the selective hydrogenation of glucose into 1,2-PDO and EG in water with MnO x -promoted Ni-based catalysts supported by ZnO at 523 K. To reveal the role of the promoter and supporter on the hydrogenation process, the catalytic performances of Ni-MnO x -ZnO, ZnO, MnO x -ZnO, Ni-ZnO, Ni-MnO x were compared when glucose, sorbitol and main intermediate C3 products (glycerol and lactic acid (LA)) served as the feedstock. On the basis of the reactivity and products distribution observed over a series of Ni-based catalysts, a general reaction pathway was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All chemicals were used as received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Catalysts used in the experiments were prepared by a co-precipitation method [11,25]. In a typical process, 200 mL deionized water were mixed with a certain mole ratio of metal nitrate and stirring at 343 K. Then, 1.2 mol L−1 of sodium carbonate solution was added slowly to adjust pH to 8.0. The mixture was stirred for 3–4 h at the same temperature. After the stirring, the mixture was filtered and filter cake was continuously washed with deionized water for several times to remove the sodium and nitrate ions. The filter cake was dried at 353 K in the air for 8 h, followed by heating at 5 K min−1 to 673 K in static air and maintaining for 4 h. The calcined catalyst was heated in a tube furnace with a flow of 100 mL min−1 of hydrogen at a rate of 5 K min−1 to 623 K and reduced for 10 h. Finally, the reduced catalyst was cooled to the room temperature and passivated with a flow of 1% O2/N2 (V/V). All the catalysts (Ni-MnO x -ZnO, Ni-MnO x , Ni-ZnO, MnO x -ZnO, ZnO) were prepared by the same methods with different types and moler ratios of metal nitrate. According to our previous reports, as for the Ni-MnO x -ZnO catalyst, the loading amount of Ni and Mn was selected as 40% and 5%, respectively, and the nickel crystal size was calculated as 8.5 nm [25]. The elemental composition of the synthesized catalyst was measured using ICP on an Optimal Emission Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Optima 8000). The ICP results show that Ni, Mn and Zn cations were not detected in the reacted liquid by ICP analysis."
3,Catalytic experiments and product analysis,"2.2 Catalytic experiments and product analysis Aqueous catalytic hydrogenation of glucose and other intermediates was performed with a 50 mL Parr pressure reactor. In a typical reaction protocol, substrates, catalysts and deionized water were added to the reactor with set ratio. Before the reaction, hydrogen was used to blow the reactor for several times to purge the air. The mixture was kept at 523 K with a certain pressure of hydrogen for many hours at 600 rpm stirring. While continuous sampling was required, the sampling valve was opened to obtain a little liquid and hydrogen was filled to keep the pressure constant. After the reaction, the liquid solution was separated from the solid mixture by centrifugation and collected with a 0.22 µm pore-size filters prior to analysis. GC-MS and HPLC analysis were used to analyze the liquid solution for the product distribution and the quantitation of target products (EG, 1,2-PDO). Qualitation of products was performed on an Agilent 7890 GC with Agilent 5975C inert MSD) equipped with a HP-INNO Wax column (30 × 0.25 mm, film thickness, 0.25 µm). Quantification of products was performed on a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC with an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column: 300 mm × 7.8 mm and a differential refraction detector (RID-10A) with a 12 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution in a flow rate of 0.65 mL min−1. The analysis used the external standard method (the linearity of the working curve of each product was above 99%) [29]. The yields of different products were calculated based on carbon via the equations: Yield (%) = [(moles of the carbon in the products determined by HPLC)/(moles of the carbon in the intermediates or carbohydrate components of feedstocks)] × 100%. In this reaction, the gas phase products were rare and can be neglected. Solid products were not quantified in this work because of their uncertain structures."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalytic performance of various catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic performance of various catalysts The variety of liquid products of glucose on Ni-MnO x -ZnO, ZnO, MnO x -ZnO, Ni-ZnO and Ni-MnO x during the reaction time was shown in Fig. 1 (Sample points were 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h, respectively. The time (after 25 min heating process) at which the temperature rose to the target temperature was 0 h). In the presence of Ni-MnO x -ZnO catalyst, the conversion of glucose reached up to 64.5% when the temperature just rose to 523 K and the value reached up to about 100% after 1 h (Fig. 1a). The yields of the EG and 1,2-PDO displayed an increasing trend and reached up to 10.2% and 27.4% after 3 h, respectively. At 0 h, the products were mainly sorbitol and LA, indicating that glucose was underwent part hydrogenation and C–C bonds cleavage in the initial heating process. Then, the yield of sorbitol reached up to 42.1% at 0.5 h and decreased rapidly, which indicated that glucose converted into sorbitol through hydrogenation reaction in the initial stage and the sorbitol was expended to produced C2 and C3 products. At 0 h, the yield of LA reached 38.0%, which was attributed to the retro-aldol reaction of fructose, which was from the isomerization of glucose in heating process [30,31]. Then, the yield of LA decreased because of its hydrogenation to 1,2-PDO and other products [28]. As another typical C3 product, the yield of glycerol reached up to 22.7% at 2 h and decreased to 12.6% after 3 h over Ni-MnO x -ZnO catalyst. The variety of liquid products of glucose on ZnO support was shown in Fig. 1(b). The conversion had an increasing trend in the reaction and the value was over 99.9% after 3 h. The typical C3 products, LA, 1, 2-PDO and glycerol, were obtained and LA was the main product with a yield of 40.6% after 3 h. 1, 2-PDO reached 8.1% and no EG was detected. The products of glucose were all C3 compounds over ZnO catalyst, indicating that the hydrogenation performance of the ZnO support was weak and the main effect was promoting the C–C bond cleavage between C3 and C4 position of glucose. Fig. 1(c) shows time courses for glucose conversion and product yields over MnO x -ZnO catalyst. The conversion of glucose reached 93.5% when the temperature just rose to the set temperature. At this time, the yields of LA, 1, 2-PDO and glycerol were 26.8%, 6.1%, and 10.9%, respectively, and the values were 36.6%, 7.4%, and 3.1% after 3 h. Compared with the results of the ZnO support, the conversion of glucose was significantly increased after the addition of MnO x , and a high conversion and a high yield of LA were obtained in the initial stage of the reaction. Combining with Fig. 1(b and c), the addition of MnO x enhanced the C–C bond cleavage efficiency of the ZnO support. The results of Ni-ZnO catalyst were similar with that of Ni-MnO x -ZnO especially for the 70.8% conversion of glucose when the temperature just reached 523 K (Fig. 1d). Differently, more sorbitol was produced at the initial stage and then reached 57.2% at 0.5 h, meanwhile the yield of LA was less than 8% in the whole reaction. The results revealed that MnO x promoted the C3–C4 bond cleavage so that more C3 compounds were produced, resulting in less sorbitol. The results were consistent with the reference [25]. The yields of EG and 1, 2-PDO were 8.9% and 23.2% at the end of the reaction, but the values were always less than that from the conversion with Ni-MnO x -ZnO. Thus, MnO x also promoted the hydrogenation performance of Ni-ZnO for converting the intermediates to the target products. The addition of MnO x increased the dispersion of Ni and ZnO resulting in a better hydrogenation performance and C–C bond cleavage performance, which was proved in our previous work [25]. The time courses for glucose conversion and product yields over Ni-MnO x were displayed on Fig. 1(e). During the whole reaction, the yield of 1, 2-PDO was always higher than that of LA and reached 29.0% with an increasing trend. Different from Fig. 1(a and d), the yield of sorbitol was less than 10%, further indicating that MnO x promoted the cleavage of C3–C4 bond rather than the hydrogenation of glucose into sorbitol. Based on all the analysis above, the results confirmed that the role of Ni was to promote the hydrogenation reaction and the conversion of the intermediates to the target products. When the amount of catalyst changed to 0.2 g, the yields of EG and 1, 2-PDO were 12.7% and 39.6%. Besides, 12.6% of glycerol was also obtained (Line 1, Table 1 ). In contrast, the hydrogenation hardly proceeded after the conversion of glucose into LA in the absence of Ni (ZnO, MnO x -ZnO). The MnO x -ZnO and ZnO support could only convert glucose to LA (Line 2 and line 3 in Table 1), and Ni promoted the hydrogenation of LA to 1, 2-PDO. MnO x owned a strong C–C bond cleavage performance especially for C3–C4 position of glucose. As shown in Table 1, the addition of MnO x increased the ratio of the yield of 1, 2-PDO to EG. Meanwhile, MnO x mainly enhanced the hydrogenation performance of Ni and the C–C bond cleavage performance of ZnO. In the whole hydrogenation process, as the stable immediate, sorbitol and C3 products (glycerol, LA) were obtained, so it was necessary to reveal the hydrogenation pathway using them as the feedstocks."
6,Conversion of different intermediates,"3.2 Conversion of different intermediates Time courses of sorbitol selective hydrogenation over Ni-MnO x -ZnO, Ni-ZnO and Ni-MnO x were shown in Table 2 . The conversions of sorbitol over the above catalysts were 98.7%, 53.0% and 17.7%, respectively. The yields of 1, 2-PDO and EG were 37.4% and 15.3%, 16.1% and 7.0%, 7.5% and 4.4%, respectively. The order of total yields of 1, 2-PDO and EG was Ni-MnO x -ZnO > Ni-ZnO > Ni-MnO x . The total yield of 1, 2-PDO and EG over Ni-MnO x -ZnO was 52.7%, which was even higher than the value obtained from glucose at the same condition. The result indicated that the pathway that via sorbitol obtained a better carbon yield compared with the pathway of glucose. Moreover, the yields of glycerol and LA over the above catalysts were 11.9% and 7.8%, 11.5% and 6.8%, 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively. The values of Ni-MnO x -ZnO were similar with the values of Ni-ZnO, which were much larger than the that of Ni-MnO x , indicating that ZnO played an important role in the conversion of sorbitol to glycerol and LA, and MnO x could promote the process of glycerol and LA to 1,2-PDO and EG [25]. To reveal the role of Ni-MnO x -ZnO, Ni-MnO x and Ni-ZnO in the conversion of LA to 1, 2-PDO, the reaction that LA as the substrate at 503 K was performed. The yields of 1, 2-PDO over the catalysts above were 10.2%, 38.1% and 11.9%, respectively. The results indicated that Mn contributed to the hydrogenation of LA to 1, 2-PDO. In contrast, ZnO support restrained this hydrogenation process. The products distribution of hydrogenation of glycerol with Ni-MnO x -ZnO, Ni-MnO x and Ni-ZnO under the same conditions was shown in Table 2. The conversion of glycerol over the catalysts above was 94.2%, 35.8% and 89.1%. The yields of 1, 2-PDO and EG over the catalysts above were 55.0% and 12.2%, 21.1% and 3.9%, 17.0% and 2.0%. Based on these results, ZnO contributed to the conversion of glycerol, and MnO x was good for increasing selectivity of 1, 2-PDO and EG from glycerol."
7,"Pathway of the conversion of glucose to 1, 2-PDO and EG","3.3 Pathway of the conversion of glucose to 1, 2-PDO and EG Based on the analysis above, the 2 pathways for glucose selective hydro into glycols were summarized, as shown in Scheme 1 . Pathway 1: glucose firstly isomerized to fructose, which happened in the heating stage. Fructose generated C3 and C2 compounds via retro-aldol reaction under the basic carriers ZnO with the assistance of MnO x . The C2 compound, glycolaldehyde, was generated by the bond-breaking between C2 and C3 position. Glycolaldehyde was hydrogenated to EG in the presence of Ni. Part of the bond cleavage occurred between C3 and C4 position, which generated two unstable C3 intermediates, dihydroxyacetone and 2,3-dihydroxypropionaldehyde. The C3 intermediates were further converted to glycerol and LA in the presence of nickel, which eventually converted to 1,2-PDO with the assistance of MnO x [28]. Pathway 2: glucose was directly hydrogenated to sorbitol under the catalysis of nickel and ZnO support. Sorbitol underwent C–C bond cleavage with the help of ZnO support, and the one generated EG after the cleavage between C2–C3 and C4–C5 positions. There was also part of C–C bond cleavage happened in C3–C4 position, which caused the formation of two molecules of glycerol. Some of the glycerol would undergo C–C bond cleavage over catalyst to produce EG. Catalytic dehydrogenation of glycerol produced an intermediate, pyruvaldehyde. Unstable pyruvaldehyde underwent a rearrangement reaction of bisphenol glycolic acid in basic conditions to generate LA, and carboxyl hydrogenation of LA to 1,2-PDO [27]."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the hydrogenation performances of glucose, sorbitol, LA and glycerol into EG and 1, 2-PDO over Ni-MnO x -ZnO, ZnO, MnO x -ZnO, Ni-ZnO, Ni-MnO x catalysts were compared in water at 523 K to reveal the role of nickel, MnO x and ZnO support in the converting reaction. Cheap nickel provided a novel route of glucose to sorbitol and promoted the consecutive conversion of glycerol and LA to 1, 2-PDO. With the assistance of MnO x , ZnO support displayed an excellent C–C bond cleavage performance especially for C3–C4 positions. Simultaneously, ZnO and MnO x enhanced the conversion of glycerol to LA and LA to 1, 2-PDO, respectively. Based on the analysis above, two pathways were proposed to reveal the hydrogenation process of glucose to EG and 1, 2-PDO over Ni-MnO x -ZnO catalyst."
