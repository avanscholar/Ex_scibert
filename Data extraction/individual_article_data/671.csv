0,Introduction,"The oxidation of alcohols into the corresponding carbonyl compounds is one of the most important functional group transformations in organic synthesis, as they have widespread applications in perfumery, dyestuff and agro chemical industries [1–3]. Many traditional inorganic oxidants for alcohols oxidation are well known, such as PCC, MnO2, Na2Cr2O7, NaClO4, KMnO4, which are hazardous or toxic. From the point of view of environmentally benign and clean technologies, synthetic strategies that avoid the use of any organic solvents as well as corrosive catalysts and oxidants are attractive. One of the preferred solutions is to use stable, active and environment friendly catalyst for carrying out oxidation of alcohols using mild and environmentally benign oxidant with a high content of active oxygen. One favourite oxidant to resort to is hydrogen peroxide as it can oxidize organic compounds with water as a by-product [4,5] and thus also avoids the production of highly toxic wastes. These advantages of hydrogen peroxide encourage researcher to develop new catalytic systems for H2O2-mediated oxidation reactions. A detail study on H2O2-mediated oxidation of various organic compounds using tungstate based catalyst and a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) has been reported by Noyori et al. [5]. Recently, polyoxometalates (POMs) have received increasing attention as oxidation catalysts due to their unique redox properties [6–11]. Based on POMs catalysts, a variety of different catalytic systems for hydrogen peroxide promoted oxidation have been developed [12–14]. Among POMs, transition metal mono-substituted Keggin-type polyoxometalates (TMSPs), [XM11M′O39](n−m)− (central atom X=P, Si, B; addenda atom M=W, Mo), in which a transition metal cation, M′ m+, is coordinated to the binding sites of lacunary heteropolyanions [XM11O39] n−, have generated substantial interest as oxidative catalysts. This is because they have available open coordination sites on the transition metals and their redox properties could be controlled at the atomic/molecular levels by changing addenda atoms without affecting the Keggin type primary structure [15,16]. It has been reported that addition of transition metals are expected to influence redox properties considerably, particularly when they are incorporated in the primary structure of the Keggin ion [17,18]. A key problem in the use of transition metal substituted Keggin type compounds is their solvolytic instability towards aqueous H2O2 [19]. But at the same time, without degradation of catalysts, oxidation of organic substrates with aqueous H2O2 catalyzed by some TMSPs (TM=Cr, Co, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) are also known [20–22]. Griffith [23,24], Cavaleiro [25–30], Nomiya [31,32] and their co-workers have reported catalytic use of transition metal substituted polyoxotungstates with hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions. Catalytic system based on oxidation reactions catalyzed by transition metals (especially Ti and Zr) substituted polyoxotungstates using H2O2 were very well explored by Kholdeeva et al. [33–37]. They have also established molecular models for studying mechanism of H2O2 based selective oxidation catalysis. Wang et al. demonstrated the oxidation of cyclohexanol with H2O2 using [SiW11MO39](n−m)− (M=Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V) as effective catalysts in biphasic system [38]. Further, they carried out oxidation of other alcohols using Na6 [SiW11ZnH2O40]·12H2O with H2O2. Thus, a literature survey shows that almost all work have been carried out using polyoxotungstates. At the same time, similar reports on analogous phosphomolybdates are scanty. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols has been investigated under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions over antimony-substituted Keggin-type phosphomolybdates in benzonitrile at 135°C by Neumann et al. [39]. Ge Peng et al. studied the oxidation of liquid phase benzyl alcohol over a series of Cs salts of vanadomolybdo phosphate using H2O2 as oxidant [7]. Sai Prasad et al. reported vapor phase air oxidation of benzyl alcohol using vanadium incorporated ammonium salt of molybdophosphate [40]. In the case of transition metal substituted phosphomolybdates, most of the work have been carried on vanadium substituted phosphomolybdate. Also, reactions have been carried out at higher temperature or using organic solvent. Studies on other transition metal (e.g. Co, Mn, Ni) substituted phosphomolybdates under mild reaction conditions are not available. Recently, we have reported synthesis and detailed characterization of Keggin-type caesium salt of transition metal substituted phosphomolybdates, Cs5 [PCo(H2O)Mo11O39]·6H2O and Cs5[PMn(H2O)Mo11O39]·6H2O [41]. As an extension of our work, here, we report the catalytic performance of caesium salt of transition metal (Co, Mn, Ni) substituted phosphomolybdates PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni) for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide under solvent free condition. Detailed catalytic studies on oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried using best catalyst by varying different parameters such as mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to H2O2, amount of the catalyst, reaction time and reaction temperature. Further, oxidation of various alcohols such as cyclopentanol, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol was also carried out under optimized conditions. The catalytic activity of recycled catalysts was also evaluated for oxidation of benzyl alcohol under optimized condition."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals used were of A.R. grade. 12-Molybdophosphoric acid, H3PMo12O40, sodium hydroxide, Na2MoO4·2H2O Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 30% H2O2, benzyl alcohol, cyclopentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol and dichloromethane were obtained from Merck and used as received."
3,Synthesis of transition metal substituted phosphomolybdates [41],"2.2 Synthesis of transition metal substituted phosphomolybdates [41] H3PMo12O40 (PMo12, 1.825g, 1mmol) was dissolved in of water (10mL) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 4.3 using sodium hydroxide solution. Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.249g, 1mmol) dissolved in minimum amount of water was mixed with above hot solution. pH of solution was adjusted to 4.5 (pH 4.3 for nickel substituted phosphomolybdate). The solution was heated at 80°C with stirring for 1h and filtered hot. To the hot filtrate saturated solution of CsCl was added drop wise and allowed to stand. As obtained crystals were very poorly soluble in any solvent, no recrystallisation was carried out. The obtained dark reddish brown crystals were filtered, air dried and designated as PMo11Co. Other transition metal (M=Mn and Ni) substituted phosphomolybdates were also synthesized according to the similar method, by taking corresponding metal-acetate salt. The obtained materials were designated as PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The synthesized materials were characterized by elemental analysis, TG-DTA, FT-IR, XRD and ESR. Elemental analysis was carried out using the JSM 5610 LV EDX-SEM analyzer. TG-DTA was carried out on the Mettler Toledo Star SW 7.01 up to 600°C in air with the heating rate of 5°C/min. FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded as the KBr pellet on the PerkinElmer instrument. The powder XRD pattern was obtained by using the instrument Philips Diffractometer (Model PW–1830). The conditions used were Cu Kα radiation (1.5417Å). The ESR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-line Century series X-band ESR spectrometer (room temperature and scanned from 2000 to 3200 Gauss)."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction The oxidation reaction was carried out in a borosilicate glass reactor provided with a double walled condenser. The desired catalyst, alcohol and H2O2 mixtures were intensively stirred in the reactor at the set constant temperature for the whole duration of reaction. Same reaction was carried out by varying different parameters such as effect of mole ratio of alcohol to H2O2, amount of the catalyst, reaction time and reaction temperature. After completion of the reaction, catalyst was removed and the product was extracted with dichloromethane. The product was dried with magnesium sulphate and analyzed on a gas chromatograph using BP-1 capillary column. Product was identified by comparison with the authentic samples and finally by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization It is observed from Table 1 that, all the catalysts show weight loss of 4.2–4.83% at 150°C, correspond to 7H2O. Similarly, DTA of all catalysts show an endothermic peak due to water of crystallization. An exothermic peak in the region 415–430°C indicates decomposition of Keggin unit. The FT-IR spectra for PMo12, PMo11Co, PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni are shown in Fig. S1 (unprocessed). The FT-IR of PMo12 show bands at 1070cm−1, 965cm−1 and 870 and 790cm−1 corresponding to the symmetric stretching of PO, MoO and MoOMo bonds, respectively. The FT-IR spectra show PO bond frequency 1050, 1043 and 1046cm−1 for PMo11Co, PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni respectively. The shift in band position as compare to PMo12 indicates the introduction of transition metal into the octahedral lacuna. A shift in the stretching vibration of MoO and MoOMo for all three compounds was also observed indicating the complexation of the transition metals. An additional band at 480, 422 and 442cm−1 is attributed to the CoO, MnO and NiO vibration, respectively. Thus, the FT-IR spectra clearly show the incorporation of Co/Mn/Ni into the Keggin framework. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of PMo12, PMo11Co, PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni indicates the synthesized complexes are crystalline in nature (Fig. S2). PMo12 shows XRD peaks in the region of 15–30 2θ corresponds to Keggin ion. From Fig S2, It is clear that, all the three synthesized materials show similar peaks pattern as their parent PMo12. This suggests presence of Keggin ion in the synthesized materials. The shift in 2θ value for PMo11Co, PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni compare to PMo12 may be due to the substitution of transition metal into lacuna. Further, the presence of Co(II), and Mn(II) in the synthesized compounds was confirmed by ESR. The full range (3200–2000G) X-band room temperature ESR spectra (Fig. 1 ) for PMo11Co, and PMo11Mn were recorded. ESR spectra of PMo11Co show eight hyperfine signals (Co2+; I=7/2), confirming the presence of paramagnetic Co(II). The observed g value of ~2.66 shows that Co(II) is in octahedral or distorted octahedral environment. Similarly, ESR spectra of PMo11Mn show six signals (Mn2+; s=5/2), indicates the presence of Mn(II) with octahedral or distorted octahedral symmetry. It is reported that the g value of ~2 attributed to octahedral or distorted octahedral environment of Mn(II) [42]. The obtained g value (2.03) is in good agreement with a reported one and confirms the presence of paramagnetic Mn(II)."
8,Catalytic studies,"3.2 Catalytic studies A detail study was carried out on oxidation of benzyl alcohol to optimize the conditions. To ensure the catalytic activity, all reactions were carried out without catalyst and no oxidation takes place. The reaction was carried out with 20mg of the PMo11Co for 24h at 90°C. Generally, benzyl alcohol on oxidation gives benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. However, benzaldehyde was characterized as the major oxidation product in the present case. 3.2.1 Effect of mole ratio In order to determine the effect of H2O2 on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, study was carried by varying benzyl alcohol: H2O2 mole ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 2:1 and 3:1) with PMo11Co as a catalyst. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . On increasing benzyl alcohol to H2O2 mole ratio of 1:1 to 1:3, conversion also increases. However, conversion was found to be almost same at 57% when the benzyl alcohol to H2O2 mole ratio was further changed to 1:4. Therefore, 1:3 mole ratio was optimized. 3.2.2 Effect of amount of the catalyst The amount of catalyst has a significant effect on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Five different amounts of PMo11Co viz., 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25mg were used, keeping all other reaction parameters fixed: namely temperature (90°C), namely benzyl alcohol (10mmol), 30% H2O2 (30mmol) and reaction time (24h). The results are shown in Fig. 3 , % conversion of 8.3, 21.4, 41.7, 56.5 and 57.4 was found corresponding to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25mg catalyst respectively. Lower conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde with 5 to 15mg catalyst may be due to fewer catalytic sites. The maximum percentage conversion was observed with 20mg catalyst but there was no remarkable difference in the progress of reaction when 25mg of catalyst was employed. Therefore, 20mg amount of catalyst was taken to be optimal. 3.2.3 Effect of mole ratio by keeping concentration of PMo11Co in aqueous phase fixed. As the substrate: H2O2 ratio is varied, the volume of aqueous phase is changing resulting in change in catalyst concentrations in aqueous phase. So, effect of mole ratio on oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also studied by keeping concentration of PMo11Co in aqueous phase constant i.e. 2.3mM. The results are shown in Table 2 . It is seen from Table 2 that, on increase of mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to H2O2, conversion also increases. However, conversion was found to be 56.5% and 61.2% when the benzyl alcohol to H2O2 mole ratio was 1:3 and 1:4 respectively, but selectivity of benzaldehyde decreases for 1:4 mole ratio (78.7%). From the view point of selectivity, 1:3 mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to H2O2 was optimized. 3.2.4 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was investigated at three different temperatures viz. 70, 90 and 110°C, keeping the other parameters fixed: namely benzyl alcohol (10mmol), 30% H2O2 (30mmol), PMo11Co (20mg) and reaction time (24h). The results are shown in Fig. 4 , which reveals that 32.2, 56.5 and 73.5% conversion were found corresponding to 70, 90 and 110°C respectively. At elevated temperature (110°C), 73.5% benzyl alcohol conversion was found with 74% selectivity of benzaldehyde and 26% selectivity for benzoic acid i.e. decrease in selectivity for benzaldehyde was observed. This is due to over oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid at elevated temperature. Hence, further optimization of the conditions was carried out with 90°C temperature. 3.2.5 Effect of reaction time The time dependence of catalytic solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol was studied by performing the reaction of benzyl alcohol (10mmol) with 30% H2O2 (30mmol) in the presence of 20mg of PMo11Co at 90°C with constant stirring. The conversion was monitored at different reaction times. It is seen from Fig. 5 , that with increase in reaction time, % conversion also increases. This is due to the reason that more time is required for the formation of reactive intermediate (substrate+catalyst) which is finally converted into the products. No significant change in % conversion as well as % selectivity was observed from 24h to 28h. Hence, reaction time was optimized for 24h. The optimum conditions for maximum % conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using PMo11Co as catalyst are; the mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to H2O2 is 1:3, 20mg of catalyst and 24h reaction time at 90°C. Under optimized condition, 50.2% atom efficiency is obtained. 3.2.6 Oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni). Oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out with PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni under optimized condition and results are presented in Table 3 . It is seen from Table 3 that, the order of activity of catalysts for oxidation of benzyl alcohol is PMo11Co≈PMo11Ni>PMo11Mn. These results indicate that the activity of catalyst is governed by reduction potential of metals used for substitution. The values for reduction potential for Co, Ni and Mn are −0.28V, −0.27V and −1.18V respectively. Among all the catalysts, PMo11Mn shows lowest conversion of benzyl alcohol and H2O2, as compare to other PMo11M (M=Co, Ni). PMo11Co and PMo11Ni show almost same conversion of benzyl alcohol. It is well known that, more negative the reduction potential, the poorer its oxidizing ability. From the reduction potential value it is clear that, catalyst consisting Mn is expected to be least active as compare to Co and Ni. Also, because of same reduction potential of catalysts consisting Co and Ni, similar activity is expected for oxidation reaction. So, results are as expected. The oxidation of various alcohols was carried out with PMo11M under optimized conditions and results are shown in Table 4 . As seen from Table 4 that, as benzyl alcohol oxidation, similar trend in activity of PMo11M (M=Co, Ni, Mn) was observed for oxidation of other alcohols such as cyclopentanol, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol i.e. PMo11Co shows better activity as compare to PMo11Mn and PMo11Ni. It was observed from Table 4 that, oxidation of secondary alcohol is easier as compare to primary alcohols. The observed trend is in good agreement with reported in art [43]. It was also observed that, long chain primary alcohol (1-octanol) is very less reactive in the present reaction conditions. 3.2.7 Control experiment A controlled experiment for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with Na2MoO4, CsPMo12, M(CH3COO)2 and PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni) was carried out under optimized conditions and results are presented in Table 5 . It is seen from Table 5 that in metal salts- catalyzed oxidation reactions, good conversion of benzyl alcohol with poor selectivity of benzaldehyde was obtained and they are not recyclable. Whereas, PMo11M, show good conversion i.e. ~11% more conversion as well as excellent selectivity for benzaldehyde as compare to their metal salts. Also, they can be recyclable. PMo11M combines properties of both PMo12 as well as their individual metal salts. At the same time, it is seen from Table 5 that, similar trend in activity of oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also observed for both metal salts as well as PMo11M. i.e. Co>Ni>Mn, which shows PMo11M retained the character of their metal salts with improved selectivity for desired product. Further, to ensure “no leaching” of metal, the following experiment was carried out. After completion of reaction, re-appeared catalyst was filtrated and aqueous phase/filtrate was collected. In this filtrate, alcohol and H2O2 were added and reaction was carried out at 90°C for 24h (experiment a). Neat reaction (without catalyst) was also carried out (experiment b) i.e. substrate+H2O2. No significant difference in conversion for (a) and (b) was observed. If there is a significant leaching of traces of metal, conversion should be much more higher (as 45.2% for Co(CH3COO)2) i.e. PMo11M are stable under present reaction condition. The above study confirms that the reported PMo11M are more stable and effective than their metal salts. Further, they can be recyclable."
9,Recycling of catalyst,"3.3 Recycling of catalyst All the catalysts are insoluble in aqueous as well as organic solvents. On addition of H2O2, the insoluble catalysts dissolved in the reaction mixture due to formation of peroxo specie. This peroxo specie gives oxygen to substrates and changed back to the insoluble state, which can be easily separated by simple filtration. The decomposition or leaching of metal contain from PMo11M was confirmed by carrying out an analysis of the used catalyst (EDX) as well as the product mixtures (AAS). For all catalysts, the analysis of the used catalyst (upto two cycles) did not show appreciable loss in the metal content as compared to the fresh catalyst. Analysis of the product mixtures shows that if any metal was present it was below the detection limit, which corresponded to less than 1ppm. The separated catalysts were washed with dichloromethane and dried at 100°C. The obtained recycled catalysts were characterized for FT-IR. The processed FT-IR spectra for the fresh as well as the regenerated catalysts (two cycles) are represented in Fig. 6 . No appreciable shift in the FT-IR band position of all regenerated catalysts compare to fresh PMo11M indicates the retention of Keggin-type structure of PMo11M i.e. PMo11M are stable under present reaction condition and can be re-used upto two cycles. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out with the regenerated catalysts, PMo11M, under the optimized conditions and results are shown in Table 6 . The regenerated catalysts show no significant change in conversion as well as selectivity upto two catalytic cycles. For third cycle, remarkable change in conversion as well selectivity is observed. On observing these data carefully, it was found that the obtained data, especially % conversion is quite similar to controlled experiment data of Mo-salt (Table 5, entry 2). While obtained difference in % selectivity may be due to the presence of metal ion (Table 5, entry 3). In other words, observed change in selectivity and conversion for third cycle may be due to the decomposition of Keggin framework into their corresponding metal oxides. So, the present catalysts can be reused upto two cycles only."
10,Conclusion,"The present contribution reports clean and environmentally benign solvent free oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni). An order of activity of catalysts for oxidation of alcohol is PMo11Co≥PMo11Ni>PMo11Mn. For the present catalytic system, the reactivity of the alcohols was found in the order primary<cyclic secondary<aromatic. The superiority of present work lies in obtaining higher selectivity for desire product. The catalysts can be re-used up to 2 cycles without any significant loss in conversion as well selectivity. Encouraging results of oxidation of alcohols show the present catalysts can be used for solvent free selective oxidation of other organic substrates with H2O2."
