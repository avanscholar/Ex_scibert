0,Introduction,"Titanium dioxide and tungsten trioxide possess properties such as electronic band structure, high photoactivity, chemical stability, and low cost that make them good candidates for photocatalytic reactions [1,2]. Titanium dioxide has shown relatively large band gap energies (3.0–3.2eV) and the ability to absorb only ultraviolet (UV) light. In order to develop photocatalysts with improved photocatalytic activity, the reduction of the semiconductor band gap in TiO2 is a possible way to reach this goal. In this sense, WO3 is an important metal-oxide semiconductor that presents relatively low band gap energies (2.6-2.8eV) [3,4]. Likewise, there are studies [5,6] that have been focused on the coupling mechanism between WO3 and TiO2. Nevertheless, most of these studies have reported on WO3/TiO2 photocatalysts in the form of traditional particle shapes such as spheres and thin films [5,6]. In fact, there are few studies focused on the growth of 1D-highly-ordered-WO3–TiO2-titanate nanotubes. Recently, WO3/TiO2 nanotube systems and various methods of synthesis, such as sol–gel, hydrothermal and anodization, which have been employed to incorporate WO3 into TiO2 nanotubes, have attracted considerable attention [7–9]. Hydrogen production by water splitting is highly effective by using nanoparticles of noble metals such as Pt or Au on TiO2 supports [10]. Other noble metals that have been employed in the H2 production due to their low cost are Ag, Cu, and Ni, but they have shown themselves to be less effective [11,12]. Highly dispersed metal nanoparticles can improve the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst, leading to a lower charge carrier recombination rate in the semiconductor during the water splitting reaction, which is an effective way to restrain the recombination of photo-generated-electron-hole pairs [13]. However, the morphology control of WO3 nanostructures in the form of nanorods, nanotubes and nanowires is difficult and WO3 alone cannot produce H2 from water owing to insufficient energy of its conduction band for H2O reduction. An alternative to improve the hydrogen production from water is the loading of co-catalysts. NiOx, RuO2, and Rh−Cr, for example, are effective co-catalysts for increasing the activity of various photocatalysts in water decomposition. In fact, it has been reported [14–16] that PdS, MoS2 and NiS co-catalysts increase the photocatalytic activity. In this work, we report the photocatalytic activity of Rh and WO3 supported on titanate nanotubes (NT) for the hydrogen production via the water splitting process. The effect of 3wt.% of WO3 supported on NT is analyzed. We also surveyed the effect of 0.3 and 0.5wt.% of rhodium supported on 3WO3/NT upon hydrogen production by photoreaction. As reference, we also employed commercial TiO2 (P25) as support. For the stability test, our best photocatalyst (0.5Rh-3WO3/NT) was tested during seven cycles of eight hours each one. The main objective of this work was to establish the effectiveness of our photocatalysts for the hydrogen production by the water splitting process, as well as to investigate the effect rhodium nanoparticles as co-catalyst supported on 3WO3/NT upon hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Rh-WO3/TiO2 by sol-gel method,"2.1 Preparation of Rh-WO3/TiO2 by sol-gel method TiO2-nanocrystals were prepared by the sol-gel method as follows: 36.6ml of titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich 97%) were dissolved in 145ml of 2-propanol (Baker 99.9%). The solution was set under constant stirring. HNO3 was added to adjust the reaction medium at pH 2. Simultaneously, in-situ was added the appropriate amounts of tungstic acid (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain 3wt.% of WO3 and rhodium (III) chloride hydrate (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain materials with 0.3 and 0.5wt.% of Rh. The hydrolysis was accomplished by adding bidistilled water. The solution was then maintained under stirring and reflux until the gel was formed. Afterwards, the gel was dried at 80°C for 12h, and annealed at 300°C for 4h. For comparative purposes, P25 (from Degussa) was used as support. In this case, the photocatalysts were prepared by the incipient impregnation method by using 0.5wt.% of rhodium and 3wt.% of WO3 using the precursors mentioned above, both in aqueous solution. The impregnated P25 was dried at 80°C for 12h and annealed at 300°C for 4h."
3,Preparation of Rh-WO3/NT by hydrothermal method,"2.2 Preparation of Rh-WO3/NT by hydrothermal method Titanate nanotubes (NT) were synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out using a NaOH solution (10N) in a microwave oven at 150°C for 4h at 400rpm. The slurry was washed several times with a HCl solution until reaching pH 3; then, it was washed with distilled water until pH was close to 7, and finally, it was filtered and dried at 80°C for 12h. The annealing process was carried out at 300°C for 4h. It is important to note that the addition of WO3 and Rh to obtain materials with 3wt.% of WO3, 0.3 and 0.5wt.% of Rh was done during the sol-gel method. Tungstic acid (H2WO4) and rhodium (III) chloride hydrate were used as precursors. The catalysts were labeled as 3WO3/NT, 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT. The label NT corresponds to the titanate nanotubes structure, as support."
4,Photocatalytic water splitting,"2.3 Photocatalytic water splitting Photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen was carried out in a quartz photo-reactor. A UV lamp (λ=365nm or λ=450nm) was used during the experiment. The quartz photo-reactor had a full operation volume of 250ml. The scavenger solutions consisted of water-2-propanol (100:100ml, 50 vol.% of H2O). During the photocatalytic tests, samples of 50mg of photocatalyst were used and stirred for 5min while the system was purged with nitrogen to remove the dissolved oxygen from the solution. Analyses were conducted on a gas chromatograph (Trace GC Ultra, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and with a 5-Å molecular sieve packed column. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30cm3 min−1. The system was calibrated previously to quantify the hydrogen production. In order to analyze the hydrogen produced by the scavenger solution, the respective photolysis water-2-propanol was carried out. To corroborate the effect of the 2-propanol in the water splitting test, a photocatalysis experiment was also carried out only with water. For the stability test, seven cycles of 8h each one were carried out for the selected most active photocatalyst (0.5Rh-3WO3/NT) and three cycles for 0.5Rh/NT to corroborate the effect of tungsten upon photocatalytic stability. After running the experiments, the UV lamp was turned off, the produced hydrogen was released and the reaction system was purged with nitrogen until the hydrogen chromatographic signal was zero. Afterwards, the reactor system was sealed, after 8h, the lamp was turned on again to start the next cycle and so on until the third cycle was completed."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples packed in a glass holder were recorded at room temperature with Cu Kα radiation in a Bruker Advance D-8 diffractometer. The data were collected for scattering angles (2θ) ranging from 4 to 80° with a step size of 0.02° for 2s per point. Microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses of the samples were performed in a JEOL 2010F microscope operating at 200kV and equipped with a Schottky-type field emission gun and an ultrahigh resolution pole piece (Cs=0.5mm, point-to-point resolution, 0.190nm). Textural properties were determined in an ASAP-2000 analyzer from Micrometrics. The specific surface area was calculated from the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) equation from N2 physisorption at 77K. A Nicolet, pro-evolution 600, UV–vis spectrometer was used to record directly the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The H2-TPR study of the photocatalysts was performed in a Quantachrome ChemBET TPR/TPD chemisorption analyzer unit under a flow of 10% H2/Ar gas mixture (20mlmin−1) with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 from room temperature up to 600°C. XPS was performed with a Thermo VG Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and an Al Kα radiation source (1486.6eV) powered at 20kV and 30mA, respectively. The binding energy was determined by using carbon C (1s) as reference line (284.6eV). The spectrometer was operated at pass energy of 23.5eV, and the base pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained in the order of 3×10−8 mbar. Peak fitting was done by using XPSPEAK 41 with Shirley background."
6,Results and discussions,
7,XRD and BET,"3.1 XRD and BET Fig. 1 (a) presents the XRD patterns for the titanate nanotubes (NT) and the 3WO3/NT, 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts annealed at 300°C. The main phase observed is tritanic acid (H2Ti3O7) according to JCPDS 36-0654 and the characteristic bands located at 2θ=9.79° (100), 24.37° (110), 28.3° (311), and 48.5° (020). Moreover, the peaks located at 23.62° and 29.16°, corresponding to the (020) and (120) crystal planes of the monoclinic WO3 phase, were not observed. Likewise, the peaks related to rhodium nanoparticles were not observed due to the fact that XRD analysis was not sensitive enough to detect very low rhodium contents. However, the addition of WO3 to the nanotubes increases the intensity of peaks located at 2θ=9.79°, 24.37° and 28.3°. The presence of 0.3 and 0.5wt.% of Rh diminishes the intensity of the peaks located at 2θ=24.37° and 28.3° notably respect to 3WO3/NT. The intensity of the peak located at 2θ=9.79°, that is ascribed to the scrolling of the titanate nanotubes [17,18], remained constant. XRD patterns for the spent 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst annealed at 300°C was carried out to verify the structural stability and the changes suffered during photocatalyst tests. Fig. 1(a) shows that the peak located at 2θ=9.7° (100) was shifted to 12.40°. The corresponding d spacing for the 2θ=9.7° is 9.11nm, for 2θ=12.40° is 7.17nm. This effect could be due to the shift towards larger angles, which in turn was due to a decrease in the interlayer spacing in the titanate nanotube walls. The decreases in the interlayer spacing was accompanied by the removal of H2O in the structure of titanate nanotube [18]. Another effect observed in the spent 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst is the presence of the anatase phase in the XRD pattern due to titanate nanotubes are deteriorated. N2 adsorption-desorption for the NT, 3WO3/NT, 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT annealed at 300°C are shown in Fig. 1(b). These isotherms can be classified as type IV with an H3 hysteresis loop that is characteristic of parallel sheets [19]. The results of BET surface areas of the NT, 3WO3/NT, 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT samples were 290, 292, 270 and 320m2 g−1, respectively. Table 1 shows the specific area and the phase of the materials used in this work. As it can be seen, the surface area is not affected by the addition of rhodium and tungsten to the titanate nanotubes."
8,Morphology by HR-TEM,"3.2 Morphology by HR-TEM In order to confirm the morphology, size and shape of the Rh and WO3 nanoparticles, the NT, 3WO3/NT, and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts annealed at 300°C were analyzed by HR-TEM. Fig. 2 (a) shows the micrograph for the titanate nanotubes (NT) as support. The image presents well-defined nanotubes with an inner diameter of 4nm and external diameter close to 10nm. The thickness of the nanotubular walls is around 2nm with a thickness space of 0.75nm. Fig. 2(b) reveals that the WO3 nanoparticles, with an average diameter of 1nm, are uniformly distributed on both side of the walls of the titanate nanotubes. In fact, there are more WO3 nanoparticles on the inside wall than on the outside wall of the titanate nanotubes for the 3WO3/NT photocatalyst. With regard to the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst, reported on Fig. 2(c), we confirm the presence of rhodium nanoparticles with sizes between 1 and 2nm in the channel of the tubular structure, reaching less dispersion with respect to tungsten nanoparticles. The presence of rhodium and tungsten nanoparticles in the titanate nanotube was confirmed by EDS (not showed). Fig. 2(d) shows the HR-TEM for the spent 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst after reaction. We found that a cluster, with the anatase phase, appears surrounding the nanotube. Besides, the length and width of the nanotubes is affected notably. It is possible to appreciate a mixture of short and long nanotubes due to deteriorate of initial structure of the titanate nanotubes. However, it is important to mention that the tubular structure remained after seven cycles of reaction."
9,UV–vis,"3.3 UV–vis Fig. 3 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra for NT, WO3/NT and Rh-WO3/NT photocatalysts in the 200–700nm region. The NT support showed absorption at around 400nm while the 3WO3/NT photocatalyst showed absorbance in the wavelength region of 420nm with a red shift adsorption. When WO3 and TiO2 form a coupled photocatalyst, the creation of defective energy levels within the band gap (Eg) decreases the band gap energy [20], as in the case of the 3WO3/NT photocatalyst, while the addition of rhodium (0.3 and 0.5wt.%) to the 3WO3/NT photocatalyst displays a remarkable blue shift absorption at 380 and 350nm, respectively, which can be due to the dispersion of rhodium nanoparticles on the 3WO3/NT photocatalysts. On the other hand, when the particle size decreases below its size at minimum band gap, the traps shift to higher energy levels, resulting in blue shifting absorption spectra promoted by the size quantization effect [21]. Table 1 shows the calculated band gap for the photocatalysts used in this work."
10,H2-TPR,"3.4 H2-TPR Fig. 4 shows the H2 TPR for the NT, WO3/NT and Rh-WO3/NT photocatalysts. The NT shows a reduction peak centered at 480°C. The addition of 3wt.% of WO3 to the titanate nanotubes modify the TPR profile of the nanotubes. In fact, Fig. 4 presents three peaks that appear at 330, 520 and 850°C for 3WO3/NT. The peaks that appear at 520 and 850°C are attributed to the reduction of W6+ species [22]. The addition of rhodium nanoparticles (0.3wt.%) to 3WO3/NT also modify its initial TPR profile. We found that appeared two new peaks at 117 and 155°C, which correspond to the reduction of Rh2O3 to metallic Rh0. The further addition (from 0.3 to 0.5wt.%) of Rh shifted the reduction peak from 117 to 155°C. The peak located between 270 and 470°C is ascribed to hydrogen consumed for the reduction of the strongly interacted RhOx species formed at the interface between the metal (Rh) and the titanate nanotubes [23]. The increasing and decreasing reduction temperatures for rhodium and WO3 on the titanate nanotubes, respectively, indicate the strong interaction between Rh and WO3 species. According to the TPR results, the Rh species exist in their metallic state in the Rh-WO3/NT photocatalysts. The Rh-WO3 interaction may be attributed to either the electron transfer or oxygen transfer between the metal and reducible oxide [23]."
11,Characterization by XPS,"3.5 Characterization by XPS In order to observe the effect of rhodium on the 3WO3/NT photocatalysts, characterization by XPS was carried out for the 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts. Fig. 5 (a) displays the W 4f core-level spectra that are characterized by two W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 peaks, which appear due to spin-orbital splitting [24]. The separation between the doublets is around 2.18eV [24]. In addition, the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst showed the W 5p3/2 peak that is close to the W 4f core-level and is set at 5.5eV above W 4f7/2 [24]. On the other hand, the characteristic binding energy of W 4f7/2 for the W5+ and W6+ species are located between 34 and 35 and 35–36eV in the 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts. With regard to 3d core-level spectra, it was difficult to carry out a correct deconvolution due to the low rhodium concentration. However, the presence of rhodium was confirmed on both 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts, as reported in Fig. 5(b). The 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst displays a low binding energy signal of 3d3/2 at 312eV and Rh 3d5/2 at 307eV, which may be related to the presence of Rh3+ species suggesting the formation of Rh2O3 [25]. In Fig. 5(b) it is also observed a little shift to higher energies which led most species Rh2O3 in the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst than 0.3Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst, suggesting that the increase from 0.3 to 0.5wt.% of rhodium on 3WO3/NT photocatalysts allows more Rh oxide than Rh metal species. It is important to mention that due to the low content of Rh, we made a magnification. The results reported on Fig. 5(b) were multiplied by a factor of five to observe the Rh 3d spectrum, for this reason we do not carry out the deconvolution. Finally, the addition of 0.3 and 0.5wt.% led to the splitting and appearance of W5+ species, but W6+ species prevailed mainly."
12,Photocatalytic activity,"3.6 Photocatalytic activity Fig. 6 presents the performance of the H2 production activity at 365nm on the NT, WO3/NT, and Rh-WO3/NT photocatalysts as a function of time for the run test (8h). It is observed that 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst showed a remarkable hydrogen production (234μmolh−1), which is almost 5 times higher than the hydrogen produced by photolysis (56μmolh−1), which is even 4 times more active than the 3WO3/NT (66μmolh−1) photocatalyst and 1.5 times higher than that of 0.5Rh-3WO3/P25 (144μmolh−1). It is important to mention that rhodium (0.3 and 0.5wt.%) and tungsten (3wt.%) loads are very low, however, they displayed notable photo-activity in the H2 production. Table 2 presents the base-line production of hydrogen by the photolysis and photocatalysis processes. The photolysis of water produces 3μmolh−1 of H2. The photolysis of the water-2-propanol solution produces 56μmolh−1. The photocatalysis of water in the presence of 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst produces 13μmolh−1 of hydrogen. However, the addition of 2-propanol increases the hydrogen production up to 234μmolh−1 on 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT. The results about stability are reported in Fig. 7 . The stability test was carried out using the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst, which showed the best H2 production performance (234μmolh−1) during the first test. In the next five cycles (8h each one), 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst showed an enhanced H2 production with respect to the first cycle. 306μmolh−1 of hydrogen was produced during the third cycle. Besides, the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst did not display any deactivation until the seventh cycle, where only 195μmolh−1 were produced, which are equivalent to two days of continuous hydrogen production using the initial water-2-propanol solution. After two days of evaluation, we found that 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst does not show deactivation. It has been reported that [26], in presence of UV-365nm illumination, the valence band electrons from TiO2 nanotubular structure are excited to the conduction band, then they are transferred to the Rh nanoparticles and catalyze H+/H2 reactions for H2 production [26]. Furthermore, the valence band electrons of WO3 are excited to the conduction band and lead facilitate the oxidation of alcohol and then transferred to the valence band of TiO2 nanotubular structure [26]. In our case, we suggest that Rh provide electrons and WO3 provide holes to improve notably the hydrogen production from 66μmolh−1 produced by 3WO3/NT to 234μmolh−1 produced by 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst. Likewise, 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst shows very good stability and the H2-evolution rates even after 56h testing. The H2 production under visible light (at 450nm) was also investigated. Fig. 8 shows the photocatalytic performance for the NT, 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalysts. As for the NT support, the H2 production was not detected. The 3WO3/NT photocatalyst showed a small quantity of 13μmolh−1 of hydrogen, which is in contrast with the addition of rhodium (0.5wt.%) that exhibited the ability to produce H2 under visible light, reaching a H2 production of 87μmolh−1 after eight hours. The results reported in the present work were compared with other photocatalytic systems and it was found that by using 1000mg of MWNT/TiO2/Ni and methanol as scavenger, 0.038μmolh−1 were produced [27], carbon nanodots/WO3 produced 1330μmolh−1 under a xenon lamp irradiation [28], and by using 100mg of CdS/Pt/TiO2 and Na2S+Na2SO3 as scavenger, 4.2μmolh−1 were produced [29]. In the case of the 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT photocatalyst, it is possible that tungsten can be excited under visible light, leading to the generation and charge separation of electron-hole pairs transferred to the NT support in the conduction band and then transferred to rhodium. On the other hand, the relationship between the semiconductor band structure and redox potentials for water splitting of the WO3 conduction band should be lower than that of TiO2. The bottom of the conduction band of WO3 is lower than the H2O/H2 potential; likewise, WO3 cannot be a photocatalyst for H2 production. However, in this study, rhodium was identified as an attractive co-catalyst when added to WO3/NT. In fact, the nanoparticles of Rh exert a remarkable positive effect on the H2 production, since WO3/NT is not active for H2 production due to the low conduction band level under UV-365 and visible light (450nm) irradiations. However, the combination of WO3 and TiO2 increases the UV photocatalytic activity due to the corresponding valence and conduction band energy levels favor not only the electron injection from the conduction band of TiO2 to that of WO3, but also the hole transfer between the valence bands in the opposite direction, which can reduce the electron–hole recombination in both semiconductors [30]. In fact, the addition of tungsten (3wt.%) to the nanotubes gives as a result an outstanding resistance to deactivation for eight cycles. Fig. 9 displays the production of hydrogen on 0.5Rh/NT photocatalyst for three cycles. This photocatalyst did not show deactivation after three cycles of eight hours. WO3 is an element which is not suitable to produce hydrogen by itself. However, one characteristic of WO3 is its remarkable photo-stability in aqueous solutions [31]. Furthermore, the combination Rh-WO3 on titanate nanotubes enhances the hydrogen production and gives more stability during more cycles than 0.5Rh/NT photocatalyst. We can then conclude that WO3 supported on titanate nanotubes acts as stabilizer and prevents the phase transformation (from H2Ti3O7 to anatase phase) of the nanotubes during cycles. Furthermore, the ternary interaction (0.5wt.%)Rh-(3wt.%)WO3 H2Ti3O7 (0.5Rh-3WO3/NT) promotes the hydrogen production from the water splitting process when compared to the corresponding hydrogen production from the 0.5Rh/NT and 3WO3/NT photocatalysts."
13,Energy levels,"3.7 Energy levels The energy levels for the valence and conduction bands can be determined from the UV–vis results and from the XPS spectra, as reported by Ansari and Cho [32]. In this sense, and based in our results of XPS, we found that the valence band (VB) for NT is around 2.5eV. The band gap energy (from the UV–vis spectrum reported in Table 1) for the NT is 3.33eV. In consequence, the conduction band (CB) would occur at −0.8eV. Following the procedure proposed for Ansari and Cho [32], we report the CB and VB structure for the NT, 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT in Fig. 10 . We found that the VB for 3WO3/NT is located at 2.1eV, whereas the valence band maximum energy for 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT was estimated at 1.7eV, followed by a band tail around 0.4eV. The band gap energy for 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT are 2.75 and 3.55eV, respectively. Therefore, the CB minimum for 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT would occur at −0.6 and −1.8eV, respectively. In this sense, the absorption onset in 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT was located at 2.1eV and 1.7eV with a maximum energy associated with the band tail at 0.4eV, respectively. We found that the presence of WO3 and Rh in the titanate nanotubes simultaneously shifts the valence band maxima and conduction band minima, which help reduce the band gap of the titanate nanotubes. The observed narrowing of the band gap for 3WO3/NT and 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT respect to that presented by NT may be due to the displacement and/or substitution of tungsten and Rh in the H2Ti3O7 lattice [32]. To enhance the water splitting reaction, in this work, the titanate nanotubes were doped with WO3 and rhodium. WO3 has a band gap energy of 2.77eV. The position of the conduction band of WO3 is located below of the reduction potential of the pair H2/H+, which is of 0.0V in the electrochemical scale [33], therefore this oxide is inactive to produce H2 because the photo-excited electrons do not have the right potential required to reduce protons from hydrogen. Indeed, the bottom of the conduction band (CB) is too low with respect to the H+/H2 redox potential [33]. However, doping of the H2Ti3O7 with tungsten and rhodium seems to increase the electric conductivity due to is a higher valence ion W6+, therefore enhances the electron transfer from the TiO2 to the Rh, which promotes the H2O dissociation [34]."
14,Conclusions,"The incorporation of nanoparticles of rhodium into the WO3/NT photocatalyst plays an important role in the photocatalytic activity. We found that 0.5Rh-WO3/NT enhanced the H2 production 4 times more respect to the WO3/NT photocatalyst. During the H2 production from water-2-propanol, it was found that rhodium nanoparticles act as co-catalysts of the tungsten. However, WO3 enhances the stability of the H2 production on 0.5Rh-3WO3/NT, which was active for six cycles of 8h, overmatching the first cycle. These results indicated that the addition of Rh nanoparticles to WO3/NT exerts a positive synergetic effect on the photocatalytic activity for the H2 production of Rh-WO3/NT with lamps of 365 and 450nm. The combined effect of Rh and WO3 nanoparticles resulted in a remarkable boosted H2 production with respect to the WO3/NT and NT photocatalysts, leading to an enhanced light absorption and increased charge separation."
