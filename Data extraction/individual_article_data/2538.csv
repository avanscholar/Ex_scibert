0,Introduction,"Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been extensively studied since it was first isolated in 1968 and is a well characterized model organism for photosynthesis. The genome is fully sequenced and annotated and the organism is highly transformable. PCC 6803 has been of particular interest recently because, in addition to possessing a full complement of photosynthetic capabilities, it contains a bidirectional [Ni–Fe] hydrogenase enzyme capable of producing molecular hydrogen (H2) from the reduction of protons under certain metabolic conditions [1–5]. A photobiological means of producing H2 from water offers an attractive option as a sustainable source of this increasingly valuable fuel [6]. However, many issues must be resolved before this process can become a practical, widespread, and economically feasible source of H2. One approach to achieving increased and sustained levels of biosolar H2 production from phototrophic microorganisms may be to encapsulate viable cells in a solid silica matrix. Encapsulation within silica sol–gel is a relatively new technique for encapsulating viable cells, first shown in 1989 with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells by Carturan et al. [7], and has been successfully demonstrated with a variety of biological components including enzymes and proteins [8–11], bacteria [12–14], yeast [7,15,16], plant cells [17,18], mammalian cells [19], and phototrophic cyanobacteria [20]. The matrix creates a solid framework that provides structural, thermal and chemical stability to the encapsulated cultures. Under the right conditions, this can prolong cell life for many months [21], protect cells from contamination, prevent outgrowth, and increase the production of secondary metabolites such as H2. The matrix is also transparent, allowing for the encapsulation of phototrophs, making this approach useful for biosensors that employ fluorescence or, in this case, for photobiological production of H2."
1,H2 production in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,"1.1 H2 production in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 H2 production in this species generally has been reported to occur in two situations: at a low, steady rate in the dark as the cells break down accumulated glycogen anaerobically; and during a transient burst of H2 production activity at the initial onset of photosynthesis with light exposure [2]. The predicted photobiological pathway of H2 production is illustrated in Fig. 1 and can be summarized as follows: Oxygenic photosynthesis is initiated at photosystem II (PSII) where water is split into protons and electrons with the release of molecular oxygen. The protons are used to create a potential gradient across the thylakoid membrane enabling the production of ATP from ADP and phosphate. The electrons enter the electron transport chain where they proceed through a series of transport molecules and proteins, including plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, and plastocyanin, to photosystem I (PSI). The excited electrons are finally used to produce reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH, which are used in the Calvin Cycle for carbon fixation and other metabolic reactions. Excess reducing equivalents can also be used by the hydrogenase enzyme to produce gaseous H2. The hydrogenase enzyme reportedly is sensitive to oxygen, with activity being drastically reduced or completely halted during oxygenic photosynthesis. Under any conditions, reductant availability also can limit H2 production. The reported substrate for the hydrogenase is two molecules of NADPH, which are oxidized to NADP+ to produce one molecule of H2 [2]. NADPH supplies reductant to numerous metabolic pathways, however, which compete with the hydrogenase. These two challenges have been considered to be the primary obstacles to improved H2 production in this species. Researchers have taken various approaches to overcome these two challenges. Two general approaches include genetic manipulation, such as altering the hydrogenase enzyme to confer some degree of added oxygen tolerance or other enhanced activity [22], or metabolic approaches [23], which manipulate the environment of the cells in order to enhance H2 production through improved reductant availability. For example, Antal and Lindblad showed that sulfur deprivation can be used to promote more than a four-fold increase in H2 production from Synechocystis in a methane atmosphere [24]. Burrows has shown that optimizing nutrient concentrations can yield nearly a 150-fold increase in H2 production compared to sulfur deprived cells, after conditioning the cells in media optimized for H2 production [25]. Encapsulation may also be regarded as a metabolic manipulation since it will alter cell metabolism and potentially increase reductant availability for H2 production."
2,Silica sol–gel for encapsulating whole cells,"1.2 Silica sol–gel for encapsulating whole cells Sol–gel processing is an empirically well characterized materials science technique used for fabricating metal oxide thin films, optoelectrical devices, monoliths for separations, and other specialty applications. The process is generic and can be used with numerous transition metals and semi-metal elements to make amorphous or crystalline metal oxides after heat treatment. The fundamentals of sol–gel processing are described in the seminal text of Brinker and Scherer [26]. A common two step sol–gel process employs metal alkoxide precursors, such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), Si(OC2H5)4, which is hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid catalyst and alcohol solvent. Subsequent condensation and hydrolysis reactions then reach an equilibrium, forming a sol, or colloidal suspension, of metal oxide clusters. With subsequent basic catalysis, condensation reactions accelerate and the clusters aggregate into a randomly cross-linked, polymeric gel. With aging, the gel becomes increasingly dense and cross-linked as solvent is expelled from the pore volume. Finally, a heat treatment can be used to remove the solvent and fully condense the gel into a microstructure suited for the application. The literature on sol–gel processing in the context of fabricating optoelectrical devices is expansive. Recently, this process was borrowed from materials science to demonstrate encapsulation of biological components, first with viable yeast cells [7]. Silica sol–gel was selected for its biocompatibility, and S. cerevisiae for its tolerance to ethanol, which is evolved from the hydrolysis of TEOS to silicic acid, Si(OH)4. Immobilization of biological components was not new, but using a purely inorganic solid matrix was a novel approach. Unlike most other commonly used organic encapsulation matrices, which can swell and are vulnerable to biological degradation, silica sol–gel creates an inert matrix that restricts cell growth. As a result, cells may enter an altered steady-state metabolism that yields increased production of secondary metabolites. The rigidity also prevents cell outgrowth, maintains the mechanical integrity of the matrix, and prevents contamination by other organisms. This allows for applications in biosensors and bioreactors where fluid streams with analytes of interest or fresh substrate can pass over porous matrices containing immobilized biological components. Several recent reviews are available [10,27–30]. Despite the variety of biological components that have been successfully encapsulated in silica sol–gel, the use of this technique for biosolar H2 production by viable phototrophs has not been investigated previously. The matrix is transparent and therefore suitable for phototrophs and photoactive proteins, as was demonstrated with photoactive proteins in 1992 by Ellerby et al. [8]. More recently, sol–gel encapsulation has been used for the development of a biosensor based on immobilized algal cells [31,32] and an alternate method using colloidal precursors has also been used to encapsulate multiple strains of Synechococcus [20]. Our evaluations indicate that approximately 12% of incident light is absorbed by the gels described in this report. We found this effect to be consistent across all gel compositions and to remain stable (after 24h) for the duration of the study (data not shown), illustrating that most of the incident radiation can be available for photosynthesis. Therefore, this approach may be well suited for immobilizing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and potentially for improving H2 production. Cyanobacteria use most of the energy collected during photosynthesis for the production of biomass. It has been suggested that cells may direct no more than 15% of their available energy toward H2 production [33]. However, if growth is restricted, that percentage could potentially increase. In a different format, Laurinavichene et al. demonstrated that cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii immobilized on glass fibers produced approximately 2.5 times more H2 than cultures under otherwise identical conditions in liquid suspension [34]."
3,Materials and methods,
4,Cell culturing,"2.1 Cell culturing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild-type (WT) cells and a mutant strain deficient in the NDH-1 complex (M55) [2] were grown photoautotrophically, with constant illumination of approximately 50μE/m2 s, on BG-11 media supplemented with 35mM HEPES buffer and 80mM sodium bicarbonate in 250mL of media in 500mL flasks maintained at 30°C on orbital shaker tables. For encapsulation studies, cells were harvested during log-growth phase and conditioned in optimized media [25] at 30°C for 40h under the same illumination."
5,Encapsulation,"2.2 Encapsulation For initial screening experiments, sol–gel precursors, including TEOS, tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), and methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) were mixed in molar hydration ratios varying from 20:1 to 40:1 (water to precursor) and adjusted with a strong acid, either hydrochloric or nitric acid, to a pH of approximately 1.0 (TEOS, TMOS, and MTES; Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA). Precursor solutions were allowed to mix in Erlenmeyer flasks up to 24h exposed to ambient air in a fume hood to allow evaporation of evolved methanol or ethanol. When initially mixed, the solution was clear but phase-separated. The solution became homogeneous typically within an hour, but phase separation occurred if stirring stopped too soon. A minimum of approximately 4h was required under these conditions for hydrolysis to proceed until a homogeneous sol was produced. Encapsulation was performed by resuspending conditioned cells in fresh optimized media containing 35mM phosphate buffer at a pH of 8.0. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells can tolerate elevated pH levels, so the strong base, NaOH or KOH, was added to the media prior to resuspension in a molar equivalent to the strong acid present in the volume of sol to be used for encapsulation, typically approximately 50μL of 1.0M base solution per mL of cell suspension, depending on the composition of the sol. This resulted in a pH of approximately 9–10. The cell suspension was then directly mixed with the sol solution in a volume ratio of 1 part sol to 3 parts cell suspension, which induced gelation within 5min. Final cell concentration in the gels was 1.0×1010 cells/mL. Final pH was estimated to be approximately 8."
6,Initial formulation screening,"2.3 Initial formulation screening For initial screening studies, various compositions were compared in a high-throughput screening assay [35] to determine more favorable encapsulation protocols for H2 production. A total volume of 500μL of sol and cell suspension was mixed in each 1mL well of 96-well microtiter plates, 125μL sol with 375μL of cell suspension. The plates were degassed in a nitrogen atmosphere for approximately 3h, sealed, and placed in an incubator at 30°C under cycled light/dark exposure, 2min on/18min off, at approximately 70μE/m2 s. Each 96-well plate had a 96-well membrane-bottom plate sealed above it, with each well containing a catalyst (sulfonated Wilkinson's catalyst; Acros, Morris Plains, NJ) and water soluble tetrazoleum color indicator (WST-3; Dojindo, Gaithersburg, MD) that changed color when exposed to H2. See Schrader et al. for a detailed explanation of the screening assay [35]. The color indicator in each well was scanned at 450nm in a spectrophotometric microplate reader (Biorad, Hercules, CA) to assess net H2 production over the course of the assay."
7,Evaluations of H2 production,"2.4 Evaluations of H2 production Subsequent encapsulation studies with formulations showing the most H2 production were carried out similarly in 2mL GC vials. Vials were prepared in a sterile laminar hood, allowed to fully gel, and then transferred to a nitrogen atmosphere to degas for approximately 3h. Vials were capped, placed in an incubator at 30°C, and cycled under light/dark exposure, 2min on/18min off, at approximately 70μE/m2 s. Headspace H2 and CO2 concentrations were measured after 16, 40 and 80h with an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After 80h, the vials were opened within a nitrogen atmosphere, allowed to degas, re-sealed and placed back in the incubator. Formulation screening experiments included all combinations of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide, as well as a range of molar ratios of alkoxide precursor to water, mixtures of precursors, and a range of glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 concentrations as additives. Later studies to evaluate H2 production used only nitric acid and potassium hydroxide, TEOS and a blend of 90% TEOS and 10% MTES, by weight, and 10wt.% PEG. Formulations and results from screening assay and subsequent H2 production evaluations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 ."
8,Environmental scanning electron microscopy,"2.5 Environmental scanning electron microscopy Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was performed at the Center for Advanced Materials Characterization (CAMCOR) (FEI Quanta 200 ESEM/UPSEM Microscope. FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed on a cold stage for imaging. This approach avoids extensive fixing and mounting typically required for biological samples prepared for SEM because the system can image at pressures above the partial pressure of water at reduced temperatures."
9,Results,
10,Encapsulation and initial screening,"3.1 Encapsulation and initial screening Currently, optimal encapsulation formulations cannot be designed from the first principles because a complete theoretical description of silica sol–gel processing and encapsulation does not exist. Hence, an optimal formulation for each new type of encapsulated cell must be explored empirically through iterative experiments. Similarities exist across a broad range of cell types and the literature provides a reasonable starting point, but optimizing the process for any given cell type depends on the characteristics of that particular cell and the gel within which it is encapsulated. In this study, common precursors, TEOS, TMOS, and MTES, were selected and both WT and M55 strains were compared to determine if they differ in their responses to encapsulation. Many variables in the initial gel formulation and its processing can affect the final properties of the gel. In this investigation, we examined precursor type, molar ratio of water to precursor, type of acid and base used for catalysis, and a blend of precursors with and without additives. In initial formulation screening studies comparing TEOS- and TMOS-derived gels, cells in TMOS, which evolves methanol during hydrolysis, showed less activity, producing less H2 than cells in TEOS, which evolves ethanol (Fig. 2 ). The growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was not significantly inhibited by low concentrations of ethanol (up to 100mM, data not shown), indicating that the cells can tolerate some residual ethanol present in TEOS-derived gels. These results suggest methanol is more cytotoxic to Synechocystis than ethanol, which presumably caused reduced activity in cells immobilized in TMOS-derived gels. In fact, cells encapsulated in TMOS gels displayed activity only slightly above cell-free controls (data not shown). However, although the alkoxide type is the only variable, the type of alcohol present after hydrolysis is not the only difference between the gels. The type of alkoxide can influence both the hydrolysis and condensation reactions, which will alter the final structure of the gel. Other cell types have shown some tolerance to low levels of methanol [36], which suggests other factors may be hindering the H2 production from Synechocystis cells encapsulated in TMOS and merits further investigation. MTES was also explored as a precursor to determine if some degree of hydrophobicity contributed by unhydrolyzed methyl groups present in the final matrix would promote a more favorable interaction with the encapsulated cells. Pure MTES cannot be used because the gels are too viscous and opaque. However, MTES is fully miscible in TEOS, which allows for a controlled introduction of hydrophobic methyl groups with negligible loss in light transmittance. Blends consisting of 5%, 10% and 15% MTES in TEOS were compared, with and without PEG, to determine the most favorable composition for H2 production. In the absence of PEG, the blend composition did not have a statistically significant effect on H2 production in either cell type (Table 2). In the presence of 10% PEG, the 10% blend was slightly beneficial to both cell types and was selected for subsequent H2 production evaluation studies. The ratio of water to precursor is also an important parameter because it influences the initial hydrolysis reactions, subsequent condensation reactions, and the final structure of the gel. More water favors more complete hydrolysis and also stabilizes the sol in the presence of minimal solvent [37]. A molar ratio of 4:1, water to precursor, is the minimum theoretically required for complete hydrolysis of silicon alkoxides, but excess water promotes more complete hydrolysis and also prevents gelation in the absence of excess alcohol solvent. Ratios varying from 20:1 to 40:1, water to precursor, were prepared and examined in varying proportions with cell suspension, which induced gelation upon mixing due to the basic catalyst present in the suspension. The more dilute sols could not accommodate a significant proportion of cell suspension and did not gel adequately at desired cell concentrations (data not shown). A ratio of 20:1 diluted by 3 parts cell suspension (375μL) per 1 part (125μL) sol was more favorable for H2 production than other formulations (Table 1) and was selected for subsequent GC studies. Because residual salts in the gel may influence activity of encapsulated cells, the type of strong acid used to hydrolyze the alkoxide precursor and promote the formation of a stable sol and the strong base required to induce gelation were also considered. Hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide were evaluated as the strong acids and neutralizing bases, respectively. These particular acids and bases have been used extensively for sol–gel processing and are commonly used to adjust pH in biological systems. A factorial experimental design was used to examine combinations of acid and base and it was determined that nitric acid neutralized by potassium hydroxide produced the most favorable environment for H2 production (Tables 1 and 2, and Fig. 3 ), perhaps because potassium nitrate provides both nitrogen and potassium to the encapsulated cells. The other salts, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, and sodium nitrate, may be less useful or less available to the cells and the lingering concentration of each, particularly excess sodium, may contribute to increased osmotic stress on the encapsulated cells. Pairing hydrochloric acid with potassium hydroxide and nitric acid with sodium hydroxide produced nearly identical results as hydrochloric acid paired with sodium hydroxide, suggesting the effects of osmotic stresses are similarly small but not insignificant (Table 2). Salts may also influence the gelation process and the resulting gel structure, so the effects of salts in this application merit further investigation. To assess the structure of the gels and the arrangement of the cells within them, TEOS gels with 10wt.% glycerol in the initial sol and containing 5×109 cells/mL were imaged by ESEM (Fig. 4 ). Of particular concern was verifying that the gels were adequately porous and that the cells were intact and dispersed, not aggregated into flocs. The formation of such aggregates would cause shading effects and limitations in diffusion of nutrients to cells within flocs, which could tend to reduce activity. Both WT and M55 cells were seen to be individually encapsulated and the gel structures were quite porous. However, ESEM images showed different gel structures, suggesting the two strains may have interacted differently with the gel matrix. Shown in Fig. 4a, the matrix around WT cells appeared to form larger pockets, whereas the matrix around M55 cells, shown in Fig. 4b, appeared to more closely adhere to the surfaces of the cells."
11,Cell activity and H2 production studies,"3.2 Cell activity and H2 production studies Four representative gel compositions, in addition to controls in liquid media, were selected for quantitative analysis of H2 production: gels of pure TEOS; TEOS with 10wt.% PEG 400; a composite blend of TEOS containing 10wt.% MTES; and the same blend with 10wt.% PEG. All gels were prepared in a hydrolysis ratio of 20:1 with nitric acid and potassium hydroxide as catalysts. Gels were prepared in 500μL volumes within 2mL GC vials, allowed to gel within a sterile laminar hood, and then degassed before being sealed and placed in the light cycling incubator as described. H2 content in the headspace was analyzed by GC at intervals of 16, 40 and 80h. The light cycle regime of 2min on/18min off was selected based on preliminary data (not shown) which allowed both detectable H2 production, minimal production of oxygen, and enough time in the dark to consume that oxygen. The light regime was held constant for this study to avoid complex effects on efficiency through alterations to cell metabolism and the distribution between photofermentative (dark) and direct photobiological (light) H2 production. After 40h of light cycling in the first round of the assay, M55 cells in pure TEOS produced a headspace concentration of approximately 0.29mM H2. This amount of H2 produced over that time interval at that light intensity gives an efficiency of H2 production from incident photons of approximately 1%, in line with the highest values previously reported for photobiological hydrogen production [38]. This efficiency estimate only considers the measured H2 retained in the GC vial; no allowance for H2 uptake by the reversible hydrogenase enzyme was included. Also, it is possible that some H2 may have been lost from the vials by diffusion through the septum cap. At 80h, the vials were removed from the incubator, opened in a nitrogen atmosphere to completely degas again, and then placed back in the incubator and sampled again at 16, 40, and 80h. This was done to evaluate if, after approximately 5 days, the encapsulated cells would remain active within the gel and continue to produce H2. Fig. 5 illustrates results from this assay, including 40 and 80h from the first cycle and 40h from the second cycle. Under the conditions of this assay, by 80h on the second cycle, one week after initial encapsulation, all cells of both types, in media and gel, had senesced and H2 production was no longer detectable (data not shown). The cause for the loss in activity is not known, but since this was observed for all samples, including cells in gel as well as cells in media, it may be due to nutrient depletion in the small volume of media included in each GC vial or some other factor associated with this format and the small geometry, such as limitations in gas exchange. H2 production, over the time intervals examined, was consistently comparable between suspended and encapsulated cells (Fig. 5). Encapsulated cells and suspended cells had similar capacities to produce H2 under the conditions of this study, but vials with suspended cells contained substantially more CO2 in the headspace than vials with encapsulated cells (Fig. 6 ). The optimized media contained bicarbonate, which contributed CO2 to the headspace after the vials were sealed. However, the vials with gel contained 25% less bicarbonate (375μL of media plus 125μL of sol as compared to 500μL of media), yet typically had less than half as much CO2 in the headspace, suggesting possible differences in metabolic activity between encapsulated cells and those suspended in nutrient media. The silica sol–gel matrix offers a biocompatible environment that provides mechanical and chemical stability, and the rigidity of the matrix physically restricts growth. The ESEM images (Fig. 4) show cells that appear to be in the process of dividing, but we cannot know whether cell division was initiated before or after encapsulation. The ability of sol–gel to restrict growth has been cited as both a liability and an asset, depending on the type of cell and the application. Long-term viability of encapsulated cells is a significant challenge [39], but the growth of cells within the gel, even at a reduced rate, could help overcome that challenge. Studies are ongoing to examine how encapsulation affects growth and long-term viability of the cells."
12,Additives,"3.3 Additives Glycerol and PEG 400 were used as additives in this study because of their previously demonstrated utility. Glycerol has been used, in concentrations as high as 20% [40], by numerous investigators for its ability to increase the biocompatibility of silica sol–gel matrices by reducing osmotic stress and improving the interaction between the pore surfaces of the gel and the immobilized cells [27,31,41,42]. PEG may also provide some osmotic protection to encapsulated cells but is generally used more for its ability to stabilize sols in the absence of an alcohol solvent [37,43]. Both additives can act to increase pore size by reducing capillary forces that develop during gelation, thereby reducing pore collapse as the matrix forms and ages. High surface tension produces high capillary forces, but both additives serve as surfactants to differing degrees which can reduce surface tension and yield larger pores [44]. Figs. 2 and 7 illustrate screening assay results comparing glycerol, PEG, and a mixture of PEG and glycerol against additive-free controls. Contrary to expectations, glycerol tended to have negligible effect on WT cells and actually hindered H2 production in M55 cells. The effects of PEG were modest, but gels with 10% PEG generally performed better than other formulations in this format. In other assays, PEG concentrations varying from 6% to 14% were compared and showed minimal differences (Table 2). Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a relatively robust cell, so beneficial effects of additives may result more from structural changes in the gel rather than from osmotic protection and reduction of stress. The effects of additives on gel structure, beyond these observations for improved H2 production, merit further evaluation."
13,Discussion,"The activity of encapsulated cells was confirmed through the production of H2 gas detected by the high-throughput screening assay and GC analyses. Activity varied significantly depending on the composition of the gel matrix. Cells encapsulated in TEOS-derived gels performed comparably to cells in liquid media and better than cells encapsulated in TMOS, presumably due to the presence of methanol generated by the hydrolysis of TMOS. However, the hydrolysis of both compounds produces silicic acid, Si(OH)4, which should behave similarly upon gelation if the alcohol solvent is removed prior to encapsulation. If the solvent is not removed, its presence can influence the kinetics between condensation and hydrolysis during gelation and aging, producing gels of different structures. Since PCC 6803 can tolerate low levels of ethanol, TEOS is the preferred precursor for this application. Complete removal of alcohol prior to encapsulation is possible, but the stability of the sol may be reduced. The use of MTES represents initial efforts to explore the use of organically modified silanes (ORMOSIL's) for encapsulating PCC 6803. The presence of a covalently tethered functional group, in this case a methyl group, can alter the structure of the matrix by occupying one of four bonds on a given silicon atom, thereby preventing hydrolysis at that site and reducing subsequent cross linking. The presence of the group can also alter hydrolysis and condensation reactions on the other three bond sites through electrostatic interactions and steric hindrance. In addition to effecting the gel structure directly, these groups can also have electrostatic effects that can alter the interaction between the matrix and both the pore fluid and the encapsulated cells. Predicting the exact effect of a given ORMOSIL on the gel structure is not possible from the first principles. Therefore, exploring their use for a given application must be iterative. MTES was selected because it is the simplest ORMOSIL, it is fully miscible in TEOS, it also produces ethanol upon hydrolysis, and it allows for the controlled introduction of hydrophobic methyl groups into a matrix that is generally hydrophilic. Phenotypic differences between WT and M55 suggested they would respond to encapsulation differently. When the cells are harvested, WT cells tend to adhere to each other after centrifugation and are relatively difficult to resuspend, perhaps due to extracellular polysaccharides. In contrast, M55 cells resuspend much more easily, indicating different surface features in the two types of cells. The tendency of WT cells to aggregate suggests that they have more hydrophobic surface moieties relative to the M55, the surface chemistry of which is likely more hydrophilic. The gel matrix itself is hydrophilic, containing residual hydroxyl groups on pore surfaces. In initial investigations, the ESEM images suggest that the gel matrix may form tighter pockets around M55 cells, whereas WT cells may have a stronger repulsive interaction with the gel matrix, causing larger pore features around each individual cell. These observations, which are being more fully explored in ongoing studies, lend credence to the suggestion that gels should be formulated to achieve beneficial interactions with each specific type of cell. Fig. 4 illustrates how the same formulation appeared to act differently with the two strains of the same microbial species. M55 cells responded well to the TEOS/MTES blend compared to pure TEOS gels, whereas WT cells seem to show negligible difference between these two types of gels. The effect appears to be further enhanced by the presence of PEG, as shown in Figs. 2 and 7. This evidence that a more hydrophobic matrix has a favorable interaction with relatively hydrophilic M55 cells suggests that a larger pocket in the matrix surrounding the cell is more advantageous for H2 production. However, the GC time series data in Fig. 5 do not consistently support this hypothesis. These data were collected at different time intervals, but the screening assay data were produced after the same consistent time interval of 5½ days. Cellular activity and hydrogen production will vary over these time intervals and the apparatus for each method also detects H2 differently. In the screening assay, H2 leaves the headspace and reacts with a catalyst and dye in a separate plate, providing a qualitative indication of H2 production. With GC analyses, H2 is accumulated in the headspace of the vial, allowing for both uptake and diffusion of H2 through the vial septum cap. These differences make comparisons between the two methods difficult. Also, ESEM imaging has not yet been performed on a full series of gel compositions, with and without PEG for a comparison of gel structure and with both cell types. Further investigation is merited to better describe the effects of matrix composition with encapsulating pocket size and resulting cellular activity. Differences in H2 production and CO2 concentrations between suspended and encapsulated cells suggest differences in cellular metabolism between the two environments. As Fig. 5 shows, H2 production is generally comparable across all environments (within error bars). However, as shown in Fig. 6, CO2 concentrations are significantly lower for all encapsulated cultures, consistently approximately half or less than the concentrations observed with cultures in media. The gel samples contained 25% less media and therefore 25% less carbonate, yet there is roughly a 50% drop in CO2 concentration, more than would be expected from differences in equilibrium (data not shown). Because the light cycling regime included 18min of dark followed by 2min of light exposure, this observation could suggest that the suspended cells may have had a higher respiration rate than encapsulated cells. Taken together, comparable hydrogen production with reduced respiration would support our hypothesis that a larger percentage of net metabolism in encapsulated cells is directed toward hydrogen production. However, very little is known about the genomic, proteomic, or overall metabolic response of these cells to encapsulation and additional work is required to elucidate these changes."
14,Conclusion,"Successful encapsulation of viable cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in silica sol–gel was demonstrated, and H2 production quantities from WT and M55 cells were comparable to those from cultures in optimized media for at least 5 days. The encapsulation process was evaluated iteratively by initially comparing multiple formulations through a high-throughput screening assay for H2 production. A smaller range of formulations was then defined for analysis of activity through H2 production as measured by GC. This research provides a proof of concept demonstrating the ability to achieve measurable H2 production from sol–gel encapsulated cells, but the process is currently far from optimized. For example, the possibility of composite matrices containing other organically modified silicates (ORMOSIL's) besides MTES or some proportion of organic polymers, such as alginate or gelatin, among others, has not yet been explored. Longevity of encapsulated cultures has also not yet been fully studied. Additional studies are underway to analyze H2 production more precisely to determine the effects of encapsulation on H2 production rates over shorter time scales. Ongoing research is also seeking to characterize in more detail the interactions between the gel matrix and the encapsulated cells and the specific responses of those cells to encapsulation. An improved understanding of these interactions will foster more favorable encapsulation and improved a priori design of these biocomposite materials, enhancing performance and longevity from encapsulated cultures."
