0,Introduction,"Transportation and power generation sectors in current days are majorly dependent on the compression ignition engines, due to their excellent fuel economy and low exhaust emissions (CO, UHC). But these compression ignition (CI) engines possess higher risks to the environment, being able to produce higher emission (NOx) and particulates [1]. On the contrary, the extinguishing petroleum reserves and strict norms observed worldwide has a put a remarkable question on the practicality of diesel engines in the upcoming times. As a result, finding an alternative fuel source with increased efficiency and lesser emission factors is the main purpose of research. The current challenges mainly at low load [2–4] in diesel dual fuel (DDF) engine were rising exhaust emissions and degradation of BTE. Due to the substitution relationship, it is tough to lower the levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions in a diesel engine. To reduce these emissions a few advanced combustion modes have been developed [5,6]. NOx and PM emission can be reduced by dual fuel combustion mode due to its advantages of favourable mixture distribution, less utilization of diesel fuel, etc, which is considered as the most promising approaches for diesel engines [7,8]. Spark ignition engines are currently acceptable by CNG, but it is not feasible to attain ignition of CNG by only compression in existing CI engines because of high self-ignition temperature (540 °C) [3], low cetane and high-octane numbers [9]. Hence, to ensure ignition inside the combustion chamber, the ignition has to be created by some other source. In dual fuel mode, CI engine attempts to burn high octane fuels like CNG, then they came across this issue. In dual fuel mode, the combustion of a small amount of high cetane pilot fuel is ignited by the primary high-octane fuel. Throughout the years, few researchers have explored the CNG combustion in a CI engine with pilot Diesel. It was found by the Hallquist et al. [10], that diesel-fuelled buses emitted more particulates compared to the buses running on CNG. Betrand, Serrano [12] and karabektas et al. [11] found hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are higher in dual fuel, irrespective of the loads together with lower NOx emissions; high loads are exceptional. It was found by Liu et al. [13] PM and NOx emissions were reduced by the diesel fuel mode, however, pilot fuel quantity increased with PM emissions. Yang et al. [14] studied over the parameters of combustion performance of diesel pilot, injection of CNG, and low load emissions on the dual fuel engine. The common rail type engine with a turbocharger was used in a diesel dual fuel (DDF) engine. To prevail optimal parameters the pressure and timing of CNG and pilot injection were varied. It was detailed that combustion process (thermal efficiency, Heat Release Rate and cylinder pressure) could be improved and emission of HC and CO gases are reduced by new timing of diesel pilot injection, enhanced pressure of diesel pilot injection, and delayed timing of CNG injection. Combustion performance and exhaust gas on DDF engine at low load affect both the parameters of diesel fuel and CNG injection. Also, to reduce the volumetric efficiency [24] the amount of pure air entering in the cylinder is reduced by the existence of CNG fuel; the standard engine using single fuel [16,17] holds more amount of oxygen [18] as compared to CNG using cylinders [19,20] and the reaction between the air and diesel is also interfered. According to Yoshimoto et al. [21], the effect of cetane number is very crucial in the study of dual-fuel operation (pilot fuel) and reported that the BTE and IMEP were impacted negatively in case of fuels having cetane number more than 45. Selim [23] and Tomita et al. [22], have studied individually and concluded that to increase thermal efficiency and to reduce NOx emission under CNG-diesel combination of fuel, moderate exhaust gas circulation should be used. Ethanol was used as the additive in the pilot fuel by Paul at al [24]. But combustion and emissions improvement were limited by the poor miscibility of ethanol in diesel. n-butanol can be mixed with diesel in any proportion due to its high cetane value as compared to ethanol making it highly suitable as a pilot fuel additive. Rubber seed methyl ester (RSME) with hydrogen was used in dual fuel mode by Geo et al. [25] for observation and reported that smoke emission and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) are significantly improved. Honge biodiesel was used by Banapurmath and Tewari [26] in pilot operation to observe a hike in CO and HC emission and a decrease in NOx emission and BTE. CNG and hydrogen dual-fuel operation using rapeseed methyl ester as pilot fuel was experimented by Korakiantis et al. [27] and studies suggested that with the usage of hydrogen the NOx increases, and with the usage of CNG, HC emission increases. Yoon and Lee [1] studied on dual-fuel combustion of biogas and biodiesel’s exhaust emission and combustion characteristics. They concluded that with the mentioned fuel combinations, along with the reduction of soot emission and with the superior performance the NOx emissions are reduced. Ghadikolaei et al. [39] studied the formation of particulate matter and chemical properties of ternary fuel blend of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel and reported that this type of blend has a better impact on DPFE (diesel particulate filter efficiency) and the obtained value of metal elements was 0.7% and ions 1.9% and diesel particulate matter was 85.8%. Aydin and Yesilyurt [40] studied the performance characteristics while using the DEE (diethyl ether) and cottonseed oil blend in the diesel engine at various load conditions and was observed that thermal efficiency was decreased by 17.39% and brake specific fuel consumption shown an increase of 29.15%. Dogan et al. [41] studied about the diesel engine characteristics which incorporates alcohol as an oxygenated fuel by considering various parameters like sustainability, enviro-economic, exergoeconomic, exergy and energy were analysed and reported that 20% 10% and 5% 1- heptanol was added (on the basis of volume) to the pure diesel and test results show that SFC is more for 20% 1- heptanol blend of 0.221 kg.kWh. Rajasekar et al. [42] investigated the influence of low viscous fuels blended with jatropha methyl ester (JOME) and reported that, minimal emission characteristics are obtained. Thiruvenkatachari et al. [43] investigated the influence of azolla methyl esters on the performance and emission characteristics on diesel engines and reported that the BTE was maximum for B25 blend (25.9%) with optimal emission characteristics. SOME, popularly known as Kusum oil (Schleicher Aleksa oil methyl ester) is biodiesel, that is produced by the transesterification process of the schleichera oleosa seed. It serves as an alternative to diesel which is bio-based and non-conventional. It is more suitable as a pilot fuel for CNG dual-fuel operation as it has a higher cetane number compared to another biodiesel. SOME chemical composition has higher oxygen levels and enables better oxidation of the fuel. It is also influential in reducing emissions and ignition delays due to its higher cetane number [28and44]. Acetylation of glycerol’s three hydroxyl groups produces triglyceride Triacetin [C9H14O6]. It is being used for the topical treatment of minor dermatophyte infections due to its fungistatic properties (based on the release of acetic acid). it has a role of antifungal drug, a food additive carrier, a food humectant, a food emulsifier, a plant metabolite, a fuel additive and a solvent as acetic acid is derived from it. Belgiorno et al. [45] and Di Blasio et al. [46] studied the impact of engine parameters on dual fuel engine at low and medium operating conditions and reported that compression ratio, air-fuel ratio in dual fuel engine significantly reduced the unburnt hydrocarbon emissions in comparison with conventional diesel engine. Di Blasio et al. [47] and Di Blasio et al. [48] investigated the influence of variable compression ratio with different piston bowl geometries on the performance characteristics of the dual fuel mode engine and reported that less combustion noise and particle size spectrum are observed at lesser compression ratio value. In order to improve the performance and emission in the diesel/CNG dual fuel combustion mode, SOME and triacetin was blended with diesel as pilot fuel to ignite the CNG mixture in this work. Based on the extensive literature it can be concluded that majority of the work in diesel CNG dual fuel operation is carried out with lesser concentration of CNG and limited work is carried out on the effect of high CNG injection into the CRDI engine. To bridge this gap an effort is made for a comparative study between diesel and SOME as pilot fuel for CNG dual fuel operation. The main objective of this present study aims to add in this field by introducing high cetane fuel SOME, diesel additive triacetin as a pilot fuel for CNG dual fuel operation to study the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of CRDI diesel engine."
1,Research setup and methodology,
2,Pilot fuels and their properties,"2.1 Pilot fuels and their properties SOME, Triacetin and high-speed diesel are the main liquid fuels used for this research [28]. The schleichera oleosa oil methyl ester (SOME) is a biodegradable, renewable and non-toxic source of fuel, and it is a combination of saturated fatty acids and mono-alkyl ester of various chain length. Kusum oil is a native tree that is primarily found in South Asia. It is commonly referred through its scientific name as Schleichera Oleosa. Moreover, based on extensive study, it has identified that the seed of the tree is rich in oil, and the properties lie par with diesel fuel. The oil of the Schleichera oleosa seeds are dominantly extracted from its seeds using mechanical crushers. The oil has a full application in terms of medical application, hairdressing, and even as pain reliever oil in massage centres. The oil has dominantly consisted of linoleic acid (50%), and the remaining are shared with oleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The fatty acid composition of the oil is listed in Fig. 1 , and the raw oil properties incomparable with the high-performance biofuels are listed in Table 1 . Based on the table, it can be inferred that the Schleichera oleosa properties are in par with the high-performance biofuels in India. Moreover, the oil content and the calorific value are closer to more preferred biofuel (Jatropha curcas) (see Table 2 )."
3,Schleichera oleosa oil methyl ester synthesis,"2.2 Schleichera oleosa oil methyl ester synthesis Biodiesel is defined as mono-alkyl ester of long-chain fatty acid derived from vegetable oil (edible and non-edible) or animal fats. Biodiesel is generally produced by transesterification of triglycerides: triglycerides react with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid or base, creating a mixture of fatty acids alkyl esters and glycerol. The overall process is a sequence of three consecutive and reversible reactions, in which di and monoglycerides are formed as intermediates. The stoichiometric reaction requires 1 mol of a triglyceride and 3 mol of the alcohol. However, an excess of the alcohol is used to increase the yields of the alkyl esters and to allow its phase separation from the glycerol formed. The overall process for the conversion of Schleichera oleosa oil into Schleichera oleosa oil Methyl ester is graphically represented in Fig. 2 . Reactions could be summarized as follows [15]. For experimental purposes, in the combustion process, Triacetin can be used as it is more oxygenated additive fuel. For reducing emissions, fuel with higher oxygen content and lower quantity of fuel additives are important."
4,Research experimental setup and procedure,"2.3 Research experimental setup and procedure The experimental test rig is shown in Fig. 3 . Experimental investigations are carried out at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at a variable load on a CRDI engine assisted CNG dual fuel diesel engine testing apparatus to evaluate the effect of fuel injection parameters on engine, combustion and performance characteristics. Table 3 provides the engine specification details. The Eddy current dynamometer is used to maintain the variable load and constant speed. Additionally, the common rail direct injection system is mounted to control the fuel injection timings and injection pressure. Table- 3 provides the engine specification details. The fuel pump is operated distinctly, to make the injection pressure range of injection wider and more independent of engine speed. In the process of production, the control of pressure is done by an inlet-valve which only allows the required amount of fuel to be pressurized. The pressure adjustments happen by activating spill valves with the help of a signal of extreme frequency. For these adjustments, a controller (16-bit) and an adequate spill flow are required, but since none of them were accessible, the pressure was regulated using a supplementary high-pressure valve. Additionally, a pressure sensor (injection) was mounted on the rail which facilitates the monitoring and controlling of pressure in fuel. In order to offer high pressure data, in between the injector and the rail a pressure transducer (fast-response) was also arranged. Bosch provided the common-rail system which was used on the testbed. A volume of 18 cm3 with highest pressure up to 100 MPa can be endured by this linear rail having four injector ports. A pressure sensor is fixed on single side of tube. The data recorded by the pressure sensor are sent to the engine ECU for calculation of injection-flow, timing and closed-loop control of the injection pressure. In the fuel injection system, a Delphi three-hole solenoid injector was incorporated (operating pressures). It has the ability to inject fuel amounts ranging from 0.5 to 100mg/injection under pressures varying from 20 to 100 MPa. This fuel injection equipment (FIE) was a typical PFI system, which included an electric fuel pump, a fuel tank, a fuel accumulator, a fuel injector and a fuel injector control circuit. In the secondary fuel injection system, test fuel was injected at low FIP of 3 bar only (see Table 4 ). A gas analyser (Model DiGas 444 5, AVL India Pvt, Ltd.) conforming to ARAI certification-ARAI/TA (4G-RV)/AVL/DiGas 444/0910–12) was used to measure the emissions of CO, CO2, and O2, in terms of volume percentage, while hydrocarbon emissions were measured in ppm (vol.) of n-hexane equivalent and NOx emissions were measured in ppm (vol.). CO, CO2, and hydrocarbon emissions were measured based on the principle of nondispersive-infrared (NDIR) detection, while NOx and O2 were measured by means of pre-calibrated electrochemical sensors. The opacity of the exhaust smoke was measured by means of a Model AVL 437 opacimeter (AVL India Pvt, Ltd.). The opacimeter had a measuring chamber of defined measuring length and nonreflecting surface, which was filled homogeneously with exhaust gas. The loss of light intensity between a light source and a receiver was measured and, from it, the opacity of the exhaust gas was calculated. The calculation was based on the Beer−Lambert law. The analyzers were interfaced through their respective RS 232C serial communication bus to an emission data acquisition platform that recorded the emission data for 120 s in intervals of 20 s. The engine initially ran for 30 min with pure diesel to warm up and keep the engine in a steady state. The in-cylinder pressure was measured with the help of piezo electric transducer mounted on engine cylinder head whereas HRR (heat release rate) generated during power stroke was calculated. According to the first law of thermodynamics, (1) d U d t = Q . − W . (2) m C v d T d t = Q . − P d V d t where, Q is the combination of the heat release rate and heat transfer rate across the cylinder wall, W is the rate of work done by the system due to system boundary displacement. To simplify Eq. (2), the ideal gas assumption can be used (3) P V = m R T Assuming constant mass, Eq. (3) is differentiated as: (4) d T d t = 1 m R [ P d V d t + V d P d t ] After combining these two equations, the heat release equation becomes (5) Q . = [ C v R + 1 ] P d V d t + C v R V d P d t After replacing time (t) with the crank angle (θ), Eq. (5) becomes (6) Q t = k k − 1 P ∂ V ∂ θ + 1 1 − k V ∂ P ∂ θ where, k is the ratio of specific heats and taken as 1.35 for diesel heat release analysis, θ is the crank angle, P is the cylinder gas pressure, and V is the cylinder volume. BSFC was calculated in order to evaluate the engine performance depending on the fuel types used in the study. For this purpose, Eqs. (2) and (3) were used to achieve the BSFC data [43]. (7) B P = 2 π ω T 1000 (8) B S F C = m f × 10 6 B P Eq. (4) was also used to determine BTE values (%) in the present paper. BTE represents the brake thermal efficiency and LHV (MJ/kg) represents the lower heating value of the used fuel. (9) B T E = 3600 B S F C × L H V × 100"
5,CNG injection circuit development,"2.4 CNG injection circuit development Fig. 3 illustrates the schematic of CNG injection circuit development. Safety is very essential when it comes to dealing with gaseous flammable fuels. So, CNG induction circuits need special attention to incorporating safety measures. Thus, the intake manifold is specially modified and safe gas flow controller/measurement devices are used. Any flashback is prevented by the secondary cylinder routed from the main cylinder also works as a buffer tank. A pressure reduction valve is used to reduce the pressure inside the secondary cylinder from 196 to 150 bar. For the measurement of gas pressure, a pressure gauge is attached with the flow line of CNG after the secondary cylinder. Then to reduce and control the gas pressure, a pressure reducer/regulator is connected with a solenoid gas injector for reaching a required pressure of 1.2 bar. Subsequently, to measure the flow of CNG into the engine’s intake manifold, a gas flow meter is attached to the same CNG flow line. A control panel is used which controls the solenoid and is synchronized to engine rotation. To achieve precise CNG induction for the required duration at a desired crank angle, this is done through a crank angle encoder."
6,CNG injection strategy development,2.5 CNG injection strategy development This study focuses on the development of a strategy to design an efficient system to inject the CNG stream in a controlled manner to the intake manifold. The CNG should be induced to the cylinder slowly increasing its quantity so as to study its relation with engine emission and performance. This process is usually conducted through CNG injection for an estimated duration without the use of a flow controller. This duration of injection is computed on the basis of engine crank angle rotation. The piston’s four strokes correspond to two revolutions of the crankshaft which completes the operation cycle of an engine (4-stroke) one cycle comprises 720-degree rotation of the crankshaft which means every stroke comprises 180-degree rotation of the crankshaft. Table 5 . Provides the technical details of CNG injector rail.
7,Experimental test procedure,"2.6 Experimental test procedure Initially, the engine was fuelled with pure diesel at standard injection timing of 12 0bTDC and an injection pressure of 1000 bar by varying the load with 20% increase in load and corresponding brake power. The speed of the engine was kept constant during the entire experiment. The equivalent ratio of the engine is changed from 0.56 to 0.91 according to the engine load condition. Then the experiment was conducted on with other blends like CNG with Triacetin, CNG with SOME, CNG with diesel combinations with the same experimental condition. Further, CNG induction is done at every load increment step after collecting all baseline data with the help of various strategies listed. After all the engine tests, to avoid contamination, the complete fuelling system is cleaned thoroughly. When the second stage is reached, for all loads, using the SOME with Triacetin the complete process is repeated over again including the pilot fuel and five CNG strategies. The output data is recorded only if the engine has become stable and running constantly at not more than 10 RPM along with the uniform flow of CNG to intake manifold. Also, water flow to the calorimeter and engine is monitored carefully so that the flow rate is constant. For an average of 80 cycles, data is recorded so as not to entertain any cyclic variations during the collection of data. To increase the accuracy of the readings, six readings for every set of data is noted. The engine exhaust is equipped with emission analysers to record emission data after the engine has attained stability."
8,Uncertainty analysis,"2.7 Uncertainty analysis Precise calibration with optimal atmospheric conditions is equally important while using precision measurement devices for reliability. Uncertainty analysis gives a broad view of experimental repeatability by counting necessary errors during measurement. In given atmospheric conditions, the process of quantifying performance and emission parameter measurement errors due to the methodology of the experiment, observation accuracy, calibration and instrumentation employed is called the experimental uncertainty analysis. Two major components are identified with uncertainty analysis one of which is repeated measurement random variation and second is accuracy bias. The equation (10) shows the total uncertainty as below. (10) O v e r a l l u n c e r t a i n t y o f t h e e x p e r i m e n t = ( B P ) 2 + ( F C ) 2 + ( B S F C ) 2 + ( B T E ) 2 + ( H C ) 2 + ( C O ) 2 + ( N O ) 2 + ( L o a d ) 2 + ( P r e s s u r e t r a n s d u c e r ) 2 ( 1.11 ) 2 + ( 0.66 ) 2 + ( 1.29 ) 2 + ( 1.29 ) 2 + ( 0.2 ) 2 + ( 0.2 ) 2 + ( 0.46 ) 2 + ( 0.1 ) 2 + ( 1.2 ) 2 = ± 2.595 % The evaluation of uncertainty values of each equipment was conducted, which established the experimental uncertainty (current) to be ±2%. This value is obviously within the acceptable uncertainty range i.e., less than ±5%."
9,Result and discussion,
10,Engine combustion characteristics,"3.1 Engine combustion characteristics In this section, heat release rate, in-cylinder pressure and ignition delay are discussed for all the fuels. These are the important parameters that help to understand the behaviour of the fuel blends in the combustion chamber. Average temperature of the gas in the cylinder and the heat release rate is calculated using the “Enginesoft/LabView” software that uses the 0D model of a single combustion zone with constant specific heat ratio. 3.1.1 Heat release rate Fig. 4 illustrates the variation of heat release rate with respect to crank angle for all the test fuels at different load condition. At full load condition, when compared to other fuels, heat release rate of diesel + CNG is observed to be as 85 J/deg CA whereas in case of SOME + CNG (80 J/deg CA) and Triacetin + CNG (98 J/deg CA) this is due to the fact that the accumulation of diesel fuel at the primary combustion phase which is in the premixed stage. In combustion analysis, the quantity of heat emitted during the combustion cycle plays an important role. The heat release rate is considered the release of thermal energy during combustion (inside the cylinder) in the engine. The amount of heat released during the transition period from chemical state to thermal state can be used to define HRR, regardless of whether the combustion is premixed, rapid or controlled. In addition, ignition delay, engine knocking, flameout period can also be identified by HRR. Because of high net calorific value and excellent fuel atomization, CNG-Triacetin blend possesses a high heat release rate of 60 J/deg CA (20% load), 68 J/deg CA (40% load), 74 J/deg CA (60% load) and 77 J/deg CA (80% load) in comparison with diesel + CNG and SOME + CNG at all load conditions. The cumulative heat release rate phenomenon represents a substantial variance in ID (ignition delay period) due to excess fuel deposition in premixed combustion. It also reflects a higher heat release rate and the lowest cumulative heat release rate. Thus, here we can conclude that combustion can be improved with the use of Triacetin + CNG as compared to other fuels. 3.1.2 Cylinder pressure Fig. 5 illustrates the variation of heat release rate w. r.t to crank angle for all the test fuels at different load condition. The fuel-air combination generation is fairly constant which results in increased pressure when the cetane number is improved and viscosity of fuel remains low. The air-fuel mixture becomes uniform and pressure gets increased due to lesser viscosity and better cetane number. At full load condition, when compared to other fuels, in-cylinder pressure of diesel + CNG is observed to be as 53.42 bar pressure is the least point, whereas the highest point of cylinder pressure prevails for whereas in case of SOME + CNG (58.23 bar) and Triacetin + CNG (62 bar). Various factors affect the in-cylinder pressure like heat movement to the combustion chamber wall, combustion, leakages and services, instantaneous cylinder volume etc. The CNG and triacetin blend holds the highest cylinder pressure out of all blends under different load situations [2]. Due to better combustion, there is high energy (kinetic) in molecules inside the combustion chamber and this also results in higher pressure inside the cylinder. Consequently, it can be said that the combustion will be a lot smoother than diesel if the oxygen levels and fuel levels are high. Cylinder Pressure of Triacetin + CNG is found better, which is 62 bar measured amongst various concentrations and it is 4.39% greater from diesel + CNG. 3.1.3 Ignition delay The delay period, commonly known as the ignition delay period is the time period from the start of fuel injection to the initiation of combustion. It also indicates the chemical as well as the physical delay of the fuel. The ignition delay suggests fuel mixing and atomization at the final stage, while the full pre-combustion process is shown at the initial stage. Depending on engine load for various fuel blends the change in ignition delay is depicted in Fig. 6 . The highest ignition delay is observed in the D100 at all loads. The reason behind this was mainly due to the viscosity, density and better fuel mix rate. The next blend having lower delay period was SOME + CNG due to its low compressibility factor, high cetane number and biodiesel composition. Also, the addition of triacetin in the CNG reduced the delay period as compared to D100. The reason behind low delay period is attributed to better fuel atomization through high surface tension and calorific range of the blend."
11,Engine performance characteristics,"3.2 Engine performance characteristics In this section, the effect of diesel + CNG, SOME + CNG and triacetin + CNG on brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption is discussed. The two parameters explain the energy conversion efficiency of the engine. 3.2.1 Brake thermal efficiency BTE (Brake thermal efficiency) infers the quality of combustion inside the engine. For different fuel strategies (Diesel + CNG, SOME + CNG and Triacetin + CNG), it was evident that brake thermal efficiency has increased with an increase in the load as illustrated in the Fig. 7 . The brake thermal efficiency of triacetin additives blended CNG (26.4%) was greater when compared with other blends and also conventional diesel. Brake thermal efficiency of diesel + CNG is minimum (at all loads) with lower levels of viscosity and higher density. The changes of Triacetin CNG blend, SOME CNG blend, diesel CNG blend at the verified loads is shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that the efficiency (BTE) of the engine can be reduced by both CNG and Diesel (dual fuel strategy) used together effectively as compared to the other fuel strategies. Insufficiency of oxygen levels results in combustion bringing partial and conversion of this energy to fuel energy stays incomplete. Engine efficiency is also observed to rise when a combination of triacetin, pilot SOME and low quantity of CNG is used for complete load range. Better combustion results in high efficiency in this case due to SOME and triacetin possessing high oxygen content. When triacetin additives were mixed with CNG blend an increase of 1.58%, 1.62% and 2.34% was observed in brake thermal efficiency. This can be assigned to the finer combustion characteristics of triacetin additives, due to the reason that there might have occurred a refinement in the catalytic activity. Simultaneously, as the evaporation rate is increased and physical delays are reduced which leads to improved BTE along with an increase in combustion efficiency. 3.2.2 Brake specific fuel consumption For the production of equal amounts of power as diesel, ‘BSFC diesel equivalent’ is a term which acts as a comparative parameter to compare a sample fuel power yield using the same engine. Because of this, a variety of fuels and fuel blends can be compared in a common platform with respect to their rate of consumption [2,29–32]. Combinations of CNG with diesel, SOME and triacetin are compared with BSFC diesel equivalent and shown in Fig. 8 . It was observed that addition of CNG in triacetin, SOME and diesel resulted in low fuel consumption. So, it can be said that when CNG has to be used as the primary fuel, a comparatively lesser quantity of pilot fuel is needed to be mixed with it to yield the same thermal energy. So, it’s obvious that CNG provides most of the energy for an engine to function. Additionally, when all the dual-fuel combinations (CNG with triacetin, SOME and diesel) when tested, it was observed that SFC is drastically lesser in triacetin-CNG blends. The BSFC becomes 0.34, 0.33 and 0.31 kg/kW-h for diesel + CNG, SOME + CNG, Triacetin + CNG respectively at maximum load. The stability and smoothness of an internal combustion engine can be evaluated based on the non-repeatability of individual cycles of operation, which is typically represented by the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective pressure. COVIMEP as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. COVIMEP decreased marginally as the ASP increased after the primary alcohol fuels were added. This is because the higher the ASP, the higher the oxygen content. This reflects a significant improvement in engine operation stability that results from a substantial amount of oxygen in the alcohol fuel. Alcohol substitution percentage (ASP) = A S P = m − d m d m m d × 100 Fuels Speed IMEP (MPa) Fuel consumption Additive consumption ASP Diesel 1500 0.75 1.55 0 0 Diesel + CNG 1500 0.75 1.39 0.31 10 SOME + CNG 1500 0.75 1.39 0.30 10 Triacetin + CNG 1500 0.75 1.39 0.25 10 Where md is the mass flow rate of diesel (kg/h); mdm is the mass flow rate of the dual fuel mixture (kg/h). C O V = / ∑ i = 1 n a i n × 100 % where n is the number of cycles, a is the parameter of which variability is study and is defined by indicated mean effective pressure IMEP, maximum pressure pmax and the angle where maximum pressure occurs. The COV of maximum pressure is suitable at cycle-by-cycle variability evaluation for regimes with injection timing closer to the value of timing for MBT (Maximum Brake Torque). The COV of maximum pressure angle, αpmax, reflects the combustion variability during the first phase of combustion. The (COV)IMEP shows how the engine responds to the combustion variability. The accepted limit value of (COV)IMEP defines the limit of in-cylinder mixture leaning and reflects the variability of flame development during the first phase of combustion. By simplifying for pure diesel COVIMEP = 1.9%; diesel + CNG COVIMEP = 1.4%; SOME + CNG COVIMEP = 1.5% and Triacetin + CNG COVIMEP = 1.6%."
12,Engine exhaust emission characteristics,"3.3 Engine exhaust emission characteristics In this section, the effect of diesel + CNG, SOME + CNG and triacetin + CNG on CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity are discussed. The exhaust emissions are the reflection of combustion characteristics of the fuel in the engine. The appropriate combustion exhibits higher NOx, lower HC, CO and smoke emissions. 3.3.1 Carbon monoxide emissions The locality of CO formation is in the flammability region where the air + fuel mixture ratio is more than charge flammability limit. Because of that reason, oxygen is deficient in that area which leads to partial fuel burning. Thus, combustion quality is the direct indication of CO emission quantity. This is shown in Fig. 9 when CO emission is varied with respect to various loads for a diesel engine. It was observed for the blends of CNG with Triacetin, SOME and diesel that CO emission reduced with load increase for every blend in dual-fuel operation. This result due to an increase in pressure inside the cylinder caused by load increase. Consequently, the temperature inside the cylinder hikes to further oxidise carbon molecules of the fuel to CO to yield carbon dioxide. This results in a further reduction in carbon monoxide. Furthermore, CNG + SOME + Diesel operations produced higher CO in comparison to Triacetin + CNG fuel blend. The reason for this outcome is attributed to the presence of more oxygen in triacetin which helps in improving the combustion process [31,33]. But if CNG quantity is raised, the CO emission rises despite any variation in pilot fuel. The observations of CO emission by SOME + CNG and triacetin + CNG, were 7.89%, 11.23% lower than diesel + CNG. 3.3.2 Nitrogen oxide emission NOx emission occurs mainly due to very high temperature inside the combustion chamber and high oxygen content of fuels used. As it is revealed from Fig. 10 that engine operation using SOME produced highest NOx volume from the exhaust. For all the engine loads, NOx emission is observed to be highest in SOME + CNG as compared to other fuels which emitted 6.84%,10.36%,11.31%,9.49%, and 3.54% of nitrogen oxides. This is due to the fact that SOME have a sufficient amount of inherent oxygen which aids smooth combustion. Consequently, the combustion chamber heats up more than necessary to cause excessive NOx production [33,34]. Furthermore, ignition delay of SOME is less due to its high cetane number which causes combustion to start early and in turn release heat at a faster rate. This heat eventually raises the cylinder temperature more, causing a rise in NOx [35]. On the other hand, CNG is seen to reduce NOx emission, especially when combined with triacetin (pilot operation). The decrease in-cylinder temperature after injection of cool CNG may be the reason for NOx emission drop [36]. If only diesel is considered, NOx emission is lesser because its low cetane number allows a longer ignition delay than SOME, which slows down the initial high-speed combustion and allows the fuels to release heat uniformly. Thus, causing a reduction in NOx emissions. 3.3.3 Smoke opacity The PM content (soot particle) in the smoke is its ‘opacity’. The more the particles are present in a unit volume of smoke, the more is the opacity. For various combinations of fuel blends, the opacities of exhaust emissions are given in Fig. 11 . Of all the blends, CNG + triacetin blend produces lowest smoke opacity. Further, smoke emissions were seen to be nominally reduced by 5.37%, 6.92% and 7.37% at full load by diesel + CNG, SOME + CNG, and triacetin + CNG, respectively. For pilot SOME and diesel operations, CNG is seen to reduce the opacity of smoke. The reason behind this reduction could be due to small structures of hydrocarbons in CNG which makes the hydrogen to carbon ratio high leading to low smoke formation [36]. The regions where air-fuel mixture is concentrated is the target area for smoke production. The Pulverized jet fuel spray core is the most vulnerable. But in case of port injected CNG, a homogeneous air-fuel combination helps in smooth combustion. Soot formation is discouraged here due to less fuel-rich zones which cause less opacity in smoke. Another reason for low smoke opacity is better carbon pyrolysis due to high oxygen content in SOME and Triacetin [37]. 3.3.4 Hydrocarbon emissions (UHC) Incomplete or partial burning of fuel causes HC emission. Fig. 12 illustrates the BSHC emission from various fuels. The figure also shows that the load increase is inversely proportional with the hydrocarbon emission of various blends used. For all the engine loads, HC emission is observed to be highest in diesel + CNG as compared to other fuels which emitted 5.84%, 7.36%, 6.31%, 7.49%, and 3.54% of unburnt hydrocarbons. For Diesel pilot operations this rise of hydrocarbon is more; however, CNG when mixed with triacetin and SOME gives better performance in terms of emission of hydrocarbon as compared to CNG with diesel dual-fuel operation [34,35]. By adding triacetin additives in CNG, emission of hydrocarbon is reduced to a considerable extent by 7.56%, 6.78%, 5.08%, 7.78%, and 2.56% less than diesel + CNG. Additionally, it is also observed that load increase impacts the UHC emission. This reduction is attributed to the fact that effective pressure (mean) increases with load rise and hence elevates the exhaust temperature thereby reducing the HC emission [34and45]."
13,Trade-off study (soot-NOx-BSFC),"3.4 Trade-off study (soot-NOx-BSFC) The detrimental effects of soot and NOx are well known to everyone. They cause a plethora of respiratory illness and degrade the environment by causing global warming through smog formation [5,38]. Furthermore, a fuel which is consumed in lesser quantity by the engine is one of the factors to choose a fuel; another reason being the depleting fuel reserves. Thus, to get a clearer picture, a trade-off study is required for comparing emission and performance of engines using various fuels with respect to BSFC, smoke opacity and NOx emission. It also gives scope for further explanation of intrinsic issues regarding the above. Fig. 13 shows the 20% load trade-off for three combinations of fuel (CNG + Triacetin, CNG + SOME, CNG + Diesel). It can be noticed clearly that the trade-off shifts to the extreme left corner (minimum fuel consumption) from extreme right corner (maximum fuel consumption). From the graph, the SOME is seen to push the trade-off to a high-NOx emission zone with a reduction of smoke and BSFC. CNG + Triacetin dual fuel operation reduces the equivalent BSFC along with NOx emission. Of the other blends, CNG + diesel blend produces lesser NOx and more PM content in Smoke (opacity). When the load is increased to 40%, the CNG + diesel (pilot fuel) blends the smoke opacity and equivalent-BSFC reduction is seen which is indicated through the shifting of trade-off zone near to origin (Fig. 14 ). But when also SOME is used in the engine, reduced smoke opacity with high equivalent BSFC and NOx emission is observed indicated through the shifting of trade-off zone away from the origin to a zone having such specifications. At the same load condition of 40%, the trade-off zone is shifted to the left corner by the implementation of CNG + triacetin while reducing the equivalent BSFC and NOx. So, the benefit of smoke opacity being similar to equivalent BSFC is evident as compared to the D100 operation. When 60% load is considered, the trade-off analysis shows interesting findings (Fig. 15 ). The equivalent-BSFC is reduced while the trade-off zone is pushed towards the middle area by using the diesel and CNG fuel combination. It also shows a minor decrease in smoke opacity and NOx emission as compared to diesel + SOME fuel combination. The trade-off zone is shifted towards the middle area with a reduction in equivalent-BSFC and NOx emission when CNG + diesel (pilot)combination of fuel is considered at 80% load condition (Fig. 16 ). It can also be seen that the top area of the trade-off plot is for equivalent-BSFC and high-NOx which is dominated by plain SOME fuel operation. But the presence of high CNG quantity in combination with triacetin in a blend tends to bring down the zone (trade-off) to low equivalent-BSFC and NOx areas. The final graph (Fig. 17 ) is for 100% load in a diesel engine operation. It is clear that equivalent BSFC surely gets reduced for CNG + Diesel fuel operation. But when CNG amount is raised in the blend, proportionately PM content in the smoke also shows a hike. SOME operation produces a high NOx and equivalent-BSFC while CNG and triacetin fuel blend shows lower NOx and equivalent-BSFC."
14,Conclusions,"For dual fuel operation of blends of CNG with triacetin, SOME and plain diesel is studied and compared comprehensively in a systematic manner. The intake manifold of the engine, a CNG injection system was placed so as to conduct the experiment smoothly. Furthermore, pilot fuel operation was verified against CNG as main fuel by checking the diesel’s effect on emission and performance characteristics. Although in this study, SOME, diesel and triacetin are compared individually, the summary of important findings is given below. • CNG with Diesel blends are observed to reduce engine BTE which further gets reduced if CNG quantity is increased in the blend. • Due to a positive impact on fuel blended with triacetin additives, BSFC was found to significantly decreased when compared with other fuel strategies. • At full load, smoke, NOx, CO and HC emissions were found to be lower in triacetin + CNG by 6.92%, 9.39%, 11.24% and 5.69% while BTE increased to 7.8% and SFC decreased to 4.93% when compared with other fuels. • BTE was found to increase and SFC was found to decrease when tested with less CNG quantity with triacetin as pilot fuel while smoke emitted was clear and HC, NOx and CO emission reduced consistently. • In this analysis, the trade-off study shows the effectiveness of triacetin + CNG in optimizing the emission parameters (NOx) to a certain standard level and decreasing the BSFC as well."
