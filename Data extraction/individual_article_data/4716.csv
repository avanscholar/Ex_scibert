0,Introduction,"In vapor detection applications, thin-film based resistive sensors, have several advantages over optical and chemical sensors, such as low power consumption, high sensitivity, good stability, and excellent response or recovery time [1,2]. Furthermore, optimization of the sensor signal can be achieved by tuning the heating processes at the detection surface. Resulting in gas sensors typically operating at temperatures of several tens to several hundreds of degrees [3–5]. Operating high sensitivity vapor sensors are therefore operated with at great expense in power consumption and long-term use [6–8]. To develop humidity detection systems, a cost efficient method has been to exploit self-heating effect on the thin-film based resistive devices itself, for accurate and reliable measurements of relative humidity (RH) in diverse domains, such as human-monitoring systems, plantation protection, chemical processing, meteorological measurement, semiconductor industries, and indoor air conditioning [9–14]. To fabricate polymer nanofibers of small dimensions ranging from several tens of nanometers to several micrometers, electrospinning for the synthesis of nanofibers is not only versatile but straightforward [15,16]. Electrospinning has favorable characteristics, such as more abundant and more controllable surface-area-to-volume ratio, diameter size and easier fiber structure functionalization, compared with other low-cost nanofiber fabrication techniques, such as melt blowing [17], drawing [18], template synthesis [19], and self-assembly [20]. Thus, electrospinning, with its capacity for interactivity, has been used to develop and fabricate new nanofibers with improved conductivity [21] and has attracted considerable attention for its use in various applications, including biomedical combination [22], catalytic [23] and photochemical [24,25] sensors. Recently, graphene (G)-based materials, such as carbon nanotubes [26], G oxide [27], and G sheets [11], have been adopted as composite materials or nanofibers for thin-film structure sensors. Based on their intrinsic properties, their electrical behavior and mechanical strength, as well as the thermal stability of the device should be considered. The loading of G in the polymer matrix can also exert a significant effect on the thermal conductivity of the composites [28–30]. In order to prepare thermal conductive composite materials, G is regarded as an efficient filler for enhancing the thermal conductivity of the polymer matrix. With the addition of small quantities of G fillers into the polymer, a lower percolation threshold for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) can be achieved, making PVA-G nanofibers potentially more favorable for use as a heating device [31]. All these unique properties, together with the demonstrated electrospinning process here, make nanofiber composites an ideal candidate to address the challenge of sensing the electrical activities of gas in the on-chip device. In this study, the self-heating (also known as joule heating) characteristics of PVA-G composite nanofiber device, was applied to enhance the activity of the water molecules (H2O) on the device surface. The electrical performance (electrical response) of nanofibers for can then be used to detect relative humidity to a high degree of sensitivity. As the electrical performance depends on the uniform dispersion of G throughout the composite nanofibers, structural composition, along with heating ability, electrical resistance, and electrical response (sensibility) of composite thin-film devices with PVA-G nanofibers will be discussed."
1,Experimental,"In this study, the graphene substructure with a PVA thin film was formed through electrospinning. The PVA powders (Mw = 84,000–89,000, 99 % hydrolyzed; First Chemical Manufacture Co. Ltd., Taiwan) and pristine G sheets (Average sheet thickness =3.5 nm, carbon content = 99.99 %, concentration =1 mg/L; Graphene Laboratories Inc., USA) were mixed to create a black suspension of PVA-G. The composite reagent mixture was fed at a consistent rate through a needle and a syringe pump (NE-1000, New Era Pump Systems Inc., USA). The 10 % PVA solution was diluted using deionized water (9 g) and PVA powder (1 g). Herein PVA, a water-based emulsion, is most often used as an adhesive for porous materials. Then, G sheets were subsequently added to the PVA solution at weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g, resulting in the corresponding suspension concentrations of 0.5 %, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6%. Furthermore, the composite suspension of both PVA and G (10 mL for each concentration) was then prepared by ultrasonication for 1 h at 25 °C to obtain adequately heterogeneous dispersions. Notably, the ultrasonication step may lead to exfoliation of the residual graphite to G sheets [32]. A schematic diagram of the process of fabricating and measuring the 40 mm × 40 mm PVA-G thin-film device for humidity detection is shown in Fig. 1 . First, conductive adhesive Cu foils (thickness =500 μm) were attached onto the surface of a clean glass substrate as electrodes [33]. And then the thin-film structures for the humidity sensing layer were formed using electrospun PVA-G composite nanofibers. In this case, the commercially available hygrometer (DTM-301H, Tecpel Co., Ltd., Taiwan) certified to be accurate within 10 % was used to determine the actual RH. The electrical characterization of the gas-sensing system for the humidity sensor was performed in a self-assembly humidity testing chamber (dimensions = 60 mm × 60 mm × 16 mm). The outlet and inlet throttle valves for controlling the flow of dry nitrogen and humid air gases were provided in the testing chamber. To avoid the effect of RH due to temperature, PTFE (Teflon) heated hoses (JH3F, JCT Analysentechnik GmbH, Austria) were used to facilitate transport of H2O. When increasing the humidity level, the testing chamber was exposed to an environment with increasingly humid air, with the commercially available hygrometer recording accurate RH. When reducing the humidity, dry nitrogen gas was released into the testing chamber while humid air ejected from the chamber outlet until RH reached a specified testing value. A power supply and electrical measurement system were used to impart heating properties to the PVA-G nanofibers and to measure four-point resistance of each Cu foil patch, respectively. The self-heating PVA-G nanofibers fabricated here were applied a voltage of 25 kV with a syringe flow rate of 10 μL/min for 30 s. Representative production rates of PVA-G composite nanofibers were collected at a 15 cm working distance from the needle tip to the glass collector. Finally, the electrospun composite nanofibers were visualized under microscopy for structural characterization. In addition, the characteristics analysis of this study include Raman spectrum (Ramboss 500i Micro-Raman/PL Spectroscopy, DongWoo Optron Co., Ltd., South Korea), energy dispersive (EDX, JSM-7610 F, JEOL Ltd., Japan), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, STA7300, Hitachi Ltd., Japan), focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM, Helios NanoLab 1200AT, FEI Co., Netherlands), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM, LEXT OLS4000, Olympus, Japan), type K thermocouple (midi LOGGER GL240, GraphTec, Inc., USA) and electrical measurement system (Keithley 2400 SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Raman and TEM analysis of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers,"3.1 Raman and TEM analysis of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers Fig. 2 shows the presence of G sheets of self-heating PVA-G composites nanofibers by Raman and TEM analysis. In this work, the results of the Raman spectrum analysis of composite nanofibers performed to determine the characteristics of composite nanofibers with G sheets. The Raman spectra indicated that the characteristic peaks are PVA, G, and PVA-G nanofibers (Fig. 2a). For PVA, the peak band with peaks at 1143, 1443, and 2911 cm−1 can be attributed to crystallinity, shear mode, and C–H valence bond vibration, respectively [34]. G displays a one-dimensional band at 1340 cm−1, a two-dimensional band at 2685 cm−1, and a broad G-band at 1577 cm−1. After electrospinning, the composite nanofibers exhibited a solid band of characteristic G peaks, and small bands at 2911 and 1143 cm−1, demonstrating that the G and PVA withstood a high-voltage electric field and that the G sheets were distributed within the PVA nanofibers. Furthermore, the use of ultrasonication could trigger the formation of a polymer of the PVA and the composite solution as well as a change in shearing stress, which could break the polymer CC bonds and lead to the formation of long-chain structures. A review of the findings of previous studies on PVA-G composites, the dispersion of PVA would be more uniform and would not affect the characteristics of the G-based structures [35,36]. The TEM image of the PVA-G composite nanofibers (6%) in Fig. 2b. The G sheets were clearly observed in the PVA nanofibers, where the G sheets can be in the individual nanofibers of the PVA. Herein the G sheets can be exfoliated in the PVA nanofibers, indicating the PVA nanofibers and exfoliated G sheets. Interestingly, it seemed that the G sheets could be dispersed in the PVA nanofibers."
4,EDX and TGA analysis of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers,"3.2 EDX and TGA analysis of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers To further investigate the G sheets distributed within the PVA nanofibers, the energy dispersive spectra and EDX mapping studies have been performed. Fig. 3 (a–c) shows the EDX spectrum of G sheets demonstrated the distribution of Au, C, O, and Si elements confirming the immobilization. The presence of Si atoms (glass substrate) can be observed without any mixing of G sheets. As the mixed concentration of G sheets increases, the peak of Si atoms becomes smaller (5.3 wt% to not marked), and more C atoms are obtained (20.6 wt% to 44.6 wt%). Further, Fig. 3(d–l) shows the EDX mapping pattern of G sheets before and after mixed in PVA nanofibers, it can infer that the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers consist of C and O atoms, which are evenly distributed while C atoms are scattered over the entire nanocomposites. The EDX spectra and mapping indicates that the C element is uniformly distributed on the composite nanofibers. The results of a similar distributed analysis with the graphene-based nanofibers have been reported [37–39]. Fig. 4 shows the results of TGA of the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers. Thermal analysis was carried out on TGA and the sample weight losses were recorded as a function of temperature and time. The decomposition behavior of the electrospun PVA nanofiber was implemented with two steps. First, when the temperature of the chamber rose from room temperature to 140 °C, it appeared that the small amount of PVA mass reduction (8%), which is attributed to the loose binding of adsorbed water and eliminated gas molecules. Second, when the temperature of the chamber rose from 149 °C to 251 °C, the most unstable oxygen functional groups of the PVA combined with graphene was decomposed, so that the mass is significantly reduced by 70 % [40,41]. However, it can be seen that the thermal decomposition temperature of PVA can be improved by 20 °C or higher through the additional graphene. In this experiment, the thermal decomposition temperature increased by 40 °C at the highest concentration of graphene (6 %). In addition, the effect of enhancing thermal decomposition was also observed at the remaining mass at 600 °C, where the highest residue was obtained by adding 6 % graphene. The results demonstrated that the thermal stability in the nanofiber structures was improved by the additional graphene."
5,Surface morphology and electrical characterization of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers,"3.3 Surface morphology and electrical characterization of self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers Fig. 5 a shows the diameter of the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers electrospun at various mixing concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 %. The morphology of the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers was observed through FIB-SEM. The smooth and clear PVA-G composite nanofiber structures were retained, with a mean diameter of 240 nm for pristine PVA and 90 nm after the addition of G sheets with a solution concentration of 6% (see the inset in Fig. 5a), respectively. Herein, we determined that such composite materials can change into PVA-G nanofibers without diversifying their morphology through electrospinning on a glass substrate. The concentration of the pure PVA forming the nanofibers was 0 %, as confirmed by the massive distribution of the mean fiber diameter around 240 nm. After G sheets with mixing concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 % were added, the mean diameter of the composite nanofibers decreased from 240 to 120 nm, suggesting that the high capacity for dispersion and viscosity of the PVA solution decreased after the addition of conductive G sheets. Moreover, the G improved charge density on the surface of the needle tip, which would have triggered a narrower and smaller diameter distribution on the PVA-G nanofibers [42,43]. Furthermore, the composite nanofibers were more stable and uniform in size, as confirmed by an increasingly mixed concentration (4–6 %), which in turn caused a reduction in the mean diameter of the composite nanofibers from 105 to 90 nm. Thus, the surface morphology of the composite nanofibers can be thinned by increasing the amount of G. Moreover, the variation of mixing concertation can be stably reduced by adding more G because the uniform electric field distribution can increase dispersion. Similar results have been reported for several polymer composites with conductive carbon nanotube materials for the preparation of electrospun nanofibers [44,45]. In order to measure the electrical properties of the self-heating PVA-G nanofibers, the percent resistance (%R = I × R/V × 100) relative to the resistance of the composite nanofiber thin-film structures for various G concentrations and pristine PVA was determined, as shown in Fig. 5b. The PVA composites were improved significantly in electrical and thermal abilities by a small amount of G dopant. Herein, V and I have applied voltage from electrical measurement and currents obtained for different concentrations of added G sheets, respectively. Inset in the LSCM showed the electrospun nanofibers on the surface of the glass substrate when the mixing concentration was 0.5 %. The %R of the composite nanofibers sample were 100 and 37.9 at G concentrations of 0 and 6 %, respectively; the %R further decreased slightly and approached stability. In other words, a reduction in the mean diameter of the composite nanofibers can be from 240 to 90 nm. It demonstrated that the conductivity increased, and PVA-G nanofibers diameter decreased when the proportion of G added increased. For the PVA/G composite conductive polymer nanofibers, the conductive mechanism of conductive polymers for RH detection is quite complicated. Generally, the conjugated backbone structure of the dopant (G) combined with the acceptor (PVA) can drive the charge mobility of the carriers. At the same time, the carriers conducting charge are by moving along the chain and between the chains, in which the extremely small interatomic distance (bandgap) between the conduction band and the valence band in the conjugated main chain PVA/G composite structures indicates a higher conduction state. The percentage of G added and the degree of PVA oxidation can affect the bandgap, thereby affecting the conductivity of the PVA/G composite polymer nanofibers [46]. Herein the nanofiber device with the G concentration of 6% can only be used for enhancing detection sensitivity as the sensing condition for RH detection. The electrical properties indicate that the proposed thin-film-based humidity detection devices could be detected precisely by optimizing the mixing concentration of the electrospun composite nanofibers."
6,Self-heating nanofiber properties and humidity detection,"3.4 Self-heating nanofiber properties and humidity detection In pursuance of the properties of the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers for forming the thin-film device, electrothermal measurements were performed before the humidity detection by placing the nanofibers on a cleaned stainless steel plate connected to probes to pass current through the Cu foil. The heating status was captured using a type K thermocouple attach onto the surface of the PVA-G nanofibers. Self-heating caused by Joule heating of the PVA-G nanofibers, its amount of heat generated was determined based on the resistance and applied voltage. Then, the total electric power of the PVA-G thin-film device was formed as a heater where the temperature can be controlled by the electrical power and the applied voltage followed by (1) P = V 2 R where V is the applied input voltage from the power supply and R the resistance of the PVA-G nanofibers for different G sheets concentrations [47,48]. The effect of electric power (electrical energy) versus applied voltage at different PVA-G concentrations is shown in Fig. 6 a. The electrical power increased for a given PVA-G concentration with increasing applied voltage ranging from the 0 to 10 V. The total electric power values of the PVA-G thin-film based heater for various PVA-G concentrations of 0 (0%; pristine PVA nanofibers), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6% at 10 V were 0, 5.05, 10.11, 15.16, 20.21, and 25.27 mW, respectively. The highest electric power was achieved at the applied voltage of 10 V at the PVA-G concentration of 6 %, which was 25.27 mW, a 20 % enhancement compared with the power at the PVA-G concentration of 5%. The response time of the self-heating behavior of the PVA-G nanofibers device was an essential factor in evaluating its humidity detection performance owing to the effect of this behavior on device operation from room temperature to a steady-state temperature. The self-heating function of PVA-G could lead to an increase in ambient temperature and affect RH. Through heating of the Teflon hoses, the temperature of H2O molecules into the sensing chamber and RH can be controlled. Fig. 6b shows the rapid-heating response of the self-heating PVA-G nanofibers. The area are 20 mm × 20 mm at various PVA-G concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 %) under a fixed bias voltage of 10 V. The temperature of the PVA-G thin-film nanofibers device increased immediately when the voltage was applied; it decreased gradually when the input power ceased after heating for 30 s. Furthermore, the heating rate increased significantly as the G concentration rose. The temperature increased from 25 °C to 58.5 °C required less than 10 s at the applied voltage of 10 V for the PVA-G concentration of 6%. This nanofiber device took only 6 s with a low power consumption of 25.27 mW, thus resulting in a high self-heating rate of 10.6 °C, compared with that at the G concentration of 5 %. The humidity-detecting mechanism of PVA-G nanofibers can be explained by the properties of material and structures, as shown in Fig. 7 a. The adsorption ability of H2O was ascribed to the strong interaction between PVA hydrogels and G [49,50]. In the previous experiments, the resonant frequency of an inductor-capacitor circuit consisting of a G-based device was demonstrated to change in response to RH reproducibly [51]. Since the action of H2O and the G films are mainly hydrogen bonding, N2 can carry away the moisture on the surface of G films (the bonding force of the hydrogen bond is weak). It appears that the adsorption behavior of H2O will become low in the N2 gas environment. As the infiltration of N2 gas, H2O is removed from the PVA-G surface (RH is reduced) and achieve the effect of desorption, that is, an increase in RH can adsorb more H2O on the surface of PVA-G nanofibers in the device. A similar on-chip device with conductive composites can be used for the detection of H2O [52,53]. To date, no publications have attempted to apply the self-heating effects of PVA-G nanofiber-based devices to the high-sensitivity measurement of vapor. The PVA was a biodegradable polymer with the polymer chains, which were indeed immobilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with G sheets [54–56]. Due to the strong van der Waals force between G sheets [56], the hydrogen bonds of PVA attach the G sheets, which can allow them distributed within the PVA, as shown in Fig. 7b. Therefore, the electrical response of the as-electrospun PVA-G nanofiber thin-film structures for H2O detection was examined by exposing PVA-G nanofibers surfaces to the respective vapor (target gas) diluted with zero air. The change in resistance can define the relative response of humidity detection due to exposure to humidity [57]: (2) Response ( % ) = ( R g − R a ) R a × 100 % where Rg is the sensor resistance in the presence of H2O and Ra the sensor resistance in the presence of N2. The humidity response properties of this study can be measured in the testing chamber by increasing the RH values in N2. Table 1 shows the RH detection using graphene-based devices with higher sensitivity, which one can find a wide variety of applications for the on-chip measurement. In this study, using the self-heating effect as a microheater was also performed at a good thermoelectric conversion efficiency. According to the humidity-detecting mechanism in Fig. 1, the reactivity of oxygen species (O− or O2 −) adsorbed on the surface of PVA-G nanofibers was considered. G sheets in the PVA/G composites can play a role as electron donors. The mechanism of PVA-G nanofibers was closely related to the change in resistance, which can be controlled by the reaction of H2O and the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface. The occurrence of chemisorbed oxygen species upon the temperature of less than 100 °C was reported by Latif et al. [64]. When the humidity-detecting device was exposed to H2O, the adsorbed oxygen species can obtain free electrons from the PVA-G nanofibers. The decrease of carrier concentration and electron mobility can cause the rise of resistance. Under the operating temperature range, the reaction of H2O with chemisorbed oxygen can be shown in Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) [65,66] (3) O 2 ( G a s ) ⇔ O 2 ( a b s o r b e d ) (4) O 2 ( a b s o r b e d ) + e − ⇔ O 2 − (5) O 2 − + e − ⇔ 2 O 2 − The electrical responses (%) of the self-heating nanofiber device for humidity detection obtained using Eq. (2) were 3.6 %, 11 %, 15.9 %, 33 %, and 66.4 % for RH of 10 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 %, respectively, at the heating temperature of 60 °C. For 80 % RH, the response and recovery times of the PVA-G nanofibers humidity sensor were 11 and 35 s at the heating temperature of 60 °C, respectively. These times were shorter than the 22 and 50 s at 30 °C, as shown in Fig. 8 a. It can be found that the linear response obtained is close to the humidity from 20 % to 80 % when the heating temperature is 30 °C. Since the response to lower RH levels (< 20 %) is almost unchanged, this system illustrates that is almost impossible to respond to RH levels below 20 % at an operating temperature of 30 °C. However, when the heating temperature is 60 °C, the linear response was obtained in humidity range of 10%–40%, and the responses in a higher RH level (> 40 %) was greatly improved. The results showed that using the PVA-G nanofibers as a humidity sensor with a higher degree of self-heating is more efficient than using a lower heating temperature with the two-fold faster response time. As humidity decreased, freer electrons (hydrogen bonding electrons) could be adsorbed on the G surface, reducing the corresponding resistance. Herein the mechanism has already been defined as mentioned above. In general, the increase in humidity and the corresponding resistance means that electrons were adsorbed [67,68]. Meanwhile, the O2 can be regarded as taking electrons and molecular charges from the G surface. As the temperature increases, it reduces the electron concentration and increases the resistance of the formed PVA-G nanofiber device [69,70]. Thus, the response of the self-heating PVA-G nanofibers device for humidity detection doubled at 60 °C and 80 % RH compared with that at 30 °C (from 38.2 % to 66.4 %), similar to results reported in other studies [71]. In this study, the long-term stability of PVA-G nanofiber devices can be performed at a temperature of 60 °C. The most common way to show the stability of a formed device for gas control [72]. The sensitivity response of this study was measured repeatedly at different RH ranges within 7 days, as shown in Fig. 8b. It indicated that the PVA-G nanofiber devices were under ∼ ±5% response to environmental changes. The gas device showed a repeatable response and a stable response in the presence of humidity."
7,Conclusions,"This study investigated the self-heating effects of PVA-G nanocomposite fibers in use as an efficient and highly-sensitive humidity sensor. The Raman spectra of the device revealed the characteristic peaks of self-heating PVA-G thin-films, where PVA retained excellent stability after the addition of G sheets. Based on the high electrical conductivity and uniform dispersal in the electrospun solution, the self-heating PVA-G composite nanofibers were smooth to such a degree so that they could be thinned down to a diameter of 90 nm through the addition of more G sheets. In addition, several G sheets could reduce the resistance of the formed self-heating PVA-G nanofiber devices and allow for device operation at temperatures of up to 60 °C with the minimal power consumption of 25.27 mW (PVA-G composite concentration of 6%). Furthermore, at RH of 80 %, the proposed humidity detection device had excellent sensing properties with a response of 66.4 % and response and recovery times of 11 and 35 s, respectively, at the heating temperature of 60 °C. Therefore, modulation of the concentration of G sheets for controlling the heating and abilities of humidity detection with functionalized PVA-G nanofibers in the thin-film device was achieved. For humidity detection, exploiting state-of-the-art self-heating resistive sensing devices with the PVA-G composite nanofibers can not only be easily manufactured through electrospinning, but can also be a low-cost and power efficient alternative to conventional composite thin-film device and fabrication."
