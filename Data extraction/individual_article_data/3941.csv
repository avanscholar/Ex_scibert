0,Introduction,"Diene-based polymers such as butadiene rubber (BR), chloroprene rubber (CR), natural rubber (NR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) are some of the most important commercial polymers [1]. They are widely used as various rubber components in the automobile, petrochemical, mining and aerospace industries. A common feature of these diene-based polymers is the presence of the olefinic structures in the polymer chain which are very active sites for a variety of chemical reactions (e.g. hydrogenation, hydroformylation, metathesis, coupling reactions). The chemical modification of diene based polymers via hydrogenating the unsaturated CC bonds (CCs) has been extensively investigated in academia and industry over the last two decades which has obtained significant achievements [2–4]. Hydrogenation of NBR is an excellent example and it has been commercialized by Bayer (now known as LANXESS) and ZEON Chemicals under the trademark Therban® and Zetpol® respectively. The hydrogenated NBR (HNBR) improves the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the NBR elastomer. It imparts excellent resistance to oxidative and ozonolytic aging, improved resistance to oils and fluids, even at high temperatures and reduced gas permeability. Currently, NBR hydrogenation reactions are carried out in polymer solutions using Rh or Pd metal based catalysts. However, the high manufacturing cost of this process has substantially limited its application (i.e. substitution of NBR). The challenge that rubber material scientists and engineers face is to produce this high-performance elastomer in an economical manner. Significant research has been carried out to improve NBR hydrogenation process, including using ruthenium (Ru) or osmium (Os) based catalysts [5,6], biphasic catalysts [7–9], performing hydrogenation reaction in aqueous system [10–17], ionic liquids [18,19], or via the use of supercritical CO2 [20]. Among them, direct hydrogenation of the NBR in latex becomes especially attractive and considerable efforts have been made to realize direct NBR latex hydrogenation. NBR latex hydrogenation is much more complicated than that in solution especially when it comes to finding an effective catalyst. NBR latex hydrogenation using organometallic catalysts has been investigated a lot. However, the stability of the catalyst in an aqueous system and the necessity of adding a large amount of organic co-solvent (improve the solubility of catalyst in water) as well as the catalyst recovery presents major obstacles in NBR latex hydrogenation. Our group has been deeply involved in the development of polymer modification processes over the last two decades, and we have focused our efforts on developing effective catalytic processes (i.e. new catalysts, novel reaction processes) for polymer hydrogenation. Recently, we reported that NBR latex could be successfully hydrogenated using RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst with the addition of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) [21] and high quality HNBR latex was obtained. However, the low solubility of the RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst in an aqueous system negatively affected the efficiency of the catalyst. As we know, RhCl3, the most common rhodium salt, has high solubility in water. It was preferably adopted as a rhodium precursor for the rhodium catalyst synthesis. The in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 in NBR latex using RhCl3 and PPh3 for NBR latex hydrogenation is reported for the first time in this paper."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ultra-high purity hydrogen (99.999%, oxygen-free) and high purity nitrogen (99.9%) were purchased from Praxair Inc. (Kitchener, Canada). Commercial grades of NBR latex and solid RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst were received from LANXESS Deutschland GmbH (Germany). Reagent grade chemicals such as mono-chlorobenzene (MCB), methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Fisher-Scientific Canada and used as received. Rhodium trichloride hydrate (RhCl3.aq, Rh 38∼40%) and triphenylphosphine (Reagent Plus 99.9wt.%) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Canada)."
3,Hydrogenation of NBR Latex using in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst,"2.2 Hydrogenation of NBR Latex using in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst NBR latex hydrogenation reactions were conducted in a stirred, 300mL batch reactor (Parr Instrument, USA). The reactor was cleaned by washing thoroughly with MEK and drying in an oven over night before each reaction. The reaction temperature was monitored using a thermocouple. The catalyst precursor RhCl3 was placed in a catalyst addition device (Parr Instrument, USA) installed in the head of the reactor. PPh3 was pre-added to the NBR latex before assembling the reactor. The mixture was degassed and heated to the reaction temperature under agitation. After that, RhCl3 was charged to the mixture with hydrogen gas. The hydrogen pressure and reaction temperature were kept constant throughout the reaction period. The reaction mixture was sampled during the reaction."
4,Determination of the degree of hydrogenation,"2.3 Determination of the degree of hydrogenation The degree of hydrogenation was obtained via Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis (Bio-Rad FTS 3000MX spectrometer) using ASTM D5670-95 test method. The NBR latex sample was precipitated by slowly dropping a NaCl solution (10wt.%) into the latex under agitation. After the solvent was decanted, the precipitated rubber was washed with water and dried under reduced pressure. The dried solid rubber was re-dissolved in MEK and the polymer solution was cast onto a single NaCl crystal disc and dried. The degree of hydrogenation was calculated from the FT-IR spectra according to the peak strength [22]."
5,Determination of rhodium concentration in HNBR,"2.4 Determination of rhodium concentration in HNBR HNBR samples were digested in a High Pressure Asher (Anton Parr, Austria) using the following method: 0.4g of HNBR sample was accurately weighed out and mixed with hydrochloric acid (1mL, 37.5wt.%), nitric acid (5mL, 62wt.%) and aqueous hydrogen peroxide (1mL of 30%, v/v). The sample was then digested at 300°C, 130bar (1885psi) for 3h. The rhodium concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (TELEDYNE, LEEMAN Labs, Prodigy, high dispersion ICP, USA) [23]. The calibration standards were prepared using rhodium trichloride solution (1000ppm, Sigma–Aldrich) and yttrium (Y) was used as internal reference standard."
6,Particle size in latex and its distribution,"2.5 Particle size in latex and its distribution The size and number size distribution (non-negative least squares method) of the polymer particles of the synthesized latex were determined at 25°C using a Nanotrac 150 particle size analyzer (BETATEK Inc. Toronto, Canada) and reported as the number average diameter. The calculations of the particle size distributions were performed using Microtrac FLEX 10.2.14 software available from BETATEK Inc., which employed single-exponential fitting, non-negatively constrained least-squares (NNLS), cumulants analysis, and CONTIN particle size distribution analysis routines."

8,In situ synthesis of RhCl(PPh3)3 and its activity in NBR latex hydrogenation,"3.1 In situ synthesis of RhCl(PPh3)3 and its activity in NBR latex hydrogenation We first investigated the in situ synthesis of RhCl(PPh3)3 in pure water. It was found that solid PPh3 liquefied around 80°C. After adding RhCl3, the color of PPh3 droplets quickly changed from transparent to red. This could be explained by the formation of RhCl(PPh3)3 from RhCl3 and PPh3. The formed RhCl(PPh3)3 has a burgundy color. Due to its hydrophobicity, RhCl(PPh3)3 tends to stay in the PPh3 droplet. As a result, the color of the droplet changes from colorless to red. When the system cooled down to room temperature, these red droplets solidified and precipitated. Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectrum of RhCl(PPh3)3 (a), pure PPh3 (b) and the precipitate obtained after RhCl3 reacted with PPh3 (c), respectively. From the FT-IR results, although the spectrum of the precipitate is similar to that of PPh3, the distinctive peak at 550cm−1 attributed to a Rh-P stretching vibration was observed, confirming the formation of RhCl(PPh3)3 [24]. After carefully washing with hot ethanol to remove the PPh3, most of the precipitates (PPh3) were re-dissolved. The final residue analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy showed the same spectrum as that of RhCl(PPh3)3. In addition, the yield was calculated based on the feed RhCl3. It was found that less than 20mol.% of rhodium from the feed RhCl3 could be converted to RhCl(PPh3)3 in water. Representative experiments under operational conditions and final conversions of NBR latex hydrogenation using the in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst as well as the pre-made solid RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst are listed in Table 1 . Two reaction temperatures 145°C and 160°C were used in the investigation. First, it can be seen that NBR latex could be successfully hydrogenated using pre-made solid RhCl(PPh3)3 together with PPh3 (Entry 1, 2). Without the addition of PPh3, the hydrogenation reaction was slow and only part of the CCs were reacted (Entry 3). In the in situ method, RhCl3 could not catalyze the hydrogenation reaction (Entry 4). After adding PPh3, it was found that the CCs in NBR could be quantitatively hydrogenated, indicating that RhCl(PPh3)3 was in situ synthesized in the NBR latex from RhCl3 and PPh3. Under the same reaction condition (i.e. Rh amount, temperature and pressure), it is clearly seen that the NBR hydrogenation reaction was faster using the in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst than the pre-made solid counterpart. The hydrogenation reaction time (both hydrogenated to 95mol.%) was shortened from 50h to 38h at 145°C (Entry 1 vs. Entry 6) and from 26h to 19h at 160°C (Entry 2 vs. Entry 7). The reproducibility of this reaction was also tested and a satisfactory result was observed (Entry 7, 8). It was worth mentioning that the in situ synthesis only takes several minutes. Compared to the total reaction time, it is a quick process. Once the catalyst is in situ synthesized, the reaction pathway should be similar to the pre-made solid catalyst. In addition, more detailed kinetic experiments are necessary to obtain the real reaction rates."
9,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations Typical FT-IR spectra of original NBR (a), hydrogenated NBR (b) obtained using in situ RhCl(PPh3)3 are depicted in Fig. 2 . In the spectrum of NBR, the peak at 2236cm−1 belongs to the –CN stretching vibration. The intense peak shown at 970cm−1 is characteristic of the level of olefin by the carbon–hydrogen vibration of the 1,4-trans double bonds. The absorbance peak at 920cm−1 is that of the 1,2 vinyl terminal bonds. After hydrogenation, it was observed that the intensity of the peaks at 970cm−1 and 920cm−1 considerably diminished while a peak at 723cm−1 appeared. The peak at 723cm−1 in the hydrogenation NBR corresponds to the -CH2 rocking vibration (saturated –[CH2] n – (n>4) unit). This transformation indicates the reduction of unsaturated CC bonds to saturated CC bonds. The chemical stability of unsaturated nitrile group during the hydrogenation was also measured. The presence of the nitrile group in HNBR and the lack of primary amines (two bands from 3250cm−1 to 3400cm−1) or secondary amines (one band from 3310cm−1 to 3350cm−1) confirms that the hydrogen reduction is exclusively toward CC bonds. Fig. 3 shows the chemical shifts of the protons in NBR and hydrogenated NBR by 1H NMR characterization. For NBR, the peaks from 5.6 to 4.9ppm are attributed to the olefinic protons. Among them, the large peaks between 5.3 and 5.6ppm are related to trans hydrogen atoms of butadiene resulting from 1,4-addition and the small peaks between 4.91 and 5.1ppm belong to the hydrogen atoms of pendant vinyl groups which comes from 1,2-addition. Meanwhile, all of the aliphatic protons in the CH3, CH2 and CH microstructures lie between 0.8 and 2.8ppm. In the HNBR (ca. 95mol.%), it could be clearly seen that most of the peaks in the olefinic protons region disappeared which confirms that the unsaturated CCs were reduced by H2. We next turn our attention to the morphology of the latex. First, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed that during the hydrogenation operation, no coagulation of the latex was observed under our reaction conditions. The average particle size of the NBR latex is around 72nm. The average size remained the same after the hydrogenation reaction (Fig. 4 ). The solid content of the resultant HNBR latex is also compared to the NBR latex. The difference is less than 5wt.% on average. In addition, Fig. 5 shows TEM micrographs of NBR latex before/after the hydrogenation step. For comparison, NBR latex (A) and the HNBR latex with a 95mol.% conversion (B) are also depicted. Although the particle size distribution of the commercial NBR latex is broad, it is not affected either by in situ synthesis process or the hydrogenation reaction. All these results show that NBR hydrogenation using in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst would not affect the latex particle size or latex stability."
10,Catalyst diffusion in NBR latex during hydrogenation,"3.3 Catalyst diffusion in NBR latex during hydrogenation The hydrogenation of polymeric materials in latex is quite different from the hydrogenation of small olefins due to their high molecular weight. The polymer hydrogenation reactions were normally conducted at a temperature higher than the polymer's glass transition temperature (T g) but lower than its melting temperature (T m). Hence, the chain conformational rearrangement is limited and the movements of the CC bonds are confined to their own local positions due to the inter-penetration and entanglement between the polymer chains [25]. On this basis, the contact of CC bonds with the catalyst should mainly depend on the diffusion of the catalyst. As the requirement for industrial applications of HNBR production needs a high degree of the hydrogenation of the CC bonds in the polymer chains (i.e. 95mol.%), the catalyst needs to contact most of the CC bonds to promote the hydrogenation reaction. Generally, the catalyst can be present in three locations in the polymer latex: i) in the water medium, ii) at the interface of water and polymer particles and iii) inside of the polymer particles. Parker and Roberts, who studied the hydrogenation of SBR latex, found that the hydrogenation reaction begins after the catalyst contacts the surface of the polymer particles [26]. From our results (Table 1, Entry 3), less than 20mol.% CCs in NBR could be reduced by using the RhCl(PPh3)3 alone. The contact between the hydrophobic catalyst and the CCs in the polymer particles is greatly limited. In order to achieve the required degree of hydrogenation, the catalyst has to diffuse into the polymer particles. When an experiment for NBR latex hydrogenation using RhCl(PPh3)3 in the presence of PPh3, more than 95mol.% conversion was achieved (Table 1, Entry 1 and 2). Therefore, the addition of PPh3 is required for a successful NBR latex hydrogenation. The PPh3 acted as a reagent (carrier) to facilitate phase boundary crossing of the catalyst dissolved in it. From our FT-IR spectra (Fig. 6b), two characteristic peaks for PPh3 [27] were observed when NBR latex was mixed with PPh3 at an elevated temperature, confirming PPh3 could diffuse into the NBR polymer particles. In the in situ process, PPh3 is not only used as a ligand for synthesizing RhCl(PPh3)3 but also works as a carrier for catalyst transportation during the NBR latex hydrogenation. To quantify the amount of catalyst residing in the polymer particles, the resultant HNBRs were digested and the residual rhodium metal was measured by ICP-AES. Fig. 7 shows the rhodium concentration in the polymer particles during the hydrogenation. The catalyst diffusion was a slow process when using the pre-made solid RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst,. The Rh concentration in the polymer particles gradually increased during the reaction and reached a steady state (18wt.%) after 15h. This is because when the hydrophobic catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 was added to the NBR latex, it is not well dispersed into the aqueous phase. Instead, it remained as suspended clusters in the water phase under agitation. In the presence of extra PPh3 under the set reaction temperature, RhCl(PPh3)3 was dissolved in the PPh3 droplets and transferred into the NBR particles. Hence, the RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst needs to cross both the catalyst-water interface and water-micelles interface before contacting the CC bonds in the NBR particles. In the in situ process, the catalyst precursor RhCl3 could be uniformly dissolved in the aqueous NBR latex. It could easily react with the PPh3, forming the RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst. The in situ synthesized catalyst was dissolved in the adjacent PPh3 droplets and diffused into the polymer particles. Thereby, the rhodium concentration in the particles rapidly increased and a steady state was reached in a short time. Comparing with using solid catalyst, the final retention of catalyst inside the polymer particles was also higher by using the in situ method. The quick catalyst diffusion and the high catalyst retention caused a faster hydrogenation reaction in the in situ process. Comparing the molar percentage of rhodium in the polymer to the total feed rhodium from RhCl3, it was found that less than half of the total rhodium was transferred into the polymer particles using the in situ method. This could be explained by the low in situ synthesis efficiency in the NBR latex system. In addition, a layer of black particles (Rh colloid) observed at the bottom of the reactor after reaction is resulted from some reduction of RhCl3 to metallic Rh at high temperature under H2. A similar phenomenon was observed by Papadogianakis et al. in the hydrogenation of polybutadiene-1,4-block-poly(ethylene oxide) latex using in situ synthesized Rh/TPPTS catalyst [28]. The activity of the metallic Rh was tested for NBR latex hydrogenation and no hydrogenation was observed [29]. Therefore, the formation of metallic rhodium is a side reaction during the in situ process. But it is not harmful to NBR hydrogenation."
11,"Effects of temperature, catalyst loading and PPh3 on the RhCl3 ratio for NBR latex hydrogenation using the in situ process","3.4 Effects of temperature, catalyst loading and PPh3 on the RhCl3 ratio for NBR latex hydrogenation using the in situ process The effects of reaction temperature, PPh3 to RhCl3 ratio and catalyst precursor RhCl3 loading are some important factors which have commonly been analyzed in NBR solution hydrogenation [30,31]. Here, these factors on the extent of hydrogenation conversion were also studied for NBR latex hydrogenation and the results are summarized in Table 2 . The effect of temperature on NBR latex hydrogenation reaction under the in situ process was studied from 50°C to 160°C at a constant reaction pressure and catalyst loading of 1000psig and 0.52mmol/L of RhCl3 respectively (Table 2, Entry 1–4 and Entry 8). It is clear that temperature is an important parameter for the hydrogenation reaction. The reaction temperature greatly affected the in situ synthesis and catalyst diffusion efficiency. The hydrogenation reaction time (to achieve the same conversion) dropped with an increase in temperature. In addition, the rhodium concentration in the polymer product increased with an increase in temperature. The ratio of PPh3 to RhCl3 was studied at 160°C at a constant RhCl3 loading (Rh/NBR) and H2 pressure (Table 2, Entry 6–9). It was suggested before that the free PPh3 performed as the required free co-catalyst ligand to maintain the stability of the main catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 during the NBR solution hydrogenation and the PPh3 had a marginal effect on the activity of the RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst [32]. However, it can be seen that the PPh3 plays a very significant role in the NBR latex hydrogenation reaction. The reaction time greatly decreased from 82h to 19h on increasing the PPh3 to RhCl3 ratio from 3 to 35. However the reaction time almost keeps constant when the ratio increases to 100. Although a larger amount of catalyst could diffuse into the polymer particles with the addition of more PPh3, the excessive PPh3 would slow down the formation of the reactive intermediate RhCl(PPh3)2 by shifting the equilibrium of the RhCl(PPh3)3 dissociation. Also, the effect of the RhCl3 loading was compared under different temperatures. It can be seen the reaction time was significantly affected under lower RhCl3 loading (Table 2, Entry 4, 5) while this was not so evident at higher loadings (Table 2, Entry 10–12)."
12,Catalyst in situ synthesis with alcohol in NBR latex hydrogenation,"3.5 Catalyst in situ synthesis with alcohol in NBR latex hydrogenation In light of the in situ synthesizing RhCl(PPh3)3 from RhCl3 and PPh3 in NBR latex hydrogenation, one way to improve the in situ synthesis efficiency is to convert more catalyst precursor RhCl3 into RhCl(PPh3)3. Right now, the standard reference work is the most familiar method for synthesizing RhCl(PPh3)3 using RhCl3 and PPh3. In this method, RhCl3 reacts with excess PPh3 in ethanol to form RhCl(PPh3). Unfortunately, RhCl(PPh3)3 could not be efficiently synthesized in water due to the low solubility of PPh3 in pure water. However, it was recently disclosed that when the RhCl(PPh3)3 was synthesized in a mixture of water and alcohol, the yield of the catalyst could be improved to a great extent compared when using pure water or pure alcohol alone [33]. On this basis, adding a small amount of alcohol (e.g. ethanol) to the NBR latex was tested in our reaction system. RhCl 3 + H 2 O + 4 PPh 3 ⟶ ethanol RhCl ( PPh 3 ) 3 + PPh 3 O + 2 HCl The results of NBR latex hydrogenation in the presence of ethanol are shown in Fig. 8 . After the introduction of ethanol, the reaction time greatly decreased from 38h to 20h at 145°C. The rhodium concentration in the polymer particles was also measured by the ICP-AES and more Rh was present inside the polymer particles. It should also be noted here that ethanol could not dissolve the RhCl(PPh3)3 or NBR polymer in the latex. No distinctive promotion for the hydrogenation reaction was observed when adding ethanol to pre-made solid catalyst (Table 3 ). Therefore, more RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst should be in situ generated under the NBR latex/ethanol mixture. The DLS results showed that after adding ethanol, the NBR particle size slightly increased from 72nm to 80nm. This is because when ethanol diffused into the micelle, it can counter balance the charges and reduce the electrical repulsion in the stern layer of the micelles [34]. In other words, the charge density at the micelles surface decreased and thereby the absolute value of the electrical potential was also reduced [35]. The effect of the ethanol to the total volume ratio in the in situ method is presented in Table 4 . It was found that the reaction became faster as the amount of ethanol volume ratio increased from 1/20 to 1/5, indicating most likely that more catalyst could be synthesized in situ with the higher levels of ethanol. However, it was also observed that further addition of ethanol to the NBR latex interrupted the stability of latex. As a result, polymer particles were precipitated from the latex. Attempts were also made to investigate the effect of different kinds of alcohols (same mol level) for NBR latex hydrogenation (Table 4). Under the same reaction conditions, the reaction time decreased with the sequence of t 2-propanol < t ethanol < t methanol. Due to its stronger reduction ability and lipophilic property (it can work as a surfactant), 2-propanol more likely stays around the polymer particles and the in situ formed catalyst can rapidly diffuse into the inside of the polymer particles. Therefore the hydrogenation reaction in the presence of 2-propanol is faster than that of ethanol or methanol."
13,Conclusions,"RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst could be in situ synthesized in NBR latex using RhCl3 and PPh3. NBR latex hydrogenation undergoes a faster reaction under the in situ method than using the pre-made solid RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst system since more catalyst could be quickly diffused into the NBR particles in the in situ method. The catalyst diffusion process was also investigated by monitoring the catalyst concentration change in the NBR particles and the result confirms that the high degree of hydrogenation can only be achieved when the catalyst is transported into the polymer particles in NBR latex. Finally, the production of HNBR latex by in situ synthesis process could be greatly enhanced by the addition of a small amount of an alcohol (not to dissolve catalyst) which greatly improves the in situ catalyst synthesis efficiency."
