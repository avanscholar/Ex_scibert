0,Introduction,"The field of catalysis has revolutionized the chemical industry over the past 150 years. Nowadays over 70% of all chemical industrial processes rely on heterogeneous catalysis [1,2]. Although heterogeneous catalysis can be considered an old discipline, the research is not stagnating; new catalysts and processes are constantly being developed [3]. However, the complexity of the surface chemistry involved, as well as the often ill-defined structure of the active sites, renders the study of fundamental aspects within heterogeneous catalysis challenging [4,5]. For example, in the Haber–Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia (the most important chemical manufacturing process in the world), there is still a gap between theoretical calculations and lab-scale tests and the actual industrial process [6]. This prevents straightforward extrapolation of results based on theoretical calculations to the industrial process [7]. Supported metal nanoparticles have attracted growing attention in the past few decades as active and selective catalysts for several reactions of industrial interest [8,9]. The hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes, in particular, are important industrial processes for the production of a wide range of chemicals that find use as solvents, fuels, plasticizers, detergents, pharmaceutical precursors, and fine chemicals [10–12]. Aldehydes, in fact, can be found in several biomass-derived feedstocks; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, for example, are the products of dehydration of fructose and xylose, respectively, while vanillin can be found in the complex lignin structure [13–15]. For this reason, the conversion of aldehydes is nowadays playing a crucial role, as the valuing of biomass-derived compounds is a critical step toward the replacement of fossil fuel as source of chemicals [16]. A vast body of work on the hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes using Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts is reported in the literature. Pd is considered a suitable catalyst for these types of reactions due to its capacity to dissociate and easily activate molecular hydrogen [17]. However, several aspects of the reaction mechanism of Pd-based catalysts still remain unclear. For example, the scientific literature is still vague on the effect of the side chains of aldehydes on the hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of the carbonyl group. The physicochemical properties of the substituent groups on aldehydes, in fact, can strongly affect their reactivity in several ways, such as increasing/decreasing the substrate adsorption (or modifying its geometry) through steric effects or increasing/decreasing the electronic density on the carbonyl bond. A steric effect was first addressed by Kobayashi et al. using cyclohexanone and one of its methyl-substituted derivatives (2-, 3-, or 4-methylcyclohexanone) as model substrates [18]. The results clearly showed that the methyl-substituted ketones were less reactive than cyclohexanone over different metal catalysts (including Pd), and the decreased reactivity was ascribed to steric hindrance of the adsorption of the substrate on the catalyst surface by the methyl group. Moreover, Santori and colleagues observed a higher hydrogenation rate of benzaldehyde than of butyraldehyde over Pt-based catalysts, attributing the phenomenon to the lower strength of the CO bond in aromatic aldehydes than in aliphatic ones [19]. Kieboom also reported that hydrodeoxygenation is accelerated by electron-donating groups on the aromatic rings of benzyl alcohol derivatives over Pd-based catalysts [20]. Different results were, however, reported by Keane et al., who noticed a decreased rate for the hydrogenation of 2-methylbenzaldehyde compared with benzaldehyde over a Ni-based catalyst and ascribed this effect to the electron-donating property of the methyl group in the ortho position [21]. One of the fundamental steps in heterogeneous catalysis is the adsorption of the substrate onto the active site. In the case of molecules containing a carbonylic group, such as aldehydes, the adsorption can happen in two modes: η1–(O) mode and η2-(C, O) mode [22]. The former implies interaction of the lone pair of oxygen with the catalyst surface, while the latter involves interaction with the double bond of the carbonyl group. These adsorption modes are affected not only by steric hindrance but also by electronic effects. In the case of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, for example, a strong interaction between the catalyst and the π-bonds of the aromatic furan ring directs the adsorption of the substrate to a flat η2-(C, O) position [23]. This, in turn, can strongly affect the selectivity of the reaction, increasing the rates of side reactions such as decarbonylation and furan ring hydrogenation, as demonstrated by Duarte et al. [24]. It is therefore clear that despite the paramount importance of hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions, fundamental studies on parameters that rule the reactivity of the carbonyl group are limited and they often fail to consider the catalytic system as a single ensemble constituted by catalyst (metal and support) and substrate. This work presents a systematic analysis of the main roles played by the nature of carbonyl-bearing substrates in hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions on Pd-based catalysts, with the aim of shedding light on their entangled mechanisms. By selecting aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes differing not only in structure but also in electron density of the carbonyl group, we could study (i) the substrate adsorption, which in turn is an indication of the proximity of the substrate to the active site and its retention by the catalyst; (ii) the electronic structure of the reducible group (CO), which interacts with the electronic properties of the catalytic site. These two effects were studied using a combination of analytical tools (such as N2 and substrate adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption analysis) and theoretical models (density functional theory studies) and catalytic tests. We believe that this study can unravel the main factors governing the reaction mechanism, providing a guideline for the future synthesis of materials with high activity and selectivity in the framework of hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials K2PdCl4 (99.99%, Merck) was used as metal precursor, and commercial activated carbon (Norit Carbon GSX, hereafter referred as “AC”) was used as support. NaBH4 (99.99%, Merck) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, M w = 9000–10,000, 80% hydrolyzed, Merck) were used for the catalyst preparation. Benzaldehyde (99%, Merck), n-octanal (99%, Merck), trans-2-octenal (95%, Merck), cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (97%, Merck), cinnamaldehyde (99% Merck), cinnamyl alcohol (98%, Merck), hydrocinnamaldehyde (98%, Merck) and phenylacetaldehyde (95%, Merck) were used as substrates. p-Xylene (99%, Merck) was used as solvent."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Pd/AC catalyst was synthesized following a sol-immobilization procedure. To an aqueous solution of K2PdCl4 of the desired concentration (total metal concentrations of 1 mmol L−1), a PVA solution (1 wt%) was added (PVA/Pd (w/w) = 0.5) under constant stirring. A freshly prepared aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M, NaBH4/Pd (mol/mol) = 8) was then added to form a dark brown sol. After 30 min of sol generation, the colloid was immobilized by adding the support and acidified to pH 2 with sulfuric acid under continuous vigorous stirring. The amount of support material required was calculated to have a total final metal loading of 1 wt%. After 1 h of stirring, the slurry was filtered and the catalyst was washed thoroughly with 1 L of distilled water and dried at 80 °C for 4 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the supported Pd nanoparticles was carried out with a ZEISS LIBRA 200FE microscope equipped with a 200-kV FEG source. The specimens were finely smashed in an agate mortar, suspended in isopropanol (99.8%, Merck), and sonicated; then each suspension was dropped onto a lacey carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh) and the solvent was evaporated. Histograms of the particle size distribution were obtained by counting at least 500 particles. The mean particle diameter (d m) was calculated using the formula d m = ∑ dini/ni , where ni is the number of particles with diameter di . X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired in an M-probe apparatus (Surface Science Instruments) equipped with an atmospheric reaction chamber. The XPS line of Pd3d was recorded by applying an AlKα characteristic X-ray line and (hν = 1486.6 eV) pass energy. All data were analyzed using CasaXPS (Microsoft Corporation, v2.3.17 PR1.1). All isotherms were collected with an ASAP2020 instrument (Micromeritics). Prior to each analysis, the samples were degassed under high vacuum for 5 h at 110 °C. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms were collected at −196 °C, while those with benzaldehyde and octanal were collected at 50 °C up to about 2 mmHg absolute pressure. The micropore distribution is reported as pore width vs dA/dlog(W) and was calculated assuming slitlike pores by using the NLDFT(SD3), N2-77-Carbon Slit Pores DFT method provided by Micromeritics. Temperature-programmed desorption (TDP) analyses of benzaldehyde and octanal were performed with a homemade gas feeding apparatus described elsewhere [25] and connected downstream to a mass spectrometer (Hiden, HPR). The catalysts (50 mg) were loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor, and before each analysis, they were treated for 1 h at 110 °C under He flow (40 mL min−1). After the reactor was cooled to 75 °C, the adsorption of the substrates was carried out by flowing the He carrier gas (40 mL min−1) through a saturator at 40 °C. After adsorption, the reactor was purged until no mass signal of the substrates was detected. The TPD analysis was performed by heating the up reactor to 350 °C at 5 °C/min. 2.3.1 Computational details Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [26,27] and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [28], employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals corrections (BEEF-vdW) [29,30] and projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials [31,32]. The computational setup is similar to that in previous work [33]. Briefly, four-layer slabs of palladium with varying supercell sizes and k-point meshes were used (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). During the relaxations, the two bottom layers of the slabs were kept fixed at the bulk positions. A kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV was used for all calculations. To avoid interaction between periodic images, the Pd slabs are separated by approximately 20 Å of vacuum along the z-direction. We performed additional single-point energy calculations using the PBE functional, including Grimme’s dispersion corrections (PBE-D3, zero damping) [34,35]. The adsorption energy is defined as follows: (1) E a d s = E X + s u r f - E X + E s u r f . In Eq. (1), all energies refer to systems with optimized structures; EX+ surf stands for the total energy of the molecule/species adsorbed, EX is the energy of the adsorbate calculated in the gas phase, and E surf is the energy of the slab. By this definition, a negative value implies an exothermic process and indicates stable adsorption. The isolated molecules were structurally relaxed inside a large simulation box of 20 × 20 × 20 Å."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests Catalytic reactions were carried out in a 100-mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a glass inlet. In a typical experiment, 10 mL of a 0.3 mol L−1 solution of substrate in p-xylene and an appropriate amount of catalyst (substrate:Pd molar ratio of 1000:1) were placed in the glass inlet, along with a magnetic stirrer. The autoclave was sealed and flushed several times with N2 in order to remove any residual oxygen in the atmosphere, and then pressurized at the desired H2 pressure (typically 2 bar). The autoclave was then heated up to the desired temperature (typically 50 °C) and the reaction mixture stirred at a constant rate of 1000 rpm. Sampling was carried out by stopping the stirring and quenching the reaction under cold water. A sample of 200 µL of the reaction mixture was withdrawn under stirring to avoid altering the catalyst/reagent ratio and then centrifuged in order to separate the catalyst. A sample of 100 µL of the supernatant solution was then diluted with a solution of 1-dodecanol in p-xylene (external standard) for GC measurement. Product analysis and quantification were carried out with a GC-FID equipped with a nonpolar column (Thermo Scientific, TRACE 1300 equipped with an Agilent HP-5 column). Turnover frequency values (TOF) were calculated assuming superficial Pd(0) atoms as the active sites (see the Supplementary Material)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization The reactivity of the carbonyl group (CO) toward hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation can be affected by the carbon structure bearing the functional group. To study the impact that different side chains have on carbonyl reactivity, we employed a single benchmark catalyst throughout this study, 1 wt% Pd on activated carbon (Pd/AC). In this way, any possible uncontrolled variable caused by the nature of the catalyst (such as particle size, morphology, or support) is avoided. The catalyst was synthesized by a traditional sol-immobilization technique following a protocol developed by Prati and co-workers (see Experimental) [36,37]. This method allows close control over average particle size and particle size distribution. The Pd nanoparticles in the sol were quantitatively deposited onto the support, as confirmed by ICP analysis of the filtrate solution (no Pd was detected; therefore we assumed that the actual Pd loading corresponded to the nominal loading). TEM analysis was performed on the final catalyst, showing Pd particles homogeneously dispersed, which exhibited a mean particle size of 4.1 ± 1.3 nm (Fig. 1 left). XPS analysis was performed to evaluate the oxidation state of the deposited Pd nanoparticles. From peak deconvolution of the Pd3d orbital (Fig. 1), 80% of the Pd at the surface was in the zerovalent oxidation state, while the remaining 20% was in the form of Pd2+. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were recorded for the bare carbon support and for the Pd/AC catalyst (Fig. 2 ) in order to evaluate possible surface changes induced by the immobilization of Pd nanoparticles. As shown by the results in Fig. 2 left, the two nitrogen physisorption isotherms are quite similar in shape and, specifically, are of Type IV with a hysteresis tentatively of Type H4, according to the IUPAC classification. This means that both the materials are of a microporous nature and do not present mesopores, with a hysteresis loop that is reminiscent of narrow slitlike pores [38]. The total specific surface area of the AC sample (1441 m2 g−1) is common for activated carbons, with about 500 m2 g−1 due to microporosity. The total pore volume is 1.19 cm3 g−1, of which 0.26 cm3 g−1 is due to the micropores. These values decrease about 30% upon Pd nanoparticle immobilization, with the Pd/AC sample showing 950 m2 g−1 of specific surface area and 366 m2 g−1 of micropore area. We note that the decrease in micropore volume and area is similar to the decrease in external surface area (about 30%). Nonetheless, the relative distribution of micropores is unaltered between the two samples (Fig. 2 right) and only their absolute concentration is affected (Table 1 ). This indicates the preferential deposition of Pd on the external surface of the carbon support, rather than within the micropores. It is therefore reasonable to assume that differences in the adsorption capacity between the two samples are due to factors other than microporosity."
8,Hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes,"3.2 Hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes To establish the influence of the aldehyde structure on the catalyst behavior, benzaldehyde and n-octanal were first chosen as representative of aromatic and of aliphatic aldehydes. Fig. 3 shows the products expected from hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of the two substrates. The reactions were first performed under mild conditions (50 °C, 2 bar of H2, and a substrate-to-metal ratio of 1000:1), using a nonpolar solvent (p-xylene). When benzaldehyde was used as the substrate, almost full conversion was obtained in only 1 h (95% conversion, with an initial activity calculated at 15 min of 0.21 mol L−1h−1 and a TOF of 0.72 s−1), with most of the reaction product being benzyl alcohol (Fig. 4 , 86% selectivity). The produced alcohol was then further fully converted into toluene after 2 h additional (Fig. S1). The reaction profile clearly highlights the consecutive behavior of the two reactions (hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation). Using n-octanal under the same reaction conditions, however, no activity of the catalytic system was observed, even after an extended reaction time (5 h). The reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure were then increased to 150 °C and 20 bar, respectively, but again no products of hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation were observed (when octanol was used as substrate). We finally used cyclohexane and ethanol as a solvent, but in this case also, no significant change in activity was noticed, allowing us to exclude a possible solvent effect (i.e., competitive adsorption between solvent and substrate). It is therefore clear that the nature of the carbon backbone plays a crucial role in the substrate reactivity. This behavior might be due to lack of interaction between octanal and the catalyst surface, to an intrinsically different electron density of the carbonyl group, or to both. To elucidate the main factor influencing this type of reaction, we continued the study via a combination of DFT calculations (adsorption energies) and catalytic tests (adsorption and electronic effects)."
9,Adsorption effect,"3.3 Adsorption effect One of the reasons that octanal does not show conversion might be that it does not interact with the catalyst surface. With this in mind, we determined adsorption isotherms using benzaldehyde and n-octanal as probe substrates. Interestingly, increasing the substrate partial pressure both benzaldehyde and octanal interact with the catalyst surface (Fig. 5 ). A larger amount of benzaldehyde than of octanal was adsorbed at any time, with a maximum quantity adsorbed of 66 cm3 g−1 (compared with 62 cm3 g−1 with octanal) before condensation phenomena occurred at ca. 2.0 mmHg. Substrate surface coverage values were estimated based on the adsorption at 1.9 mmHg: the surface coverage for octanal was 1.54 molecules/nm2, while that for benzaldehyde was ca. 21% higher, with an estimated value of 1.86 molecules/nm2. In addition, the adsorption isotherms of the two substrates followed a different trend in the whole pressure range studied, which suggests a different adsorption mechanism for the two molecules. In particular, the isotherm of octanal changes slope more than once in the range of pressures studied. This means that the mechanism of adsorption of octanal is more complex than that of adsorption of benzaldehyde and/or might involve different adsorption sites, as highlighted in the DFT study (see below). Adsorption isotherms showed that octanal (as well as benzaldehyde) adsorbs onto the catalyst surface. In particular, the reactants are likely to adsorb mainly within the carbon micropores; micropores, in fact, have a strong interaction with the substrates due to weak van der Waal interactions. This technique, however, does not provide information regarding the strength of interaction between the different substrates and the catalyst surface. For this reason, we carried out temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements using both benzaldehyde and octanal as probe molecules for the Pd/AC catalyst (Fig. 6 ). Although the peak areas cannot be directly compared, as it was impossible to calibrate the mass spectrometer due to the very low vapor pressure of both molecules, the chemisorption of octanal was proven by the presence of substrate desorbing at a temperature of 140 °C (orange line). Benzaldehyde desorbed at a similar temperature (133 °C), showing in this case a much stronger signal (blue line). These low desorption temperatures point in the direction of substrate physisorption onto the catalyst surface. In order to understand and quantify the differences in adsorption strengths between the two substrates, DFT calculations were carried out. A benchmarking of common density functionals for the calculations of benzaldehyde and octanal was initially performed due to the difficult description of the interaction of benzaldehyde and octanal with transition metal surfaces (see the Supplementary Material). Briefly, we quantified our DFT calculations using experimental data for (1) the adsorption of linear alkanes on Pd(111) surfaces [39] and (2) the adsorption of benzene on Pd(111) [40]. As shown in Fig. S2, while PBE-D3 performs well for the adsorptions of alkanes on Pd(111), BEEF-vdW severely underestimates their adsorption energies. In contrast, BEEF-vdW performs rather well for benzene adsorption on Pd(111), while PBE-D3 does not. We therefore employ the PBE-D3 and BEEF-vdW functionals for our investigations of the adsorption of octanal and benzaldehyde, respectively. The adsorption energies of octanal (calculated with PBE-D3) and benzaldehyde (calculated with BEEF-vdW) as a function of surface coverage are shown in Fig. 7 a. In both cases, the adsorption energy depends on the coverage. At low coverage (one molecule in a 3 × 7 unit cell of Pd(111), corresponding to a coverage of θ = 0.007 molecules per Å2), octanal is chemisorbed on the palladium surface through an η1–(O) mode, and the aliphatic chain lies down on the surface with an adsorption energy of −138 kJ/mol (see Fig. 7b, structure A). As the coverage increases (one molecule per 3 × 2 and 2 × 2 unit cell), the octanal molecules start to tilt over, reducing the adsorption energy to −97 kJ/mol (see Fig. 7b, structure C). Benzaldehyde adsorbs with the aromatic ring parallel to the Pd(111) surface in an almost flat geometry with an adsorption energy of about −120 kJ/mol at low coverages, θ = 0.007 and 0.009 molecules/Å2 (which correspond to 4 × 5 and 4 × 4 unit cells; see Fig. 7b, structure D). Higher coverages were evaluated with a single molecule in 3 × 2 and 2 × 2 unit cells of the Pd(111) surface, θ = 0.024 and 0.036 molecules/Å2, respectively. At θ = 0.024, the benzaldehyde molecules adsorb through an η2–(O) mode (see Fig. 7b, structure E) with an energy of −66 kJ/mol. A decrease of more than half of the adsorption energy is found at high coverage of benzaldehyde (ca. −54 kJ/mol; see Fig. 7b, structure F). The adsorption energies of octanal are always higher than those for benzaldehyde at any coverage investigated here, confirming the results obtained by TPD. From the theoretical and experimental results, we therefore conclude that both substrates change adsorption mechanisms, depending on the surface coverage. When normalizing the adsorption energies to the number of molecules per surface area of Pd (molecules/Å2), we find that octanal binds more strongly to the Pd surface than benzaldehyde over the range of coverages investigated herein. The results of DFT calculations fit perfectly with TPD and adsorption isotherm results, but the differences in adsorption energy revealed between the two substrates are not enough to justify the complete inactivity of octanal hydrogenation on the Pd/AC catalyst. Octanal, in fact, is completely inactive at any range of concentration, while benzaldehyde can be easily converted. Although the adsorption of the substrate on the catalyst surface is one of the catalytic step of the reaction, it is clear that in this specific instance it is not the ruling factor determining the final catalytic activity. To fully investigate the systems and highlight the possible role of carbonyl electron density, we carried out a set of experiments using slightly different substrates that differ from each other in the electron density of the carbonyl group."
10,Electronic effect,"3.4 Electronic effect Different substrates were tested under the same reaction conditions (50 °C, 2 bar H2, and a substrate-to-metal ratio of 1000:1). First, we employed cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde and 2-octenal (Fig. S3). The former is similar in structure to benzaldehyde but has the aromatic ring fully hydrogenated, eliminating the conjugation between the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. The latter is structurally similar to n-octanal but contains an additional double bond conjugated to the carbonyl bond (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, enal). The catalytic results show no conversion at all when cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde is used, while 100% conversion was obtained with 2-octenal after 2 h (initial activity of 0.31 mol L−1h−1, TOF 1.07 s−1), yielding n-octanal as the only product (therefore only the CC bond was hydrogenated; Fig. 8 ). The CC bond hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored over the CO bond hydrogenation. In both cases, however, the carbonyl group was not affected. Excluding significant differences in adsorption energy between octanal and octenal, the hydrogenation of the double bond rapidly transforms octenal in octanal, which was earlier found inactive under these conditions. The inactivity of cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde further suggests that the presence of a stable π-electron conjugation is a prerequisite for the reduction of the carbonyl group. To confirm the latter statement, cinnamaldehyde was employed, representing a substrate containing a conjugated system with both an aromatic ring and a simple CC bond. The catalytic results (Fig. 9 ) show the formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (CC hydrogenation) as the major product (ca. 80% selectivity) and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (both CC and CO hydrogenation) as the side product (ca. 20% selectivity; combined initial activity 0.07 mol L−1h−1, TOF 0.24 s−1). No hydrodeoxygenation products were detected. It is clear that the hydrogenation of the double bond is favored compared with the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, but the presence of hydrocinnamyl alcohol in the reaction mixture demonstrates that also the carbonyl group can be reduced. Hydrocinnamyl alcohol can be formed following two different pathways that differ greatly from a mechanistic point of view, as presented in Fig. 10 . The first consists of a CO hydrogenation step followed by CC reduction, while the second consists of a first hydrogenation of the CC bond followed by reduction of the carbonyl. In the first pathway, CO hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a conjugated system, while in the other, the carbonyl group is isolated but still in the presence of an aromatic ring that can contribute to an adsorption energy similar to that of benzaldehyde. Since no cinnamyl alcohol production was observed at any point, the small amount of hydrocinnamyl alcohol formed and the fast double-bond hydrogenation suggest that hydrocinnamyl alcohol is formed through the first pathway (1. carbonyl hydrogenation, 2. double bond reduction). This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally using hydrocinnamaldehyde as substrate; in this case, no conversion was observed (Table 2 ). On the other hand, using cinnamyl alcohol as the substrate, full conversion to hydrocinnamyl alcohol was obtained after less than 2 h of reaction, thus confirming that CC bond hydrogenation is very fast. Similar behavior was observed in the case of the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. As expected, in fact, using hydrocinnamyl alcohol as the substrate led to no conversion to phenylpropane, since once again the substrate does not have a stable π-electron system conjugated to the OH group. Based on these results, we demonstrated the role of the aromatic ring in activating the carbonyl group of aldehydes. The addition of a CC conjugation between the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group maintains the ability to activate the aldehyde toward hydrogenation, as confirmed by the small amount of hydrocinnamyl alcohol detected. The rate of CC hydrogenation, however, is much higher than that of the carbonyl reduction on Pd surface, for thermodynamic reasons. A conclusive experiment was carried out using phenylacetaldehyde, where only one carbon atom separates the aromatic ring from the carbonyl bond (Fig. S4). In this case, no conversion was obtained, confirming that the absence of CHO conjugation inhibits CO reduction even in the presence of the aromatic ring."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, we elucidated the factors affecting the hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of various aldehydes on a Pd-based catalyst. Using benzaldehyde and n-octanal, we demonstrated the importance of the side chain in determining the reactivity of the carbonyl group. Although the adsorption mode and strength are affected by the structure of the substrate, these aspects have proven not to be the decisive factors in the conversion of the carbonyl group. This was demonstrated by a combination of adsorption studies (N2 and substrate adsorption, as well as temperature-programmed desorption), theoretical models (DFT studies), and dedicated experiments. Electronic activation of the carbonyl group via strong π-electron conjugation, as found in a benzyl ring, was found to be key in the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols and hydrocarbons, while molecules with no or weak π-electron conjugation (such as alkyl chains or single conjugated CC double bonds) remain inactive under the reaction conditions studied. In addition, we believe that this study can provide useful guidelines for the future synthesis of materials with high activity and selectivity in the framework of hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes. Moreover, a similar approach could be extended to other substrates and reactions, further increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms that govern heterogeneous catalysis."
