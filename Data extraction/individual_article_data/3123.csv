0,Introduction,"The selective oxidative conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the most interesting and important functional group transformational processes in organic synthesis [1,2]. Carbonyl compounds are an important group of molecules, precursors and intermediates for the pharmaceutical and fine-chemical industries. They are particularly useful for the production of flavors, fragrances, biologically active compounds and natural products [3]. Generally, the oxidation of alcohols has been performed using transition metal catalysts based on both non-precious [4–6] and precious metals [7–9]. All these catalytic reagents are neither environmentally friendly nor economical, and make serious toxicity issues including separation difficulties from products. Based on the environmental issues, the toxicity of metal catalysts and as a consequence the high price of platinum group metal catalysts make it desirable to search for more economical and environmentally friendly alternatives. A possible solution to this problem could be the increased utilization of ionic liquids [10–21] (ILs) both as solvents and catalysts. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the metal free oxidation of alcohols has been carried out using ionic liquids and also with organo catalysts [22–25]. Notably, more attention has been given to the reusable ionic compounds as solvents and catalysts in the development of cost-effective protocols [10–21]. There is considerable interest in the use of room temperature ionic liquids as promising substitutes due to their tunable polarity hydrophobicity, thermal stability and low vapor pressure [10–21]. These properties of ILs lead to better solvating ability of various organic, inorganic and polymeric compounds [10–21], leading to better solvents and catalysts for many reactions. Interestingly, many works have been performed on the oxidation of alcohols in the presence of ionic liquids using metal and other co-catalysts with a range of oxidants [26–33]. However, to the best of our knowledge, a few reports [10–13] are available on the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by ionic liquids alone in the absence of metal catalysts. Some of these oxidation processes were carried out using NaClO [10] and hypervalent iodine [11] oxidant. Next, the TEMPO coupled ionic liquids [10,11] were also used as catalysts. Despite notable achievements in the metal catalyzed and also with metal free oxidation of alcohols, the search for facile, cost-effective and environmentally benign procedures that avoid the use of expensive metal catalysts and hazardous stoichiometric agents is of continuing interest and highly desired. Thus, we herein demonstrate the green protocol for the selective oxidation of alcohols using novel amino acid coupled imidazolium ionic liquid (L-AAIL; Fig. 1 ) applying hydrogen peroxide as an ideal oxidant. For convenient and general oxidation processes, the oxidant should be conceptually in rich atom-economy, environmentally benign, readily available and safe to handle as well [34,35]. In this regard, hydrogen peroxide promised to be a useful oxidant with respect to the criteria mentioned above [1–35]. More specifically, hydrogen peroxide produces only water as by-product and is considered a green oxidant. Hence, developments in new catalytic oxidation processes using H2O2 are an important and challenging goal in modern oxidation chemistry [34,35]."

3,Preparation of catalysts (L-AAIL),"2.2 Preparation of catalysts (L-AAIL) A mixture of Boc-aspartic acid (11.0mmol) and triethyl amine (22.0mmol) in DMF was cooled in an ice-bath. The 1-carboxy ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide [Cemim]Br (10.0mmol) was added and agitation continued at ambient temperature for 24h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was extracted with ether and poured to water. The unreacted Boc-aspartic acid was removed by centrifugation. The aqueous layer was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the ionic liquid was dried under vacuum at 70°C for 6h. The Boc-3-(3-(1,2-dicarboxyethylamino)-3-oxopropyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide was deprotected using 50% TFA in dichloromethane (5mL) for 1h at 25°C. After evaporation of the solvent from the mixture, TFA was removed by triturating the residue with 5mL of methanol (saturated with ammonia). The resulting mixture was concentrated using rotary evaporator and the ionic liquid 33-(3-(1,2-dicarboxyethylamino)-3-oxopropyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide (L-AAIL) was dried under vacuum 80°C for 3h. 1 H-NMR (500MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 2.2 (m, 2H), 2.8 (t, 2H), 3.7 (s, 3H), 4.6 (t, 2H), 5. 2 (m, 2H), 6.9 (s, 2H), 7.6–7.8 (d, 1H), 8.2 (d, 1H), 9 (s 1H), 10.1 (s, 2H). 13 C-NMR (125MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 22.16, 23.72, 38.15, 50.05, 66.11, 80.96, 128.21, 128.37, 139.91, 148.90, 149.22 and 155.44. FT-IR (KBr, cm−1): 3427.12, 3294.10, 2926.10, 1735.36, 1477.33, 1225.03 and 624.96. HR-MS (EI): calculated mass (349.03), found (349.43)."
4,Typical oxidation procedure,"2.3 Typical oxidation procedure To a mixture of L-AAIL (0.0025mmol) and benzyl alcohol (2mmol), 30% H2O2 (5mmol) was slowly added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room (25°C) temperature for 30min. After completion of the reaction, ether was added (3×5mL) to separate the product from the catalyst. The organic layer was concentrated and purified by column chromatography (ether: n-Hexane 0.5: 4.5mL) to give the benzaldehyde."
5,Result and discussion,"The explorative experiments have been carried out with benzyl alcohol as the model substrate using hydrogen peroxide at 25°C under solvent free conditions. Obviously, there is no appreciable reaction in absence of catalyst (Table 1 , entry 1). At first we applied the simple ionic liquid, [Cemim]Br and l-aspartic acid and observed slight oxidation of benzyl alcohol producing benzaldehyde (18–35%; Table 1, entries 2 and 3). However conversion and yields could not be improved further with either [Cemim]Br or l-aspartic acid. Next our interest was turned towards the preparation of l-aspartic acid coupled imidazolium ionic liquid for alcohol oxidation. To our delight, the l-aspartic acid coupled imidazolium ionic liquids (L-AAIL; Scheme 1 ) were found to be the active system for the selective oxidative conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Here, benzyl alcohol was completely oxidized to benzaldehyde (96%; Table 1, entry 4). Surprisingly, the oxidation process in organic solvents is not so facile (Table 1, entries 5–8). After inventing the active ionic liquid for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, we started to examine the scope of the developed catalyst for a series of structurally diverse alcohols. As seen from the table, aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic alcohols can be oxidized to carbonyl compounds. The substituted primary benzylic alcohols are selectively oxidized to aldehydes with 88–96% yield (Table 2 , entries 1–6). Similarly, the secondary alcohols have also been converted to ketones with 76–84% yield (Table 2, entries 7–10). After having demonstrated the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols, our interest was focused towards the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols. This is because many oxidation protocols have significantly failed in the oxidation of secondary aliphatic alcohols. However, interestingly, the oxidation process we have developed works well in the oxidation of aliphatic secondary alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds with 85–86% yield (Table 2, entries 11–12). As the last example, the oxidation of heterocyclic alcohols was performed. Notably, these alcohols also underwent oxidation and produced corresponding aldehydes (88–90%; Table 2, entries 13–14). Apparently, the green oxidation methodology developed worked well for the selective conversion of structurally diverse aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds. Further, the chemoselectivity of the alcohol oxidation has been performed using benzyl alcohol and 1-octanol. The mixture of benzyl alcohol and 1-octanol in equal amounts (2mmol) was subjected to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide with L-AAIL under optimized conditions. Interestingly, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol proceeds predominantly over the oxidation of 1-octanol producing 80% of benzaldehyde and 20% of octanal (Scheme 1). The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in presence of 1-octanol may be due to the fact that α-CH in benzyl alcohol is more active than that of 1-octanol. This study clearly reveals that the protocol can be applied for the chemo-selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols in presence of aliphatic alcohols. In a final set of experiments, we performed the stability and recycling of L-AAIL under the optimized conditions. Indeed, the L-AAIL was successfully recycled and reused 7 times without any significant loss of catalytic activity. These results are presented in Fig. 2 ."
6,Conclusion,"In concussion, we have developed an efficient and green oxidation process for the selective conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds. The l-amino acid coupled imidazolium based new ionic liquid is introduced and its catalytic function was invented for the oxidation of alcohols for the first time. More interestingly, the protocol developed works well for the oxidation of aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic alcohols."
