0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide emissions owing to extensive use of fossil fuels make our planet face the problem of global warming. In response to this crisis, finding carbon-free or carbon-neutral alternative energy sources have become a pressing need in most nations’ agenda (Azbar et al., 2009). Hydrogen (H2) is the only carbon-free fuel and has been recognized as the ideal choice as it has the highest energy density among the known gaseous fuels and water is the only combustion product, eliminating greenhouse gas emission, acid rain formation and ozone depletion (Dursun and Tepe, 2005). H2 production is one of the key technical issues in the wide use of hydrogen. Traditional methods for H2 production such as electrolysis of water, coal gasification and steam reforming of hydrocarbons are usually energy intensive and environmentally unfriendly (Zabut et al., 2006). Therefore, the sustainable energy development urgently demands an energy-saving and clean H2 production technology. Biological H2 production technology is one of the ideal solutions to this problem for operating at ambient temperature and pressure, which can lower the energy consumption, capital cost and pollutant discharge (Hafez et al., 2009; Meher and Das, 2008). Bio-H2 production technologies can be divided into many types in terms of their biological processes. Among them, photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris are the most promising microbial system due to its high conversion yield of substrate, ability to absorb wide spectrum of light and lack of Photosystem II which automatically eliminates the difficulties associated with O2 inhibition to H2 production (Jamil et al., 2009). Moreover, PSB can utilize waste organic substrates as sole carbon sources (electron donors) for high purity H2 production, thus, it can give the functions of both the organic wastes treatment and clean fuel production (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Kovács et al., 2006). Bioreactor is the key component in the bio-H2 production system. According to the cell status in reactors, bioreactors basically can fall into two types: suspended-cell bioreactors and immobilized-cell bioreactors. Compared with suspended-cell systems, the immobilized-cell system using physical or biological immobilization approaches can effectively enhance biomass retention to overcome cells washout, significantly improving its stability and reusability (Jo et al., 2008; Roeselers et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2002). Among these immobilized-cell techniques, the cell entrapment in porous gels is one of the promising techniques for bio-H2 production due to being inexpensive and easy to handle (Wu et al., 2006). This gel entrapment allows H2-producing bacteria in the reactors to be enriched, and creates a local anaerobic environment that is well suitable for oxygen-sensitively fermentative H2 production (Gavala et al., 2006). Besides, since it can be continuously and stably operated at a low hydraulic retention time, H2 production rate can be improved by elevating organic loading rates. This immobilized photosynthetic H2-producing system had successfully been utilized in experiments (Chen et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2009). Performance of the immobilized-cell bioreactor for H2 production is affected by multi operation parameters. Organic substrate is one of the important factors. It provides reductant for H2 evolution by photo-fermentation, that is, H2 production by PSB requires electron donor from organic substrate to develop the photochemical reactions (Gfeller and Gibbs, 1984; Melnicki et al., 2008). Some researchers had investigated the effects of type and concentration of substrate on H2 evolution by PSB (Keskin et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Laurinavichene et al., 2010). The efficiency of substrate conversion to H2 can be reflected by hydrogen yield, which varies among different PSB species, or even among different strains of the same species due to the change of the metabolic pathways in accordance with the conditions of nutrients, culture pH or concentrations of metabolites (Tao et al., 2008). Furthermore, light absorption by the photosynthetic apparatus is essential for H2 generation since the photosynthesis pigment molecules do show different utilization efficiencies for the different wavelength lights (Argun and Kargi, 2010). Therefore, it is necessary to use suitable light sources that provide sufficient light energy with needed wavelengths for a H2-producing photobioreactor. Currently, researchers have paid more attention to the light conversion efficiency during H2 production. The largest light conversion efficiency (LCE) of Rhodobacter existing in low light intensity and low nitrogen environment with a pH of 6.7–7.5 was obtained (Lee et al., 2007), and the LCE decreased at a high light intensity (Wakayama and Miyake, 2002). Theoretically, part of the produced H2 energy should derived from the consumed substrate. Thus, the chemical energy in the consumed substrate also needs to be considered to evaluate the efficiency of total energy recovery in the H2 production process. However, research on this work hasn’t almost been done. In the present work, a photobioreactor, packed with entrapped-PSB gel granules for H2 production, was operated in a continuous mode. The strain used in this research was isolated from urban sewage sludge and identified as R. palustris. Monochromatic LED lights were chosen as external light source in the present study. The present work mainly focused on the effects of hydraulic retention time, organic loading rate, light wavelength and illumination intensity on H2 production behaviors and energy conversion efficiencies of R. palustris CQK 01 in an immobilized-cell bioreactor."
1,Methods,
2,Microorganism,"2.1 Microorganism This H2-producing PSB strain was isolated from the urban sewage sludge of Chongqing City (China) and enriched with synthetic medium using glucose as sole carbon source in an anaerobic serum bottle at 30°C, under an illumination intensity of 3000lux from a tungsten filament lamp. After enrichment cultures for 4 times, the inoculum of the culture was spread on agar solid plates by using inoculating needle and incubated for about 72h at 3000lux illumination intensity. The single colony growing fast was then selected and re-streaked 3 times to purify the objective strain. Next, the PCR amplification of 16S rDNA gene of the pure culture was processed using a pair of bacterial universal primers (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTC-3′, 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). The amplified 16S rDNA genes were then cloned with a T-vector and sequenced. According to the taxonomy from the Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (the 8th edition) and comparison with the corresponding standard strain’s 16s rDNA gene sequence in NCBI (The National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA), the obtained strain was identified as R. palustris and named as R. palustris CQK 01. For preculture, the pure culture was inoculated in 100mL synthetic medium containing (g/L): K2HPO4·3H2O, 1.006; KH2PO4, 0.554; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.20; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.042; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0010; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.0010; NaCl, 0.20; CaCl2, 0.010; CO(NH2)2, 1.35; C6H12O6·H2O, 4.024. Moreover, 1.0g yeast extract and 1mL growth factors solution (biotin, 1.0g/L; pyridoxine hydrochloride, 1.0g/L; riboflavin, 1.0g/L; thiamine hydrochloride, 1.0g/L; nicotinic acid, 1.0g/L) were added to 1L synthetic medium to improve growth conditions. The initial pH value of the culture medium was adjusted to 7.0 by 0.1mol/L NaOH solution before autoclave sterilization. Hundred milliliters inoculated medium was grown anaerobically at 28°C for 72h with 3000lux illumination intensity from a tungsten filament lamp. Argon gas was introduced to create anaerobic conditions before cultivation."
3,Amplification and entrapment of PSB cells,"2.2 Amplification and entrapment of PSB cells Thirty milliliters inoculum from the 72-h preculture was added to 3L synthetic culture medium containing 8.04g glucose/L and the culture was one-sidedly illuminated by LED lamps (red light) with an illumination intensity of approximate 5000lux. Argon was used to create an anaerobic environment. After 62h (exponential phase) of inoculation, precipitate from the culture was first removed by centrifugation at 2250 g for 5min, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20300 g for 10min, washed twice with deionized water, then, suspended in 50mL of 0.1mmol/L phosphate buffer and used as inoculum for the preparation of entrapped-cell granules. The entrapped-cell matrix components consisted of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, with 1750±50° of polymerization), sodium alginate and carrageenan powder. These entrapped-cell particles were prepared as description in the reference (Wang et al., 2010)."
4,Operation of a packed-bed bioreactor for H2 photo-production,"2.3 Operation of a packed-bed bioreactor for H2 photo-production Continuous bio-H2 production by a photobioreactor filled with entrapped-cell particles was performed in an anaerobic mode. The flat panel photobioreactor (100×40×200mm) with a working volume of 800mL was made of transparent polymethylmethacrylate (5mm thickness). The front surface of the bioreactor was exposed to incident light, while other walls were covered by polyurethane foam for thermal insulation. External illumination with a radiation area of 200mm2 was, respectively provided by four sets of LED lamps with main wavelengths of 630, 590, 520 and 470nm and the illumination intensity was adjusted from 2000 to 8000lux by adjusting the distance between the LED lamps and the bioreactor. Prior to the experiment, the test system was sterilized by autoclave except the photobioreactor body which was sterilized by formalin vapor, and the interior of the test system was cleaned 3 times by sterile water. Synthetic medium solution in a fluid reservoir, containing glucose as the sole carbon source and the other components that were the same as those described in Section 2.1, was introduced into the packed-bed reactor from the bioreactor bottom by a peristaltic pump through a silicone tube. The calibration of flow rate of culture medium against the rotate speed of peristaltic pump was conducted prior to experiment. The produced biogas and effluent were discharged from the top of the bioreactor and introduced by a glass pipe to a gas–liquid separator, then, the separated biogas was collected in a glass bottle by drainage method for H2 measurement. Two heaters were arranged at the bottom of the bioreactor to maintain the designated temperature of the glucose solution at the inlet where a T-type thermocouple was distributed to detect the solution temperature. The operation of the entrapped-cell bioreactor experienced two stages: startup and stable run. During the startup stage, the bioreactor was operated in a batch mode for more than 3days to activate the entrapped PSB and enhance H2 producing activity, and the photobioreactor was illuminated at 630nm and 3000lux using LED lamps. Then, come into the stable run stage. In this stage, the entrapped-cell photobioreactor was conducted under different operating variables in a continuous flow mode. The performances of the photobioreactor were assessed mainly by the hydrogen production rate, substrate consumption rate, H2 bioconversion yield to glucose, apparent percent conversion efficiency of illumination light energy, as well as total energy efficiency."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen content in the collected biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography (SC-2000, China) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless steel column packed with porous polymer pellets of TDX. Argon was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 25mL/min and the temperatures of the oven and TCD were maintained at 55 and 100°C, respectively. The electric current of the TCD was 70mA. The pH of culture medium was adjusted using a pH meter (Ecoscan pH 6, Singapore). The incident light wavelength was determined by a spectrometer (USB 2000, USA) and the illumination intensity by a digital luxmeter (ST-85, China), and the corresponding irradiation intensity of illumination light was detected by a digital irradiation meter (FZ-A, China). The concentration of glucose was determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. The substrate consumption rate (SCR) refers to the amount of glucose consumption per unit time (h) and per unit volume of bioreactor (L), and is shown as Substrate consumption rate(SCR) = amount of glucose consumed(mmol) H 2 evolution time(h) × bioreactor volume(L) The hydrogen production rate (HPR) is defined as the amount of H2 produced per unit time (h) and per unit volume of bioreactor (L), giving H2 generation capacity and economic efficiency of the entrapped-cell bioreactor. It is calculated by Hydrogen production rate(HPR) = amount of H 2 produced(mmol) H 2 evolution time(h) × bioreactor volume(L) H2 bioconversion yield (YH) to substrate is given by the ratio of the moles of H2 that have been produced to the moles of glucose that have been consumed. H2 bioconversion yield shows the technical efficiency of the photo-bioreactor for converting the hydrogen element in glucose to H2 and is presented as H 2 bioconversion yield(Y H ) = amount of actual H 2 produced(mmol) amount of substrate consumed(mmol) = HPR SCR The efficiency of energy recovery reflects the energy accumulation for H2 production by the entrapped-cell photobioreactor. It can be explained by apparent light conversion efficiency (LCE) and total energy efficiency (TEE). Apparent light conversion efficiency is defined as the percent ratio of the total combustion enthalpy from H2 produced by the photobioreactor per unit time to the input light energy at the same time (Natha and Das, 2009), which reflects the energy accumulation from illumination light, and can be calculated by Light conversion efficiency(LCE) = H 2 combustion enthalpy(J/mmol) × H 2 production rate(mmol/h/L) × bioreactor volume(L) input light energy of the photobioreactor per unit time(J/h) × 100 % = Δ H H 0 × HPR × V I · A · t × 100 % where Δ H H 0 is the standard combustion enthalpy of H2 (−286.0J/mmol), I is the irradiation intensity of illumination light (W/m2), and V means the volume of the bioreactor and A refers the irradiated area of the bioreactor in m2, t indicates the duration time of H2 production (hour), here, it is 1h. On the other hand, the total energy efficiency is defined as the percent ratio of hydrogen energy evolved to the sum of input energy involved in illumination light and consumed substrate. It demonstrates the energy recovery in the process of H2 bioconversion and is described as: Total energy efficiency(TEE) = H 2 combustion enthalpy(J/mmol) × H 2 production rate(mmol/h/L) × bioreactor volume(L) the total energy of illumination light and consumed substrate per unit time(J/h) × 100 % = Δ H H 0 × HPR × V I · A · t + Δ H G 0 × SCR × V × 100 % where Δ H G 0 means the standard combustion enthalpy of glucose (−2803.0J/mmol)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of hydraulic retention time of influent medium,"3.1 Effect of hydraulic retention time of influent medium In the present experiment, the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the influent medium on H2 production and substrate consumption was investigated with two different glucose loading rates (2.8, 3.5mmol/h). The illumination wavelength was 630nm and the illumination intensity was set at 5000lux, the temperature and pH of the influent medium were maintained at 30°C and 7, respectively. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 1 . It is seen that SCR and HPR decreased with an increase in HRT at a fixed organic loading rate (Fig. 1a and b). At 3.5mmol/L glucose loading rate, the SCR obviously reduced from 4.35 to 1.62mmol/L/h with the increase in HRT. The HPR slowly reduced from 1.36 to 1.34mmol/L/h with the increase of HRT to 11.4h, then significantly decreased to 0.93mmol/L/h with the further increase of HRT to 26.7h. While at 2.8mmol/h organic loading rate, both of the SCR and the HPR slightly dropped as the HRT increased to 11.4h, respectively, then obviously dropped with the further increase of HRT. The SCR and the HPR were 1.90mmol/L/h and 1.03mmol/L/h at the HRT of 11.4h, respectively. The drops in SCR and HPR can be attributed to a decreasing supply of organic substrate with the increasing HRT. Obviously, it can be considered that there exists a critical HRT value of 11.4h affecting the SCR and HPR. In this work, the variations of H2 yield, light conversion efficiency and total energy efficiency with HRT were investigated. From Fig. 1c, it is seen that YH gradually ascended with the increase in HRT at a fixed glucose loading. For instance, the YH increased from 0.31 to 0.57mol H2/(mol glucose) across the entire HRT range at 3.5mmol/h influent glucose loading rate, and at 2.8mmol/h it slowly ascended to 0.61mol H2/(mol glucose) with the increasing HRT to 16.0h, then, remained about 0.61mol H2/(mol glucose) with the HRT to 26.7h. The rising YH with the increasing HRT reveals that the efficiency of glucose conversion to H2 by PSB was improved due to the prolonged time for mass transfer and biochemical reaction in the entrapped-cell bioreactor. Conversely, the corresponding HPR always descended with the increase in HRT at a fixed influent glucose loading rate. As to energy recovery, it is found that the LCEs slowly decreased with a rise in HRT to 11.4h, and then obviously decreased with the further rise in HRT of the influent medium to 26.7h in the two runs (Fig. 1d). In detail, the LCEs gradually descended to 11.4% and 14.8% with the rise in HRT to 11.4h at 2.8, 3.5mmol/h glucose loading rate, respectively, then, significantly decreased to 5.8% and 10.4 % with further rise in HRT to 26.7h. The change of LCE via the increasing HRT can be ascribed to a drop in H2 production due to lack of organic substrate. With the rise in HRT, however, the change of the TEE at 3.5mmol/h was different from that at 2.8mmol/h (Fig. 1e). The TEE initially ascended from 2.2% to 2.9% with the increase in HRT to 11.4h at 3.5mmol/h and then slowly ascended to 3.2% with the further increase in HRT to 26.7h, while the TEE always descended with the increase in HRT at 2.8mmol/h. Obviously, the increase of TEE with the rising HRT at 3.5mmol/h shows that more hydrogen in the consumed substrate was converted to molecular hydrogen due to adequate glucose supply and the prolonged biochemical reaction time, while the decrease in TEE with the rise in HRT at 2.8mmol/h can mainly be ascribed to lack of glucose. The results shows that it needs to simultaneously enhance the conversion efficiencies of light energy and chemical energy in substrate for commercial H2 production."
8,Effect of organic loading rate of influent medium,"3.2 Effect of organic loading rate of influent medium Substrate loading rate is often a critical parameter affecting H2 production efficiency (Gavala et al., 2006). In the present experiment, two sets of experiments with illumination wavelengths of 520 and 630nm were, respectively, conducted to investigate effect of influent glucose loading rate on bioconversion during H2 production, where the illumination intensity was fixed at 5000lux. The HRT and temperature of influent medium were maintained at 11.4h and 30°C, respectively. The initial pH value of influent solution was adjusted to 7.0. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . As depicted in Fig. 2a, substrate consumptions were initially improved with an increase in influent glucose loading rate to 4.2mmol/h, then compressed with the further increase in glucose loading rate in the two experiments. The maximal SCRs, 3.97 and 4.15mmol/L/h, were observed at 520 and 630nm, respectively. Fig. 2b shows that HPRs first rose and then, dropped with the ascending glucose loading rate. The HPR obviously rose to 1.36mmol/L/h as the influent glucose loading rate increased to 4.2mmol/h at 630nm, then, dropped to 0.97mmol/L/h with the ascending glucose loading rate to 4.9mmol/h. For at 520nm, the HPR increased to 0.63mmol/L/h with the increase in glucose loading rate to 2.8mmol/h, then slowly dropped with the further increase in glucose loading rate. The changes of SCR and HPR with the rising influent glucose loading rate indicate that adequate glucose supply can improve the abilities of H2 production by PSB, while excessive supply of glucose will cause an inhibition to H2 production and substrate consumption. As shown in Fig. 2c, YHs always descended with an increase in the influent glucose loading rate in the two runs, that is, a low influent glucose loading rate could result in a high YH. For example, the YH of 0.74mmol H2/(mmol glucose) was gained at 2.1mmol/h influent glucose loading rate for 630nm illumination wavelength, then, dropped to 0.33mmol H2/(mmol glucose) with the increase in glucose loading rate to 4.9mmol/h. This drop of YH can be mainly attributed to that more intermediates were produced with an increase in influent glucose loading rate during H2 production, although the HPR could be improved. As shown in Fig. 2d, LCE first ascended, then, descended with an increase in influent glucose loading rate at an illumination wavelength. The relatively higher LCEs, 19.0% and 15.1%, were observed in the two experiments, respectively. It indicates that PSB cells entrapped in granules could utilize more available substrate to produce abundant ATP through glycolysis with an initial increase in the influent substrate loading rate, and converted intracellular superfluous energy to H2 energy. This result is consistent with the results of these references (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Melis, 2007). However, the decreased LCE can be attributed to the fact that a further increase in influent substrate loading rate resulted in deteriorated H2 production due to acid-metabolites accumulation (Wakayama and Miyake, 2002; Gavala et al., 2006). TEEs always descended with the increasing influent glucose loading rate at 520 and 630nm (Fig. 2e). That is, the TEE reduced from 2.0% to 1.2%, from 3.1% to 2.3% with the increase in glucose loading rate to 4.2mmol/h for 520nm and 630nm, respectively, then slightly reduced to 1.0% and 2.1% with the further increase in glucose loading rate to 4.9mmol/h. In addition, the change of the TEE was almost similar to that of the corresponding YH with a variation of glucose loading rate. The result reveals that more chemical energy in the consumed substrate was transferred into acid-intermediate products rather than H2 with the increase of influent glucose loading rate due to the limited metabolic ability of PSB immobilized in these granules. Meanwhile, the change of HPR was contrary to those of YH and TEE, which indicates that it is urgent for commercial promise of H2 energy to improve the conversion efficiencies of energy and substrate during bio-H2 production."
9,Effect of illumination wavelength,"3.3 Effect of illumination wavelength Studies have showed that PSB can preferably absorb light energy within certain wavelength ranges (Chen et al., 2007; Uyar et al., 2007). Although the absorption maxima at some wavelengths such as 379, 590, 806 and 863nm are proved (Uyar et al., 2007), little work was done on effect of illumination wavelength on bioconversion efficiencies during H2 production by PSB. In the present work, monochromatic LED lights with the main wavelengths of 470, 520, 590 and 630nm were chosen as external light source to obtain the better insight of effect of illumination wavelength on H2 production. Where two sets of experiments were conducted at two illumination intensities of 4000, 5000lux with an influent glucose loading rate of 4.2mmol/h, a HRT of influent medium of 11.4h, an influent medium temperature of 30°C and a pH of 7. Fig. 3 a shows that the SCRs at 520 and 630nm were higher than those at 470 and 590nm under the same illumination intensity of incident light. The maximal SCR of 4.41mmol/L/h was observed at 630nm and 5000lux in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 3b, HPR first ascended with an increase in light wavelength to 590nm, then, descended with further increase in light wavelength to 630nm at an light intensity. Specifically, the HPR ascended from 0.24 to 1.58mmol/L/h with the increase in illumination wavelength from 470 to 590nm at 5000lux, then descended to 1.30mmol/L/h with further increase in illumination wavelength to 630nm. The maximal HPR of 1.58mmol/L/h was achieved at 590nm. The results indicate that the incident light with wavelength of 590nm facilitated H2 production due to the existing absorption maxima of bacteriochlorophyll a of PSB (Uyar et al., 2007), while the incident light at 630nm with the same illumination intensity could inhibit H2 production due to a great light energy stress on the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll a (Chen et al., 2007). YHs almost demonstrated the same change with HPRs as a function of light wavelength in the two runs (Fig. 3c). An increase in the illumination wavelength from 470 to 590nm led to a gradual increase in YH due to the improvement of H2 production, then, YH dropped with the light wavelength to 630nm. The maximal YH, 0.46mmol/mmol, was obtained at 590nm and 5000lux. It reveals that the absorption of PSB to light at 590nm facilitated the synthesis of the bacteriochlorophyll a, as well as H2 production. The subsequent drop of YH at 630nm may be mainly ascribed to production of more intermediates. Therefore, it can be inferred that the different metabolic pathways of glucose for PSB were pursued under different illumination lights. Fig. 3d and e illustrate effect of illumination wavelength on LCE and TEE for H2 production by the entrapped-cell photobioreactor. LCE and TEE, respectively increased with the increase of incident light wavelength from 470 to 590nm, then, significantly dropped with the illumination wavelength to 630nm at an light intensity. It is seen that the maximal LCE and TEE, 61.6% and 3.4%, were obtained at a wavelength of 590nm, while the lowest LCE and TEE were observed at 470nm. Therefore, an illumination by incident light of 590nm resulted in the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSB in the experiment. Thus, it can be inferred that more ATP can be synthesized at 590nm and the PSB cells immobilized in particles mainly engage in the metabolism of energy storage for H2 production under these optimal conditions."
10,Effect of illumination intensity,"3.4 Effect of illumination intensity In the present work, effect of light intensity on the performance of bio-H2 production was investigated in two runs (4.2 and 4.9mmol/h influent glucose loading rate), where the illumination wavelength was fixed at 590nm, the pH and temperature of influent medium were 30°C and 7, respectively. Light intensity of the LED lamps was changed between 3000 and 8000lux by adjusting the distance between the light source and the front surface of the photo-bioreactor. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the increased illumination intensity resulted in an initial increase and a subsequent drop in SCR at a fixed influent glucose loading rate. Correspondingly, HPR initially ascended with the increase of the illumination intensity to 6000lux, then decreased with the further increase in the illumination intensity to 8000lux (Fig. 4b). The peaks of SCRs, 4.19 and 4.56mmol/L/h, were respectively observed at 6000lux for 4.2mmol/L/h glucose loading rate and at 5000lux for 4.9mmol/h influent glucose loading rate, while the maximal HPRs, 2.38 and 2.61mmol/L/h, were respectively achieved at 6000lux in the two runs. The results indicate that the performance of H2 production could be significantly improved with the increasing illumination intensity, while it could be inhibited at an excessive light intensity. Effects of illumination intensity on YH, LCE and TEE are, respectively shown in Fig. 4c–e. It is found that YH, LCE and TEE initially ascended with the increase in illumination intensity at a fixed influent glucose laoding rate, then, obviously descended with the further increase in illumination intensity to 8000lux. For example, the YH, LCE and TEE, respectively, increased from 0.33 to 0.62mmol H2/(mmol glucose), from 58.0% to 82.3% and from 2.4% to 4.8% as the illumination intensity rose from 3000 to 6000lux at 4.2mmol/h influent glucose loading rate, then decreased to 0.54mmol H2/(mmol glucose), to 38.3% and to 4.1% with the further increase in illumination intensity to 8000lux. The maximal LCE of 82.3% in the study was gained at 6000lux illumination intensity and 4.2mmol/h influent glucose loading rate, while the corresponding TEE was only 4.8%. Thereby, the light saturation level for H2 production can be considered as about 6000lux. Here, the initial increases in HPR, YH, LCE and TEE can be attributed to the fact that the increasing illumination intensity provided sufficient light energy for the endergonic transport of these electrons to the chlorophyl ferredoxin (Melis, 2007), as a consequence, the light-dependent H2 evolution was promoted and the maximal bioconversion efficiencies of light energy and glucose were achieved at the light saturation level of 6000lux. However, the light inhibition to primary photo-reaction of PSB cells might occur at the light intensity above 6000lux. Thus, the subsequent decrease in HPR, YH, LCE and TEE with the further increase of illumination intensity can be ascribed to the fact that the excessive supply of light energy compressed the activity of light reaction center for PSB cells and interrupted electron transport to the chlorophyl ferredoxin. In addition, the TEE was far lower than the LCE under the same illumination intensity conditions. For instance, the maximal LCE in this study was 82.4% at 590nm and 6000lux, while the corresponding TEE was only 4.8%. The losses of energy and cost during H2 production by photofermentation can be mainly attributed to the intermediates production. Furthermore, the HPR significantly increased with the increase of illumination intensity till the light saturation, while the corresponding LCE increased slightly. The loss of illumination energy ascended with the increase in light intensity due to light transmission and scattering. Also, it can be inferred that H2 energy produced should not only be derived from light energy, but also from the substrate."
11,Evaluation of the proposed entrapped-cell photobioreactor system,"3.5 Evaluation of the proposed entrapped-cell photobioreactor system In this work, multi indexes were introduced to evaluate the characteristics of conversion of substrate and light during photo-H2 fermentation by the immobilized PSB in a continuous mode. The maximal LCE of 82.3% was achieved in the present work, which was higher than that reported in references (Laurinavichene et al., 2010; Melis, 2007; Uyar et al., 2007). This indicates that the entrapped-cell system was of higher light energy recovery capacity to the special monochromatic light. It can be attributed to the fact that the significant energy loss due to the inactive absorption to some wavelength lights, such as short-wavelength lights, was avoided, and light energy loss due to radiation energy converting to heat was decreased. Furthermore, the maximal H2 bioconversion yield, 0.74mmol H2/(mmol glucose), was observed at a low influent substrate loading in this paper, which was lower than those in references (Chen et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010; Abo-Hashesh et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2002). Actually, the highest H2 yield up to 2.86mmol H2/(mmol glucose) (the data not shown in the text), had been observed at a low influent glucose loading of 2.1mmol/h and illumination light (590nm and 8000lux), while the corresponding substrate utilization efficiency was only 15.3%. Most importantly, the H2 yield always decreased with the increase in the influent substrate loading due to more intermediates formation. The results demonstrate that H2 bioconversion yield is greatly influenced by the operation conditions, and the entrapped-PSB photobioreactor system needs to be further improved to increase the conversion efficiency of substrate and to decrease the cost of commercial H2 production. Meanwhile, it is inevitable to develop a comprehensive evaluation method for the performance of H2 production system."
12,Conclusions,The behaviors of hydrogen production and conversion characteristics of substrate and energy during continuous photo-H2 production were investigated in a photo-bioreactor entrapped R. palustris CQK 01. The results indicate that the performance of H2 production by the photo-bioreactor system was interactively influenced by multi-factors. The PSB cells immobilized in particles at 590nm could mainly engage in the metabolism of energy storage for H2 production due to more ATP synthesized in primary reaction center. The TEE was far lower than the LCE at the same operational variables due to the intermediates production.
