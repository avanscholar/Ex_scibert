0,Introduction,"In recent years, the solar photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting over semiconductor photocatalysts has become a promising way to resolve the energy crisis and environmental pollution issues [1–5]. The charge separation efficiency and surface water reduction reaction kinetics are considered to be two key factors affecting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity [6,7]. Incorporating a proper co-catalyst into the semiconductor photocatalytic system, which not only form a Schottky barrier at the interface of semiconductor photocatalysts and co-catalysts to generate a built-in electric field for the directional separation of photo-generated carriers, but also acts as the active sites for the surface water reduction reactions, is very helpful to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance [8,9]. Until now, Platinum (Pt) have been considered as the most advanced co-catalyst for photocatalytic or electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which can be due to its best function in achieving rapid charge separation and accelerating surface water reduction kinetics [10–12]. However, the application of Pt is greatly limited by its high price. Thus, it is particularly important to develop the cost-effective Pt-alternative co-catalysts. Over the past decade, transition metal phosphides (TMP) such as Ni2P [13,14], CoP [7,15], and FeP [16] have been proved to be potential candidates for electrocatalytic or photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their outstanding advantages such as good electronic conductivity, accelerated electrons transport rate, and low cost. Among them, CoP has been considered as one of the most effective TMP co-catalysts. However, the surface water reduction reactions kinetics of CoP co-catalyst photocatalytic system are still inhibited and hardly reach the hydrogen evolution activity levels of Pt co-catalyst photocatalytic system. In electrocatalysis, the fast surface water reduction reaction kinetics requires a fast water dissociation capacity and an appropriate hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH* ≈ 0 eV) [17,18]. Obviously, except for Pt-group precious metals, it is difficult for a single catalyst to have these excellent properties at the same time. The water dissociation capacity of CoP is not very good, and CoP has a hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy favorable for H2 release but unfavorable for hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH* of CoP is about +0.08 eV ~ +0.5 eV according to the literature), which greatly limits its catalytic activity. [19,20]. To address this problem, incorporating a small amount of Pt-group noble metals with fast water dissociation and good hydrogen adsorption capacity into the CoP systems is expected to be an effective way to modulate the surface water reduction kinetics. Recently, ruthenium (Ru) has been proved to be a promising alternative to Pt for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), because it has similar hydrogen evolution catalytic performance as Pt, and it is also the cheapest among Pt-group noble metals (only 4% of Pt). For example, Mahmood et al. prepared a Ru@C2N electrocatalyst, which has better HER activity than Pt/C catalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions [21]. Ru has such excellent HER catalytic performance, which can be attributed to the good water dissociation capacity and strong hydrogen adsorption capacity [22,23]. Considering the above benefits of Ru and CoP, we envision that the synergistic interaction between Ru and CoP is expected to balance the hydrogen adsorption process and H2 release process. Thus, construction of Ru-modulated CoP binary co-catalyst will not only have the advantages of low cost and fast charge transfer, but also have the merits of fast water dissociation and favorable hydrogen adsorption and H2 release capacities for the accelerating surface water reduction kinetics. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of Ru-modulated CoP acts as a co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It is well known that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely reported as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution owing to its suitable bandgap, few pollution, and low cost [24]. Moreover, its Fermi level are significantly higher than that of most metals, which facilitates the Schottky contact [7,25]. Especially for two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, which not only reduce the diffusion distance of photo-generated carriers to prevent the rapid recombination, but also provide a large surface area to support the co-catalysts, have attracted much extensive attention [26,27]. Furthermore, compared with other structures, 2D/2D structure expands the Schottky junction at the interface, and provides a shorter migration distance to the reaction interface for photo-generated carriers [28–30]. On the basis of the above considerations, we envision that the integration of 2D Ru-modulated CoP nanosheets binary co-catalyst with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets will effectively promote charge separation and accelerate the surface hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics, thus achieving a high hydrogen evolution performance. In this work, we constructed a 2D/2D Ru-modulated CoP nanosheets/g-C3N4 nanosheets ternary hybrid photocatalyst (Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs, where x refers the Ru-to-Co molar ratio) for hydrogen evolution under visible light. The optimal 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs photocatalyst exhibits an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1172.5 µmol g−1 h−1 under visible light with a high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3.49% at 420 nm, which is close to Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system and higher than most reported transition metal phosphides (TMP)/g-C3N4 photocatalytic systems (Table S1). The higher photocatalytic performance not only due to efficient separation of photo-generated carriers, superior electrons transport properties, and promoted surface water reduction kinetics of binary co-catalyst, but also owing to the 2D/2D assembly structure which provides short charge transport distance and strong interface Schottky effect. This study provides a new way to develop cost-effective Pt-alternative co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by incorporating a small amount of ruthenium into the transition metal phosphides."

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Deionized water (DI water) was used throughout the experiments."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of bulk g-C3N4 (bulk GCN) and g-C3N4 nanosheets (GCN NSs) The bulk GCN was prepared by thermal polycondensation of melamine as previously reported [31]. Typically, 5 g of melamine was placed into a crucible with a cover and heated to 520 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, then to 550 °C for another 2 h at the same heating rate. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the yellow product was collected and ground into powder. The GCN NSs was prepared by the further thermal treatment of bulk GCN. 0.7 g of bulk GCN was uniformly spread into the porcelain boat (60 mm × 30 mm × 20 mm) to make sure a good contact between bulk GCN and air, then heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 4.5 h in an open system. After naturally cooling down, the white GCN NSs powder was obtained. 2.2.2 Preparation of ruthenium-modulated cobalt (Ru-Co-x), ruthenium-modulated cobalt phosphide (Ru-CoP-x), cobalt phosphide (CoP), ruthenium (Ru), and ruthenium after phosphating treatment (Ru-P). The Ru-Co-x were synthesized according to the wet chemical reduction of metal cations. Taking the synthesis of Ru-Co-1:8 as an example, 26 mg of RuCl3·xH2O and 249.1 mg of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O were suspended in 50 mL of DI water, and the solution was magnetically stirred at 120 °C for 10 min. Then the NaBH4 solution (30 mL, 10 mg mL−1) was slowly added under stirring. After the reaction for 30 min, the mixture was cooled down to 25 °C, centrifuged, and rinsed several times with DI water. The as-obtained powders were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h. Similarly, Ru-Co-1:4 and Ru-Co-1:16 were synthesized according to the same procedure as mentioned above, but different masses of RuCl3·xH2O were used. Subsequently, the Ru-CoP-x nanosheets were synthesized by a low-temperature phosphating process with NaH2PO2·H2O as the source of phosphorus. Typically, 20 mg of as-prepared Ru-Co-x and 100 mg of NaH2PO2·H2O were grinded fully and loaded in a ceramic boat. Then, the boat was put into a tube furnace and purified with a high-purity N2 (99.999%) for 1 h to remove air. Subsequently, the tube furnace was heated to 350 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 2 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooling down naturally to room temperature, the black product was rinsed several times with DI water to remove phosphate, and centrifuged with absolute alcohol at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Then it was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight to obtain Ru-CoP-x. Similarly, CoP was prepared according to the same procedure as mentioned above, but no RuCl3·xH2O was used; Ru-P was synthesized in the absence of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O; and Ru was synthesized in the absence of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and without the subsequent phosphating process. 2.2.3 Preparation of Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs, CoP/GCN NSs, Ru/GCN NSs, and Ru-Co-x/GCN NSs composites The Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs composites were synthesized via a self-assembly method. Different mass ratios of as-prepared Ru-CoP-x (15, 25, 35 wt% of the total mass of composites) and GCN NSs was mixed with 50 mL of DI water, then ultrasonicated for 1 h to form a homogeneous suspension. After that, the mixture was magnetic stirred for 5 h to self-assemble. Then, the product was centrifuged, washed several times with DI water and absolute alcohol, and finally dried at 60 °C overnight. The obtained solid were abbreviated as 15% Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs, 25% Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs and 35% Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs, respectively. Similarly, the CoP/GCN NSs, Ru/GCN NSs, and Ru-Co-x/GCN NSs composites were synthesized according to the same procedure but Ru-CoP-x was replaced by CoP, Ru and Ru-Co-x, respectively. 2.2.4 Preparation of Ru-CoP-x-GCN NSs composite To investigate the interface Schottky effect between Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs, the Ru-CoP-x-GCN NSs composite was synthesized by a simple physical mixing of Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs without aqueous environment, grinding and any other treatment."
4,Characterization of samples,"2.3 Characterization of samples X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was measured with a Shimadzu XRD-6100 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were performed on a Nicolet FT-IR spectrophotometer (Nexus 470). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCA PHI500 spectrometer. The morphologies were acquired on a JEOL FEIJEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The concentrations of different metal ions were detected by Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Agilent 725). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions were investigated by the TriStar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) data were recorded by a UV-3600 Plus (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were employed on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained on Edinburgh FLSP920 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 337 nm."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was measured by using a Labsolar 6A online photocatalytic analysis system (Perfectlight, Beijing), as shown in Figure S1 . Typically, under magnetic agitation, 20 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in a 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 10 vol% triethanolamine (TEOA). The reaction solution was kept at 5 °C by recirculating cooling water system, and it was evacuated for 30 min to remove air completely. A 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm) was used as the light source. The produced H2 was measured by a GC7900 II gas chromatograph (Tian Mei, Shanghai), using nitrogen as carrier gas."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photo-electrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660B) with a conventional three-electrode cell. The prepared sample was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) as the reference electrode. Typically, 10 mg of catalyst and 5 mg of PVP were dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol along with 20 μL of oleic acid and then ultrasonicated for 30 min to form a suspension. Then, 30 μL of the suspension was uniformly dropped onto a piece of fluoride tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm × 1 cm). The transient photocurrent response measurements were performed in 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution under a 300 W Xe arc lamp with cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were measured in a 100 mL of 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM {Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4−} at a bias voltage of 0.3 V over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and structural morphology of Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs,"3.1 Synthesis and structural morphology of Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs In this work, the Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs samples were synthesized according to the detailed scheme in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the GCN NSs was prepared by self-modification of polymeric melon units through a two-step thermal treatment of melamine in the air atmosphere. During the heating process, bulk g-C3N4 can be thermally oxidized into nanosheets through overcoming the weak Van der Waals force between layers [32]. Then, the Ru-CoP-x was prepared by a wet chemical reduction of the Ru(III) and Co(II) mixed aqueous solution followed by a low-temperature phosphating process, which shows a 2D nanosheets morphology. Finally, the Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs composite was obtained through the self-assembly process of 2D GCN NSs and 2D Ru-CoP-x nanosheets. This 2D/2D assembly structure can expand the Schottky junction at the interface between Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs, which would effectively promote the charge separation, thus achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency. The morphology features of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by TEM and HRTEM images. Firstly, all the Ru-Co-x samples have a 2D nanosheets morphology with smooth surfaces, as displayed in Fig. 2 a and Figure S2 a-c. After phosphating treatment, the surface of the obtained Ru-CoP-x sample becomes rougher (Fig. 2 b and Figure S2 d-f), which is helpful to expose more active sites for water reduction reaction. Bare GCN NSs has a rough surface with many folds, which can lead to a large BET surface and provide rich active sites for hydrogen evolution (Fig. 2 c). It can be seen that all the Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs composites have a 2D/2D assembly structure (Fig. 2 d and Figure S2 g-i), which can provide a large interface to extend the Schottky effect and will effectively promote the charge separation, thus achieving an excellent hydrogen evolution. Besides, Ru, Ru-P, and CoP also have a 2D nanosheets morphology with rough surface, and Ru/GCN NSs and CoP/GCN NSs composites also have a 2D/2D assembly structure ( Figure S3 ). To further confirm the phase composition of the composite, HRTEM images of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 2 e, 2f. The regions where no lattice fringes can be observed are amorphous GCN NSs, and the regions where obvious lattice fringes can be observed are Ru-CoP-1:8. The lattice fringe of 0.205 nm corresponds to the Ru (101) lattice plane [33]. The lattice fringes of 0.189 nm and 0.196 nm correspond to the (211) lattice plane and (112) lattice plane of standard orthorhombic CoP (ICDD No. 00-029-0497), respectively [34]. Also, the 2D/2D assembly interface between GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:8 nanosheets can be observed clearly. Moreover, EDX spectrum ( Figure S4 ), HAADF-STEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images at the scale bar of 50 nm ( Figure S5 ) of the 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs composite show that the composite was composed of Ru, Co, P, N, and C elements. Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of CoP nanosheets, and Ru-CoP nanosheets with GCN NSs form a 2D/2D assembly structure. Furthermore, in the 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs sample, the stoichiometric ratio of Ru is calculated to be 2.7 wt% of the total mass of the composite, Co is calculated to be 14.6 wt%, P is calculated to be 7.7 wt%, GCN NSs is calculated to be 75 wt%, and the Ru-to-Co molar ratio is calculated to be 1: 8. XPS element analysis can just only measure the surface element content of the sample, so we also use the ICP-AES to measure the actual metal element content of the sample (Table S2). The accurate weight content of Ru and Co in 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs is 2.51 wt% and 11.88 wt%, respectively. Therefore, the final loading of Ru is 2.51 wt%, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of 2.7 wt%. And the calculated atom ratio of Ru-to-Co is 1: 8.1, which is similar to the theoretical feeding ratio of 1: 8. To study the chemical composition, the as-prepared samples were investigated by XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 3 a. For GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs samples, two characteristic peaks at 13.0° and 27.2° correspond to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4, which can be associated with the typical in-plane repeating unit of tri-s-triazine and graphitic stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, respectively [35]. For Ru, Ru-P, Ru-CoP-1:8 and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs samples, the main characteristic peaks located at 44.0° can be indexed to the (101) planes of Ru (PDF 65-7646) [36], showing that the Ru phase has not changed after 350 °C phosphating process. For CoP, Ru-CoP-1:8 and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs samples, the main characteristic peaks at 31.6°, 36.3°, 46.2°, 48.1°, 52.2° and 56.8° can be indexed to the (011), (111), (112), (211), (103), and (301) planes of CoP (PDF 65-2593), indicating that Co phase was successfully phosphatized to CoP [37]. The above results show that the Ru-CoP-1:8 sample is composed of CoP and Ru two phases, and the Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs sample is composed of GCN NSs, CoP, and Ru three phases. Importantly, after the introduction of Ru-CoP-1:8, the characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 do not shift, indicating the stable structure of g-C3N4. Furthermore, the chemical structures of GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and visualized in Fig. 3 b. The general shape of FT-IR spectra for two samples is similar, suggesting that the chemical structures of GCN NSs is not changed after the introduction of Ru-CoP-1:8. The sharp peak at 810 cm−1 is out-of-plane bending vibrations of tri-s-triazine [38]. The peaks from 1800 cm−1 to 1000 cm−1 are the typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles while the broad ones between 3000 cm−1 and 3500 cm−1 is caused by the NH stretch [39]. Overall, these similar vibration modes suggest the structural stability of GCN NSs in the synthetic process of 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs. To further determine the chemical states of surface elements, the high-resolution XPS spectra of GCN NSs and 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs samples were employed, as shown in Fig. 4 . From the C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4 a, b), each sample shares the similar features of the g-C3N4, indicating that all of them have the g-C3N4 local structure. The C 1s XPS spectra for GCN NSs sample can be fitted into three distinct peaks at 284.8 eV, 286.4 eV and 288.2 eV, relating to the CC, C-NH2, and N-CN bonds, respectively [40]. The N 1s XPS spectra for both the GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs samples can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 398.7 eV, 399.8 eV and 401.0 eV, which represented sp2 hybridized nitrogen in triazine rings (C-NC), tertiary nitrogen (N-(C)3) and C-NH bond, respectively [41]. Compared with GCN NSs, the peaks in C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs are not shifted, suggesting that the chemical states of GCN NSs are not changed after the introduction of Ru-CoP-1:8. Moreover, it was worth noting that the C 1s peak is partially overlapped by the Ru 3d peak (Fig. 4 a), which is consistent with previous literature report [42]. The small peak at 284.2 eV can be attributed to Ru 3d3/2 of the metallic state Ru (Ru0), and the peak at 279.5 eV corresponds to Ru 3d5/2 of Ru0, which confirms the existence of metallic state Ru0 [43]. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p is presented in Fig. 4 c. The peaks at 781.2 eV and its satellite at 786.2 eV can be indexed to Co 2p3/2, while the peaks at 797.6 eV and its satellite at 803.1 eV can be assigned to Co 2p1/2, implying the formation of CoP [44]. With respect to P 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4 d), the peaks at 129.3 eV and 130.2 eV correspond to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 of Pδ−, respectively, indicating the existence of the metal phosphides [45]. Meanwhile, the peak at 133.1 eV may be assigned to the PO species [46]. The above results further confirm the successful formation of Ru-CoP on the surface of GCN NSs. Furthermore, to study the effect of specific surface area on photocatalytic performance, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution plots of bulk GCN, GCN NSs, and 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs are displayed in Figure S6 . It can be seen that bulk GCN has a low BET specific surface area of 3.05 m2/g, which results in lower photocatalytic performance. Compared to bulk GCN, due to the ultrathin and porous structure (average pore size is about 3 nm), the BET specific surface area of GCN NSs is increased to 145.49 m2/g, which is beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. However, compared to bare GCN NSs, the BET specific surface area of 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs is reduced to 68.83 m2/g due to the introduction of Ru-CoP-1:8 with low specific surface area, which is similar with the result of previous report [47]. This result indicates the BET specific surface area is not a decisive factor for the high performance of 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs composite."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the samples was tested with triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent under visible light illumination (λ > 400 nm). As shown in Fig. 5 a, compared with bulk GCN (2.18 μmol g−1 h−1), the hydrogen evolution activity of GCN NSs increased to 30.68 μmol g−1 h−1 due to the ultrathin and porous structure which reduces the diffusion distance of photo-generated carriers to prevent rapid recombination. Both bare bulk GCN and GCN NSs show poor photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity possibly due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. However, significant improvement can be observed after integrating co-catalyst with GCN. Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs exhibits a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1172.5 µmol g−1 h−1, which is close to Pt/GCN NSs of 1450.6 µmol g−1 h−1. Compared with Ru/GCN NSs (266.4 µmol g−1 h−1) and CoP/GCN NSs (336.2 µmol g−1 h−1), Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs shows the best performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru and CoP in the binary Ru-CoP-1:8 co-catalyst. It is worth noting that 25% Ru/GCN NSs (266.4 µmol g−1 h−1) and 25% Ru-P/GCN NSs (266.8 µmol g−1 h−1) show a similar photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, which prove that the low temperature phosphating annealing at 350 ℃ has no significant effect on the catalytic performance of Ru. Moreover, Ru-Co-1:8/GCN NSs without phosphating treatment shows a hydrogen evolution activity of 250.5 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 4.7 times lower than that of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs, confirming the superiority of TMP co-catalysts. Importantly, to study the interface Schottky effect between Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs, photocatalytic performance of simple physical mixing of Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs without aqueous environment and further treatment (Ru-CoP-x-GCN NSs) was also tested [48]. Ru-CoP-1:8-GCN NSs has a low hydrogen evolution activity of 245.5 μmol g−1 h−1 due to the too weak interface Schottky effect between Ru-CoP-x and GCN NSs. Compared with Ru-CoP-1:8-GCN NSs, Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs was increased by 4.8 times owing to the strong interface Schottky effect. This result suggests that the 2D/2D self-assembly structure may have a relatively strong interface Schottky effect to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, bare Ru-CoP-1:8 has no photocatalytic activity, indicating that Ru-CoP-8 is not a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs with 25% loading ratio but different Ru-to-Co molar ratio were compared, as shown in Fig. 5 b. Notably, Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs exhibits a highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1172.5 µmol g−1 h−1 than that of Ru-CoP-1:4/GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:16/GCN NSs, indicating that the photocatalytic activity is related to the synergistic effect of Ru and CoP. The decreased activity in Ru-CoP-1:4/GCN NSs may be due to although the increase ratio of Ru (ΔGH* < 0) enhances the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, at the same time, the decrease ratio of CoP (ΔGH* > 0) weakens the H2 desorption, thus hindering the surface water reduction kinetics [19,22]. Similarly, the activity of Ru-CoP-1:16 is also significantly decreased, which may be because although the increase of CoP ratio promotes the desorption of H2, the decrease of Ru ratio leads to the insufficient water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, thus also hindering the kinetics of water reduction to hydrogen. Therefore, Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs with an appropriate water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption capacity can lead to the optimal surface water reduction kinetics, thus achieving the best hydrogen evolution activity. The effect of Ru-CoP-1:8 loading content in Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 c, 15% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs has a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 696.1 µmol g−1 h−1 under visible light. When increasing the Ru-CoP-1:8 loading content to 25%, the hydrogen evolution activity can be obviously improved to 1172.5 µmol g−1 h−1, which can be due to the increased active sites. However, further increasing the loading content of Ru-CoP-1:8 to 35% lead to a significant decrease in hydrogen evolution activity for 556.5 µmol g−1 h−1, which may be caused by the light-screening effect of excessive co-catalysts [49]. To ensure the reliability of the experiment results and explore the key factors of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the hydrogen evolution performance under various blank experiments were also tested (Fig. 5 d). There is no hydrogen evolution in dark conditions, indicating that light is necessary for the photocatalyst in the water reduction reaction. Without adding water, H2 cannot be detected, indicating that water is the feedstock of the reduction. Without the addition of photocatalyst, there is also no H2 released, indicating that photocatalyst is one of the key factors to overcoming the kinetic obstacles of water reduction reaction. The recyclability performance of the optimal sample 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs was also tested (Fig. 5 e), and the results shows that even after five cycles, the hydrogen evolution rate is still quite stable. Before and after five cycles, XRD and TEM images of the Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs photocatalyst do not change significantly (Fig. 5 f and Figure S7 ), indicating the good stability of the Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs photocatalyst."
10,Investigation of enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Investigation of enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic activity To study enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic activity, the optical and electrical properties of the samples are tested and shown in Fig. 6 . Firstly, the photoabsorption capacity of GCN NSs, Ru-CoP-1:8, and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs composites were characterized by the UV–vis DRS (Fig. 6 a). The intrinsic absorption edge of pristine GCN NSs is around 470 nm. Compared with GCN NSs, the intrinsic absorption edge of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs redshifts to 550 nm, resulting from the visible light absorption of Ru-CoP-1:8 catalyst. With the increment of Ru-CoP-1:8, the colors of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs composite change from write to dark gray, which is consistent with the enhanced absorbance in the visible region ( Figure S8 ). The bandgap value of the semiconductor materials could be calculated using the following equation: α h ν = A ( h ν - E g ) n / 2 where α, h, υ, Eg and A represent the absorption coefficient, the Planck constant, the light frequency, the bandgap, and a constant, respectively. According to the literature, the n value of g-C3N4 is 4 [50]. Based on the above equation, the transformed Kubelka-Munk function plots for GCN NSs and Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs are also displayed, as shown in Fig. 6 b. The bandgap value of GCN NSs is about 2.63 eV while Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs drops to 2.25 eV, indicating that GCN NSs is more easily excited by visible light after the introduction of Ru-CoP-1:8 co-catalyst, which is consistent with the improved photocatalytic performance of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs. To study the charge transfer properties of Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs, PL spectra were applied (Fig. 6 c). With the excitation wavelength of 337 nm, each sample shows a strong emission peak at around 430 nm due to the band to band electronic transition, which is similar with the previous report [51]. Compared to GCN NSs, the PL intensity of co-catalysts/GCN NSs is significantly reduced, indicating the effective inhibition of recombination of photo-generated electron-hole due to the fast charge transfer from the excited GCN NSs to co-catalysts [52]. Among them, the intensity of 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs is the lowest, showing that the charge separation efficiency of binary co-catalyst system is faster than that of one-component co-catalyst system, which is consistent with the enhanced photocatalytic performance. To better understand the recombination process, the TRPL decay spectra were also performed, as shown in Fig. 6 d. The average fluorescent lifetime (τ) of photo-generated carriers is fitted into τ1 and τ2. τ1 represents the fluorescence decay time of the excited electrons from the conduction band to the valence band of GCN NSs, and τ2 represents the fluorescence decay time of the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs on the GCN NSs. A1 and A2 are the relative intensities. The average fluorescent lifetimes of bare GCN NSs, 25% Ru/GCN NSs, 25% CoP/GCN NSs, and 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs are 15.75, 11.18, 9.06, and 7.16 ns, respectively (see Supporting Information for more details). Interestingly, after the loading of Ru-CoP-1:8 co-catalysts, τ2 and τ were simultaneously shortened a lot. The shortened lifetime of τ2 may be caused by the rapid interfacial electrons transfer from the excited GCN NSs to co-catalysts. The electrons on the co-catalyst are more likely to react with the protons trapped on the co-catalyst to release hydrogen, thus improving the photocatalytic performance [53]. Among them, 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs has the shortest lifetime due to the improved electrons transport properties of binary co-catalyst compared with the one-component co-catalysts. Then, to study the photo-generated carriers migration rate of the Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs, photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were applied for further research. To evaluate the generation rate of photo-generated carriers under the illumination condition, the transient photocurrent plot was performed (Fig. 6 e). It is clear that under dark and light conditions, the photocurrent response of each sample has the similar characteristics except for the current density. Compared with bare GCN NSs, 25% Ru/GCN NSs, and 25% CoP/GCN NSs samples, 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs shows the highest photocurrent density, testifying the improved carrier generation rate [54]. Moreover, the EIS Nyquist plot was carried out to study the charge transfer resistance properties (Fig. 6 f). All the photocatalysts show the similar semicircle curves, which are indicative of the resistance properties [55]. Among them, the arc radius of 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs is the smallest, reflecting the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance. The above PEC measurements results indicate that 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs has the highest generation and migration rate of photo-generated carriers, which is also consistent with the highest photocatalytic performance. In summary, the improved photocatalytic activity is not related to the BET specific surface area, but is caused by the suppressed recombination of photo-generated carriers, improved charge separation efficiency, and superior electrons transport properties of binary co-catalyst. Taking all the above information into account, the possible mechanism of Ru-CoP-x/GCN NSs for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is speculated, as shown in Fig. 7 . Under visible light irradiation, the electrons of GCN NSs are excited and jump into the conduction band. Because of the strong Schottky effect between the interface of Ru-CoP and GCN NSs and superior electrons transport properties of binary Ru-CoP co-catalyst, electrons are then transferred to the Ru-CoP, which inhibits the recombination with holes. Moreover, 2D/2D assembly structure provides short photo-generated carriers transport distance and strong interface Schottky effect, which promotes the charge transfer. Finally, electrons are enriched in Ru, which promotes the water dissociation to active intermediate H*. On the other hand, due to the good H* adsorption capacity, the generated H* is also first enriched in Ru. Then, H* is transferred from hydrogen-enriched Ru to hydrogen-deficient CoP, and was further reduced to H2 on the CoP surface with strong H2 desorption capacity. With this synergistic effect of Ru and CoP, Ru-modulated CoP with appropriate H* adsorption capacity and H2 desorption capacity promotes the surface water reduction kinetics, thus significantly promotes the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. To further facilitate the separation of photo-generated carriers, TEOA is used as a sacrificial agent to consume holes."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we constructed a novel Ru-modulated CoP/g-C3N4 nanosheets ternary hybrid photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution under visible light. The optimal photocatalyst 25% Ru-CoP-1:8/GCN NSs exhibits an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1172.5 µmol g−1 h−1 under visible light with a high AQE of 3.49% at 420 nm, which is close to the Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system and higher than most reported transition metal phosphides (TMP)/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system. The improved photocatalytic performance may be mainly due to the superior properties of Ru-CoP binary co-catalyst with efficient charge separation and promoted surface water reduction kinetics, and the 2D/2D assembly structure with short charge transport distance and strong interface Schottky effect. This study provides a new way to develop cost-effective Pt-alternative co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by incorporating a small amount of ruthenium into the transition metal phosphides."
