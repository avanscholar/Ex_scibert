0,Introduction,"A considerable amount of soil, and those surrounding mining and industrial areas, have been contaminated with heavy metals (Hu et al., 2019). The soil is usually contaminated by multiple heavy metals. For example, Zn and Cd usually coexist as mixed heavy metal pollutants. Phytoremediation is to use the plant for removing heavy metals from the soil, which has been considered to have great potential in remediating heavy metal-contaminated soils in situ because of its cost-efficiency and eco-friendliness (Chen et al., 2020). The potential of phytoremediation technology for purifying heavy metals-contaminated soil depends on the accumulation of heavy metals by hyperaccumulators (Huang et al., 2020). Sedum plumbizincicola is a hyperaccumulator of Zn and Cd, and it has remarkable ability to extract them from the contaminated soil. Phytoremediation is an effective method for removing heavy metals (HMs) from soil without damaging the function and fertility of the topsoil (Pilon-Smits, 2005). However, the disposal of considerable contaminated plants have become a major problem, limiting the application of phytoremediation (Chang et al., 2019). These contaminated plants are defined as hyperaccumulators and have high tolerance to specific HM with an adsorption more than 50 times higher than that of ordinary plants (Mahar et al., 2016). This is detrimental and hence necessary to be adequately disposed of the hyperaccumulators (Liu et al., 2019). The high content of accumulated HMs in the contaminated hyperaccumulators might access into the human food web, if no additional protection and action are taken (Al-Thani and Yasseen, 2020). The high moisture content (>90 %) also limits the disposal of hyperaccumulator owing to the high energy consumption required for the drying (Yanik et al., 2007). Due to the high-moisture nature of hyperaccumulators, the hydrothermal treatment is a potential option to treat this wet biomass. Water could reach the supercritical state by exceeding the critical condition, i.e., 374 ℃ and 22.1 MPa, being termed as ‘supercritical water’ (SCW) (Susanti et al., 2014). In the supercritical state, the ionic product of water dramatically decreased, which is favorable to the occurrence of the free-radical reaction (Weijin et al., 2019). It was reported that the dielectric constant of SCW could be reduced to 5, which is much lower compared with the regular water (approximately 80) (Guo et al., 2010). The hydrogen bonding strength is significantly reduced in SCW, showing strong polarity and completely dissolve organic matter and gases. Therefore chemical reactions will take place in a single phase instead of multi-phase, thus improving the reaction efficiency (Savage, 1999). Derived from the SCW process, the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) could be an practical approach for converting high-moisture biomass into value-added products, for instance, syngas and biochar (Godwin et al., 2019). Borges et al., (2019) reported that SCWG of biomass ensured better gasification performance by suppressing the tar formation compared with that observed in the conventional gasification or pyrolysis. Different studies have confirmed that the H2 production from biomass using SCWG has a good application prospect. For instance, Yan et al. (2019) conducted the H2 production from food waste using SCWG and achieved the H2 yield of 13.3 mol/kg without adding catalysts, while the maximum H2 yield of 202.4 mol/kg was achieved when 5 wt.% KOH was added. Microalgae with a moisture of 95 % was gasified by the SCWG approach at 663 ℃ and 24 MPa to produce a syngas containing 52 % H2 (Caputo et al., 2016). Studies have been carried out on the hydrothermal treatment of hyperaccumulators and other substances containing HMs. For instance, Carrier et al. (2011) reported that the HMs in Pteris vittata were transferred into the solid products after the hydrothermal treatment. Shi et al. (2013) treated sewage sludge under subcritical water conditions, receiving similar results with Carrier et al. (2011). It was found that the toxicity of HMs in the sewage sludge reduced to a low even no risk level. The experimental results indicated that the hydrothermal treatment could effectively reduce the dissolved HMs to prevent them from reentering the ecological cycle. Currently, most related researches on SCWG of biomass focused on improving the H2 yield by taking the advantage of using metals as catalysts (Nanda et al., 2018a; Su et al., 2019). No research has been conducted on the use of SCWG for the simultaneous H2 production and HMs immobilization, which are likely to be achieved since HMs could be solidified in the SCWG process following the similar mechanism occurred in the hydrothermal treatment. Hyperaccumulators may be possible to be converted into biofuel, biogas or biochar through the pyrolysis treatment as a type of lignocellulose biomass (Adekunle et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2019a,b; Yek et al., 2019a; Wan Mahari et al., 2018a; Lam et al., 2019c, d; Lam et al., 2019e; Wan Mahari et al., 2018b; Yek et al., 2019b), in which, those HMs can be transferred and dispersed into liquid biofuels (Qin et al., 2019). In this work, the SCWG process was applied to treat the Sedum plumbizincicola. The effects of temperature on both H2 production and HMs immobilization were studied. The mechanism of the H2 production from biomass was investigated. The HMs redistribution in liquid products and biochar, and speciation transformation behaviors were explored. The corresponding environmental risks were appraised."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The hyperaccumulator, Sedum plumbizincicola, was harvested from the Renhua phytoremediation test field in Guangdong Province, China. The plant was ground into 40 mesh before being used. The results from the proximate and ultimate analysis, and HMs concentrations are listed in Table 1 . All the chemical reagents were purchased from Aladdin in Shanghai, China"
3,Supercritical bath experiment,"2.2 Supercritical bath experiment Fig. 1 represents the schematic diagram of the setup of SCWG. The experiment was performed in a SCWG reactor with an electrically heating furnace, which was purchased from Wuzhou Dingchuang Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China. The actual reaction temperature was monitored in real time through a thermocouple in the reactor. Before the heating, argon was used to purge the air in the reactor to ensure an inert environment. The original biomass and deionized water were added into the reactor and thoroughly mixed by a magnetic stirrer. During the SCWG process, the gasification reaction of Sedum plumbizincicola occurred, accompanied by the generation of gaseous products, liquid products, and biochar. After heating, water was continuously added to the system to cool the reactor rapidly. After the temperature was closed to room temperature, the gaseous product was collected by the gas bag and then examined by the Gas Chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD). The remaining solid-liquid mixture was collected and separated for further analysis."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The primary gaseous products, including H2, CO, CH4 and CO2, were quantified by the Agilent 7890B GC-TCD. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The organics in liquid products were extracted with the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), and then the bio-oil was obtained by removing CH2Cl2 through a rotary evaporator. A qualitative analysis of the organic substances in liquid products was performed through the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP2010-SE, Japan). The 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H NMR) spectra of bio-oil products were performed using the Bruker AVANCE Ⅲ HD500 spectrometer, Germany, and deuterated methanol (CD3OD) was used as the solvent. The liquid products were digested by the mixture of HNO3 and H2O2 via the microwave heating. After the digestion, the clear solution passed through a filter membrane with a diameter of 0.45 μm and then was diluted with deionized water. The concentrations of HMs in liquid products were quantitatively determined by the Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 8300, America). The biochar was dried at 105 ℃ for 12 h and then its final weight was determined. A modified sequential extraction procedure developed by the European Communities Bureau of Reference (BCR) was used to selectively extract four fractions of HMs, including the exchangeable fraction (F1), the reducible fraction (F2), the oxidizable fraction (F3) and the residual fraction (F4) (Long et al., 2009). The original plant, biochar and residues (F4) were separately mixed with HCl, HNO3 and HF (3:1:1 v/v) and subjected to microwave digestion. The concentrations of HMs in the extracted and digested solution were determined through ICP-OES. All the experiments were repeated three times and the average was reported. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITaCHI SU8000, Japan) imaging for the original plant and the biochar was also performed to examine the changes of morphology structures."
5,Gasification efficiency analysis,"2.4 Gasification efficiency analysis The individual gas yield, total gas yield, carbon gasification efficiency (CE) and H2 gasification efficiency (HE), were used to assess the H2 production efficiency of hyperaccumulators through SCWG, which were defined in Eqs. (1)–(4), respectively, shown as follows: (1) I n d i v i d u a l g a s y i e l d m o l / k g = T h e m o l e s o f g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s T h e m a s s o f b i o m a s s × 100 % (2) T o t a l g a s y i e l d m o l / g = T h e s u m o f H 2 , C O , C H 4 , C O 2 y i e l d s (3) C E % = T h e m a s s o f c a r b o n i n g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s T h e m a s s o f c a r b o n i n b i o m a s s × 100 % (4) H E % = T h e m a s s o f h y d r o g e n i n g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s T h e m a s s o f h y d r o g e n i n b i o m a s s × 100 %"
6,Distribution of HMs in products and speciation proportion,"2.5 Distribution of HMs in products and speciation proportion The percentage of HMs in liquid products was calculated through Eqs. (5) and (6), shown as below: (5) P % = C 1 C b × L Y (6) L Y w t . % = W 1 ( W 0 + W 2 ) × 100 % where, C 1 and C b (mg/kg) are the HMs’ contents in liquid products and original plant, respectively. LY (wt.%) is the liquid products yield, W 0, W 1 and W 2 are the masses of the plant, liquid products and added distilled water, respectively. The percentage of four forms of HMs was calculated as follows: (7) P i % = C f i C s i × 100 % where, i refers to the different HMs, P i is the proportion of four forms in total HMs, C si (mg/kg) is the concentration of HMs in biochar and original plant, and C fi (mg/kg) is the concentration of four forms including F1, F2, F3 and F4."
7,Risk assessment,"2.6 Risk assessment The risk assessment code (RAC) was adopted to judge the environmental risk level of HMs in biochar, which is widely used for evaluating environmental toxicity and availability of HMs in solid (Huang et al., 2011). The definition of RAC refers to the proportion of HMs in F1 (Singh et al., 2005). RAC divides the risk of HMs to the environment into five categories, i.e., no risk (<1 %), low risk (1–10 %), medium risk (11–30 %), high risk (31–50 %) and very high risk (>50 %) (Huang et al., 2011)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of the temperature on gasification characteristics,"3.1 Effect of the temperature on gasification characteristics The feedstock containing 6 wt.% of biomass concentration was gasified in SCW at 25 MPa for 20 min at different reaction temperatures (380–440 ℃). The gaseous products mainly consisted of H2, CO, CH4, CO2, while C1-C4 organic hydrocarbon gases accounted for a small proportion (Susanti et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2006). Fig. 2 shows the effect of temperature on the total gas yield, and the individual yield of H2, CO, CH4, CO2, CE and HE. The total gas yield was improved from 4.31 to 12.06 mol/kg (Fig. 2a). The yields of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were improved when the temperature increased, and all of them reached the maximum values at 440 ℃, which were 2.74 mol/kg H2, 0.29 mol/kg CO, 1.26 mol/kg CH4, and 7.78 mol/kg CO2, respectively. In particular, the yield of H2 increased from 0.92 to 2.74 mol/kg, counting for an increase of 66.4 %. The reaction mechanism of the SCWG process was likely shifted to the free-radical reaction, and H2 was the typical product in free-radical reaction (Gong et al., 2019). Fig. 2b shows that CE and HE improved apparently. The maximum CE of 36.1 % and HE of 25.5 % both occurred at 440 ℃. Although the total gas yield decreased at 420 ℃ compared with 400 ℃, HE still increased. Because the H2 yield almost unchanged, and the CH4 yield increased by 0.3 mol/kg, which led to an increase of 2.46 % in HE at 420 ℃. In general, both H2 yield and HE value reached their maximum at 440 ℃. Wang et al. (2019) conducted an experiment to gasify sewage sludge in SCW, obtaining a maximum H2 yield of 0.12 mol/kg and a total gas yield of 2.13 mol/kg at 400 ℃ without the addition of catalysts. Nanda et al. (2018b) aimed at producing H2 by SCWG of wheat straw. In their experiment, the H2 yield, total gas yield and CE were about 1.25 mol/kg, 6.4 mol/kg and 14.6 %, respectively, at 450 ℃. In comparison, this study achieved a H2 yield of 2.74 mol/kg, a total gas yield of 12.06 mol/kg and CE of 36.1 % at a lower temperature of 440 ℃. It was indicated that the hyperaccumulator plant (Sedum plumbizincicola) had a great prospect as a feedstock for SCWG conversion to generate H2. Ionic and free-radical reactions are the main reactions in the hydrothermal process of biomass, and the ionic reaction is favorable under subcritical conditions (Yong and Matsumura, 2013). The ionic product and dielectric constant of water decreases as the temperature rise to the critical point, in which the free-radical mechanism becomes dominant compared to the ionic reaction (Hu et al., 2014). The occurrence of the free-radical reaction favored the decomposition of the biomass into small molecular weight intermediates and gases by facilitating the bond-cleavage reactions (Borges et al., 2019). The OH bond (464 kJ/mol) and CH (414 kJ/mol) had the higher bond energy compared with the covalent bond of CC (347 kJ/mol) and CO (360 kJ/mol), thereafter higher energy was required for the dehydrogenation (Susanti et al., 2014). The compounds in Sedum plumbizincicola were likely to have undergone a series of reactions e.g., hydrolysis, decomposition, polymerization and steam reforming reaction (Cao et al., 2016). The oligomers produced by the hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were further converted into lower molecular weight compounds, which were decomposed into gaseous products at high temperatures through the dehydrogenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation due to the endothermic steam reforming reaction (Eqs. (8) and (9)) (Nanda et al., 2016). The increase in temperature contributed to a higher CH4 output (from 0.09 to 1.26 mol/kg), which was possibly due to the demethylation of methoxyl groups of lignin at high temperatures (Hu et al., 2014). As the temperature increased, the CC bond was broken, and the CH3 group formed by the decomposition of the methoxy group combined with H to form CH4 (Li et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 2(a), the yields of H2, CO and CO2 declined at 420 ℃, while the yield of CH4 increased by 71.4 % compared with that at 400 ℃. Perhaps because it is more conducive to the methanation reaction at 420 °C, leading to a decrease in the yield of CO, CO2 and H2 (Eqs. (10) and (11)). (8) C x H y O z s + x - z H 2 O l → x C O ( g ) + x - z + y 2 H 2 ( g ) (9) C x H y O z s + 2 x - z H 2 O l → x C O 2 ( g ) + 2 x - z + y 2 H 2 ( g ) (10) C O g + 3 H 2 g ⇌ C H 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) (11) C O 2 g + 4 H 2 g ⇌ C H 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g )"
10,Effect of the temperature on bio-oil composition,"3.2 Effect of the temperature on bio-oil composition The compounds in the bio-oil at different gasification temperatures examined by GC–MS are shown in Fig. 3 a. The bio-oil contained alkanes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, fatty acids, esters, benzene, ethers and a few nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds (NCH). The main compounds in the bio-oil included aliphatic and aromatic compounds. It was revealed that the oxygenated compounds were firstly decomposed into intermediates, which were further dehydrogenated to produce H2 and decarboxylated to generate CO2 (Susanti et al., 2014). Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds were likely to be generated through the hydrolysis of proteins and the Maillard reaction occurred in amino acids and sugars, while Maillard reaction can inhibit the free-radical reaction. The decrease of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds indicated that the Maillard reaction was inhibited, while the free-radical reaction was favored, resulting in an increase of gaseous products (Cao et al., 2016). In Fig. 3a, from 400 ℃ to 440 ℃, the relative content of phenols declined because they were likely to be converted to organic acids (Lu et al., 2013), while the decreased acids were likely decomposed into gases consisting of H2 and CH4. In order to clearly demonstrate the compound distribution of the bio-oil, 1H NMR was also used for the analysis of the bio-oil (Fig. S1). The compounds of the bio-oil are alkane (0.5–1.5 ppm), aliphatic (1.5–4.5 ppm), and aromatic compounds (4.5−10 ppm). In addition, aromatics included those heteroaromatic compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen (5.5–9.5 ppm) (Zhou et al., 2010; Gong et al., 2017). The primary compounds in the bio-oil was aliphatic compounds (39.6–45.8 %), followed by the aromatic compound (28.6–38.4 %) (Fig. 3b), which was in agreement with the results obtained by GC–MS. The content of aromatic compounds increased when the temperature rose from 380 to 420 ℃. This can be explained by the Dielse-Alder reaction mechanism that the elevated temperature was likely to have promoted the occurrence of dehydrogenation, and also the H2 production (Chen et al., 2013). At a higher temperature (440 ℃), aromatic compounds were degraded into ring-opening compounds such as carboxylic acids that were finally degraded into CO2, H2, CH4 and CO (Wang et al., 2016a).The results obtained by 1H NMR were in good accordance with that of GC–MS."
11,Morphology investigation of the solid products,"3.3 Morphology investigation of the solid products The SEM images revealed the surface morphology of the produced biochar (Fig. 4 ). Compared with the smooth and contiguous surface of the untreated plant, the morphology of the biochar exhibited more porous, hollow, and rougher. The biochar’s surface showed some shallow holes at 380 ℃, and more pores can be observed at higher temperatures. It was probably because of the rapid degradation of organic matters at higher temperatures (Fig. 4) (Lin et al., 2019). During the SCWG process of lignocellulose biomass, the biochar was likely to be produced in two paths. One was through the degradation of the liquid intermediates and the other was through the reactions of gaseous products. For the first route, the intermediate phenolic compounds such as furfurals and phenolic compounds can be converted into biochar (Lu et al., 2013). For the second route, the side reactions of gaseous products, e.g., Boudouard reaction, CO and CO2 hydrogenation may also form the char (Susanti et al., 2012)."
12,Study of distribution and speciation transformation of heavy metals,"3.4 Study of distribution and speciation transformation of heavy metals No HM was detected in the gaseous products in the temperature ranging from 395 to 445 ℃ (Jin et al., 2016). In this study, HMs in gaseous products were negligible. Both extraction and immobilization were carried out concurrently during the SCWG process (Leng et al., 2014), inducing HMs redistributing in the liquid and biochar products. The redistributions of HMs in liquid and biochar products at different temperatures (380–440 ℃) are shown in Fig. 5 . In the liquid products, the contents of Zn, Cd and Pb were too low to be detected, and the percentage of Mn was less than 0.1 %. Fig. 5a shows that the proportion of Cr in liquid products was very low (smaller than 0.8 %). Also, it was decreased with the rise of temperature. Although different HMs behaved differently, the increase of temperature brought out a consistent increment of HM content in biochar. The best experimental result was obtained at 440 ℃, when the heavy metals content in the liquid product was the lowest (Fig. 5a-b). Most HMs (>99.2 %) were distributed to biochar after the SCW treatment. In this study, a higher HMs immobilization efficiency in biochar was obtained compared with the previous studies (Table 2 ). Shi et al. (2013) illustrated that the proportion of HMs in liquid products was low (<1.3 %) with the majority being distributed (>98.7 %) in biochar after the SCW treatment. Leng et al. (2014) found that a large proportion of HMs (>90 %) was accumulated into the biochar by the hydrothermal treatment (Wang et al., 2019; Nanda et al., 2018a; Shi et al., 2013; Leng et al., 2014). The increase of temperature intensified the immobilization efficiency of HMs, which was probably due to the quickly formed biochar for helping adsorb HMs (Lin et al., 2019). Additionally, the HMs in the fractions of F1, F2 and F3 releasing rate to the liquid products was much lower than the decomposition rate of organic matters of Sedum plumbizincicola, which led to the accumulation of HMs on the biochar (Bi et al., 2012). To determine the extent of the HM pollution, there was a need to investigate both the HM contents and speciation (Li et al., 2018). The speciation transformation behaviors of HMs, including Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb and Cr after the SCW treatment were studied in this section. In this study, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb and Cr were divided into four-speciation with the modified BCR method. The four-speciation distribution of HMs is illustrated in Fig. 6 (Long et al., 2009). The results showed that the temperature also had an advantageous effect on the transformation of HM into more stable fractions. The F1, F2 and F3 fractions of Zn and Mn declined, but on the contrary, the F4 fractions were increased from 380 to 400 ℃. The F4 fractions of Zn (10.4 %) and Mn (11.9 %) were increased to 44.9 % at 380 ℃, and 67.0 % at 400 ℃, respectively. The HM tended to be transformed from the weak bonded forms to stable ones with elevated temperature, which was consistent with the results of Shi (Shi et al., 2013). Established in the results obtained in this study, the fate of HMs in Sedum plumbizincicola during the SCWG process was derived and is shown in Fig. 7 . The HMs in F1 and F2 were firstly dissolved and released into liquid products in SCW (Bo et al., 2009). These released HMs could combine with sufficient oxides or oxygen-containing functional groups, e.g., COOH and OH, and organic ligands on biochar to form stable HMs complexes, being presented in the fractions of F3 and F4 (Huang et al., 2017). The decomposition of organic matters resulted in the escape of HMs bound to organic matters (F3), and then bounding those HMs with inorganic components on biochar (e.g., silicates, SiO2, Al2O3 and sulfides) to finally flow to F4 (Wang et al., 2016b; Chen et al., 2017). Cr was mainly (>95.1 %) distributed in the stable F4 fraction (97.7 % at 440 ℃), and no Cr was detected in F1 and F2. The content of Pb in F1 was less than 2.8 %, and Cd in F1 and F2 was very low (<10 %), except for F1 that was detected to be 20.1 % at 420 ℃. In summary, the SCWG treatment had an advantageous effect on the immobilization and the decline of the bioavailability of HM. Also, it was found that the SCW treatment at 440 ℃ was the best condition over the range of temperatures considered."
13,Environmental risk assessment based on risk assessment code,"3.5 Environmental risk assessment based on risk assessment code Table 3 displays the RAC values of the HMs distributed in the biochar. As shown in Fig. 6, Cr did not exist in the F1 form after the SCW treatment and showed no environmental risk. Pb and Cd displayed low environmental risk in general, except for the 20.1 % of Cd detected at 420 ℃. It was noteworthy that Zn was still at medium risk and even high risk with 12.9–36.5 % of RAC. Mn was at medium risk with the RAC in the range of 9.3–27.8 %. It was implied that Zn and Mn had a potential risk of the biochar, which should pay more attention. Generally, as the temperature increased, the risk level of Zn and Pb were decreased when the RAC declined from 22.0 % to 12.9 % for Zn, and 0.7 % to zero percent for Pb. The results implied that the HMs were usually transformed into the comparatively stable fractions after the SCW treatment, thereafter leading to a diminution of environmental risk (Shi et al., 2013). Pyrolysis technology usually requires high temperatures, leading to the volatilization of HMs. Therefore, advanced flue gas cleaning systems are essential, which will increase investment costs (Chanaka Udayanga et al., 2018). In contrast, because of the relatively low temperature, less volatilized HMs, and no need for dehydration pretreatment, SCWG has unique advantages for the disposal of lignocellulosic biomass containing HMs. Meanwhile, SCWG still has some deficiencies. It requires severe reaction conditions of high temperature and high pressure, so the operation cost is high. Due to the low solubility of salt in supercritical water, it is prone to precipitation. These precipitates will block the reactor when combined with chars (Reddy et al., 2014)."
14,Conclusions,"The SCWG process was successfully developed for dispersing hyperaccumulators with high HM concentrations. The results demonstrated that the high temperature was obviously beneficial to the H2 production and HM immobilization (especially for Zn, Mn and Cr), and 440 ℃ was the optimal condition. The endothermic steam reforming reaction was promoted with elevated temperature, increasing the H2 yield. The GCMS examination showed that the content of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds decreased, illustrating that the free-radical reaction was enhanced in the system, which favored the hydrogen production by facilitating the bond-cleavage reactions. The analyses of bio-oil illustrated that the aromatic compounds, oxygenated compounds and phenols were degraded to be H2-rich gases. The majority (>99.2 %) of HMs (Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb, Cr) were accumulated in the biochar. Organic compounds in plant were rapidly decomposed and released into gases, which enhanced the porous of the yielded biochar, thereby promoting HM immobilization."
