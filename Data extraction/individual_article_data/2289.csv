0,Introduction,"During the last decade hydrogen has become to be one of the most demanded products for the energy industry as very light, powerful and environmentally clean fuel. At the same time, the contradiction between wide prevalence of hydrogen-containing compounds in the nature and its absence in free zero-valence state complicates the development of hydrogen energy substantially. Fuel cells (the low-temperature fuel cells, in particular) will become in the nearest future the main devices for application in hydrogen energy [1–3]. For the low-temperature fuel cells a special attention should be given to manufacturing of CO-free hydrogen because of irreversible poisoning of the catalytic materials even by trace amounts of carbon monoxide [4–7]. Reforming of carbon-containing materials (e.g., ethanol) can be also considered as an efficient method for hydrogen production [8,9]. Intensive development of renewable energy sources in recent years has led to the design of technologies for production of various biofuels (such as methane, methanol, and ethanol) from biomass [10,11]. Subsequent biomethanol [12] or bioethanol [13] steam reforming enables to produce hydrogen from the renewable sources. These processes can be realized under far milder conditions than, for example, those of methane steam reforming. The bioethanol steam reforming seems to be more attractive due to the lower toxicity of its aqueous solution (8–12% C2H5OH) which can be used directly for steam reforming [13]. Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) requires substantial energy consumption, as follows obviously from the enthalpy value of the reaction: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O ↔ 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 , Δ H 298 ° = + 173 kJ/mol To increase the product yield the temperature needs to be increased – however, this leads to formation of numerous undesirable by-products [13]. This problem can be successfully solved with the membrane catalysis which allows to remove hydrogen selectively from the reaction zone [14]. Within the last decade a number of communications dedicated to realization of steam reforming process of alcohols in membrane reactors has been published [15–20]. The main advantages of such approach involve both the increase in hydrogen yield and the production of high-purity hydrogen. Quite a number of heterogeneous catalysts were offered by different authors for ESR, in particular, Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt, Ni, Co, Cu on alumina, silica, magnesia, zirconia or ceria [12,13]. One of the problems is deactivation of the catalysts due to carbon deposition at high temperature. The application of supports made from the carbon-based materials (graphite, fullerenes, carbon nanofibers or nanotubes) may solve this problem due to their resistance to carbonization, high specific area, thermal stability and good adhesion to metals [21]. Nanodiamonds can also be considered under this approach. The number of publications dedicated to application of nanoparticles in catalysis is permanently growing [22–24]. Detonation nanodiamonds (DND), or nanodiamonds produced by detonation synthesis technique, represent diamond nanoparticles consisting of carbon atoms in the sp3-hybridization state [25,26]. The outer DND surface is partially oxidized and contains a large number of carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups. This allows the forming of the surface complexes with transition metal ions, which can serve as the precursors of active nanocatalysts for various reactions, electrochemical sensors, etc. Due to the presence of various functional groups and high specific surface area (150–450m2/g), DND are characterized by clearly pronounced sorption properties and can be used as not only support for metal nanocatalysts but also for their own catalytic activity [27–29]. An additional important advantage of DND is their relatively low cost (5Euros per gram); high thermal stability makes them applicable for such high temperature catalytic processes as ESR. The activity of Pt, Ru, Ni, Pt-Ni, and Pt-Ru nanoparticles supported on DND was studied for the first time in a conventional tubular reactor [30]. The main goal of this study was the research of the membrane catalytic process of high-purity hydrogen production using Pt–M alloy (M=Ni, Ru) nanocatalysts deposited on DND in the presence of the commercial dense Pd-Ru membrane with 100% selectivity for hydrogen."
1,Methods and materials,
2,Preparation of catalysts and the procedure for catalytic experiments,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts and the procedure for catalytic experiments The catalysts were prepared by deposition of metal chlorides onto DND followed by IR radiation. A suspension of metal chlorides (Pt with Ru or Ni where the Pt:Ru (Ni) ratio was 9:1) and DND particles in dimethylformamide (DMF) was subjected to ultrasonic dispersion for 10min and dried to a constant weight. Resulting powder was exposed to IR radiation for 2min in an inert atmosphere; the intensity corresponded to the temperature of 700°C. The samples of catalysts with 0.3 and 10wt% of Pt–Ru or Pt–Ni alloys were prepared. A traditional tubular stainless steel reactor (TR) of 7mm diameter was used for ESR in the plug flow apparatus. Samples of catalysts (loading 0.3g; metal content 0.3wt%) mixed with granulated quartz (fraction 1–3mm) were placed into the middle of reactor tube (volume of catalyst bed 4.5cm3). ESR was carried out at temperatures from 350°C to 650°C with a carrier gas (Ar) flow rate of 20cm3/min. The liquid mixture of ethanol and water with the molar ratio of 1:3 or 1:9 was fed by infusion pump P-600 into the evaporator. At the evaporator outlet ethanol and water vapors were mixed with the carrier gas and then fed into the reactor. Vaporous ESR products were condensed at the outlet of the reactor in a glass receiver cooled to 0°C. Uncondensed vapors (water and ethanol) were fed to LHM 8MD chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector (t =160°C, I =80mA, a column with Porapak-T stationary phase, carrier gas He, flow rate 30cm3/min). Methane, CO, and CO2 were analyzed in the same chromatograph with the use of the activated charcoal column. Hydrogen and methane were analyzed with the use of Chrom-4 chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and CaA Zeosorb stationary phase column. The obtained data were treated by using Ecochrom program. The other series of experiments was carried out in the membrane reactor (MR). The samples of catalysts (0.3g, metal content 0.3wt%) mixed with granulated quartz (fraction 1–3mm) were placed into the reaction zone of the membrane reactor consisting of two parallelepiped-shaped stainless steel compartments with the following inner dimensions: 118mm×20.5mm×2mm (reaction zone volume 4.5cm3). The two compartments were divided by a pinhole-free foil membrane of Pd–Ru alloy (6mass% Ru; 118mm×20mm×50μm). Two gaskets made of copper and of graphite ensured that the gaseous streams flowing in the permeate and the reaction zones did not mix with each other in the reactor. Experiments in MR were carried out at the temperatures of 350 and 450°C. The flow of sweep gas on the permeate side (from 40cm3/min to 100cm3/min) allowed to perform hydrogen removal from the reactor. Each experiment was carried out within 3–5h. Regeneration of the catalysts between experiments was carried out by heating in hydrogen for one hour at 450°C. The ethanol conversion degree, X (%), the catalyst selectivity, S (%), and the yield of products, Y i were calculated from the results of analysis by using the following equations: (2) X = φ 0 − φ 1 φ 0 × 100 (3) S i = φ i φ 0 − φ 1 × 100 (4) S H 2 = φ H 2 φ H 2 + 2 φ CH 4 × 100 (5) Y i = φ i φ 0 , where φ 0 and φ 1 are the initial and the resulting ethanol concentrations, respectively; φ i is the ESR product concentration (i =H2, CO, CO2, or CH4). Hydrogen permeability of Pd-Ru membrane was measured directly in the membrane reactor before and after the completion of ESR experiments with Pt-Ru/DND catalyst by feeding the flow of pure hydrogen to the reaction zone and the flow of argon (40cm3/min) to the hydrogen removal zone. Hydrogen permeability constant was calculated by using equation: (6) J [ cm 2 s − 1 bar − 1 / 2 ] = Q × δ S × P 1 − P 2 where Q is hydrogen flux through the membrane, cm3/min; δ – the thickness of membrane, cm; P 1 – hydrogen partial pressure on the input side of membrane, bar; P 2 – hydrogen partial pressure on the output side of membrane, bar; S – membrane area, cm2."
3,Catalysts structure and morphology,"2.2 Catalysts structure and morphology The specific area and porosity of catalyst samples were measured by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption in the porometer ASAP-2020N (Micromeritics Co., USA). The specific surface area was determined by using BET method in the range of relative pressure values from 0 to 1 using the equation for multimolecular steam adsorption. The micrographs of the samples were obtained by using a transmission electron microscope JEM-2100 (Jeol). X-ray analysis of the samples containing 0.3 or 10% of metal catalyst was performed using the diffractometer “Rigaku D/MAX 2200”, CuKα1 radiation. The software package Rigaku Application Data Processing was used for spectra analysis."
4,Results and discussion,"X-ray patterns of Pt-Ru/DND and Pt-Ni/DND samples with 10wt% metal content are similar, both having the peaks corresponding to the diamond and Pt phases (Fig. 1 ). The coherent scattering region for diamond particles is equal to 4.5±0.5nm. For metal particles this value was equal to 11±1nm which is far higher than that for DND. The results of TEM analysis of DND and DND-Pt/Ru nanocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2a and b respectively. As one can see, an average size of DND particles equals to ≈4.5nm (Fig. 2a), while for metal nanoparticles this value was found to be about 3.5–4nm for different samples. At the same time, some particles with higher sizes can also be observed (Fig. 2b). The difference between TEM and X-Ray data is determined by the fact that the intensity of X-ray reflections is higher for large particles. X-ray reflection of Pt-Ru and Pt-Ni nanoparticles cannot be detected when their content in the sample equals to 0.3% and the metal particle size is below the detection level. A similar situation was observed for the metal particles synthesized in the Nafion membrane matrix [31]. At the same time, the sizes of DND particles determined by using both methods appear to be quite close to each other because DND size distribution is quite narrow. It is well known that different facets of the crystal surface are characterized by different structure, heat of adsorption, therefore, they can display different catalytic activity [32]. At the same time, deposition of metal nanoparticles on the structured surface may lead to the different preferential orientation of a metal nanocrystal. From this viewpoint it is important to know which facets predominate on the surface of platinum alloy nanoparticles precipitated on DND support. X-ray diffraction analysis cannot answer this question because of the random orientation of nanoparticles, while the High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) appears to be far more informative in this case. This technique allows to determine the distance between interatomic layers located on the nanoparticles surface. The most frequently observed distances between interatomic layers was determined to equal ≈2.8Å (see Fig. 2b), which corresponds to (110) XRD reflections. They cannot be observed in the Pt X-ray pattern in accordance with the extinction rule. 1.95Å and 2.25Å distances corresponding to (200) and (111) reflections, respectively, are far less common. The experimentally determined specific surface area of catalysts containing 0.3% of metal was equal to 290±5m2/g. After the use of these catalysts in the ESR process this value reduced to 155±3m2/g. However, both of these values are quite low when compared to that calculated for nanoparticles with an average size of 4.5nm (∼500m2/g). This discrepancy can be explained by the partial aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles, which increases in the course of catalytic cycle. The distribution of the ESR reaction products obtained in the tubular reactor for Pt-Ni/DND and Pt-Ru/DND bimetallic catalysts with water/ethanol ratio of 3/1 is shown in Fig. 3 . The ESR by-products can be formed according to the following side reactions [12]: (7) C2H5OH↔CH4 +CO+H2 (8) C2H5OH↔CH3CHO+H2 (9) C2H5OH↔C2H4 +H2O (10) 2C2H5OH↔3CH4 +CO2 (11) C2H5OH↔C+CO+3H2 (12) C2H5OH↔CH4 +C+H2O The products distribution for Pt-Ni/DND and Pt-Ru/DND bimetallic catalysts after ESR in a tubular reactor at the water-to-ethanol ration 3:1 is shown in Fig. 3a and b. Formation of acetaldehyde and ethane was not observed in the course of these ESR catalytic processes. The use of Pt-Ni/DND catalyst in ESR process at low temperatures results in substantially lower hydrogen yields (Fig. 3a) in comparison with Pt-Ru/DND (Fig. 3b). Pt-Ru/DND catalyst has an additional advantage providing a much lower carbon monoxide concentration in the products mixture. CO concentration in the products mixture was close to zero at the temperatures lower than 450°C (Fig. 3b). However, the methane yield increased considerably with a temperature increase for this catalyst. It is likely that a decrease in hydrogen selectivity for Pt-Ru catalyst with temperature (Fig. 3b) is observed due to the increase in selectivity of this catalyst on methane at high temperatures. The CH4 by-product formation observed for noble metal ESR catalysts supported on oxide carriers [12,13] could be explained not only by reactions (7), (10), and (12), but also by methanation of ESR product, CO2: (13) CO2 +4H2 ↔CH4 +2H2O It is known that Ni and noble metal catalysts deposited on oxide supports show high activity in this reaction. One of the methods allowing to suppress this reaction consists in decreasing the ethanol partial pressure [33]. In fact, the use in our experiments of the H2O/ethanol ratio of 9:1 instead of 3:1 decreased methane yield 1.5 times and increased hydrogen yield simultaneously. With high ESR temperature one can suppose the proceeding of direct DND interaction with water vapor. In order to evaluate the possible influence of this process on the distribution of the products, the blank experiment was carried under the same conditions. The main products of this reaction were H2 and CO2. Still, the yields of these products were negligible in the temperature range 350–530°C. Thus, the hydrogen yield was 30 times less in this case than for the ESR on the Pt-Ru/DND catalyst at 530°C. Table 1 shows hydrogen yield at 350 and 450 оC for different water-to-ethanol ratios in the reaction mixture for ESR process carried out in the tubular and membrane reactors. The total ethanol conversion achieved 98–99% at 450°C in the case of the membrane reactor. The following features of ESR process were noted. The hydrogen yield increased with temperature and with an increase in the water-to-ethanol ratio. In accordance with the thermodynamics of the process both of these features seem to be quite natural. At the same time, the total hydrogen yield in the membrane reactor increased as a rule by a factor of 1.5–2 in comparison with ESR in a traditional reactor. Hydrogen removal from the reaction zone through a membrane resulted in a remarkable shift of the equilibrium to the ESR products formation. In the course of our experiments with the Pt-Ru/DND catalyst a hydrogen amount from ∼35% to 60% was selectively removed through the membrane (it is known as the hydrogen recovery factor), thus increasing hydrogen yield substantially in the course of ESR process. Strictly speaking, one cannot exclude the catalytic effect of the membrane used in the process under consideration. We have carried out the blank ESR experiment at 450°C in the membrane reactor in the absence of catalyst. The conversion of ethanol was lower than 1%. Most probably, this is due to the lower surface area of membrane in comparison with that of nanocatalyst (1.3×10−3 vs. 280m2/g, respectively). It is evident that the nature of second component of the alloy affects the productivity of membrane reactor. Pt-Ni/DND catalyst gives higher CO yield and lower selectivity on hydrogen in comparison with Pt-Ru/DND. This appears to be the reason for lower hydrogen recovery factor and, as a consequence, the lower hydrogen productivity of membrane reactor with Pt-Ni/DND catalyst. In all cases the methane yield in membrane reactor increased with an increase in hydrogen yield. This fact allows to suppose that the CC bond breakage proceeds only after the preliminary partial hydrogen elimination from the alcohol molecule. At the same time the formed methane does not take part in further transformations. Membranes made on the basis of platinum metals are known to be poisoned by carbon and carbon monoxide formed in the course of ESR process. However, the use of Pt-Ru/DND catalyst in the membrane reactor for 3–5h in the flow mode did not lead to a decrease in the product yield (see Fig. 4 ). The membrane hydrogen permeability decreases by almost two-fold after 50h online in ESR process with planned regenerations of Pt-Ru catalyst in hydrogen every 3–5h (Fig. 5 ). To prevent the inhibition of ESR process, membrane reactor was subjected to the oxidative regeneration by the air flow at 450°C. As also seen from Fig. 5, after regeneration the value of membrane permeability returns to the initial level. It is probable that a practically constant activity of the Pt-Ru/DND catalyst in our experiment is explained by the sufficiently high rate of hydrogen removal by argon flow. The production of ultra-high purity hydrogen on the output zone is the main advantage of this process when carried out in the membrane reactor. The impurities content in hydrogen did not exceed 0.01%. This result is related on the practically absolute selectivity of hydrogen permeability through the dense Pd alloy membrane [34]."
5,Conclusions,"The study of steam ethanol reforming over Pt–Ni and Pt–Ru alloys supported on DND was carried out in traditional and membrane reactors. The following conclusions can be derived from the obtained results: 1. The best results regarding hydrogen yield and purity are achieved both in traditional and membrane reactors when using Pt–Ru alloy catalysts deposited on DND surface (at total metal content of 0.3% and Pt/Ru=9/1). 2. The use of the membrane reactor allows not only the production of high purity hydrogen but also an increase in the efficiency of ESR process. 3. The high temperature ESR process is characterized by a lower selectivity; however, when the process is carried out at 350°C in the membrane reactor it allows to produce hydrogen of high purity which is about completely free from impurities."
