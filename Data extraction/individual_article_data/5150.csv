0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel because of its clean, sustainable and renewable characteristics, high energy content and lack of CO2 emissions from its combustion. The hydrogen gas can be generated through thermochemical, electrochemical or biological processes. Among the different biological processes, anaerobic biohydrogen production by dark fermentation is, technically, more feasible and recognised as environmentally friendly and cost effective. The process, which relies mainly on fermentative indigenous microorganisms and renewable biomass, can also offer prospects of sustainable energy when used in the treatment of organic waste. Suspended cell culture has been the most frequently used system for H2 production through anaerobic dark fermentation. Suspended systems allow better mass transfer between microorganism and substrate; however, the difficulty in maintaining a sufficient amount of hydrogen-producing bacterial population in the bioreactor at low hydraulic retention time (HRT) encourages researchers to further explore the attached systems. Immobilisation is one of the most promising attached growth systems that could enhance the density of cells and be stably operated at low HRT. The application of these immobilised cells on an industrial scale is more feasible when operated without sterilisation, such as in a fluidised bed [1], packed bed [2] or up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors [3]. Several techniques can be applied to entrap cells, such as surface attachment through physical adsorption [1], gel entrapment [4] and self-immobilised approaches [5]. Many types of immobilised carrier materials, such as activated carbon, pumice stone, ceramic ring and so forth, have been studied for their possible applications in biohydrogen production [1,2]. Activated carbon is one of the most studied materials because of its non-toxicity, good adherence to the seed sludge and higher mobility inside bioreactors. In addition, this matrix has excellent mechanical stability and is nearly non-degradable. The use of activated carbon as a support carrier in immobilisation systems are generally well known in the surface attachment approach; however, the operations conducted were mostly under mesophilic conditions [1,6,7]. There are several reports of attached growth cells that operate under thermophilic conditions [2,8,9]. However, to the extent of our knowledge, the use of immobilised mixed cultures on granular activated carbon (GAC) after operating in repeated batch mode under thermophilic conditions has not yet been reported. Repeated batch cultivation is a feasible method for improving hydrogen productivity, owing to a reduction in lag phase during fermentation and the reuse of the cell, thus minimising the inoculum preparation [10]. In this study, repeated batch cultivation was applied to grow the hydrogen-producing culture on the surface of a GAC support carrier. The screening of efficient hydrogen-producing bacteria from a mixed culture by repeated batch cultivation has become a suitable strategy to avoid variation in the inoculum, thus maintaining high microorganism growth rates [11,12]. As environmental parameters can exert their influences during the immobilisation process in a repeated batch, it is crucial to study the effect of the pH and substrate concentration at the initial stage of development of the GAC-immobilised cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pH, substrate concentration and repeated batch cultivation during the immobilisation of mixed microflora onto GAC under thermophilic conditions using a repeated batch technique. The purpose of this study was to provide good fermentation operating conditions as to promote selective microbes to attach on the GAC pore, that to be used for subsequent fermentation in a large-scale bioreactor. The experimental hydrogen production data obtained at various pH values and substrate concentrations were fitted with a modified Gompertz equation to describe the evolution of hydrogen. The optimal parameters obtained from the batch studies were used to enrich the GAC-immobilised cells, and the feasibility of these GAC-immobilised cells were evaluated in a fluidised-bed column reactor (FBCR). Experiments were conducted with continuous operation in sequential batch mode to determine the optimum HRT for maximum hydrogen productivity of the GAC-immobilised cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Source of H2-producing sludge, carrier support","2.1 Source of H2-producing sludge, carrier support The mixed microflora for biohydrogen production used in this work was an anaerobic sludge from a previous study and was originally obtained from a sludge pit at a palm oil mill plantation in Pulau Carey, Selangor, Malaysia [13,14]. The sludge was pre-treated by heating at 80°C for 60min in a shaking water bath (Model SW22, Julabo, Germany) to inactivate methanogenic bacteria and other non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms prior to batch fermentation. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was used as carrier to immobilise mixed microflora through surface attachment. The method of the immobilisation onto GAC can be found in our recent publication [14]."
3,Medium composition,"2.2 Medium composition The medium used in batch H2 fermentation contained 10g/L (ca. 30±1.5mM) sucrose as the sole carbon and energy source and supplements, including NH4Cl (1g/L), NaCl (2g/L), MgCl2·6H2O (0.5g/L), CaCl2·2H2O (0.05g/L), K2HPO4·3H2O (1.5g/L), KH2PO4 (0.75g/L), NaHCO3 (2.6g/L), cysteine hydrochloride (0.5g/L), yeast extract (2g/L), resazurin (0.5mg/L), trace elements (1mL/L) (R&M Chemical, UK) [15]. This medium composition was applied for all experiments investigating the effect of initial pH, whereas for experiments investigating the effect of initial sucrose concentration, the sucrose concentration in the medium was set in the range of 13–43±1.5mM. The optimum initial sucrose concentration obtained from the batch study was used for controlled experiments using a FBCR with same medium."
4,Batch hydrogen production with different initial pH values and sucrose concentrations,"2.3 Batch hydrogen production with different initial pH values and sucrose concentrations The effect of different initial pH values (pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5) on hydrogen production was investigated at 60°C with an initial sucrose concentration of 10g/L (ca. 30±1.5mM). The optimal initial pH, which gave the maximum hydrogen production and yield, was further used to study the effect of substrate concentration (13, 23, 33 and 43±1.5mM) using sucrose. The repeated batch technique was applied to attach the mixed microflora onto GAC as well as to investigate the favourable environmental conditions in the attached system. For that purpose, batch fermentation was carried out with the optimal pH and sucrose concentration and was switched to a repeated batch mode of operation consisting of five successive batches. The experimental procedure is similar to our previous study [14]. However, instead of keeping 10% of spent medium along with GAC-attached cells from previous batch, this study focused on the efficiency of GAC-attached cells alone. Therefore, entire broth was evacuated after five successive batches and GAC-attached cells were refreshed with new media to obtain the kinetic profile of initial pH and initial sucrose concentration. 2.3.1 Determination of optimal pH To study the effect of the initial pH, the experiment was conducted in a 50mL serum bottle with a working volume of 25mL with 10% (2.5mL) heat-treated POME sludge in the medium. The cells were hosted by adding GAC at a ratio of 1:1 heat-treated POME sludge (mL) to GAC weight (g) in the serum bottle. The effect of the initial pH was studied between pH 5.0 and 6.5 with 0.5 increments using 1M HCl or 1M NaOH. The serum bottles were purged with nitrogen gas to create anaerobic conditions, capped with butyl rubber stopper and clamped with an aluminium cap. The serum bottles were incubated at 60°C in a shaking water bath (Model SW22, Julabo, Germany) at 150rpm. For this series of experiments, the switch from batch to repeated batch operation always occurred 24h after initiation of the batch phase. At the end of the first batch operation, approximately 90% of the volume of the broth was replaced with an equal amount of fresh medium in order to perform subsequent batch fermentations with the reserved GAC and 10% residual broth. Then, the same procedure was repeated for the subsequent batches under the same operating conditions (aforementioned). The repeated batch cultivation process continued for maximum five successive batches for stable hydrogen production at each initial pH to ensure the immobilisation and attachment of active cells onto GAC. In the final fermentation, the entire broth in the serum bottles was evacuated, whereas the GAC was reserved as immobilised inoculum. Fresh medium (25mL) was added into the bottle and was fermented with the reserved GAC-immobilised cells. The composition of gaseous products and liquid samples were monitored at designated time intervals until the biogas stopped being produced. The samples were analysed for gas content, soluble volatile fatty acids and total carbohydrates. The productivity of hydrogen production at each initial pH was compared by batch profiling using a modified Gompertz equation. 2.3.2 Effect of sucrose (substrate) concentration The effect of initial substrate concentration, ranging from 13 to 43 (±1.5) mM sucrose at increments of 10mM, at the optimal initial pH was also studied. The heat-treated POME sludge (1.5mL; 10%) in the medium was inoculated in a 30mL serum bottle containing a 15mL working volume. The ratios of GAC (g) to heat-treated POME sludge (mL) in the serum bottle and subsequent repeated batch procedures were the same as in the study of the effect of initial pH value. However, for batch profiling at different initial substrate concentrations, all broths were evacuated and the GAC-immobilised cells were fermented with 15mL of fresh medium. The gaseous and liquid samples were taken at time intervals for analysis until biogas production stopped. All experiments in the batch fermentation studies were performed in triplicate to confirm the final results; meanwhile, all results presented are the average data of the triplicate. 2.3.3 Effect of repeated batch cultivation The obtained optimal initial pH values and initial substrate concentration were then used to study the effect of repeated batch cultivation. The heat-treated POME sludge (50mL; 10%) in the medium was inoculated in a 1L Duran bottle (Schott, USA) containing a 500mL working volume. The ratios of GAC (g) to heat-treated POME sludge (mL) in the Duran bottle and subsequent procedures were similar to the mentioned above. The repeated batch procedure was carried out for five successive batches for a stable hydrogen production at the optimal pH and sucrose concentration. At the end of five successive batches, the entire broth was evacuated and GAC-immobilised cells were incubated with 500mL of fresh medium. This procedure was repeated for eight batches to examine the stability and durability of the GAC-immobilised cells prior to using it in the bioreactor. This experiment was performed in triplicate to confirm the final results; meanwhile, all results presented are the average data of the triplicate."
5,Setup and operation of the FBCR,"2.4 Setup and operation of the FBCR A laboratory-scale FBCR with a 10L working volume was used in this study. Approximately 450g of clean GAC was used in a 1:1 ratio with heat-treated POME sludge volume (mL), which were enriched and adapted by repeated batch cultivation in several Duran bottles at the optimal initial pH and initial substrate concentration prior to transferring it to the reactor (similar procedure to that described in Section 2.3.3). The FBCR was loaded with approximately 5% (w/v) of the enriched GAC-immobilised cells and 40 floating balls (polypropylene), each with a diameter of 35mm, in 10L of prepared sucrose (5g/L) medium. The reactor was purged with nitrogen gas for 5min to create anaerobic conditions and was operated in sequential batch mode over a wide range of HRTs from 24 to 3h and a cycle time of 24h. The reactor was operated at 60°C and the temperature was maintained by hot-water circulation through the water jacket. Throughout the experiments, the pH of the reaction medium in the reactor was adjusted to 5.5±0.5 by adding 5M NaOH or 5M HCl solutions after each feeding cycle. The pH was not controlled during the fermentation in the FBCR. Experiments were conducted successively to determine the optimum HRT by evaluating the hydrogen performance of the GAC-immobilised cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , the FBCR consisted of two disengaged columns for fermentation, whereby the main column hosted GAC-immobilised cells and the second column functioned as a circulation column. The reactor fluid was intermittently circulated by overflowing the liquid from the first column to the second column to improve contact of the GAC-immobilised cells with the medium. The FBCR system carried out the sequential cycles until the hydrogen performance for each HRT was at steady-state conditions, before switching to a shorter HRT. Liquid samples were taken from a height of 0.2m in the reactor. The evolved gas was trapped at the top of the second column, and the biogas was quantified in terms of the composition of biogas. Sugar content, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and pH were also monitored at designated time intervals."
6,Monitoring and analysis,"2.5 Monitoring and analysis Hydrogen gas production was calculated from headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval as described previously [14]. The concentration of hydrogen gas in the headspace of the reactor was measured using a gas-tight syringe (0.5mL injection volume) and a gas chromatograph (model SRI 8600C, USA) equipped with a helium ionisation detector (HID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Helium (MOX 99.99%) gas was utilised as the carrier gas for the GC measurements. The cumulative hydrogen production in the batch experiment, used to obtain the optimal initial pH and substrate concentration, was determined according to a modified Gompertz equation using Sigma Plot Software 10.0 (Systat Software Inc., USA). Theoretically, the modified Gompertz equation is as follows [16]: (1) H t = H m × exp { − exp [ R m × e H m ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H t is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL), H m is the maximum hydrogen production (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mLh−1), e is Euler’s number with e =2.73 value, λ is the fermentation lag phase (h) and t is the incubation time (h). The fermentation liquid was filtered through a 0.22μm syringe filter before analysis. Soluble VFAs were analysed by HPLC using an Agilent 1100HPLC system (California, USA) with a REZEX ROA column (Phenomenex, USA) equipped with an ultraviolet (UV) detector. Ethanol was determined by HPLC (model Agilent 1200HPLC system; California, USA) with a REZEX ROA column (Phenomenex, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID). The HPLC sample injection volume was 20μL, and the standard curves were generated using different concentrations of ethanol and mixed organic acids. The details of the analytical methods using HPLC were described in our recent work [14]. Sucrose was analysed using the phenol–sulphuric acid method [17]. Bacteria were visualised using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Model Supra 55VP, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). The immobilised GAC cells were fixed with 2% (w/w) glutaraldehyde and left overnight at 4°C. The fixed samples were washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer solution three times and left for 10min between each rinse. Dehydration was performed by successive passage with 30, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100% (w/w) alcohol. The dehydrated particles were then transferred to a critical-point dryer (Model Leica EM CPD 300, Leica Microsystems, Germany) for 1h and the 30min before undergoing sputter-coating with platinum before being analysed by FESEM."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of pH on biohydrogen production by GAC-immobilised mixed culture,"3.1 Effect of pH on biohydrogen production by GAC-immobilised mixed culture The effect of the initial pH on hydrogen production from sucrose by carbon-immobilised mixed microflora is shown in Fig. 2 . Overall, the pH of the fermentative broth dropped to around pH 3.8–4.5 after 48h (Table 1 ). In this study, the initial pH of 5.5 provided the best hydrogen yield of 2.70mmolH2/mmolhexose at a hydrogen production rate of 4.55mmolH2/L/h (Table 1). The optimal initial pH of 5.5, obtained from our batch experiment, was in consensus with reported values using seed sludge [18]. The pH range of 5.5–6.5 is considered weakly acidic, which encourages microorganisms to release express protons from cytoplasm for the enhancement of hydrogen production and resumption of cell growth [18,19]. Additionally, Wang and Wan reported that most of the inoculum from anaerobic sludge efficiently produced hydrogen at optimal pH values of 5.5–6.5 [20]. On the other hand, Hwang et al. found that inhibition of hydrogen production by sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can be substantially suppressed at pH 5.5 [21]. Meanwhile, Abdul et al. reported that cultivation at a high initial pH value of 9.0 could detoxify the inhibitor (primarily furfural content) in oil–palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) molasses [22]. The greater effects of pH on biohydrogen production, is not only to influence hydrogenase activity, but also to change the toxicity of certain harmful substances. An initial pH of 5.0 gave the lowest hydrogen yield of 2.09mmolH2/mmolhexose and a hydrogen production rate of 2.51mmolH2/L/h (Table 1). At an initial pH of 5.0, substantial suppression was noted in the hydrogen production rate [23]. These results illustrate that secretion of acid in the medium can cause accumulation and a sharp drop in the pH value (pH 3.8) of the culture broth, as shown in Table 1. Low pH (3.8) due to acid accumulation destabilises the cell’s ability to maintain the internal pH. This results in the cessation of ATP levels in the cell followed by inhibition of microbial growth and substrate uptake [18]. Therefore, more substrate might be required to maintain bacterial growth under a stressful low-pH environment, which results in a low hydrogen production rate [24]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pH should not be any lower or higher than a certain level to avoid inhibiting hydrogen production by the microbial population. Anaerobic biohydrogen production is usually accompanied with VFAs and solvents, collectively known as soluble microbial products (SMPs). SMPs are considered as beneficial indicators for monitoring hydrogen production performance. In this study, acetic and butyric acids were predominant and comprised of 64–87% of the total end products. The trend of SMPs reflected the metabolic pathway was acidogenic and occurred in parallel with hydrogen production over the entire pH range. The ratio of TVFAs/SMPs for the pH range of 5.5–6.5 did not vary significantly and was essentially within the range of 0.83–0.87 (Table 2 ). Acidogenic pathways for fatty acid (e.g. acetic and butyric acids) production are known to favour hydrogen production [25]. The fatty acids cannot be used by acidogenic bacteria and are excreted. The fermentation at initial pH 5.5 constitutes the highest TVFA value of 45.3mM, which reflects the best pH for hydrogen production performance (Table 2). Meanwhile, the TVFAs/SMPs ratio of 0.64 at an initial pH of 5.0 indicates that the pathway of hydrogen production at that particular pH is close to the solventogenesis pathway rather than acidogenesis. The low pH enhanced the formation of acetic acid and suppressed the formation of butyric acid, thus causing the solvent (e.g. ethanol) to consume the additional free electrons from NADH [18,26]. It is generally known that ethanol and propionic acid do not favour hydrogen production. Chu et al. reported the existence of propionic acid at an initial pH of 5.0 [19]. However, in this study, no propionic acid was detected. Methane gas was also not detected throughout the experiment."
9,Effect of sucrose concentration on biohydrogen production by GAC-immobilised mixed culture,"3.2 Effect of sucrose concentration on biohydrogen production by GAC-immobilised mixed culture Batch fermentation using sucrose at different concentrations, ranging from 13 to 43 (±1.5)mM, was conducted at 60°C with the optimal initial pH value of 5.5, obtained from earlier experiments (Section 3.1). The cumulative hydrogen production volume increased with an increasing concentration of sucrose from 13 to 43mM, as shown in Fig. 3 . The maximum cumulative hydrogen production volume (H m) was obtained at a substrate concentration of 43mM, which accounted for 2193.3mL/Lmedium of H2. Table 3 shows the kinetic analysis based on the modified Gompertz equation. The evolution of H2 from 1583.6 to 2193.3mL/Lmedium with an increase of sucrose concentration showed that the repeated batch approach provides an advantage over dark fermentation by avoiding variation in the inoculum and maintaining the microorganisms at high growth rates [11]. Meanwhile, the effect of initial substrate concentration on the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate (Table 3) exhibited a different pattern to that of the cumulative hydrogen volume (Fig. 3). A decrease in hydrogen yield with a further increase in the initial sucrose concentration (higher than 13mM) was observed, whereas a reduction in the hydrogen production rate was noted when the initial sucrose concentration was higher than 23mM. The drop of hydrogen performance with further increase in the initial sucrose concentration could be attributed to substrate and end-product inhibition. End-product inhibition, such as accumulation of organic acids and alcohols as products of the fermentative metabolism, could also lead to the increase in partial pressure of the fermentation system and prevent further substrate degradation [27]. These negative effects could also impair growth and increase osmolality of the culture medium [28]. Almost complete (95%) substrate consumption was observed in medium supplemented with 13 and 23mM initial sucrose concentrations. However, the substrate degradation was drastically reduced with sucrose concentrations higher than 23mM, as was the hydrogen production rate (Table 3). At concentrations of 33 and 43mM, sucrose was not completely removed (66 and 68% removal, respectively), indicating that any sucrose that was not utilised was retained in the system in quantities as high as 11.2 and 13.8mM, respectively. Consequently, the hydrogen production rate was lower than that obtained at an initial sucrose concentration of 13mM. The incomplete substrate conversion was attributed to an increase in osmolality in the culture medium, owing to the high concentration of solutes present in both the substrate and the end products [28]. End-product inhibition by the acid production leads to a drop in extracellular and intracellular pH, and acts as a stress on the bacterium, thus urges the bacterium to protect itself against the acid stress and switch to solvent production [29]. The TVFA/SMP value of 0.6 (Table 4 ) for an initial sucrose concentration of 33 or 43mM elucidates the aforementioned fact, whereby acids were re-utilised to sustain or increase the surrounding pH and help to relieve the stress on the bacterium. In this study, a similar hydrogen yield (1.5mmolH2/mmolhexose) was obtained in 30mL serum bottles for initial sucrose concentrations of 23 and 33mM (equivalent to 7.8 and 11.3g/L sucrose, respectively) under the optimal pH of 5.5 (Table 3). This value is two times lower than hydrogen production in a 50mL serum bottle with an initial sucrose concentration of 10g/L, which was obtained during the study of the initial culture pH (Table 1). This deviation reflects the influence of culture volume and the headspace ratio on the biohydrogen production performance. The supersaturated hydrogen gas was easily dissolved in the liquid at high substrate concentrations, owing to less available head space in the 30mL serum bottle, thus increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen gas in the head space of the bottles caused hydrogen production to be repressed [30]. Accumulation of high-biomass and organic metabolites, which resulted in unfavourable conditions for further hydrogen evolution in the present batch experimental conditions, could be avoided by applying a continuous-flow or a fed-batch fermentation processes, which were implemented in our FBCR (Section 3.4). Niel et al. reported the inhibition of hydrogen production by a pure culture of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus at a sucrose concentration of more than 25mM under extreme thermophilic (70°C) conditions [28]. Meanwhile, under thermophilic (60°C) operation with a pure culture of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2, the hydrogen performance decreased when the sucrose concentration increased above 20g/L (ca. 58mM) [8]. The hydrogen production rate in this study seemed to drop at initial concentrations above 23mM under thermophilic (60°C) operation by a GAC-immobilised mixed culture. A maximum hydrogen yield of 2.3mmolH2/mmolhexose_consumed was obtained at an initial sucrose concentration of 13mM, whereas a maximum hydrogen production rate of 3.9mmolH2/L/h was obtained at the initial sucrose concentration of 23mM. However, the values of hydrogen production rate obtained from initial sucrose concentrations of 13 and 23mM were not statistically significant different (Table 3). Therefore, the optimum concentration of initial sucrose concentration was chosen to be 13mM, based on the maximum hydrogen yield obtained (Table 3). A TVFA/SMP ratio of 0.8 suggests that hydrogen fermentation from sucrose by GAC-immobilised cells at the optimum initial sucrose concentration of 13mM produced acetic and butyric acids as the main metabolites (Table 4). Kim and Kim examined various carbon sources for biohydrogen production by an anaerobic mixed culture under thermophilic (60°C) conditions and found that sucrose gives the biohydrogen yield of 2.44molH2/molhexose_consumed without pH controlled [31]. However, in terms of immobilised mixed-culture cells, this study is considered to be the first to report anaerobic biohydrogen production using activated-carbon-immobilised cells under thermophilic (60°C) condition, giving a higher hydrogen yield than that achieved under mesophilic conditions."
10,Effect of repeated batch cultivation,"3.3 Effect of repeated batch cultivation Fig. 4 shows the hydrogen production at different batch cultivations, operating at the optimal initial pH (pH 5.5) and substrate concentration (13±1.5mM sucrose) obtained from previous experiments. The repeated batch seemed to exhibit a stable hydrogen production starting from the third cycle of repeated batches. The yields of five successive batches were in the range of 2.6–2.75molH2/molhexose with approximately 44–49% hydrogen content. The repeated batch approach shows promising results and rapidly allows the microorganisms in the culture to adapt to their environment. Mixed cultures generally exhibit lower H2 yields compared to pure cultures, owing to the presence of non-hydrogen-producing or hydrogen-consuming microorganisms. However, the mixed culture from POME sludge that was immobilised onto GAC in the present study could overcome this problem by adapting in the surrounding environment of fermentation through repeated batch cultivation. Fig. 5 shows the predominant species of rod-shaped microorganisms found during hydrogen production from successive repeated batches. From our recent study focusing on the community analysis of the anaerobic sludge from palm oil mill treatment plant, it was found that the predominant species in the reactor effluent was species of Bacillus. Bacillus smithii CMB-B1 and Bacillus coagulans M36 species have been identified to be dominant species responsible for the production of hydrogen. The same sludge was used in this present study. These species can grow at 50–60°C with optimum pH around 5.5–6.5 (Nakamura et al., Grady and Chen) and are capable of producing hydrogen from waste biomass [32,33]. Furthermore, even after evacuating the entire broth and replacing it with totally fresh medium in repeated batch cycles 8–15 (Fig. 4), the hydrogen yield seems to be stable in the range of 2.7–2.8molH2/molhexose, which is similar to that seen in the previous five successive batches that contained 10% of recycled suspended cells of the POME sludge. The stability of the GAC-immobilised cells and the high yield is mainly attributed to good adaptation of the H2-producing microorganisms, which are attached to GAC, to the favourable environment conditions (optimal pH and substrate concentration) of repeated batch mode [34]. Therefore, the repeated batch cultivation approach seems to be successful in enriching the GAC-immobilised cells under the favourable environmental conditions and enhancing the stability and durability of the acclimated immobilised cells prior to using them in the fermenter. O-Thong et al. have reported a study on a pure culture of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 immobilised on heat-treated methanogenic granules with a maximal hydrogen yield of 1.76molH2/molhexose [8]. Yet, the hydrogen yield is lower than the present study with the immobilised mixed culture (2.8molH2/molhexose). The higher yield seems to prove that the repeated batch cultivation was successful in eliminating most of the hydrogen-non-producing bacteria and retaining mostly the hydrogen-producing bacteria. No methane gas was detected in any of the experiments."
11,FBCR: evaluation of reactor performance,"3.4 FBCR: evaluation of reactor performance As shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , stable hydrogen and soluble metabolite end-product formation was observed after feeding for 11 days. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.7mmol/L/h, corresponding to a hydrogen yield of 2.8molH2/molhexose_consumed, was associated dominantly with butyrate, followed by acetate, at a HRT of 12h. At that particular HRT, butyrate and acetate constituted more than 70% of the total soluble end products. The high hydrogen yield was triggered by acidogenic microorganisms accepting extra electrons during the production of VFAs that were mainly dominated by acetic and butyric acids, as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [31]. Theoretically, 2mol H2 is produced from 1mol glucose when butyrate (C4H8O2) is the main fermentation product: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + C 4 H 8 O 2 whereas 4mol H2 is produced in acetate (C2H4O2) fermentation: (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 Meanwhile, at steady state, after the start-up period, a slightly lower yield of 2.1molH2/molhexose_consumed is obtained after a HRT of 24h compared to a HRT of 12h (with 2.7molH2/molhexose_consumed); this may be attributed to low substrate-loading conditions that were needed to maintain cell growth, resulting in lower hydrogen production per substrate present [34]. During the steady state between a HRT of 24 and 6h, the hydrogen content in the gas phase was varied between 48 and 50%. Meanwhile, the H2 production rate was increased when the HRT was decreased from 24 to 12h. However, after changing the HRT to below 12h, the hydrogen production decreased in the range of 0.1–1.9mmol/L/h, corresponding to the lowest rate of hydrogen yield of approximately 0.3molH2/molhexose_consumed at a HRT of 3h. A lower hydrogen yield was associated with the significant decrease in TVFAs, which can be related to the high food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) that lead to lower sugar degradation and lower hydrogen production [35]. At HRT of 3h or 6h, H2 productivity was found to be lower due to the incomplete utilisation of substrate compared to HRT of 12 or even 24h. The shorter period led the microorganisms in the biofilm on activated carbon partially utilise or degrade sucrose and produce less hydrogen which has been explained by the high food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M). This did not happen at longer HRT therefore high hydrogen productivity were obtained for HRT 24 and 12h. As decreasing the HRT to below 12h resulted in lower hydrogen production, the HRT was then increased back to 12h and subsequently to 24h in order to recover the process. The hydrogen production rate further increased, having a similar trend of hydrogen content and metabolites during steady-state conditions at both 12 and 24h HRT. The results indicate that the hydrogenogenic microorganisms attached to the GAC could recover metabolic activity and could be retained in the reactor during the recovery process [3]. The result was in contrast with suspended-cell systems that face the drawback of hydrogen processing failure, owing to hydrogen washout even after the HRT was increased for process recovery [3]. Suspended-cell systems have low cell retention that means the system is unable to retain microorganisms that are growing slower than the dilution rate of the reactor [36]. Table 5 summarises the maximal hydrogen yield by different microorganisms grown on different immobilised carriers using sucrose as the sole carbon source. Notably, activated carbon has been widely recognised as an immobilised carrier in fermentative hydrogen production under mesophilic conditions [1,7,37,38,39]; however, to the extent of our knowledge, the present study seems to be the first to demonstrate fermentative hydrogen production using activated carbon under thermophilic conditions. The present study, with 2.8molH2/molhexose_consumed, gives the highest hydrogen yield among other studies. Furthermore, a support carrier such as activated carbon, which is familiar to high temperatures during its manufacturing process, gives an advantage that makes it a suitable carrier under thermophilic conditions, owing to the strongly heterogeneous surfaces that are ideal for nutrient uptake. Recently, Singh and co-workers have demonstrated the immobilisation of Clostridium sp. LS2 cells by entrapment in polyethylene glycol (PEG) [4,40]. Their study faces difficulty in cell leakage, owing to bead breakage, and they found that a high concentration of PEG (12% w/v) decreased the hydrogen production rate because of diffusional limitations that constrained the transfer of substrate and product through the beads [4]. Despite the entrapment method, granular sludge is also widely used, owing to the high bioactivity of hydrogen-producing bacteria that develop into granules. However, the application of granular sludge is not appropriate in non-sterile continuous hydrogen production under mesophilic conditions, owing to the methanogens that can eventually grow in the attached growth configuration, causing decline in hydrogen performance [3]. Kotsopoulos et al. have successfully demonstrated biohydrogen production under an extreme thermophilic temperature (70°C) in granular up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, using methanogenic granules that were free of methane, with a maximal hydrogen yield of 2.47molH2/molglucose and a maximal hydrogen production rate of 2.3mmolH2/L/h [41]. Yet, the performance was still lower than the present study using the attachment of POME sludge onto GAC as immobilised cells. Table 6 summarises the soluble end products at the steady state for each HRT. The TVFAs/SMP for HRTs of 24–6h were approximately 0.7, which depict an acidogenic phase that favours the production of VFAs and hydrogen gas. The main metabolites produced (butyrate and acetate) were in line with another study using mixed culture from POME under thermophilic conditions at pH 5.5 [42]. In addition to Enterobacter and Clostridium species, several Bacillus species have already been reported as producing hydrogen in anaerobic digester. The dominant soluble metabolites were acetic acid and butyric acid in the culture supernatant suggested that the acidogenesis pathway was favoured to produce higher amounts of biohydrogen. The prevalence of acetic acid and butyric acid and ethanol was supported by the study of Kotay and Das using B. coagulans IIT-BT SI during fermentative biohydrogen production [43]. Notably, at a HRT of 3h, the TVFA/SMP ratio was 0.09. The lower sugar degradation caused by the high F/M ratio at a HRT of 3h, resulting in impaired cellular metabolism, thus decreases the hydrogenase activity and alters the metabolic pathway to solvent production (solvetogenic phase) [27]. The trend was similar to other reports using a mixed culture that showed, by shortening the HRT, butyric-acid-type fermentation was shifted to ethanol-type fermentation [24]. The HRT seems to influence the production of soluble end products in fermentative hydrogen production [44]. Kim and Kim studied thermophilic fermentative hydrogen production from various carbon sources by anaerobic mixed culture [31]. The results show that, even using the same type of inoculum, different metabolite distributions were obtained among the various carbon sources, which might be caused by different metabolic pathways and the complexity of the involved enzymes [31]. As far as the experiments were conducted using granular activated carbon (GAC), we were not been able to measure the cell growth of the immobilised microbes and to provide data separately. However, from biofilm roughness observation, which we had examined it using Atomic force microscopy, we noticed that there is correlation between biofilm roughness and the deposition of microorganisms developed during biohydrogen production, which occurred at different interval of time at of optimal pH 5.5. This observation has been drawn similarly by Oh et al. [45]. They concluded that difference in roughness measured over a certain period of time showed most deposition of microorganisms had occurred rapidly. The adhesion of biofilm can be correlated significantly with the content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP). Carbon balance for the sugar conversion to products was calculated by converting amount of sugars consumed and generated products based on the amount of actual acids produced. In general, lower yield of hydrogen per mole glucose compared to the theoretical maximal value as in Eqs. (1) and (2) can be explained by the consumption of substrate for microbial growth and maintenance instead of being fully channelled to final product reactions. In this study, the mass balance data taking account of the 10–15% carbon being used up for biomass growth. This range is in agreement with Kim et al. who reported that 11% of the sucrose used as substrate was diverted into microbial biomass [46]. More recently, Kongjan et al. considered 15% of the sugars being converted to cell mass during thermophilic fermentation which is in consensus with Kotsopoulos et al. reporting approximately 14–16% of the carbon source for microbial biomass [34,41]. The results of carbon mass balance for FBCR at HRT 12h and 24h showed that the agreement was high (>90%), indicating the experimental measurements were accurate (Table 7 ) [47]. In this study, no methane was detected throughout the study. Even though no pH control was performed throughout the operational period, the thermophilic operation temperature gives an advantage for the system to reduce the risk of contamination by methanogenic archaea. The pH was not maintained to keep the alkali addition minimal and also to rely on the resistance of GAC-immobilised cells against pH fluctuations. This strategy would further help to operate the system running at low pH in larger scale. Furthermore, as a sufficient amount of buffering capacity was provided with the influent, the system could sustain the pH throughout operation."
12,Conclusions,"The enriched GAC-immobilised cells used in this study can produce a methane-free biogas with a hydrogen content of up to 50%. The optimal conditions for producing hydrogen from sucrose using GAC-immobilised cells at 60°C were achieved at an initial pH of 5.5 and an initial substrate concentration of 13±1.5mM (sucrose). Repeated batch cultivations have shown to enhance biohydrogen production and the durability of the enriched GAC-immobilised cells in FBCR for up to almost 3 months continuous operation. The feasibility of the GAC-immobilised cells were examined in a FBCR at a HRT between 24 and 3h. The maximum hydrogen yield was obtained at a HRT of 12h with 2.8molH2/molhexose_consumed. These results indicate that the GAC–FBRC system is suitable and may be superior to most immobilised processes in terms of hydrogen yield, as reported so far."
