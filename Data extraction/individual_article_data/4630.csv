0,Introduction,"Bioenergy is seen as one of the key options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and the dependency of fossil fuels [1]. Among the possible energy alternatives, hydrogen energy has a higher energy yield (122MJ/kg) than other hydrocarbon fuels and produces only water without carbon combined end products, when it combusted as a fuel or converted to electricity via fuel cell. Therefore, hydrogen is expected to play a major role in future energy supply [2,3]. To make the concept of “hydrogen economy” a reality, innovation of technologies leading to sustainable, sufficient, and economically feasible production of H2 is essential [4]. Commercialized H2 production methods rely mainly on thermochemical conversion of fossil fuels, while biological H2 production is still under development, although it is considered more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive [5–7]. Among the bioH2 production approaches, dark (light-independent) and photo (light-dependent) fermentations using low-cost or waste organic substrates are of particular interest due to their high economic feasibility and dual function of waste reduction and clean energy production [8–12]. Dark fermentation involving mainly acidogenic bacteria produces H2 while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids and alcohols [13,14]. Photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., purple nonsulfur bacteria) utilize the end products of dark fermentation, converting them into H2 via photo-fermentation with simultaneous VFA reduction [15–20]. The major limitation of photo-fermentation systems is its poor H2 production rate due primarily to slow growth of photosynthetic bacteria and low light conversion efficiency of photobioreactor (PBR) [10,21–24]. Thus, while combination of dark and photo-fermentations seems to be an ideal biohydrogen producing model leading to the highest theoretically and practically H2 yield [19,25–29], photo-fermentation may act as a rate limiting step for the overall hydrogen producing process. Among all the light sources available, solar light energy is the most abundant natural light source on earth (ca. 5.7×1024 Jyear−1) [30]. There are many advantages of using the sunlight; it is cost free and contains full spectrum of light energy [31]. Therefore, sunlight is commonly used as the energy source for the growth of photosynthetic bacteria [32]. Most commercial cultivation of photosynthetic bacteria are carried out in open ponds, but the performance of these outdoor systems are usually poor, time consuming and requires large area of land. There are also problems of being difficult to control the culture conditions, contamination, unstable light supply and intensity, and uneven light distribution [33–36]. The foregoing problems can be solved by using indoor photobioreactors [7], which are usually more efficient and easier to control [37]. However, the major obstacle of applying indoor photobioreactors is the high power consumption and high operation cost due to the need of artificial light sources. To improve the light efficiency with a lower cost is an essential step towards the development of a successful indoor phototrophic H2 production process. To capture the advantages of both indoor and outdoor photobioreactor systems, we developed a novel solar-energy-excited optical fiber photobioreactor, in which the sunlight was introduced into the indoor photobioreactors for illumination. Our previous work showed that the addition of optical fiber into photo-fermentation broth as the internal light sources could markedly stimulate cell growth and H2 production in photo-fermentation [5,7,19,38]. However, in those studies, the optical fibers were excited by artificial light, thereby being cost intensive and less feasible for commercial applications. In the present study, we further developed a novel and more cost-effective illumination system by using optical fibers excited by sunlight as the internal illumination system in contrast to the artificial light sources due to which less consumption of electricity observed. This motivated us to examine whether combined optical fiber and sunlight collecting system could also promote phototrophic H2 production by R. palustris WP3-5. In addition, since sunlight is usually very unstable, a light dependent resistor (LDR) was installed for online monitoring and control of the irradiation intensity on the photobioreactor. In this new photobioreactor, the sunlight carried by optical fibers was used for daytime illumination. Whenever solar light intensity decreased below a set value (due to cloudy/rainy days and at night), the artificial light source (tungsten filament lamp) automatically switched on, thus ensuring continuous and sufficient light supply toward the reactor. Hence, the H2 yield can be improved and the cost of energy consumption can be reduced. In this study, the feasibility of using this novel photobioreactor system for photo-H2 fermentation was demonstrated using an indigenous R palustris WP3-5 strain."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium,"2.1 Microorganism and medium The phototrophic H2 producer used in this study was R palustris WP3-5, which was isolated from a swine wastewater treatment plant in central Taiwan [39]. The culture medium for the strain consisted of (in g/l) acetate (HAc), 31.4mM; glutamic acid, 0.4; K2HPO4, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; iron citrate solution (1.0g/l), 5ml/l; trace element solution, 1ml. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2·4H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; CoCl2·6H2O, 200; CuCl2·2H2O, 20; NiCl2·6H2O, 20; NaMoO4·2H2O, 40; HCl (25%), 1ml/l. The cells were grown anaerobically (with argon gas sparging the medium to create an anaerobic condition for cultivation) at pH 7.0, 32°C for 48h under illumination with tungsten filament lamps (light intensity=50W/m2)."
3,Photobioreactor setup and operation,"2.2 Photobioreactor setup and operation As shown in Fig. 1 , the photobioreactor was a 2.7-l glass-made vessel illuminated with solar-energy-excited side-light optical fiber and external light sources (100W tungsten filament lamp). Two pieces of SEEOFs protected in a glass tube immersed into the liquid medium inside the photobioreactor. Since the SEEOFs did not have direct contact with the medium, there was no need to autoclave the optical fibers prior to use. The SEEOFs were made of quartz glass (diameter: 11mm, length: 5 and 50cm) obtained from Laforet Engineering Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The side-light optical fiber was excited by sunlight collecting system (Laforet Engineering Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). The sunlight was collected by using 12 specific Fresnel lenses and then transmitted through an end-light optical fiber with a diameter of 1mm. The light tracking system makes each Fresnel lenses rotate toward the position of sun so that the SLOF could gain maximum light energy from sunlight during the daytime. The six end-light optical fibers from six Fresnel lenses were made into a bundle and connected to a sunlight collecting point. Afterward the collected light sources transmitted through an end-light optical fiber toward solar-energy-excited optical fiber (SEEOF). After autoclave sterilization of the bioreactor, R. palustris WP3-5 cells were inoculated (10% inoculum) into the reactor. Both batch and continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) were conducted. For continuous cultures, the feeding medium contained an HAc concentration of 31.4mM. The photo-fermentation was carried out at a light intensity of (95W/m2) with the illumination of tungsten filament lamps as the external light sources. The internal light source was solar-energy-excited side-light optical fiber (SEEOF) whose light intensity varied within the range of 0–350W/m2 depending on the weather and time. Both batch and continuous (CSTR) cultures had a working volume of 1800ml and the CSTR was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 48h. The operation condition for all the cultures was 32°C, pH 7.1, and 200rpm agitation. A gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to measure the amount of gas products generated and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25°C and 760mmHg. Gas samples were taken by gas syringe at desired time intervals to measure the gas composition. The liquid sample was also collected from the reactor as a function of time to determine cell concentration, pH and residual acetate concentration. For batch cultures, time-course data of cumulative H2 production were simulated by modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [40,41] to determine the kinetic parameters of photo-H2 production. (1) H = H max exp { − exp [ R max · ⅇ H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H denotes cumulative H2 production (ml), H max denotes maximum cumulative H2 production (ml), R max denotes maximum H2 production rate (ml/h), t denotes culture time (h), λ denotes the lag time required for the onset of H2 evolution (h) and e denotes the natural exponential base with a value of 2.718. For continuous operation, batch cell growth was performed initially until reaching late exponential growth phase. The medium was then fed continuously at an HRT of 48h."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Cell concentration of the culture was regularly monitored by measuring optical density at 660nm (i.e., OD660), which was converted to dry cell weight (DCW) concentration via proper calibration (1.0 OD660 approximately equals 4.47g dry cell/l). Acetate (HAc) concentration was determined by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID). The detailed procedures for GC analysis were described in our recent work [7,42]. The gas products (H2 and CO2) were also analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector following the same procedures given in our recent reports [7,42]. All of the data were average values of either duplicate or triplicate runs. The deviation of the data ranged from 3 to 11%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of solar-energy-excited optical fiber on phototrophic H2 production,"3.1 Effect of solar-energy-excited optical fiber on phototrophic H2 production Table 1 describes the performance of photo-H2 production in photobioreactors illuminated with TL or OF(sunlight) by using different light sources' arrangement during daytime or night time. Combining OF(sunlight) with TL (denotes as OF(sunlight)/TL) resulted in much better total H2 evolution ( V H 2 ) , cell concentration, overall H2 production rate ( v H 2 ) and H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) than those obtained from the control culture (using TL/TL alone). Time-course profiles of H2 evolution are illustrated in Fig. 2 , indicating that OF(sunlight)/TL exhibited the highest H2 production (H max) of 98.0ml, followed by 33.6 and 41.1ml obtained from using OF(sunlight)/none and TL/TL, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 1). During the course of batch fermentation, the pH did not vary significantly (maintaining at 7.0–7.6 in all runs). As shown in Fig. 2a, the H2 evolution stopped in the night time because there was no sunlight at night, indicating that light energy supply is necessary for photo-H2 production. Although using TL/TL alone as light sources was still able to produce ca. 41ml of H2, the overall H2 production rate ( v H 2 ) was much lower than OF(sunlight)/TL (Fig. 2c and Table 1). Also, according to the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)), using OF(sunlight)/TL gave a higher R max (2.18ml/h) (representing the kinetic characteristics of H2 production) and H max (105ml) (Table 1). Moreover, using TL alone as the external light source had a problem with a rapid decrease in the light intensity due to the shielding effects arising from increases in the concentration of cells and products or from formation of biofilm on the surface of reactor vessels. Thus, using TL alone gave rise to limited H2 production due primarily to the poor light penetration when the cell concentration became higher. In contrast, although minor biofilm formation was also observed on the optical fibers, it did not considerably affect its light penetration. Moreover, as the side-light optical fiber was directly immersed into the photobioreactor, the formation of biofilm on vessel wall had no effect on the irradiation from optical fibers. Using OF(sunlight)/none (no illumination at night) resulted in the lowest cumulative H2 production, final cell concentration and H2 yield. These results are quite expectable since a shorter total illumination time (27h) was used when compared to 63h for the other two illumination strategies (Fig. 2). However, from the aspect of electricity consumption, using OF(sunlight) alone is a sustainable and economical way of photo-H2 production. The electricity consumption for different light sources' arrangement decreased in the order of TL/TL (5kW-h)>OF(sunlight)/TL (2.81kW-h)>OF(sunlight)/none (0.00843kW-h). The foregoing results indicate that combining sunlight collecting system and optical fiber could markedly enhance H2 production performance in all categories (Table 1)."
7,Effect of scale-up operation and light sources' arrangement on phototrophic H2 production,"3.2 Effect of scale-up operation and light sources' arrangement on phototrophic H2 production Conventional large-scale photobioreactors are usually performed outdoors using direct sunlight illumination [43,44]. The outdoor photobioreactors have drawbacks like contamination problems in open system, direct exposure to UV irradiation, instability of solar energy supply, requiring a large area of land, and decrease of light intensity within the photobioreactor due to rapid light attenuation in the culture broth. These problems severely limit the light conversion efficiency and productivities of outdoor photobioreactors. In this study, sunlight was collected and transferred to the indoor photobioreactor through optical fibers (used as the internal light source) for photo-H2 production. The effect of light source arrangement was also examined to identify the most efficient and energy saving way of photo-H2 production. The light sources' arrangement for the day/night illumination (Table 2 ) was as follows: (a) day: OF(sunlight), night: none (OF(sunlight)/none), (b) day: OF(sunlight), night: TL (OF(sunlight)/TL), (c) day: TL, night: TL (TL/TL), and (d) day: OF(sunlight)–TL, night: TL (OF(sunlight)–TL/TL). Meanwhile, the working volume was increased from 50ml to 1800ml. Acetate (30.3mM) was used as the sole carbon source for photo-H2 production. The length of optical fiber was also increased from 5cm to 50cm. The photobioreactor configuration and distance from the reactor wall to the optical fiber (d OF) are the key factors affecting the efficiency of photo-H2 production. The large-scale photobioreactor (1800ml working volume) was constructed based on the optimal d OF of 25mm (data not shown) while the d OF was shorter (11.5mm) for the small scale photobioreactor (50ml working volume). The resulting photo-H2 production performance is shown in Table 2, while time-course profiles of H2 evolution, HAc concentration and light intensity for the different light sources' arrangement are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Using OF(sunlight)–TL/TL appeared to give a much higher total H2 evolution of 3528ml, followed by 2706, 2844 and 376ml obtained from using OF(sunlight)/TL, TL/TL and OF(sunlight)/none, respectively. This was due primarily to the fact that combining OF(sunlight)–TL and TL could provide sufficient light energy needed for both cell growth and photo-H2 production. Using OF(sunlight)–TL/TL also gave the highest R max and H max of 71.4ml/h and 3716ml, respectively (Table 2). The lag time was similar (λ =13–15h) for all light source arrangements. The high R 2 values (Table 2) indicate that the modified Gompertz equation is well suited to describe the time-course profiles of phototrophic H2 production by R. palustris WP3-5. It is also worth noting that cumulative H2 production was the lowest with the illumination of OF(sunlight)/none (Fig. 3a), indicating the requirement of sufficient light energy supply for efficient photo-H2 production. However, comparing OF(sunlight)/TL with TL/TL, the cumulative H2 evolution for OF(sunlight)/TL is lower than TL/TL. This may be due to significant fluctuation of light intensity of sunlight in the daytime depending on the weather, season, and time. Moreover, illumination with OF(sunlight) has been very helpful for energy saving while applying to H2-producing photobioreactor."
8,Effect of light dependent resistor (LDR) on phototrophic H2 production,"3.3 Effect of light dependent resistor (LDR) on phototrophic H2 production Since the light intensity of sunlight varied greatly with the weather, season, solar spectrum and operation time, the light supply of solar-energy-excited optical fiber (SEEOF) systems was unstable. To solve this problem, the photobioreactor was equipped with a light dependent resistor (LDR), which could monitor the light intensity supply from SEEOF online and turn on the compensative artificial light sources automatically to maintain a total light intensity of greater than 30W/m2 toward the photobioreactor. This is a ‘one-stone-two-bird’ strategy, since the light energy supply can be maintained at a sufficient level and the external light source was turn on only when needed, leading to a significant saving of electricity required for artificial light sources. Time-course profiles of H2 evolution of using the LDR system are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The results show that the photo-H2 production increased steadily with operation time. Comparing Figs. 3b and 4 for the same light source arrangement, the photo-H2 production was quite stable and was not significantly influenced by weather and time when using LDR. This result indicates the effectiveness of using LDR for providing sufficient and stable light energy continuously during the daytime. Table 2 shows that using OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR, the cumulative H2 production (26.8%) and H2 yield (26.7%) significantly increased, when compared to the values obtained from OF(sunlight)/TL without LDR. The cumulative H2 production and H2 yield of using OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR were even higher with using OF(sunlight)–TL/TL (Table 2) due probably to the marked variation in sunlight intensity of the two experiments. Thus, combining OF(sunlight) with LDR seems to be a favorable choice for improving phototrophic H2 production rate and saving energy cost. It is noted that the light intensity of sunlight varied greatly with the weather and operation time, resulting in an unstable light intensity from SEEOF systems. It is very difficult to show in Fig. 4 when the light intensity was lower than 30W/m2 during the period of daytime. For this reason, a galvanometer was used to monitor the electricity consumption for the different light source arrangements. Based on the electricity consumption, we confirmed that LDR did turn on the TL light during daytime and was able to estimate the total irradiation time of TL light. This study appears to be one of the pioneer reports raising the idea of combining solar-energy-excited optical fiber and the online control of stable light energy supply with LDR for photo-H2 production."
9,Stability of photo-H2 production during CSTR operations,"3.4 Stability of photo-H2 production during CSTR operations To assess the feasibility for commercial applications of the phototrophic H2 production system developed from the present work, the aforementioned photobioreactor using continuous mode (HAc concentration=31.4mM, working volume=1800ml) was performed to explore the long-term operation on stability assessment under the optimal light source arrangement (OF(sunlight)/TL with an LDR). The continuous culture was controlled at 48h HRT, reaching a steady state within two days in terms of H2 production rate (Fig. 5 ). At 48h HRT, the continuous culture achieved a high hydrogen production rate (32.4ml/l/h) and H2 yield (2.93mol H2/mol HAc) during the period of 15-day operation. Meanwhile, the cell concentration reached a nearly constant value of 5.51g/l. The H2 content in biogas was nearly constant at 88.1±2.5%. Higher H2 content in the biogas would simplify the downstream H2 purification procedures, thereby benefiting the follow-up application of H2 in clean energy processing (e.g., electricity generation via fuel cell). Although the conditions of the continuous culture have not yet been optimized, the photo-hydrogen production performance is still superior to most of reported values from relevant studies (Table 3 and Fig. 5). This suggests the potential of using the proposed novel photobioreactor for commercial H2 production."
10,Performance assessment of the present phototrophic H2 production system,"3.5 Performance assessment of the present phototrophic H2 production system The optimal light sources' arrangement (OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR) gave a highest H2 yield (2.93mol H2/mol HAc) and overall H2 production rate (32.4ml/l/h), respectively (Table 3). The H2 yield is 73.3% of the theoretical value (4.0mol H2/mol HAc) derived from Eq. (2), [27,45]. (2) CH3COOH+2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 The H2 yield (73.3%) obtained from this work is the highest yield ever attained for a carrier-free photo-H2 fermentation when compared with reported values in the literature (Table 3), whereas a higher yield (ca. 90%) could be obtained in a clay carrier assisted photo-fermentation system with the R. palustris WP3-5 strain [38]. In addition, the electricity consumption of using OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR for photo-H2 production decreased nearly 55.7% in contrast with that of using external light source alone (TL/TL), suggesting the feasibility of energy saving of the novel illumination system. The overall H2 production (32.4ml/l/h) is also higher than the reported values by using sunlight as light sources (Table 3). The H2 yield and photo-H2 production rate are the two key parameters for bioreactor design in developing high-yield and low-cost bioH2 production system [11,46]. The proposed solar-energy-excited optical fiber photobioreactor coupled with LDR appears to be capable of attaining high-rate and high-yield phototrophic H2 production at the same time."
11,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated a feasible approach to improve light source efficiency and reduce electricity expenses for cost-effective photo-H2 production process. A novel solar-energy-excited optical fiber photobioreactor equipped with light dependent resistor (LDR) was shown to effectively enhance the phototrophic H2 production. The photobioreactor was illuminated by combinative light sources including optical fiber excited by solar energy (internal light source) as well as external irradiation of tungsten filament lamp. Illumination with OF(sunlight)/TL system was effective in promoting H2 production, resulting in a 1.38 and 1.36-fold increase in cumulative H2 production and H2 yield, respectively, when compared with using illumination with TL/TL. The pitfall of fluctuating light intensity while using OF excited with sunlight can be avoided by using a light dependent resistor (LDR), which could online monitor and control the total light intensity irradiating on the surface of photobioreactor. By coupling the LDR device, photobioreactors illuminated by OF(sunlight)/TL obtained a further 26.8% and 26.7% increase in the cumulative H2 production and H2 yield, respectively, when compared to that without LDR. It was concluded that OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR is much better than other light sources' arrangement in terms of photo-H2 production performance as well as energy saving. To our knowledge, this is one of the earliest reports describing the concept and application of using OF(sunlight)/TL with LDR for photobioreactor illumination strategy leading to improved photo-H2 production efficiency."
