0,Introduction,"With the gradual exhaustion of fossil fuels, the vital drive towards the exploration of sustainable lignocellulosic biomass as an efficient renewable instead of conventional petroleum-based products has gained an increase interest for the global sustainable development (Gomez Bernal et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2019b; Qiu et al., 2020b; Sindhu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020). Lignocellulosic materials, which consist of three major components (Lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose), are known as renewable and abundant feedstocks for manufacturing highly value-added functional materials, biofuels, adsorbents and biobased chemicals. Hemicellulose, second to cellulose in abundance, differs greatly from cellulose. It is a heteropolymer with side-chains and is mainly composed of pentoses (xylans), which is widely utilized to produce numerous high-value-added platform molecules (Gürbüz et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019). Xylan, as one of important pentose, can be acid-hydrolyzed to D-xylose which is subsequently catalyzed to furfural (FUR) via dehydration. FUR is a versatile molecule with various industrial applications, which is utilized as raw material for manufacturing food additives, biofuels, resins, plastics, polymers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (Eseyin & Steele, 2015; Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). It is a precursor used to synthesize furan-based chemicals such as furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and furoic acid (FA) (Weingarten et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020). Intensive efforts have been devoted to establishing numerous thermo-chemical processes for manufacturing FUR using mineral acids, organic acids, inorganic salts, ionic liquids, metal oxides, and solid acids as catalysts (Choudhary et al., 2013; Dias et al., 2007; He et al., 2017; Li et al., 2014). Industrially, mineral acids such as H2SO4 and HCl are known as the most common homogeneous acid catalysts for catalyzing biomass, xylan or D-xylose into FUR, which have brought several issues in terms of equipment corrosion, high operational costs, and waste disposal. For address above-mentioned drawbacks, heterogeneous solid acids (e.g., metal oxides, MCM-41-supported niobium-oxide, SBA-15-SO3H, styrenesulphonic acid, mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41, sulfonated montmorillonite, and biochar) (García-Sancho et al., 2013; Sádaba et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012) have gained widespread attention recently due to their large surface area, strong acidity, low corrosion, easy separation, and high thermostability (Sudarsanam et al., 2018). Furfuryl alcohol (FFA), a versatile bio-based furan chemical, is widely utilized in manufacturing hypergolic rocket fuels (HRF), casting/foundry resins (CFR), flame-resistant composites (FRC), coatings, polymers, adhesives, cements, etc. (Di et al., 2018; Eseyin & Steele, 2015; Iroegbu & Hlangothi, 2019; Pereza and Fraga, 2014). Cu/SBA-15-SO3H catalyst catalyzed D-xylose to FFA with 63% yield for 6 h at 140 °C and 4 MPa in n-butanol-water media (Deng et al., 2020). UiO-66 (75 mg) catalyzed 20 mmol FUR to FFA with 71% yield in 25 mL organic amine at 170 °C for 10 h (Qiu et al., 2020a). Ni3Sn2 IMC gave 99% selectivity at 2 MPa and 100 °C toward FUR hydrogenation to FFA (Yang et al., 2019). The development of envionmentally-friendly process for catalyzing FUR to FFA is urgently needed. In the past few decades, a sustainable and green alternative exists in the biocatalysis and biotransformation that conducts bioreactions with much higher selectivity and higher catalytic efficiency under mild conditions (Bu et al., 2020; Ema et al., 2008). M. deltae growth cells catalyzed 10 mM FUR to FFA at 100% yield (Belay et al., 1997). S. cerevisiae wholly transformed 30.0 mM FUR to FFA (Liu et al., 2005). M. guilliermondii catalyzed 50.0 mM FUR into FFA at 83% yield (Li et al., 2017). B. coagulans converted 208.0 mM FUR into FFA with 86% yield in water − dioctyl phthalate media (Bu et al., 2020). Recently, the dehydration of carbohydrates from forest and agricultural biomass has been extensively studied (Choudhary et al., 2013; Sahu and Dhepe, 2012; Weingarten et al., 2011). FUR can be produced from pentose in lignocellulosic materials such as corncob (CC), oat hull (OH), and cottonseed hull bran (CHB) catalyzed by acids (Zhang et al., 2013). CC is one of the most abundant agricultural residues worldwide, which is composed of cellulose (39–45%), hemicellulose (25–35%), lignin (17–21%) and low amounts of ash and extractives. In this study, CC was catalyzed into FUR by newly synthesized sulfonated Sn-zeolite catalyst, and CC-derived FUR was attempted to catalyze into FFA by an NADPH-dependent reductase from Candida glabrata. The important chemical catalytic parameters (e.g., Sn-zeolite dose, catalytic temperature, catalytic time, etc.) on the production of FUR and whole-cell biocatalytic parameters (e.g., cell dosage, cosubstrate glucose dose, NADP+ loading, biocatalytic temperature, biocatalytic pH, metal ion, surfactant, FUR loading, etc.) on the FUR-reducing activity were evaluated. Finally, a sustainable chemoenzymatic pathway for FFA synthesis from CC was designed in a tandem catalytic reaction with sulfonated Sn-zeolite and NADPH-dependent reductase catalyst."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corncob (CC) (29.7 wt% glucan, 34.1 wt% xylan and 17.0 wt% lignin) was collected from village of Jintan (Jiangsu Province, P.R. China). Zeolite was purchased from Henno purification Co., Ltd. (Henan Province, P.R. China). Furfural (FUR), glucose, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polyoxyethylene(60) sorbitan monooleate (Tw-60), polyoxyethylene(80) sorbitan monooleate (Tw-80), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), polyethylene glycol-1000 (PEG-1000), polyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG-2000), polyethylene glycol-4000 (PEG-4000), polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000), NH3·H2O (25 wt%), ethanol, AlCl3, BaCl2, CuCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, CrCl3·6H2O, FeCl2, FeCl3, MgCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, SnCl4, ZnCl2 and other chemicals were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, P.R. China)."
3,Synthesis of heterogeneous Sn-zeolite,"2.2 Synthesis of heterogeneous Sn-zeolite 2.8 g tin tetrachloride (SnCl4), 8.4 g zeolite and 140.0 g ethanol were thoroughly mixed under continuous mechanical stirring. The pH value of this mixture solution (A) was regulated to reach 6.0 by dropping NH3·H2O (25.0 wt%). This pH-adjusted mixture solution (B) was placed in an oven and kept dry at 70 °C till constant weight and further dried for another 15 h at 90 °C. 120 mL H2SO4 (0.50 M) soaked dried solid powder for 3 h, then this sulfonated material was isolated by filtration and washed with more water to neutrality. Wet solid was dried in a 110 °C oven for 3 h at and further dried in a muffle furnace for another 3 h at 500 °C. Sulfonated Sn-zeolite was collected for catalyzing CC into FUR."
4,Catalysis of milled CC into FUR,"2.3 Catalysis of milled CC into FUR 3.75 g milled CC, 50 mL water and Sn-zeolite (0–6.0 wt%) were added into a 100-mL high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) stainless-steel reactor (Zhengjiang Jingkou Dantu Huanqiu Electrical Instrument, P.R. China). After the catalysis by stirring (500 rpm) at 160, 170 and 180 °C for 5–60 min of incubation, this HTHP reactor was soaked in ice-cold water. FUR yield (YFUR ) was obtained as below equation: FUR y i e l d ( % ) = FUR p r o d u c e d ( g ) × 0.88 CC ( g ) × 0.341 × 150 96 × 100"
5,Construction of recombinant reductase strain,"2.4 Construction of recombinant reductase strain Enzyme genes of NADPH-dependent reductase (CgCR) from Candida glabrata CGMCC 2.234 and glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium (BmGDH) (GenBank: SUV21072.1) were synthesized by Genecreate Co., (Wuhan, P.R. China). To establish an affective pathway for bioreduction of FUR, the GDH was introduced for internal cofactor (NADP+/NADPH) regeneration and coexpressed in E. coli with CgCR. pRSF-F (AGCCAGGATCCGAATTCGAGC) and pRSF-R (GTGGTGATGATGGTGATGGCTGC) were designed to linearize pRSFDuet-1 backbone. primers CgCR_F (CACCATCATCACCACATGGCTGCTCTACATAAGAACACTTCTACTTTG) and CgCR_R (ATTCGGATCCTGGCTTTACACAAATGGCTTAAATGGCCCCC) were designed to amplify CgCR. primers GDH_F (CTAAGGAGATATATCATGTATACAGATTTAAAAGATAAAGTAGTAGTAATTACAGGTGG) and GDH_R (GATATATCTCCTTAGGTACCTTACACAAATGGCTTAAATG) were designed to amplify GDH. After CgCR, GDH and linearized pRSFDuet-1 were purified from gels, these three fragments were assembled together with T5 exonuclease by transforming E. coli DH5α chemically competent cells. GDH and CgCR were inserted into MCS-1 site (multiple cloning site 1) in pRSFDuet-1 following His-tag under the control of an isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 promoter to give pRSFDuet-CgCR-GDH. The resultant was verified by DNA sequencing and transferred into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) by electroporation to give recombinant strain CG-19"
6,Measurement of reductase activity,"2.5 Measurement of reductase activity Activity of reductase in CG-19 was detected spectrophotometrically at 30 °C and pH 7.5 (unless otherwise stated) through monitoring the change of NADPH absorbance at 340 nm in a total volume of 3.0-mL containing 0.10 mM NADPH, 2.0 mM FUR, 2.95 mL buffer (sodium phosphate buffer, 50.0 mM) and 50.0 μL crude enzyme. One unit (U) of enzyme activity of CG-19 was defined as the enzyme amount (mg protein) that catalyzed the oxidation of 1.0 μmol of NADPH per minute under these conditions."
7,Bioreduction of FUR to FFA by CG-19 cells,"2.6 Bioreduction of FUR to FFA by CG-19 cells CG-19 cells were grown aerobically in LB medium containing 50.0 μg/mL Kanamycin to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.60. Then, isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.50 mM to induce expression at 37 °C for 5 h. CG-19 cells were subsequently harvested at 4 °C by a centrifugation (10000 × g) for 5 min, washed twice with physiological saline (0.75 wt%). To enhance catalytic efficiency, FUR-reducing parameters were evaluated using CG-19 cells as biocatalyts. FUR (100 mM) was catalyzed in 50 mL buffer (100 mM, pH 6.0–9.0) containing glucose (0–3.0 mol glucose/mol FUR), NADP+ (0–3.0 μM/mM FUR), 100.0 mM FUR, CG-19 wet cells (0.01–0.15 g/mL), metal ions (e.g., Cr3+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Sn4+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Li+, and Mn2+) (0.050 mM), surfactants (e.g., PEG-1000, PEG-2000, PEG-4000, PEG-6000, SDS, Tw-80, EDTA, Tw-60, and CTAB) (0.50 mM). These mixture solutions were inculbated in sealed tubes on ZWY-240 thermostats shaker (Shanghai, P.R. China) (160 rpm) for certain time (0–72 h) at 25–50 °C, the substrate FUR and product FFA were quantified with HPLC. The FFA yield was obtained as below equation: FFA y i e l d ( % ) = FFA p r o d u c e d ( m M ) Initial F U R ( m M ) × 100 To evaluate the substrate FUR tolerance of reductase in CG-19, 25–500 mM commercial FUR were separately mixed with CG-19 wet cells (0.050 g/mL) in the aqueous system (pH 7.5) containing glucose (1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR) and NADP+ (1.0 μmol NADP+/mol FUR) on a thermostats shaker (160 rpm) at 35 °C for 24 h. FUR and FFA were quantified with HPLC. In a 100-mL HTHP reactor containing dried CC (3.75 g, 40–60 mesh), Sn-zeolite (3.6 wt% dose) and 50 mL water, catalytic reaction was conducted for 30 min at 170 °C and pH 1.0 by stirring (500 rpm). The pH of CC-slurry containing FUR was subsequently regulated to 7.5. FUR was catalyzed with CG-19 wet cells (0.050 g/mL) at 35 °C for certain bioreduction time (0–24 h) by adding glucose (1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR) and NADP+ (1.0 μmol NADP+/mol FUR). FUR and FFA were quantified with HPLC."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Pellets, which were prepared by mixing the zeolite or Sn-zeolite with KBr, were assayed with Nicolet PROTÉGÉ FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) (JSM-6360LA, JEOL, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with a CuKα radiation. Prepared samples were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-6360LA, JEOL, Japan). The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area measurements were performed with N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K in a ASAP2020M system (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). FUR and FFA were quantified with HPLC (Bu et al., 2020). NH3-TPD was carried out to assay the acid strength of Sn-zeolite by chemisorption analyzer (ChemiSorb 2720, Micromeritics, USA). Sn-zeolite (100 mg) was treated in helium at 300 °C for 2 h. After NH3 adsorption at 50 °C for 1 h, Sn-zeolite was treated by helium purgation to remove excess ammonia until baseline stabilized. Then Sn-zeolite was heated to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min for NH3 desorption. Gas flows were 30–50 mL/min. The biocatalytic activity (A) of whole-cells was determined after incubation for different time (0–72 h) at different temperatures (4 °C, 35 °C, and 50 °C) and pHs (6.0, 7.5, and 9.0). The data were fitted using the linear equation as below: (1) y = a∙x + b (2) t1/2 (h) = [Ln(1/2 × 100) − b]/a where x and y represent the incubation time (h) and Ln(A/A0 × 100), respectively. A and A0 represent residual and initial biocatalytic activity of whole cells, respectively. The coefficients a and b of equation (1), along with the correlation coefficients (R2) can be obtained from the linear regression equations. The half-life (t1/2) values can be calculated from Eq. (2)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of Sn-zeolite,"3.1 Characterization of Sn-zeolite Zeolite is one kind of crystalline hydrated alumina-silicate of alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal cations. It is widely used for producing medicine, sorbents, catalysts, etc. (Eroglu et al., 2017; Kavallieratos et al., 2018; Rumbos et al., 2016). In this study, zeolite was used as carrier to prepare tin-loaded sulfonated zeolite (Sn-zeolite) catalyst. The surface structure, characteristic peaks of chemical groups, and pore properties were measured by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The surface area changes of Sn-zeolite was seen from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms results. Sn-zeolite had smaller pore size (3.8 nm), larger specific surface area (46.6 m2/g), and bigger pore volume (0.040 cm3/g) compared to zeolite (Table 1 ). SEM revealed that zeolite and Sn-zeolite had diverse distributions of particle-size. FT-IR was adopted to investigate the characteristic peaks of chemical groups of samples. It was found that the FI-IR images of zeolite and Sn-zeolite had no significant difference. The bond at around 1640 cm−1 (bending vibration of –OH) is attributed to zeolite surface-adsorbed water molecules (He et al., 2017). The bonds at near 1444 cm−1 (C–C stretching vibration), 1090 cm−1 (Si-O-Si antisymmetric stretching vibration of zeolite) (Gong et al., 2019) and 794 cm−1 (Si-O-Si symmetric stretching vibration of zeolite) were detected·NH3-TPD was used for evaluating the acidic strength of Sn-zeolite. Generally, the high desorption temperature of NH3 is correlated with the strong acid center. In view of NH3 desorption temperatures of 100–200 °C, 200–400 °C, and 400–800 °C, the sites of acid centers on heterogeneous catalyst can be classified into weak, medium and strong sites, respectively. It was found that Sn-zeolite had a weak acid center (<200 °C) and two strong acid center (>400 °C) at 105 °C, 470 °C and 700 °C, respectively. XRD is the principal technique used for investigating crystal structures of composite materials. Significant diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 12.2°, 20.8°, 21.8°, and 62.6° were detected in zeolite and Sn-zeolite. The Sn-zeolite structure was clearly different from zeolite. Probably, soaking with solvents and sulfonation with H2SO4 could dissolve some components in zeolite. This process for preparing Sn-zeolite influenced the surface of zeolite."
11,Transformation of corncob (CC) into FUR by Sn-zeolite,"3.2 Transformation of corncob (CC) into FUR by Sn-zeolite To effectively synthesize FUR, it is necessary to conduct the reaction for catalyzing biomass under the optimized catalytic conditions (Catrinck et al., 2020; He et al., 2017). Sn-zeolite-mediated transformation of CC (75.0 g/L) was carried out by Sn-zeolite (0–6.0 wt% dose) in 50 mL water (pH 1.0) for 5–60 min at 160–180 °C. Effects of Sn-zeolite dose on catalyzing CC to FUR were observed in Fig. 1 a. FUR yields were found to gradually raise with the rise of Sn-zeolite dose from 0 to 3.6 wt%. 75.0 g/L of CC was catalyzed to 103.0 mM FUR at the maximum yield (52.3%) within 30 min at 170 °C using 3.6 wt% of Sn-zeolite as catalyst. By increasing the Sn-zeolite dose from 3.6 to 6.0 wt%, FUR yields decreased. These results indicated that 3.6 wt% dose was the appropriate Sn-zeolite loading. Effects of catalytic time and temperature on catalyzing CC to FUR were revealed in Fig. 1b. After these operations at various catalytic time (5–60 min), the FUR yields differed under different catalytic temperature (160, 170 and 180 °C). FUR yield reached the maximum (52.3%) after 30 min of incubation at 170 °C. Higher catalytic temperature and longer catalytic time favor the side-reactions such as condensation and self-polymerization of FUR (Zeitsch, 2000). In view of above data, it was observed that 75.0 g/L CC could be efficiently catalyzed to FUR (103.0 mM) with 3.6 wt% dose of Sn-zeolite for 30 min at 170 °C in sealed HTHP reactor (500 rpm). In a dibutyl phthalate-water (1:1, v:v) biphasic system, dewaxed chestnut shell-derived xylose (17.9 g/L xylose) could be catalyzed into 47.0 mM FUR by SO4 2-/SnO2-Attapulgite (2.0 wt% dose) using a microwave (600 W) for 10 min at 180 °C (Di et al., 2018). To evaluate the performance stability of Sn-zeolite, this heterogeneous catalyst was recovered and reused for seven times to catalyze corncob into FUR (Fig. 1c). Each run was conducted for 30 min at 170 °C in sealed reactor. The FUR yields dropped gradually after each recycle. From 1st to 5th run, FUR yield dropped from 52.3% to 46.8%, indicating a comparable stable recycle capacity. After 6th and 7th run, FUR yields were obtained at 41.9% and 37.3%, respectively. An efficient Sn-zeolite recycling was demonstrated in this study, indicating that Sn-zeolite had good stability to be reused for catalyzing CC into FUR. Compared to some reported solid acid catalysts (Di et al., 2018; He et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015), Sn-zeolite had higher catalytic activity."
12,Expressing recombinant CgCR and GDH in E. Coli cells and effects cosubstrate glucose and NADP+ dose on FUR-reducing activity,"3.3 Expressing recombinant CgCR and GDH in E. Coli cells and effects cosubstrate glucose and NADP+ dose on FUR-reducing activity To avoid the excessive addition of NADP + or NADPH, CgCR and GDH were added simultaneously to construct an NADP+ regeneration system. Glucose as cosubstrate was consumed by GDH to regenerate NADP+ into NADPH that was used in the catalysis of FUR to FFA through bioreduction. CgCR and GDH were successfully coexpressed in one E. coli (Fig. 2 A & 2B). The bands on SDS-PAGEs (Fig. 2C) indicated the expressed proteins with molecular weights of 36.1 kDa (CgCR) and 29.4 kDa (GDH). Biomass-derived glucose could be used as cosubstrate to achieve the internal cofactor regeneration (Ema et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2019). As indicated in Fig. 3 a, effects of cosubstrate glucose dose (0–3.0 mol glucose/mol FUR) were evaluated on the FUR-reducing activity. When glucose doses were below 1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR, the FUR-reducing increased with the rise of glucose dose from 0 to 1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR. Over the dose of 1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR, the FUR-reducing activity dropped significantly. Probably, excessive cosubstrate glucose addition made biocatalytic system more viscous, thereby causing a decrease in FUR-reducing activity. Therefore, the cosubstrate glucose dose was chosen at 1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR for enhancing FUR bioreduction. In the biocatalytic system, NADP+ is common bioreaction precursor for increasing NAD(P)H content in cells and promoting bioreduction efficiencies (Peleteiro et al., 2016). Effects of NADP+ dose on the FUR-reducing reaction were illustrated in Fig. 3b. NADP+ loading influenced FUR-reducing activity clearly. As the rise of NADP+ dose from 0 to 1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR, the FUR-reducing activities were raised, probably due to the rise of coenzyme NADPH content in CG-19 cells. At the dose of 1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR (e.q. NADP+ 100 μM), the FUR-reducing activity reached the maximum. After NADP+ exceeded 100 μM (over 1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR), FUR-reducing activities began to decrease. Therefore, the appropriate NADP+ dose for enhancing FUR-reducing activity of CG-19 was 1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR."
13,Optimization of FUR-reducing conditions,"3.4 Optimization of FUR-reducing conditions Whole-cell biocatalyst dosage, biocatalytic temperature, biocatalytic pH, metal ions, sufactants are known as important reaction parameter for bioconversion (Bu et al., 2020; Kratzer et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Ni et al., 2012). In this study, different cell dosages (0.01–0.15 g/mL), biocatalytic temperature (25–50 °C), biocatalytic pH (6.0–9.0), metal ions (Cr3+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Sn4+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Li+, and Mn2+), and surfactants (PEG-6000, PEG-4000, PEG-2000, PEG-1000, SDS, Tw-80, EDTA, Tw-60, and CTAB) were tested on FUR-reducing activities. The effects of CG-19 cell dosage (0.01–0.15 g/mL) on the FUR-reducing activities were explored. As the rise of CG-19 cell dosage from 0.010 to 0.050 g/mL, the initial reaction rates increased significantly. At the dose of 0.050 g/mL, the initial reaction rate reached the maximum (2.95 μmol/min). In the range of 0.050–0.15 g/mL (cell dose), the initial reaction rate could slightly inhibit catalytic activity. Thus, the optimal CG-19 cell dose was selected as 0.050 g/mL (wet weight). High loading of biocatalysts increased the reaction system’s viscosity so that the high mass-transfer barrier and low dissolved oxygen (DO) might be prominent, which resulted in the decrease of biocatlytic actvity. Biocatalytic temperatures and pH values had a profound influence on reductase activity (Bu et al., 2020; He et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2019). As indicated in Fig. 4 a & 4b, the appropriate biocatalytic temperature and pH for FUR-reducing were observed at 35 °C and 7.5 respectively. The half-life (t1/2) values were determined from these data in Fig. 4c & 4d. At 35 °C,t1/2(pH 7.5) = 3.3 d > t1/2(pH 6.0) = 0.93 d > t1/2(pH 9.0) = 0.62 d; At pH 7.5, t1/2(4 °C) = 10.3 d > t1/2(35 °C) = 3.3 d > t1/2(50 °C) = 0.42 d. Compared to these calculated half-life values, it was observed that CG-19 cells had good thermo- and pH stability at 35 °C and pH 7.5. Biotransformation 100 mM FUR for 3 h, FUR was converted with 100% of conversion and FFA was obtained with 100% selectivity at 35 °C and pH 7.5. Using B. coagulans NL01 whole-cells as biocatalysts, 52.0 mM FUR could be transformed into FFA (47.5 mM) with 98.8% conversion and 91.4% selectivity at 45 °C and pH 7.0 (Bu et al., 2020). In the dibutyl phthalate-water (1:1, v:v) biphasic system at 30 °C and pH 6.5, 47.0 mM FUR could be wholly catalyzed into FFA within 2.5 h by E. coli CCZU-Y10 cells containing NADH-dependent reductase (Di et al., 2018). Effects of metal ions (0.050 mM) on FUR activities were tested by individually supplementing AlCl3, BaCl2, CuCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, CrCl3, FeCl2, FeCl3, MgCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, SnCl4, and ZnCl2 into the biocatalytic system at 35 °C and pH 7.5. Fe2+ and Ba2+ caused strong inhibition on FUR-reducing activities. Sn4+, Co2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, and Cu2+ (0.050 mM) enhanced the FUR-reducing activities. Notably, Sn4+ (0.050 mM) could promote the highest FUR-reducing activity. Effects of Sn4+ doses (0–3.0 mM) were further tested on FUR-reducing activity at 35 °C and pH 7.5. The results showed that 0.025–3.0 mM Sn4+ had no inhibition on the FUR-reducing activity, indicating that Sn4+ leached from Sn-zeolite might have no negative influence on the CG-19 cell-catalyzed FUR. By supplementing 1.0 mM Sn4+ to bioreduction system, the FUR-reducing activity reached the maximum. To enhance catalytic of water-insoluble substrates, some additives such as surfactants are selected to supplement into biocatalytic system for facilitating dispersal of substrate molecules and promoting substrate conversion efficiency (Ni et al., 2012). Effects of surfactants (PEG-6000, PEG-4000, PEG-2000, PEG-1000, SDS, Tw-80, EDTA, Tw-60, and CTAB) (0.50 mM) were examined on the FUR-reducing activities. PEG-6000, SDS, Tw-80, and Tw-60 enhanced the FUR-reducing activities significantly. CTAB slightly promoted the FUR-reducing activity. Among these additives, SDS was chosen as appropriate surfactant additive, which could promote the FUR-reducing activity by 1.38-folds. Furthermore, the effects of SDS doses (0–3.0 mM) were tested on the FUR-reducing activities of CG-19 cells. When SDS was supplemented to the biocatalytic system from 0 to 0.50 mM, the FUR-reducing activities were raised with the rise of SDS dose. Over 0.50 mM, the FUR-reducing activities decreased gradually. Therefore, SDS (0.50 mM dose) was chosen as surfactant additive for enhancing the FUR-reducing activity of CG-19 cells. In view of above-mentioned results, the optimal catalytic of FUR condition was obtained as follows: FUR was catalyzed with CG-19 wet cells (0.050 g/mL) at 35 °C by supplementary of cosubstrate glucose (1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR), SDS (0.50 mM) and NADP+ (1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR) in the aqueous media (pH 7.5)."
14,Biocatalytic synthesis of FFA from FUR,"3.5 Biocatalytic synthesis of FFA from FUR FUR is one kind of strong inhibitor to some bacteria and enzymes (Bu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2018). The effects of substrate FUR dosage (25–500 mM) on FFA production were evaluated (Fig. 5 a). When FUR dose didn’t exceed 100 mM, FUR was wholly reacted within 3 h. At over 100 mM, FFA yields decreased significantly. At the FUR dose of 150 mM to 400 mM, the FFA yields were 75.1% to 52.2%, respectively. When FUR was 500 mM, FFA yield dropped to 42.0%. Clearly, the appropriate substrate FUR dosage was 100 mM. FUR (≤75 mM) could be wholly reduced to FFA with reductase biocatalyst (Di et al., 2018), and 100 mM and 200 mM FUR could be catalyzed to FFA yields at 89.1% and 46.9%, respectively. Only 5 mM FFA produced from 100 mM FUR after 24 h of bioreduction in the aqueous system (Yan et al., 2018). Clearly, CG-19 cells showed high FUR-reducing activity towards high loading of FUR. Sn-zeolite (3.6 wt%)-mediated catalysis of milled CC (3.75 g, 40–60 mesh), which was composed of 29.7 wt% glucan and 34.1 wt% xylan, was carried out in 100-mL HTHP reactor containing 50 mL water (pH 1.0) at 170 °C under the agitation of 500 rpm. After 30 min, this HTHP reactor was soaked in ice-cold water container, and then the pH value of CC-slurry containing 103.0 mM FUR was regulated to reach 7.5. This diluted FUR (100.0 mM) was catalyzed with CG-19 wet cells (0.050 g/mL) at 35 °C by supplementary of cosubstrate glucose (1.5 mol glucose/mol FUR), SDS (0.50 mM) and NADP+ (1.0 μmol NADP+/mmol FUR). CC-derived FUR was wholly catalyzed to FFA by CG-19 cells within 3 h (Fig. 5b). M. guilliermondii SC1103, and B. coagulans NL01 could only catalyze ~ 50 mM FUR (Li et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2018), while CG-19 could be effectively catalyzed over 100 mM FUR. Afer the conversion of CC with Sn-zeolite, the obtained CC-slurry contained CC residues, FUR, FUR-derived chemicals and Sn-zeolite. No significant inhibition was observed when CG-19 cells catalyzed CC-slurry into FFA. Biosynthesis of FFA from FUR by reductase biocatalysts could be carried out with high biocatalytic activity and selectivity under the ambient condition. Additionally, the combination of heterogeneous Sn-zeolite catalysis and reductase biocatalysis in a cascade fashion without the need of isolating intermediates and Sn-zeolite shortened the operating time, operation cost, and waste generation. CC is one kind of inexpensive and sustainable raw feedstock (De Bhowmick et al., 2018). Bio-based FFA, an important furan chemical, could be manufactured from sustainable CC in a hybrid route, which was established for chemoenzymatically catalyzing CC to FFA in a tandem catalytic reaction with Sn-zeolite and CG-19 reductase catalysts."
15,Conclusion,"Sulfonated Sn-zeolite catalyst was prepared for efficiently catalyzing xylan in CC into FUR, and recombinant E. coli CG-19 harboring NADPH-dependent reductase was constructed for effectively catalyzing CC-derived FUR into FFA. An environmentally-friendly pathway was established for FFA synthesis from CC (75.0 g/L) in tandem reaction with sulfonated Sn-zeolite (3.6 wt% dose) at 170 °C and NADPH-dependent reductase biocatalyst (0.050 g/mL) at 35 °C. This solid acid-reductase hybrid pathway had potential application for high-value utilization of CC to biobased furan chemicals."
