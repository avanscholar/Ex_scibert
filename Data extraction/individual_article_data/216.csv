0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas is considered the main chemical in the petrochemical industry and sustainable fuel for the future. Hydrogen can be produced by many methods such as thermal cracking of petroleum products, electrolysis, steam reforming, and water splitting. Steam reforming is considered as one of the environmentally friendly methods. Thermal cracking of petroleum products is a majority hydrogen production due to the cost-effective and abundant raw material. However, its drawback is that petroleum is a non-renewable raw material, resulting in non-net zero emissions from CO2 generation, affecting health and negatively impacting environmental change [1,2]. Increased environmental concerns have led to the tendency of the development of alternative resources. Therefore, bio-alcohols are increasingly interested in replacing fossil fuels in the future economy, causing severe long-term environmental consequences [3,4]. Every year, bioethanol is generated by significant manufacturers, by-product has become an emergency problem in the environment, the 1,000 L of ethanol production gives 2.5–5 L of fusel oil. It is considered a low-value material due to its high cost and loss of space for storage and elimination. Therefore, some research is considering utilizing it by converting it to hydrogen via steam reforming. Fusel oil is mixed of alcohol with low molecular weight as i-amyl alcohol, i-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol). Nowadays, fusel oil is mainly utilized to produce isoamyl acetate and biodiesel [5]. (1) Fusel oil steam reforming: CxHyOz + H2O → CO2 + H2 (2) Fusel oil decomposition: CxHyOz → CH4 + CO + H2 (3) Water gas shift:CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 ΔH298K = -41 kJ/mol (4) Methanation: CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O ΔH298K = -206 kJ/mol (5) Alkene Polymerization: CnH2n → Polymer → Carbon ΔH298K = -127 kJ/mol (6) Thermal deposition: CH4 → C + 2H2 ΔH298K = 75 kJ/mol (7) Boudouard reaction: 2CO → CO2 + C ΔH298K = -172 kJ/mol The catalyst plays an important role in improving conversion and hydrogen yield. There are two types of metal groups in steam reforming: noble metal classifies (Ru, Pt, and Rh) [6,7] and transition metal group (Ni, Co, and Cu) [8]. Significantly, the noble metal is ideally classified because of its high catalytic performance and resistance to coking, but the high cost is limited [9,10]. Hence, the transition metal is receiving much attention with high catalytic activity. Nickel (Ni)-based catalysts have been widely investigated in STR since their ability to cleave C–C, C–H, and C-O at and low cost [11–14]. Vizcaíno et al. reviewed the Co-based catalyst generated in short CNFs with low ordering degree than those created in Ni-based sample at the same temperature, according to TEM images. The increased C–C bonding cleavage capacity of Ni compared to Co could enhance carbon creation C2H4 and CH4 formation from ethanol. It concluded that a higher amount of more stability coking was discovered on Ni/SBA [15] due to its decomposition to carbon (Eq. (6)) which are preferred thermodynamically at high reforming temperatures. Various supports have an essential role in increasing the specific surface area, stabilizing, and dispersing the active site, promoting product yield, and suspended coking. More significantly, some functional groups such as OH can react oxygen to generate CO2 and CO. Silica porous (SP) is typically worked as a support for Ni catalysts in the steam reforming owing to its good textural properties. However, the blocking of pores during the reaction from coking can cause rapid deactivation [16]. The same SiO2, Al2O3, is generally investigated in steam reforming because this support has low cost and high specific surface area. However, Al2O3 has strong acidity properties. Therefore, it easily dehydrated the OH group and promoted polymerization C2H4. Therefore, the blocking of pores during the reaction by coking can cause fast deactivation during the steam reforming [16]. Silica fiber (SF) has received much attention due to its tubular structure and open morphology, facilitating carbon gasification and promoting the regeneration of metallic Ni sites on the support [17]. Nevertheless, weak metal-support interaction between Ni and SF leads to accumulated nickel clusters and catalyst deactivation by sintering [15]. During the steam reforming, the coking or carbon deposits over support which formed via hydrocarbon cracking as polymerization ethylene (5), carbon monoxide disproportionation (Boudouard reaction) (7) [18]. There are two kinds of carbon deposits (amorphous and filamentous carbon). The amount and type of carbon depend on the condition (temperature, catalyst). For example, the Boudouard reaction is referred to at a low temperature, while the decomposition of hydrocarbon will occur at a higher temperature. Following the literature review, in steam reforming over Ni-based catalysts lower than 500 °C, carbon deposits are amorphous. Filamentous carbon (CNTs and CNFs) will be formed under high temperatures [19]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are receiving considerable attention as promising support owing to their promotion-specific surface area and good mechanical strength. Moreover, using CNTs can improve the interactions between Ni sites and their support. It can be modified to improve the dispersion and surface functionalization [20,21]. The specific graphene structure relating π-electron density enhances the amount of mobility electron to switch between the active site and the support. Therefore, combining the tubular structure of SF and the large surface area of CNTs would be helpful for designing composite support for a Ni catalyst in fusel oil reforming. Prasongthum et al. [21] reported that CNTs-SF was prepared by steam reforming of ethanol and used as catalyst support. They observed that the composite catalyst showed an excellent catalytic performance and high selectivity of H2 production at a relatively lower reaction temperature. The unique structure of CNTs-SF was beneficial for promoting the dispersion of metal catalysts and strengthening the bonding between metal and support. This research focused on the fusel oil steam reforming over Ni/CNTs-SF catalysts to produce hydrogen and compare with Ni/SF and Ni/SP catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material The chemical components of the fusel oil was defined to be mainly i-amyl alcohol, i-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and water, at 67.75, 20.09, 8.02, 4.13, and 0.01% by weight, respectively. The fusel oil has a specific density of 0.8152 g cm−3."
3,Synthesis of the SF,"2.2 Synthesis of the SF SF was prepared via sol–gel techniques and electrospinning apparatus. Firstly, TEOS as a silica source was dissolved in distilled water with a ratio of (1:2) and followed by adding HCl and EtOH to the solution under stirring for each step 5 min with a ratio (0.01:2) mole. Secondly, the solution gel was stirred at 55 °C in a water bath for approximate half-hour. Then the SF was prepared by electrospinning equipment (Fig. 1 ). The solution was fed rate at 10 mL/h, and a voltage of 15 kV was supplied to the needle after that SF was dried at 120 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h [22]."
4,Prepare of CNTs-SF,"2.3 Prepare of CNTs-SF Support CNTs-SF was obtained from ethanol steam reforming at 600 °C, steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 1, W/F of 6 gcat h mol−1 over Ni/SF as described previously [21]. The as-prepared CNTs-SF from ethanol steam reforming contained significant amounts of impurities such as Ni and amorphous carbon. To obtain CNTs-SF, the as-prepared CNTs-SF were pretreated by a mixture acid solution of 3 M HCl and 1 M HNO3 to remove Ni and impurities. The mixture was then placed in an ultrasoundsonicator for 4 h at 40–50 °C. Nitric acid is commonly employed for the purification of CNTs. However, the strong acids frequently cause CNTs damage of being oxidized. The use of HNO3 at relatively low concentrations can avoid CNTs damage. In this work, HCl as a relatively mild acid was also used to effectively remove Ni catalyst and amorphous carbon [23–24]. Saito et al. reviewed that treatment with acid can create some functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic groups [23,25]. The sonication is used in common to break up the aggregation of CNTs in solution. During sonication, the shear forces derived from cavitation phenomena can break up the aggregation of CNTs owing to the Van der Waals interactions between the CNTs themselves [26]. After sonication, the mixture was thoroughly washed several times with DI water until pH of the solution was 7, finally dried overnight at 100 °C."
5,Catalyst preparation,"2.4 Catalyst preparation The Ni supported on SF, and SP (silica porous, Q10 CARiACT) were prepared by impregnation with a Ni loading of 10 wt%. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as a Ni precursor was added into the DI water to dissolve, and then this solution was brushed to the support. Then, the catalyst was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at a temperature of 500 °C for 2 h. The Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst (10 wt%) was prepared using a wet impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution. This step will be obtained under sonication at 40–50 °C for 2 h. Lastly, the catalyst was dried at 110 °C for overnight and calcined at 350 °C for 4 h"
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size were estimated via N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was applied to calculate the specific surface area, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was observed to find the pore-volume and mean pore diameter. Before the analysis step, the samples will be degassed and heated at 200 °C for 2 h using Micromeritics ASAP 2020. XRD patterns were studied to confirm the crystal phase and estimate particle size of an active site using model X’Pert diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The samples were scanned in 2θ range of 5° − 80°. The average particle size of NiO and Ni was calculated by the Scherrer’s equation. (8) d NiO = K λ β c o s θ dNiO : the size of crystalline NiO (nm) K: shape factor (in this case of 1) λ: the X-ray wavelength (Copper K-α = 1.5406 Å) β: the line broadening at half of the maximum intensity (FWHM) (radian) θ: the Bragg angle. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was employed to reveal the dispersion Ni particle size and amount Ni on these supports. The fresh and spent catalyst could be used this technique to evaluate the carbon deposit. The amount of coke is important to evaluate the catalytic performance, which is assigned Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) because coke can block the pore and deactivate the catalyst. The amount of coke was measured by TGA using the PERKIN 8000 equipment. First, the temperature was rated from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Then, the program continuously increased up to 800 °C and holding time for 15 mins. Graphene structure was observed clearly using a Fourier Transform Raman spectrometer (PerkinElmer) via Raman spectroscopy at two bands."
7,Catalytic performance,"2.6 Catalytic performance The fusel oil steam reforming was performed at the atmospheric condition in a fixed-bed reactor. Before reaction, the catalysts (10Ni/SP, 10Ni/SF, and 10Ni/CNTs-SF) were reduced by 15% (v/v) H2 in N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The mixed feed of fusel oil and water was at a ratio of 9, fed to the reaction system by an HPLC pump. The organic gas products were analyzed by an online GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) during the steam reforming. The other gas products such as H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 were detected by an online GC-equipped thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Characterization of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts Fig. 2 showed the XRD patterns of 10Ni/CNTs-SF, 10Ni/SF, 10Ni/SP catalysts, and SF, respectively. The diffraction peaks attributed to the NiO were identified at 36.9°, 43.6°, and 62.9° [27] for all catalysts. The broad diffraction band was identified at 21.5° was assigned to silica amorphous of SF and SP. The average size of NiO size calculated by Scherrer’s equation was 5.5, 10, and 13 nm for 10Ni/CNTs-SF, 10Ni/SP, and 10Ni/SF catalysts, respectively. It suggested that a large oxygen-containing functional group in the CNTs structure promoted the metal dispersion [28]. However, in the case of NiO over SP support which suggested that poverty diffusion could decelerate the diffusive of the solution nickel nitrate during impregnation procedure and became the larger NiO size with aggregation phenomenon [29]. There are many allotropes carbon materials such as diamond, amorphous carbon, graphene, etc. These carbon materials have different applications in many fields. However, carbon nanotubes are suggested to play an important role in catalytic performance in the steam reforming reaction due to their mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have a single and many layers of graphene wrapped around the core tube. Raman is a unique technique to confirm graphene structure. In this work, Raman spectroscopy was assigned the crystalline and disordered structure of CNTs [30,31]. Fig. 3 illustrated at two bands, including D band (defect) at 1341 cm−1 and G band (graphite) at 1596 cm−1 [32]. The further understanding of the quality nanotubes is by observing on intensity ratio (IG/ID) [33]. It was summarized from the figure that untreated acid showed IG/ID at 0.5 and treated acid showed IG/ID at 0.6. Therefore, acid contributed to improving the quality of nanotubes. A highly ordered structure can decrease zero bandgaps [34], expand tensile strength [35], and have high thermal conductivity [36]. The specific graphene structure relating π-electron density enhances the amount of mobility electron to switch between the active site and the support. Amorphous and carbon nanotubes have different decomposition temperatures that are shown in the TGA profile. Fig. 4 illustrated the temperature region decomposition range of 500–650 °C with 78% weight loss in an oxygen atmosphere which referred to the oxidation of stable CNTs after ethanol steam reforming [37]. Fig. 5 depicted the clear image of CNTs covering the SF surface analyzed by the TEM technique. CNTs were synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) of ethanol steam reforming. Therefore, the carbon deposits were mixed with amorphous and carbon nanotubes. Acid pretreatment was used to remove soft coke in amorphous structure and other impurities. The corresponding analysis EDS shows in the figure, which confirmed the presence of the Ni on the surface catalyst. The amount of NiO on the surface is 11.11% and 11.47% in CNTs-SF and SF, respectively. These results were in agreement with the hypothesis after loading of 10% Ni loading. The BET characterization for the different supports was observed in Fig. 6 . The SP support showed type IV isotherms with H1 type hysteresis loop, suggesting a typical highlight of mesoporous materials. N2 adsorption–desorption on the SF support is linear with a relative pressure of P/Po of 0, showing that the sample was non-porous structures. The SF support curve was linear without adsorption N2 because of its non-porous structure [38]. The SP support had the highest surface area of 258.71 m2/g, while the SF and CNTs-SF support was at 4.71 m2/g and 209.06 m2/g, respectively, as reported by Prasongthum et al. [21]. The SF support showed the smallest surface area due to its non-porous material, while the CNTs-SF exhibited Type II adsorption isotherms with relatively high surface area. After loading Ni, the specific surface area and total pore volume of 10Ni/SP and 10Ni/CNTs-SF decreased gradually because Ni species were embedded in the support pores with 224.49 and 207 m2/g, respectively. By contrast, Ni/SF enhanced slightly from 4.71 to 6.95 m2/g. It could be explained that the assigned to the deposition of Ni on the surface of the support. This result was in agreement with SEM images (Fig. 5). The porosity characteristic of all catalysts was summarized in Table 1 . In Fig. 7 , the TEM image depicted the distribution of metallic Ni on CNTs-SF. The 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst was prepared by impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution under sonication. The TEM image showed that the CNTs structure was not disrupted by the sonication."
10,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of fusel oil steam reforming was observed for the conversion to gas and distribution products (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6). Fig. 8 showed the catalytic performance at the temperature ranging of 500–700 °C. In the case of 10Ni/SP and 10Ni/SF catalyst, the hydrogen yield increased with increased temperature. At low temperatures, the yield of H2 was 3.34 and 6.5%, respectively. Dehydration of fusel oil to ethylene and decomposition were preferred; hence high methane and CO formed at low temperatures. However, an increasing temperature can promote hydrogen yield and decrease undesirable products such as CH4. However, CO2 selectivity also enhanced dramatically at 600 and 700 °C. These results related that Ni/SF has better performance than Ni/SP and the same condition [39]. Considering the 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst, thermal decomposition almost occurred at 650 °C; hence CNTs referred to low-temperature reaction. At high temperatures, the yield of H2 and CO2 selectivity was relatively low. In the case of 500 °C, 10Ni/CNTs-SF gave high yield H2 compared 10Ni/SF catalyst at 700 °C, meaning that the 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst worked as support could improve reaction yield. The clear evidence was the small size of Ni particle and good dispersion on support through the TEM image and XRD patterns. Fig. 9 showed the stability test observed for 11 h at 500 °C of all catalysts. Fusel oil conversion (conversion to gas) of 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst was 53%, whereas those for 10Ni/SF and 10Ni/SP catalysts were maximal 30% and 33%, respectively. The time on stream fluctuated due to decomposing to organic compounds such as ethylene, propylene, or propane, which were initially (first 200 min) significantly increased at the beginning. It can be explained that the longer contact time between fusel oil and water molecule could promote C–C cracking and decompose of fusel oil. Furthermore, methane reforming also occurred at high space–time and consumed CH4. However, the results indicated that the 10NiCNT-SF catalyst showed significantly higher activity than 10Ni/SF and 10Ni/SP catalysts. According to the catalyst characterization, the CNTs-SF had a higher surface area than SF, but slightly lower than SP. The NiO crystal size of the 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst (5.5 nm) was obviously smaller than that of 10Ni/SP (10 nm) and 10Ni/SF (13 nm) catalysts, which delivered the highest activity. The stability test indicated that 10Ni/SF and 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalysts seem stable after 7 h (420 min) of the reaction. By contrast, the gas conversion rapidly decreased after 5 h in the case of the 10NiSP catalyst due to the deactivation. These results indicated that fibrous 10Ni/CNTs-SF and 10Ni/SF catalysts exhibited more excellent catalytic stability than the porous ones. In general, porous material has coking filled in the pore and lead to decrease Ni surface site causing long diffusion [40]. As a result, 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst had the highest hydrogen yield at 15%, and 10Ni/SF and 10Ni/SP catalysts gave lower hydrogen yield at 11% and 7%, respectively."
11,Characterization of spent catalyst,"3.3 Characterization of spent catalyst The carbon deposit over fresh and spent catalysts analyzed by TGA is shown in Fig. 10 . Before the reaction, 10Ni/SP and 10Ni/SF catalysts had not few weight losses at 100 °C due to the vaporization of the adsorbed water on the surface and inside the pore. However, 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst showed significant weight loss at 650 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, where the weight loss that occurred between 600 and 700 °C was assigned to be the oxidation of CNTs [37], and it was estimated to contain 48.55% of CNTs content. After the reaction, two noticeable weight loss stages were observed at 400–500 °C and 550–700 °C. The first stage was noted to be the oxidation temperature of amorphous carbon, while the second stage was the oxidation temperature of the filamentous structure. The TGA analysis found that the amount of carbon deposited over the spent 10Ni/SP catalyst increased to 64.5%, while approximately 31% were found over the spent 10Ni/CNTs-SF and 10Ni/SF catalysts. The higher amount of carbon deposits on Ni/SP catalyst could be the reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst during steam reforming."
12,Conclusions,"In this present research work, we have successfully prepared the SF via sol–gel techniques and CNTs-SF via steam reforming ethanol method. The 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity than the 10Ni/SF and 10Ni/SP catalysts. The unique tubular structure and large specific surface of the CNTs-SF support improved the reduction of Ni, thus giving higher activity and performance. The stability test showed that the activity of 10Ni/SF, and 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalysts remained stable for more than 10 h of the test and found some coke deposited analyzed by TGA. By contrast, the 10Ni/SP catalyst activity was gradually increased and dropped after 5 h due to coking causing the loss of the active site. The TGA analysis found that the amount of carbon deposited over the spent 10Ni/SP was 64%, while approximately 31% was found over the spent 10Ni/CNTs-SF and 10Ni/SF catalysts. In addition, the 10Ni/CNTs-SF catalyst had the highest hydrogen yield at 15%, and 10NiSF and 10Ni/SP catalysts gave lower hydrogen yield at 11% and 7%, respectively. The tubular structure and easy accessibility of the fibrous catalysts supported the reduction of the carbon deposition, thus offering better long-term stability."
