0,Introduction,"Ionic liquids (ILs) [1] have attracted great interest both in industry [2,3] and academia [4–7] for application into the framework of sustainable and green chemistry [8,9]. In the initial stages of the research on ILs they were directly associated without criticism with green chemistry, as replacements of traditional molecular solvents (MSs), but the advancement of this research field have shown that ILs may lead to relevant problems regarding pivotal facts such as their environmental fate [10–12], biodegradability [13], toxicity [14] or technological concerns related with some unsuitable properties [15] such as the high viscosity of many types of ILs [16,17], which lead to large energy requirements for their use at industrial scale. These problems have led to doubts about the scaling up of ILs to industrial level [18], which is confirmed by the decrease in the number of scientific publications about ILs in the last years [7]. Nevertheless, ILs can be developed considering sustainability [19] because the large number of anion-cation combinations leading to ILs [20,21] provides a new synthesis platform for designing task-specific ILs [22–24] and tuning physicochemical properties [25]. This leads to an advantage for ILs over the reduced number of MSs which are commonly applied in the industry, which environmental problems are well-known being difficult to be eliminated. The large difference between the properties and characteristics of MSs and ILs is an important barrier for the replacement of MSs by ILs in technologies at industrial scale. Therefore, the use of ILs + MSs mixtures by considering suitable MSs [26,27] has been proposed in the literature for tuning ILs properties [28,29] and their design at the molecular level [30], leading to a new direction for the development of ILs – based technologies [31]. The large number of ILs + MSs combinations, because of the number of possible compounds and the effect of mixture composition requires a rational approach for studying these systems both from the micro and macroscopic viewpoints, for analyzing intermolecular forces, their relationship with macroscopic features and the possibility of developing structure – composition – property relationships [32] which can be used for predictive purposes at industrial scale. For this purpose, the development of combined experimental and theoretical studies may provide the required information because of the strengths of molecular modelling [33–35], leading to a molecular level picture of the studied mixtures, and the determination of relevant physicochemical properties, which are required for process design purposes at industrial scale. Despite of the considered relevance of ILs + MSs mixtures, the available literature studies are still scarce [36–38]. Therefore, continuing with our ongoing research efforts on ILs + MSs mixtures [39–42], a study on 2-hydroxyethyl ammonium formate (2HEAF) IL + alcohol mixtures combining experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) as a function of mixture composition and temperature is reported. 2HEAF is a newly advanced IL that has been displayed to have unusual properties in synthesis as a solvent [43]. Several studies on the thermophysical properties of pure 2HEAF as a function of temperature have been reported including properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension ultrasonic viscosity or electrical conductivity [44–47] and the PVT behavior [48]. Likewise, the microscopic properties of 2HEAF have been studied using molecular modelling methods [47,48]. The studies on 2HEAF + MSs mixtures are scarce in the literature, with the only study being reported by Iglesias et al. showing density and ultrasonic velocity data for 2HEAF + short hydroxylic solvents (water, methanol, and ethanol) mixtures [49]. To advance in the knowledge of 2HEAF + MSs mixtures a combined experimental and theoretical study is reported in this work considering alcohols as MSs. The selection of alcohols was based on the industrial relevance of these compounds and on the intermolecular levels features rising from the presence of hydroxyl group and the possible development of hydrogen bonding with 2HEAF, which would be the main effect on the macroscopic properties of these mixed systems. Five alcohols were selected to consider different molecular features to be analyzed: i) 1-propanol (1PRO) and 2-propanol (2PRO), to study the effect of the position of the hydroxyl group, ii) 1,2-propanediol (12PRO), to consider the effect of having two hydroxyl groups, and iii) 2-methyl-1-propanol (2M1PRO) and 2-methyl-2-propanol (2M2PRO), to analyze the effect of alcohol branching on mixture properties; Fig. 1 . Experimental study was done selecting relevant thermophysical properties (density, ρ, speed of sound, u, and refractive index, n D ), which were measured in the full composition range for the five 2HEAF + alcohol systems as a function of temperature at 0.1 MPa. From these properties, excess and mixing thermodynamic properties were calculated and analyzed in terms of deviations from ideal behavior and its relationship with the developed intermolecular forces. Likewise, a theoretical study using MD was also reported for the considered systems as a function of mixture composition providing information on the mixed fluids structuring and intermolecular forces at the nanoscopic level, which was analyzed in combination with experimental results."
1,Experimental and computational methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The alcohol samples used in this work were provided by Merck with purity larger than 99% in mass terms, Table S1 (Supporting Information). The quality of alcohols samples was further verified with gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detection (FID). The GC did not show significant impurities. Values of density, speed of sound and refractive index of pure alcohols were compared with values in literature as a function of temperature showing suitable agreement, Table S2 (Supporting Information). 2HEAF was synthesized according to the following procedure. 2-Aminoethanol (0.2 mol, 12 mL) was placed in a two-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. While the flask was mounted in an ice bath, under vigorous stirring with a magnetic stirring bar, (0.2 mol, 7.5 mL) formic acid was added drop wise to the flask in about 45 min. Stirring was continued for 24 h at room temperature to obtain a final viscous, clear and yellow liquid. The product was dried under vacuum at 323 K for 48 h. No solid crystals or precipitation was observed when the liquid sample was purified or was stored at freezing temperature for a few months [50]. The chemical formula of the substance produced is [HO − CH2 − CH2 − NH3 +][−OOCH]. The purity of the synthesized 2HEAF was evaluated via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy)Bruker 250 MHz spectrometer, using DMSO‑d 6 as solvent with TMS as internal standard) [51]. 1H and 13C NMR spectra are reported in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information) with the main signals being for 1H NMR spectrum: 3.12 ppm (t, 2H, –O-CH2-); 3.39 ppm (t, 2H, –CH2-N); 7.95 ppm (S, broad, 4H, -NH3 + OH); 8.39 ppm (S, 1H, H-COO−) and for 13C NMR (62.9 MHz, DMSO-d 6): δ = 39.9, 59.5, 161.9 ppm. Water contents for all the samples were measured by coulometric Karl–Fischer titration. Repeated measurements were done to determine reproducibility (±0.054), Table S1 (Supplementary Information). All the chemicals were kept in dark glass flasks stored in a desiccator wrapped in aluminum foil and were kept in a refrigerator. 2HEAF + alcohol mixtures were prepared by weighing using an analytical balance (Sartorius TE124S, ±1 10−4 g). Samples were degassed (20 min) by ultrasounds (MISONIX Ultrasonic Liquid Processor)."
3,Thermophysical properties,"2.2 Thermophysical properties Densities and speeds of sound for pure liquids and their binary mixtures were measured using an Anton Paar DSA 5000 vibrating U-tube densimeter and sound analyzer with a certified precision of ±1 × 10−6 g cm−3 and ± 0.1 m s−1, respectively. Density and sound velocity cells are temperature-controlled by a built in Peltier (± 0.001 K). The refractive index of pure liquids and binary mixtures is measured by automatic refractometer Abbemate 200 (±0.0001)."
4,Molecular dynamics simulations,"2.3 Molecular dynamics simulations MD simulations were carried out with the MDynaMix v.5.2 program [52]. The forcefield parameterization for 2HEAF was previously reported whereas those for the alcohols are reported in the Supporting Information (Table S3). The simulated systems for 2HEAF + alcohol binary mixtures consist of 400 total molecules (2HEAF + alcohol), with the number of molecules for each mixture component varied according to mixture composition. Binary mixtures were simulated in the whole composition range with 0.1 mol fraction steps. Cubic simulation boxes were used along the work, with periodic boundary conditions, which were initially built with the Packmol [53] program. All MD simulations were carried out at 298.15 K and 1 bar in the NPT ensemble. MD simulations were carried out in two stages: i) 10 ns NPT equilibration steps (equilibration analyzed through the evolution of the total potential energy) and ii) 20 ns NPT production runs, which were used for the calculation of all the properties reported in this work. Temperature and pressure were controlled by using the Nose–Hoover method. The Ewald method was considered for handling coulombic interactions (15 Å cut-off radius) [54]. Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated with 15 Å cut off and Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules for cross terms. Equations of motion were solved with the Tuckerman–Berne double time step algorithm (1 and 0.1 fs for long and short time steps) [55]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermophysical properties,"3.1 Thermophysical properties Thermophysical properties for 2HEAF + alcohol mixtures (1PRO, 2PRO, 12PRO, 2M1PROP or 2M2PRO) are reported in Table S4 (Supporting Information) in the full composition range as a function of temperature. The temperature dependence of density was used for calculating thermal expansion coefficients, α p , according to Eq. (1) using linear fits for describing temperature evolution of density, ρ. These linear fits lead to R 2 ≥ 0.9995 for all the considered pure compounds and mixtures, thus providing an accurate description of ρ = f(T). (1) α p = − 1 ρ ∂ ρ ∂ T p Isentropic compressibilities, k s , were calculated from ρ and speed of sound, u, using Eq. (2). (2) k S = 1 ρ u 2 The analysis of intermolecular forces in the studied mixtures is done in terms of excess properties. For the calculation of some of these properties volume fraction, ∅ i (defined according to Eq. (3)), is required. Excess molar volumes, V E , excess thermal expansion coefficients, α p E , and excess isentropic compressibilities, k S E , were calculated as reported in Eqs. (4) to (6) [56]. In these equations, N stands for the number of compounds in the mixture (i = 2), x i for the mole fraction, M i for the molar mass, V i for the molar volume, k T, i for the isothermal compressibilities, and C p, i for the isobaric heat capacity. The k T values for 2HEAF were obtained from a previous work reported by our group [48], whereas those for alcohols were obtained from the literature [57–60]. The C p values for 2HEAF were calculated according to Eq. (7) whereas those for alcohols were obtained from the literature [61–65]. Mixing refractive index, ∆n D , was defined in terms of volume fraction (Eq. (8)) because the definition in terms of mole fraction has no physical meaning [66,67]. (3) ∅ i = x i V i ∑ i = 1 N x i V i (4) V E = ∑ i = 1 N x i M i ρ − ∑ i = 1 N x i M i ρ i (5) α p E = α p − ∑ i = 1 N ∅ i α p , i (6) k S E = ∑ i = 1 N ∅ i k T , i − T ∑ i = 1 N x i V i ∑ i = 1 N ∅ i α p , i 2 ∑ i = 1 N x i C p , i (7) C p , i = α p , i 2 V i T k T − k S (8) ∆ n D = n D − ∑ i = 1 N ∅ i n D , i Excess and mixing properties as a function of mixtures composition (x = 2HEAF mole fraction) were fitted to Redlich-Kister (RK) functions, Eq. (9): (9) M E = x 1 − x ∑ j = 0 k A j 2 x − 1 j The A j coefficients and the quality of the fits (quantified using standards deviations) for V E are reported in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The proper number of A i coefficients was selected according to the standard error of the fitting. RK fits were used to calculate partial molar volume of each mixture compound, V ¯ i , according to Eq. (10), and the excess partial molar volumes, V ¯ i E , from Eq. (11). (10) V ¯ i = V E + V i + 1 − x i ∂ V E ∂ x i P , T (11) V ¯ i E = V ¯ i − V i Values of V ¯ i and V ¯ i E at so-called infinite dilution conditions, V ¯ i ∞ and V ¯ i E , ∞ , were calculated for the limiting composition conditions, i.e. for values of the properties when x i → 0, and are reported in Table S6 (Supporting Information). The composition evolution of V E and α p E for the five binary x 2HEAF + (1-x) alcohol mixtures in the full composition range at 298.15 K is reported in Fig. 2 . The V E is negative in the full composition range for all the studied mixtures, Fig. 2a, although the value of the minima and the mixture composition for which the minima are inferred are largely dependent on the type of considered alcohol following the ordering 2M2PRO > 2PRO > 1PRO > 2M1PRO > 12PRO. These negative V E values can be explained considering i) strong ion – alcohol intermolecular forces, which would rise from the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors both in the IL and alcohol molecules, and ii) effective molecular packing because of the size and shape of the involved molecules. Steric effects should develop a pivotal role in the behavior of these mixtures, those alcohols with a single hydroxyl group leads to very different V E , with remarkably large negative V E values for 2M2PRO. The size and shape effects on mixture properties can be analyzed in terms of ovality parameters, Ov, defined as the ratio of molecular surface and volume [68], which were calculated from structures of isolated molecules in vacuum optimized at B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level [69–72] with ORCA program [73]. The relationship between alcohols' Ov and the value of V E at minima, V min E , are reported in Fig. 3 showing how alcohols with lower Ov values lead to larger (in absolute value) V min E and a certain linear relationship between V min E and Ov for alcohols with a single hydroxyl group (R 2 = 0.80). These results confirm the relevant effect of steric factors in the behavior of V E with molecules with shapes closer to spheres leading to better molecular packing and to larger (in absolute value) V E . In the case of 12PRO, the presence of two hydroxyl groups in the alcohol molecule leads to extensive alcohol – alcohol self‑hydrogen bonding in the pure alcohol [74], which is disrupted upon mixing with 2HEAF, thus leading to the lower (in absolute value) V E for the studied alcohols. Likewise, in the case of 2M2PRO the presence of three methyl groups at the α‑carbon atom increases the electron density at oxygen (hydroxyl) atom and causes better interaction with the ionic liquid, i.e. stronger hydrogen bonds IL-alcohol when compared with the other alcohols. The negative values of α P E for all the considered mixtures (except for 2HEAF rich mixtures containing 1PRO), Fig. 2b, confirm the decrease in compressibility of alcohols upon mixing, i.e. lower intermolecular free lengths. This is confirmed by the negative k S E values reported in Fig. 4a showing enhanced rigidity upon mixing with 2HEAF, and pointing to effective molecular packing upon mixing. Likewise, ∆n D follows an opposite behavior to V E being positive in the full composition range, Fig. 4b, in agreement with the interpretation of ∆n D in terms of the evolution of intermolecular forces upon mixing [75]. Reis et al. [76] analyzed the correlation between V E and ∆n D to interpret the behavior of refractive index in binary mixtures, showing complex features, which can be analyzed in terms of the involved intermolecular forces. Therefore, ∆n D vs. V E plots for 2HEAF + alcohol mixtures are reported in Fig. 5 , with these curves showing a complex interdependency between both properties being largely dependent on the type of alcohol. It is remarkable that whereas for mixtures containing 1PRO and 12PRO a cross point is inferred, Fig. 5a and c, lobular-shaped curves are obtained for the remaining alcohols. Nevertheless, the results reported in Fig. 5 show the existence of several mixing schemes in the studied mixtures as a function of 2HEAF content and the type of considered alcohol. Three regions can be considered i) x(2HEAF) up to roughly 0.4 (depending on the type of alcohol) for which the increase of ∆n D is accompanied also by an increase (in absolute value) of V E ; ii) x(2HEAF) roughly in the 0.4 to 0.7 range, for which minor changes in V E are paired with decreasing ∆n D ; and iii) x(2HEAF) > 0.7, in which both properties decrease. These three regions suggest the development of i) alcohol dominated mixtures (x(2HEAF) < 0.4) in which alcohol-alcohol self‑hydrogen bonding is roughly maintained, ii) transitional composition mixtures (x(2HEAF) from 0.4 to 0.7) in which alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonds are gradually replaced by alcohol-2HEAF interactions, and iii) 2HEAF dominated mixtures (x(2HEAF) > 0.7) in which alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding should be vanished being replaced mostly by alcohol monomers hydrogen bonded to 2HEAF ionic pairs. The evolution of V ¯ i E reported in Fig. 2c and d confirm the existence of several mixing regions, although the behavior of some mixtures is slightly complex, it can be also inferred the three composition regions defined in the previous paragraph, Fig. S2 (Supporting Information). The values of V ¯ i ∞ and V ¯ i E , ∞ reported in Table S6 (Supporting Information) provide useful information about the affinity between solute and solvent molecules. Most of the cases show V ¯ i E , ∞ < 0 (with the exception of V ¯ 12 PRO E , ∞ ), which may be attributed to the presence of significant interactions between unlike molecules, i.e. hydrogen bonding between alcohol and 2HEAF is highly favored, which would justify the large negative excess molar volume in spite of the disrupting effect of 2HEAF on the alcohol-alcohol self‑hydrogen bonding. The temperature effect on mixtures structure is analyzed through the changes in excess volume at minima, V min E , with temperature, which are reported in Fig. 6 . These results show an increase in absolute value of V min E with increasing temperature in the studied temperature range, i.e. increase of contraction effect upon mixing, Fig. 6a, with changes in the 16% (1PRO) to 33% (12PRO) on going from 298.15 to 323.15 K. The temperature effect on V ¯ i E , ∞ is reported in Fig. 7 , these results show that V ¯ 2 HEAF E , ∞ increases in absolute value with increasing temperature with very large changes in the studied temperature range, whereas V ¯ ALCOH E , ∞ show minor changes for most of the alcohols or even large decrease in absolute value for 1PRO. These results show that although alcohol-2HEAF hydrogen bonding is maintained in the studied range, leading to a contractive effect upon mixing, the disruptive effect of temperature on alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding is the main factor controlling mixing process as the V ¯ i E , ∞ show. Although the reported experimental thermophysical properties provide information about the intermolecular forces and structuring in the studied mixtures, more detailed characterization can be obtained from the use of theoretical modelling of these results according to a suitable theoretical approach. The Prigogine-Flory-Patterson (PFP) theory [77–79] has been reported as a suitable approach for analyzing properties (specially V E ) in IL + MS mixtures [80,81]. PFP theory considers molecules as formed by isometric segments interacting with neighbor segments, and although specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding are not included in the model it can be used to infer the different contributions to V E as defined in Eq. (12): (12) V E = V interactional E + V free volume E V P ∗ effect E where V interactional E stands for the contribution associated with intermolecular interactions being proportional to the empirical χ 12 parameter; V free volume E for the contributions rising from changes in available free volume as a result of the different expansivities of mixed compounds, and V P∗effect E for the term rising from the different internal pressures of the considered compounds. PFP equations are described in the literature [81] and the properties required for the application of the model are reported in Table S7 (Supporting Information). The calculation of V E according to PFP theory requires the determination of χ 12 parameter, which is calculated for equimolar compositions [81]. The results of PFP application to V E are reported in Fig. 8 showing that the model can describe the behavior of V E although larger deviations are inferred for systems containing 2M1PRO and 2M2PRO. All the studied 2HEAF + alcohol mixtures are characterized by negative V interactional E contribution, because of the large χ 12 parameter, thus suggesting strong intermolecular forces in the considered mixtures. The χ 12 parameter follows the ordering (in absolute value) 12PRO > 2M2PRO > 2PRO > 1PRO > 2M1PRO, which can be used to quantify the strength of 2HEAF-alcohol interactions. The V free volume E contributions are negative (as expected) for all the mixtures and follows (in absolute value) 2M2PRO > 2PRO > 2M1PRO > 1PRO > > 12PRO, therefore these mixtures are characterized by the increase of free volume upon mixing, i.e. mixing process is characterized by a very efficient rearrangement of available space, which combined with the developed heteroassociations are responsible of the large contraction upon mixing. Regarding V P∗effect E contribution it is positive for all the systems which can be related with the structure breaking effect of 2HEAF on the hydrogen bonding structure of alcohols and vice versa, which is favored by the formation of 2HEAF + alcohol interactions."
7,Molecular dynamics simulations,"3.2 Molecular dynamics simulations The experimental results and PFP analysis of the obtained properties provide a vision of the liquid structure and properties of the studied mixed fluids but further details at the microscopic level are required, which can be inferred from the MD simulations. The MD simulations can reproduce the most relevant physicochemical features, as showed in Fig. 9 by the comparison of experimental and predicted excess volume showing good qualitative and quantitative agreement. The presence of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups both in both components (2HEAF and alcohols) of the studied mixtures should be the main factor controlling the microscopic structuring in these mixed fluids. The local arrangements were initially analyzed considering site – site radial distribution functions (RDFs) for selected atoms involved in hydrogen bonding sites, Fig. 10 . RDFs for alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding are reported in Fig. 10a to e, all the studied alcohols lead to two well defined RDFs peaks, with maxima at roughly 1.88 (slightly larger for 2M2PRO mixtures) and 3.39 Å, with intensity decreasing with increasing 2HEAF concentration, which show that alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding is maintained in the full composition range. The solvation numbers corresponding to alcohol-alcohol RDFs are reported in Fig. 11a and b for the first and second solvation shell, which show a non-linear decrease with increasing 2HEAF concentration, with values lower than those expected from a linear dilution effect, thus showing the disruptive effect of 2HEAF on alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding. Regarding the effect of the type of considered alcohol, the larger differences are inferred for 12PRO that leads to lower alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding upon the dilution in 2HEAF, Figs. 10c and 11 a. minor differences are inferred for the remaining alcohols with only relevant features obtained in the second solvation sphere for which a lower number of alcohol molecules are inferred for 2M2PRO, Fig. 11b, which can be produced by a steric effect related with the shape of the alcohol molecule. The disruptive effect of 2HEAF on alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding should be related with the development of alcohol – 2HEAF hydrogen bonding, both with 2-HEA cation and FOR anion. Alcohol – 2-HEA hydrogen bonding is analyzed through RDFs reported in Fig. 10f to j, which show two solvation peaks with maxima positions and composition evolution like those for alcohol-alcohol RDFs, and solvation numbers reported in Fig. 11c to d showing non-linear evolution with mixture composition and remarkable differences on the behavior of 12PRO in comparison with the remaining alcohols. The development of alcohol-FOR hydrogen bonding is also confirmed from the RDFs reported in Fig. 10k to o, with the corresponding solvation numbers reported in Fig. 11e and f showing similar extension of alcohol – FOR and alcohol – 2-HEA, i.e. alcohol molecules are hydrogen bonded both to cation and anion without any remarkable preferential interaction. It should be remarked the lower extension of hydrogen bonding for mixtures containing 12PRO, pointing to the presence of two neighbor hydroxyl groups in the alcohol as a disruptive effect, which would justify the lower, in absolute value, experimental excess molar volume reported in Fig. 2a. Likewise, the alcohol – 2HEAF mixtures are characterized by anion-cation hydrogen bonding, Fig. 10p to t, but the solvation numbers reported in Fig. 11g to h, show larger values than those expected from a pure dilution effect, i.e. the trend to develop 2-HEA – FOR hydrogen bonding is favored in the whole composition range over the other possible hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, the position of the maxima for RDFs peaks for the first and second solvation shells for all the considered hydrogen bonding pairs reported in Fig. 10 appear at almost the same distance, thus showing that solvation shells around alcohols and ions are composed by both types of molecules, with an enrichment of ions because of the favored anion-cation interactions. This behavior is confirmed by the spatial distribution functions (SDFs) reported in Fig. 12 . The structure around alcohol molecules, e.g. around 1PRO (Fig. 12a, similar results for the remaining alcohols), is characterized by a high densification of alcohol, 2-HEA and FOR species around the hydroxyl group, in agreement with RDFs reported in Fig. 10, thus the three types of molecules are competing for the same interaction site. Likewise, the possibility of 2-HEA acting as a hydrogen bond donor group leads to a densification below the hydroxyl group of alcohols, thus confirming 2-HEA developing hydrogen bonding with alcohols both as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. In the case of alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding, results in Fig. 12a show a single interaction site, confirming that a central alcohol molecule acts mainly as hydrogen bond donor regarding another alcohol molecule whereas the possibility of acting as acceptor is occupied by alcohol – 2-HEA interactions. Regarding the structuring around 2-HEA cations, Fig. 12b, a cap above the hydroxyl group occupied by alcohol, 2-HEA and FOR molecules is inferred showing hydrogen bonding with these molecules in this site, which is accompanied by a solvation shell of FOR molecules all around the 2-HEA cation. In the case of FOR, Fig. 12c, two caps above the oxygen atoms are inferred that are occupied both by 2-HEA cation and alcohol molecules, although being richer in 2-HEA because of the prevailing 2HEA-FOR hydrogen bonding showed in Fig. 11g and h, which is accompanied by a large concentration of FOR molecules around the CH group pointing to a weak FOR-FOR hydrogen bonding through this position. Therefore, all the available hydroxyl groups and CO sites (in FOR) are occupied by the three possible hydrogen bond donors or acceptors (alcohol, cation and anion) although with an enrichment of anion-cation interactions for sites in cation and anion. The MD results allow to infer the strength of intermolecular interactions through the calculated intermolecular interaction energies, E inter , defined as the sum of Lennard-Jones (i.e. van der Waals) and coulombic (i.e. pure electrostatic) contributions, and their evolution with mixture composition, Fig. 13 . Alcohol – alcohol interactions are stronger for 12PRO containing mixtures because of the presence of two hydroxyl groups, but as the 2HEAF content increases they decrease in a similar way for all the considered alcohols, Fig. 13a. Regarding alcohol – 2HEA and -FOR E inter , Fig. 13b and c, they follow a non-linear evolution with mixture composition leading to a linear decrease in absolute value for alcohol rich mixtures and then they remains almost constant for 2HEAF rich mixtures above equimolar compositions, thus confirming that alcohol remains in the solvation spheres around anion and cation even for 2HEAF rich mixtures, thus decreasing the extension of alcohol – alcohol interactions. Regarding E inter for 2HEA – FOR interactions, Fig. 13d, the reported results show a non-linear increase (in absolute value) with increasing 2HEAF content, showing the prevailing anion – cation interactions over the other possible ones with negligible differences for all the considered alcohols. The reported results have shown the formation of extensive hydrogen bonding between all the involved molecules; thus, we also analyzed the dynamic properties of these intermolecular forces. For this purpose, the so-called residence times, t res , defined as the time an atom remains in a solvation sphere defined around a central one, were calculated as previously defined [82], Fig. 14 . As the objective is to analyze the dynamics of hydrogen bonding, solvation spheres for the calculation of t res were defined according to the first minima of RDFs reported in Fig. 10, i.e. spheres with radii which allow the development of hydrogen bonds. All the developed hydrogen bonds are largely labile, with t res lower than 20 ps for all the interactions and alcohols (mostly except for 2M2PRO containing mixtures), and they decrease with increasing 2HEAF content. Although the viscosity of the considered liquid mixtures should increase with increasing 2HEAF content (pure 2HEAF is more viscous than any of the considered alcohols [47]), the local dynamics of hydrogen bonds increases with increasing ionic liquid content, in spite of the strength and extension of the developed hydrogen bonding in the considered mixtures."
8,Conclusions,"This article reports a combined experimental and theoretical study on the properties and structuring of 2-hydroxyethylammonium +1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1,2-propanediol, 2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol in the 298.15 to 323.15 K temperature range and atmospheric pressures over the whole composition range. Experimental results showed large deviations from ideality which are justified by the development of extensive hydrogen bonding between the available hydrogen donor and acceptor sites. Solvation spheres around each type of molecules are defined by the presence of all the possible hydrogen donor species around the corresponding sites, thus competing for the development of hydrogen bonding which are of similar strength. The development of anion – cation hydrogen bonding is slightly favored over the remaining ones but alcohol – alcohol and alcohol – ion hydrogen bonding is formed in the whole composition range. The development of molecular solvent (alcohol) – ionic liquid hydrogen bonding without disrupting ion – ion interactions may be considering as a way of fine tuning ionic liquid properties but maintaining most of the relevant ionic liquid features, which is of relevance for the application of the considered ionic liquid(s)."
