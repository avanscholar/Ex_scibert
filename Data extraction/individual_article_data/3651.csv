0,Introduction,"Brazil is the world's major producer of ethanol from sugarcane [1], and this industry offers a variety of byproducts that can be exploited [2]. According to forecasts by the National Supply Company (CONAB), the production of sugarcane for the 2018/19 harvest in Brazil will be 615.84 million tons. Ethanol production in the country is expected to reach 32.3 billion liters, and sugar production is expected to reach 31.73 million tons [3]. One of the byproducts generated in the sugar-alcohol industry is molasses. Predictions by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [1] suggest that sugarcane molasses production in Brazil will reach approximately 14,000 tons by 2019 [1]. During the off season periods, this byproduct is used for ethanol production in Brazil. However, ethanol production from molasses yields 12 L of ethanol per ton of sugarcane processed, while the ethanol production from sugarcane juice yields 80 L per ton of sugarcane processed [4]. An alternative that can add value for the sugar and ethanol process chain is the application of sugarcane molasses as a substrate in dark fermentation for H2 production because of the valuable carbohydrates in its composition [5]. The most important components in molasses for H2 production are sucrose (28.71% w/v), fructose (10.35% w/v) and glucose (3.77% w/v) [6]. Although approximately 80% of sugar production in the world occurs from sugarcane [6], many studies in the literature investigate the dark fermentation of beet molasses [7–9]. These studies have used suspended cell growth systems, such as continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) [2,7,8], and immobilized cell growth systems, such as the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor [9]. Using an EGSB (35 °C) reactor, Guo et al. [9] evaluated the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) (6 h to 1 h) on H2 production from beet molasses (2–10 gchemical oxygen demand (COD) L−1). The maximum hydrogen production rate observed by the authors was 0.71Lh−1 L−1 at the HRT of 2 h. After 60 days of operation the main metabolites detected were acetate and ethanol, corresponding to 89.1% of the total metabolites produced. Several studies describe ethanol-type [2,9] and butyrate-type fermentation [10,11] as the most common routes of hydrogen production through the fermentation process. However, depending on the microbial population present in the inoculum and in the substrate, fermentation may occur through other metabolic pathways, since several species of microorganisms can coexist [12]. For example, bacterial cultures producing propionic acid (HPr), lactic acid (HLa) and acetic acid (HAc) by autotrophic processes can affect hydrogen yields through substrate competition and H2 consumption in their production pathways [12–14]. The growth of bacteria that can interfere with hydrogen production can be avoided by applying pretreatments to mixed anaerobic cultures [15]. However, it has been reported that pretreatment cannot always prevent the growth of all inhibitory microorganisms [12]. Another solution to this problem is the reduction of HRT, since the growth rate of H2-producing bacteria is greater than that of H2-consuming bacteria [16]. Therefore, to maximize H2 production, it is essential to identify the optimal HRT of an operation. In this context, the use of mixed cultures is advantageous, since it has operational benefits relative to the use of pure cultures, such as simplicity of handling, potential to use several organic substrates and reduction of operational costs [17]. Despite the notable advances in literature studies on dark fermentation of beet molasses, the higher production of sugarcane byproducts makes it necessary to investigate the routes for H2 production from sugarcane molasses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of decreasing the HRT from 24 to 1 h on hydrogen production from sugarcane molasses using a mixed culture, because the HRT is one of the main factors that influence the dark fermentation. For this purpose, three mesophilic EGSB reactors (30 °C) with molasses concentrations equal to 5, 10 and 15 g L−1 (referred to as EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively) were constructed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Design of the EGSB reactors,"2.1 Design of the EGSB reactors In this study, three laboratory-scale EGSB reactors with identical configurations were operated. The reactors were constructed of transparent acrylic with a diameter of 3.6 cm and a working volume of 1.5L. The EGSB reactors were operated under mesophilic conditions with a constant temperature of 30 ± 1 °C, which was maintained by the circulation of water from an ultrathermostatized water bath through the outer jacket of the reactors and internal tube (“U” shape) inside the reactors. The superficial velocity of the reactors was maintained at 6 m h−1 by using a recycling pump, which ensured a bed expansion of 30% relative to the granular bed initial height of 50 cm. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup of the EGSB reactors."
3,"Inoculum, support medium and substrate","2.2 Inoculum, support medium and substrate The inoculum was obtained from granulated sludge from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor used for poultry slaughterhouse wastewater treatment (Avícola Dacar, Tietê, SP, Brazil). For the selection of H2-producing communities, the inoculum (10%v/v) was homogenized and subjected to heat treatment according to Kim et al. [18] with subsequent cooling in an ice bath until the temperature reached 25 °C. The support material came from the same sludge used as an inoculum. The sludge was sieved to separate the granules with diameters of 3.0–5.0 mm that formed the bed of the EGSB reactors. The sieved granules, with diameters of 3.0 to 5.0 mm, were heated at 100 °C for 1 h under constant stirring, followed by cooling in an ice bath until the temperature reached 25 °C [19]. The organic substrate used as the carbon source was sugarcane molasses collected from the distillery plant São Martinho (Pradópolis, SP, Brazil). The raw molasses was collected in concentrated form, and its physicochemical characterization is shown in Table 1 . In order to feed the reactors EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, the molasses was diluted with tap water to the respective concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 g sucrose L−1. A nutritional medium was added to the molasses solution as described by Rosa et al. [20]."
4,Startup and reactor operation,"2.3 Startup and reactor operation In the reactor startup, the inoculum and molasses solution with an initial concentration of 2.5 gsucrose L−1 were recirculated until a carbohydrate conversion of 80% was achieved. The molasses concentration was increased in intervals of 2.5 g sucrose L−1 (after reaching 80% carbohydrate consumption) until the operating concentration established for each reactor was reached (EGSB-5, from 2.5 to 5.0 gsucrose L−1, EGSB-10, from 2.5 to 5.0 to 7.5 to 10.0 gsucrose L−1, EGSB-15, from 2.5 to 5.0 to 7.5 to 10.0 to 12.5 to 15.0 gsucrose L−1). The pH of the feed prepared for the startup procedure of the reactors was ~ 5.5. The pH, COD and carbohydrate concentration were monitored daily during this period. After inoculation, the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors were operated in continuous mode for 191, 201 and 210 days, respectively, in six operational conditions as a function of the decreasing HRT (24, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 h). The change in the reactor operational conditions was performed after reaching a steady state, that is, variations of less than 10% in the carbohydrate conversion and hydrogen production (composition, yield, and volumetric production) over a period of 10 days. Under conditions with no hydrogen production, only the stabilization of the carbohydrate conversion parameter was considered when changing the operational conditions. The effluent pH was maintained within the range of 4.0 and 4.7 by the addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The measurements of pH, COD, volatile suspended solids (VSS) and total suspended solids (TSS) were performed according to the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater [21]. The affluent and effluent carbohydrate concentrations of the reactors were quantified based on the method proposed by Dubois et al. [22]. The volumetric biogas production was measured by liquid displacement, as proposed by Walker et al. [23]. The biogas composition was determined by gas chromatography [24]. The concentrations of organic acids and alcohols were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography according to the method proposed by Penteado et al. [24]."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Effect of HRT on biohydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of HRT on biohydrogen production The effect of hydraulic retention time on hydrogen production from sugarcane molasses by dark fermentation with mixed culture was investigated. CH4 was not detected in the biogas composition during the operation of EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, evidencing the effectiveness of the heat pretreatment of the inoculum and the operation under acidic pH conditions (between 4.0 and 4.7) in inhibiting methanogenic archaea. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of HRT on the hydrogen content (%H2) and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of the EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors. In EGSB-5, no hydrogen was observed in the biogas as the HRT decreased from 24 h to 1 h. In EGSB-10, a %H2 of 17.2 ± 3.9% was observed at the HRT of 24 h, but no hydrogen was observed at HRTs from 16 h to 4 h. At HRTs of 2 h and 1 h, the %H2 was equal to 1.5 ± 1.8% and 8.03 ± 2.4%, respectively. In EGSB-15, the %H2 decreased from 19.1 ± 6.3% to 4.4 ± 3.9% with the decrease in HRT from 24 h to 8 h. With further reduction of the HRT from 8 h to 1 h, the %H2 increased from 4.4 ± 3.9% to 13.0 ± 2.4%. EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 showed similar %H2 behavior, with high percentages at an HRT of 24 h, low values at HRTs of 16 and 8 h and higher values at HRTs from 4 h to 1 h. According to Wang et al. [2], at long HRTs, hydrogen-producing bacteria have enough time for adequate substrate utilization, which does not occur at shorter HRTs due to the high inflow velocity of the feed, explaining the relatively high %H2 values obtained with an HRT of 24 h in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15. In contrast to EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, Yun and Cho [25], operating a CSTR (35 °C) with molasses (20 gCOD L−1) and an effluent pH of 4.2, detected CH4 (35–40%) at an HRT of 24 h. In this case, the heat treatment applied to the inoculum used by Yun and Cho [25] was not effective during the long-term operation of the reactor with an HRT of 24 h (335 days). H2% values similar to this study (maximum %H2 values of 20.4% and 42.2% for EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively) were observed by Guo et al. [9] in an EGSB reactor with a decreasing HRT from 6 h to 1 h, consequently increasing organic loading rate (OLR) from 8 to 192 kg COD m−3 day−1, with beet molasses used as the substrate. The authors observed %H2 values between 30 and 51%. In EGSB-10, the HPR was 3.55 ± 0.8 L day−1 L−1 at the HRT of 1 h, with a maximum value of 4.56 L day−1 L−1 in this reactor. In EGSB-15, the HPR increased from 1.94 ± 1.6 L day−1 L−1 at the HRT of 2 h to 8.83 ± 2.83 L day−1 L−1 at the HRT of 1 h, with a maximum value of 13.92 L day−1 L−1 observed at the HRT of 1 h and pH 4.6. The HPRs observed in the EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors increased with decreasing HRT due to the greater substrate availability for H2 production. Other studies have also reported similar behavior under mesophilic operational conditions [2,26,27]. Similar to the present study, Guo et al. [9] investigated H2 production in an EGSB reactor using granular activated carbon (GAC) as a support material and beet molasses as a substrate. The authors observed an increase in the HPR to 17.0 L day−1 L−1 with a decrease in the HRT from 6 h to 2 h (corresponding to OLRs of 8 to 120 kgCODm−3 day−1) and a decrease in the HPR to 2.4 L day−1 L−1 with an increase in the OLR to 192 kgCODm−3 day−1. Previous studies [28,29] have indicated that H2 production can be inhibited under high OLRs because of the accumulation of organic acids in the system [30]. In contrast to the observations of Guo et al. [9], EGSB-15 showed greater robustness than the other reactors, as evidenced by the fact that the highest HPR (13.92 L day−1 L−1) was associated with an OLR of 360 kgCODm−3 day−1. Despite the superior robustness of EGSB-15, the maximum HPR (17.0 L day−1 L−1) of Guo et al. [9] was superior to that of EGSB-15 (13.92 L day−1 L−1), possibly because of the use of GAC as a carrier material. Idris et al. [31] investigated the effect of molasses concentration (50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%) in batch tests (37 °C) during the immobilization of mixed cultures in GAC. The study by Idris et al. [31] confirmed that the use of GAC as a carrier material increased H2 production by up to 50%. Boshagh et al. [32] evaluated different support media for hydrogen production from glucose (20 g L−1). The authors observed an HPR of 44.40 L day−1 L−1 for the reactor without a medium and an HPR of 50.64 L day−1 L−1 for the reactor with GAC as the support medium. Lay et al. [26] operated a CSTR (35 °C) fed with beet molasses (40 g L−1) and found that the HPR increased to 0.67 L day−1 L−1 with a decrease in the HRT from 24 h to 3 h (corresponding to OLRs of 40–320 kg m−3 day−1). Although the HPR observed in the EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors were lower than the maximum reported by Guo et al. [9] in EGSB reactor with GAC as carrier material, it was higher than the HPR reported by Lay et al. [26]. The high HPRs observed in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 can be explained by the type of reactor used, since the immobilization of biomass in an EGSB reactor avoids the washing of the biomass that occurs in CSTR [5,33]. Salem et al. [33], operating a CSTR (35 °C) fed with bean feedstock (10 g L−1), observed a reduction in the HPR from 1.9 L day−1 L−1 to 0.43 L day−1 L−1 as the HRT decreased from 24 h to 12 h. Tomczak et al. [34] investigated H2 production in an anaerobic packed bed reactor (APBR) (37 °C) fed with sucrose (5 g L−1) and observed that decreasing the HRT from 3 h to 2 h resulted in an increase in the HPR from 1.32 to 2.00 L day−1 L−1. However, with further reduction of the HRT to 1 h, the HPR decreased to 1.34 L day−1 L−1, unlike the patterns observed in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, in which the HPR increased in response to a similar decrease in the HRT. Barros et al. [27] used an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) for H2 production from glucose (4 g L−1) and observed that for polystyrene as a support medium, the HPR increased from 2.40 to 12.48 L day−1 L−1 with the decrease in the HRT from 8 to 1 h. Ferreira et al. [35], operating an AFBR (30 °C) fed with sucrose (5 g L−1), observed an increase in the HPR from 1.70 to 8.20 L day−1 L−1 with a reduction in the HRT from 8 h to 1 h."
8,Performance of the fermentative process,"3.2 Performance of the fermentative process The effluent pH remained from 4.4 to 4.5 in EGSB-5 and EGSB-15 and from 4.3 to 4.7 in EGSB-10. The COD removal was maintained from 0.02 to 14.8%, 7.7 to 26.2% and 3.0 to 16.4% in EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors, respectively, which represent expected COD removal values for acidogenic systems [36]. Han et al. [7], in the operation of a CSTR with immobilized biomass, a mesophilic temperature (35 °C), a fixed HRT of 6 h and a beet molasses concentration of 10 g L−1, reported a mean COD conversion of 13.2%. Ramos and Silva [19] observed a COD removal of 9.9% in a H2-producing EGSB reactor using cheese whey as a substrate (15 and 25 gCOD L−1), mesophilic operating conditions (30 °C), and decreasing HRTs from 8 to 0.5 h. Fig. 3 shows the carbohydrate conversions of the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors as a function of HRT and OLR. The carbohydrate conversion in EGSB-5 decreased from 99.0 ± 0.8% to 92.4 ± 2.1% as the HRT decreased from 24 h to 1 h. In EGSB-10, the carbohydrate conversion decreased from 95.2 ± 0.8% to 88.7 ± 7.6% as the HRT decreased from 24 h to 1 h. In the EGSB-15, the carbohydrate conversion decreased from 94.5 ± 1.3% to 71.4 ± 7.1% as the HRT decreased from 24 h to 1 h. Chang et al. [37] used a CSTR (35 °C) fed with beet molasses at an OLR of 20 to 44 kgCODm−3 day−1 for H2 production. These authors observed an average carbohydrate conversion of 79%, which is lower than those of EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 for OLRs between 15 and 60 kgsucrosem−3 day−1 (95.6–94.3%, 95.5–96.1% and 94.5–91.1%, respectively). Additionally, using a CSTR (35 °C) for H2 production from beet molasses (40 gCOD L−1), Lay et al. [26] observed similar results to those of the present study, with decreasing carbohydrate conversion values from 94% to 70% with decreasing HRTs from 24 h to 3 h (corresponding to OLRs of 40–320 kgCODm−3 day -1). Although high OLR values are preferable in the anaerobic digestion process due to the minimization of energy needs in the operation, high substrate concentrations may inhibit the activity of microorganisms [12,15]. Kumar et al. [38] used sugarcane molasses in batch tests (30 °C) for hydrogen production and observed carbohydrate conversions of 73, 68, 64 and 46% for molasses concentrations equal to 10, 20, 40 and 50 g L−1, respectively. Karapinar et al. [15], using an upflow packed bed reactor (48 °C) for H2 production from glucose (15 g L−1), observed that the substrate conversion at an HRT of 2 h (30–40%), corresponding to an OLR of 184 kg m−3 day−1, was lower than that at an HRT of 6 h (60%), corresponding to an OLR of 64 kg m−3 day−1. Ferreira et al. [35], using an AFBR to produce hydrogen from sucrose (5 gCOD L−1) at a temperature of 30 °C, also reported a decrease in carbohydrate conversion from 76.7% to 36.6% when the HRT was reduced from 8 to 1 h (corresponding to an OLR increase from 15 to 120 kgCODm−3 day−1). The EGSB reactors showed the same behavior as the AFBR and the upflow packed bed reactor. However, it is possible to once again highlight the robustness of the EGSB reactor, which showed a decrease in carbohydrate conversion to 70% by increasing the OLR to 360 kg m−3 day−1. On the other hand, the upflow packed bed reactor presented 30–40% of substrate conversion in OLR of 184 kg m−3 day−1 [15] and the AFBR presented 36.6% of substrate conversion in OLR of 120 kgCODm−3 day−1 [35]."
9,Composition and distribution of soluble products,"3.3 Composition and distribution of soluble products The concentrations of the major metabolites produced as a function of HRT in the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors are shown in Figs. 4–6 , respectively. In EGSB-5, the main metabolites produced were HAc (30.0–50.0%), HPr (13.0–45.0%), butyric acid (HBu) (13.0–30.0%) and valeric acid (HVa) (3.0–8.0%). In EGSB-10, the main metabolites produced were HBu (8.0–51.0%), HPr (17.0–32.0%), HAc (11.0–32.0%) and HLa (13.0–29.0%). Similar to EGSB-10, the main metabolites produced in EGSB-15 were HPr (4.0–57.0%), HLa (6.0–50.0%), HBu (18.0–33.0%) and HAc (7.0–23.0%). In EGSB-5, the absence of H2 despite the high percentage of HAc (30.0–50.0%) at all HRTs may be related to the presence of homoacetogenic microorganisms, which use CO2 and H2 for HAc formation (Eq. (1)) [39]. The production of HAc by the homoacetogenesis process can be estimated via mass balance on the basis of the metabolites produced and hydrogen yields (HY) (Eq. (2)) [40,41]. (1) 2CO2 + 4H2 → C2H4O2 + 2H2O (2) [HAcH] = (2[HAc] + 2[HBu] − [HPr] − HY)/6 where [HBu], [HAc] and [HPr] are the measured concentrations of HBu, HAc and HPr in mmol, respectively, and HAcH is the concentration of acetic acid from homoacetogenesis in mmol. Table 2 shows the percentage values of HAc produced in the homoacetogenesis process at all HRTs in this experiment. In EGSB-5, the concentration of HAc from the homoacetogenesis process was considerable. The production of HAc increased until an HRT of 2 h and then decreased slightly at an HRT of 1 h (from 51% to 45%). These values confirm that homoacetogenesis plays an important role in limiting hydrogen production in this reactor. At shorter HRTs, the percentage of HAc from the homoacetogenesis process was similar to the percentage of HAc responsible for hydrogen production. Similar values were reported by Palomo-Briones et al. [42] (36%–46%). These authors evaluated the effect of improving mass transfer conditions on hydrogen production. Although the less hydrogen was accumulated in the reactor, homoacetogenic hydrogen consumption remained constant. This indicates that even at better mass transfer conditions, such as in the EGSB reactor, the homoacetogenic hydrogen consumption can occur. Therefore, high HAc production is not always associated with a high HY. Lovato et al. [43] investigated the effect of temperature in the mesophilic range (20, 25, 30 and 35 °C) for H2 production from the codigestion of cheese whey and glycerin in an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor (ASBBR). The authors observed that the best temperature for H2 production was 30 °C and that a high molar fraction of HAc (57.3%) resulted in an HY of 0.7 molH2 mol−1 substrate while the low molar fraction of HAc (30.4%) resulted in an HY of 1.4 molH2 mol−1 substrate. The reactor with the lower HY was also observed to have a higher molar fraction of HPr (29.3%) than the reactor with the higher HY (13.3%). In EGSB-5, HPr (13.0–45.0%) was also produced at all HRTs. The production of HPr uses hydrogen (Eq. (3)), further explaining the absence of H2 in this reactor. (3) C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O Tunçay et al. [44] stated that the use of complex carbon sources, such molasses, may lead to the occurrence of homoacetogenesis because such carbon sources contain autochthonous microorganisms. Arroj et al. [40] observed a homoacetogenesis-produced HAc value (41%) similar to that in EGSB-5 (23–51%) during H2 production in a CSTR (35 °C) with starch as the substrate (20 gCOD L−1) and with the HRT decreasing from 18 to 4 h. Castelló et al. [45], using a CSTR (30 °C) to produce H2 from cheese whey (30 gCOD L−1) at a fixed HRT of 24 h, observed HAc production by homoacetogenesis of 46%, which was also similar to that of EGSB-5. In the reactors EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, the highest %H2 at HRT of 24 h was coincident with the lowest concentration of HAc of 0.38 g L−1. However, the absence of H2 or low %H2 at the HRT from 16 h to 4 h may be related to the increase in HAc molar fraction because of the occurrence of homoacetogenesis. In addition, by decreasing the HRT from 24 h to 16 h the observed HPr molar fractions were 35.2% and 39.4% in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively. The metabolic routes of H2 production were similar. In EGSB-10, H2 production was associated with a decrease in the HPr concentration from 1.4 g L−1 at an HRT of 16 h to 0.6 g L−1 at an HRT of 1 h and the presence of HLa (1.3 g L−1), HAc (0.9 g L−1) and HBu (1.8 g L−1) at the HRT of 1 h. In EGSB-15, the H2 production at HRTs of 2 h and 1 h coincided with an increase in the HLa concentration from 0.5 g L−1 at an HRT of 24 h to 4.8 g L−1 at an HRT of 2 h, the presence of HAc (1.7 g L−1 at an HRT of 2 h and 1.3 g L−1 at an HRT of 1 h) and HBu (2.0 g L−1 at an HRT of 2 h and 1.8 g L−1 at an HRT of 1 h) and a decrease in the HPr concentration (from 3.6 g L−1 at an HRT of 24 h to 0.3 g L−1 at an HRT of 1 h). Cells are increasingly washed out as the HRT decreases from 24 to 1 h, and this process may explain the reduction in the HPr concentration in the EGSB reactors, because the growth rate of hydrogen-producing species is slower than the growth rate of HPr-producing bacteria [46]. Ferreira et al. [35] used an AFBR (30 °C) to produce H2 from sucrose (5 g L−1) while decreasing the HRT from 8 h to 1 h and observed that the decrease in HRT from 8 h to 1 h resulted in an increase in the HBu concentrations from 10.5% to 20.7%, maintenance of the HAc concentrations between 31.3% and 46.1% and a decrease in the HPr concentrations from 47.4% to 14.3%. Unlike the patterns observed in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, Nualsri et al. [47], using a CSTR (37 °C) for H2 production from sugarcane juice (25 gCOD L−1), observed an increase in H2 production (1.18 to 17.40 L day−1 L−1) with a decrease in the HLa concentration (7.2 gCOD L−1 to 2.2 gCOD L−1) as the HRT was reduced from 12 h to 3 h. The authors concluded that H2 production was associated with the HBu fermentation pathway. Castelló et al. [45], using a CSTR (30 °C) to produce H2 from cheese whey (30 gCOD L−1) with an HRT of 24 h, also correlated H2 production with the HBu fermentation pathway. The authors observed the presence of HLa concomitantly with the presence of HBu, similar to the observations from EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, indicating that the concentrations of HLa and HBu are independent. Thus, both fermentations occurred in the CSTR and did not interfere with hydrogen production. The formation of hydrogen from HLa can occur through the conversion of HLa and HAc to HBu and H2 (Eq. (4)) [48]. (4) CH3CH(OH)COOH + 0.4CH3COOH → 0.7CH3(CH2)2COOH + CO2 + 0.4 H2O + 0.6H2 Generally, bacteria use HLa and HAc [49] to produce H2 and HBu under conditions of low substrate availability [48]. However, in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, the H2 and HBu production from HLa fermentation was favored under high OLRs (180–360 kgCODm−3 day−1). The H2 production from HLa and HAc was recently reported [50,51]. In this type of fermentation, HLa production provides the equilibrium between NADH/NAD + due to the lack of stability of the HBu fermentative pathway in the accumulation of these enzymes [52]. Changes related to the NADH/NAD + balance are microbial mechanisms for NADH regeneration [52] without increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen in organic overload conditions [53]. However, this mechanism generates less hydrogen than the HAc (Eq. (5)) and HBu (Eq. (6)) pathways [17]. (5) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (6) C6H12O6 → CH3(CH2)2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 The increase in HLa concentration was also observed by Mariakakis et al. [10] operating a CSTR under mesophilic conditions (37 °C) with beet molasses as a carbon source (with OLRs of 11.6–69.6 kgCODm−3 day−1). These authors observed an increase in HLa production under conditions of high substrate availability. However, the authors found that increased HLa production also resulted in decreased HPR and HY. The HY value at the HRT of 1 h for EGSB-10 was 0.09 ± 0.03 molH2 mol−1 hexose. In the EGSB-15, the HY increased from 0.05 ± 0.03 to 0.13 ± 0.03 molH2 mol−1 hexose when the HRT decreased from 2 to 1 h, with a maximum value of 0.25 molH2 mol−1 hexose at the HRT of 1 h. To compare the results, Table 3 shows the HY and HPR values of this study and other studies using sugarcane molasses as substrate. According to Agler [17], the theoretical values of HY are 4 molH2 mol−1 hexose if the hexose is metabolized to HAc and 2 molH2 mol−1 hexose if the hexose is metabolized to HBu. When the fermentation products are organic compounds such HLa and EtOH, the HY is even lower because of the conversion of carbohydrates to these products, bypassing the main reactions that produce hydrogen. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the HY and the lactic acid yield (LaY) in EGSB-15. The HY was highly affected by the LaY (Fig. 7), since the HY values remained very low (maximum of 0.25 molH2 mol−1 hexose) when the values of LaY were (maximum of 0.99 molHLamol−1 hexose). The LaY increased from 0.10 ± 0.04 to 0.84 ± 0.15 molHLamol−1 hexose when the HRT decreased from 24 h to 2 h and decreased to 0.64 ± 0.10 molHLamol−1 hexose when the HRT decreased to 1 h. The highest LaY was observed at the HRTs of 2 h and 1 h; these HRTs also exhibited the highest HPRs (1.94 and 8.83 L day−1 L−1, respectively) and HYs (0.05 and 0.13 molH2 mol−1 hexose, respectively). The low HY values observed in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 are associated with the high yields of HLa. Calli et al. [54] indicated that low values of HY occur because of the development of high H2 partial pressure, which results in the change in the fermentation pathway from acetate production to butyrate production and in the inhibition of hydrogen-producing bacteria by HLa-producing bacteria. Tunçay et al. [44] observed a maximum HY of 0.02 molH2 mol−1 hexose in a batch test (35 °C) using molasses as the organic substrate (30 and 50 g L−1). That HY is lower than the values obtained with EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 at an HRT of 1 h (0.09 molH2 mol−1 hexose and 0.13 molH2 mol−1 hexose, respectively). Tunçay et al. [44] observed that the main metabolites produced were HAc, HBu and HLa, similar to the metabolites produced in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15. Despite the disadvantages associated with the presence of HLa in terms of hydrogen production, the production of this acid concomitant with H2 production can be considered interesting because HLa is a high-value organic acid."
10,Conclusions,"The H2 production from sugarcane molasses was favored by the decrease in the HRT in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, resulting in OLRs greater than 180 kgsucrosem−3 day−1. In EGSB-5, the decrease in the HRT did not result in H2 production, because the H2 was probably consumed in the production of HAc via the homoacetogenesis reaction. In EGSB-10, H2 production was observed only at the HRT of 1 h (3.55 ± 0.86 L day−1 L−1). In EGSB-15, H2 production was observed at HRTs of 2 h (1.94 ± 1.6 L day−1 L−1) and 1 h (8.83 ± 2.83 L day−1 L−1). The maximum HPR (13.92 L day−1 L−1) was observed in EGSB-15 at an HRT of 1 h. The H2 production in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 was associated with increased HLa production, combined with the presence of HAc and HBu and low concentrations of HPr. The presence of HLa played a double role: HLa was associated with H2 production but also resulted in low HYs (maximum of 0.25 molH2 mol−1 hexose in EGSB-15)."
