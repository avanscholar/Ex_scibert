0,Introduction,"In most of the approaches being investigated for the production of biofuels, furfurals appear as important intermediates [1]. For example, furfural is directly obtained by the acid-catalyzed dehydration of xylose, the main building block of hemicellulose, one of the constituents of biomass. Furfurals are also present in bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass [2,3]. This brown viscous liquid contains many oxygenated compounds that impart unwanted properties to the oil, making it unsuitable as a transportation fuel [4–12]. Due to the high reactivity of these compounds, it is necessary to catalytically upgrade bio-oil in order to improve its storage stability, boiling point range, water solubility, and octane number. Mild hydrogenation is one of the potential routes for bio-oil stabilization, which eliminates the most reactive oxygenate groups, which in turn are the least desirable in fuel components [13,14]. The present contribution focuses on the study of furfural conversion as a model compound of biomass-derived feedstocks [15–25]. As opposed to Pd, on which decarbonylation is the dominant conversion path [26,27], Cu is highly selective for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, with methyl furan only appearing at temperatures >200°C [28]. The exact reaction pathway by which the carbonyl group in the aldehyde gets hydrogenated is not fully understood. For example, it has been proposed that the first step is the formation of a CH bond, yielding an alkoxide intermediate, which is then followed by the addition of the second H atom to this intermediate, forming an adsorbed alcohol [29]. Alternatively, it is also possible that the first step might involve the addition of H to the O atom, thus forming a hydroxylalkyl intermediate, which subsequently would yield the adsorbed alcohol [30,31]. In this work, we examine both mechanisms for the case of furfural on Cu surfaces, which has not been previously investigated. We have investigated the kinetics and reaction pathways of furfuraldehyde hydrogenation over a silica-supported Cu catalyst. These studies have been complemented with DFT calculations of adsorbed furfural on Cu(111) and Cu(110) planes, as well as DRIFTS analysis of adsorbed furfural species conducted on unsupported Cu metal powder, to avoid adsorption on the support that masks the signal from the metal. DFT calculations and DRIFTS have helped us identify the type of adsorbed species on the Cu surface and explore the reaction pathways involved in the conversion of furfural. Understanding the chemistry of the aldehyde functional group on Cu surfaces may have a broader impact on the study of other deoxygenation reactions involved in the refining of biomass-derived oils."
1,Methodology,
2,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization A 10wt.% Cu/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). A 1.5M Cu(NO3)2 (Fluka, 99.9%) aqueous solution was added to the silica support (SiO2, Hisil) at a liquid/solid ratio of 1cc/g. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried overnight at room temperature and then placed in an oven at 120°C for 12h. The oven-dried catalyst was finally calcined for 4h at 400°C following a linear heating ramp of 10°C/min, under the flow of pure air at 100ml/min. Several physical/chemical techniques were employed to characterize the Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Morphology and size of the Cu clusters present in the catalyst were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The BET surface area (Sg ) was measured by N2 physisorption in a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 unit. The reducibility of calcined sample was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). For these measurements, 50mg of calcined catalyst was placed in a quartz tube, heated at 10°C/min under 20ml/min of He up to 550°C, and held at the temperature for 1h. The sample was then cooled down to 30°C and exposed to a stream of 5% H2/Ar with the flow rate of 20ml/min. After that, it was heated to 600°C with a ramping rate of 10°C/min. The amount of hydrogen consumed as a function of temperature was monitored online by a TCD detector. The fraction of Cu reduced was estimated from the H2 consumption experiment, using a known amount of CuO for calibration."
3,Reaction kinetics,"2.2 Reaction kinetics The vapor-phase reaction of furfural over Cu/SiO2 was conducted in an isothermal tubular reactor, and the data were analyzed assuming an isothermal integral plug flow reactor (PFR). The pelletized catalyst (size range: 250–425μm) was placed at the center of a vertical tubular quartz reactor between two layers of glass beads and quartz wool. Calculations were done to ensure that external and internal mass transfer limitations were eliminated following the criteria proposed by Madon and Boudart [32]. The catalyst was pre-reduced in the flow of H2 (60ml/min, Airgas, 99.99%) for 1h at 350°C. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled down to the selected temperature (230–290°C) under the same H2 flow rate. A 0.5ml/h flow of liquid furfural (Aldrich, 99.5%) was fed continuously from a syringe pump (Cole Palmer) and vaporized into a gas stream of 60ml/min H2. The reaction products were analyzed online by a gas chromatograph (Agilent model 6890) using an HP-5 capillary column and a FID detector. The carbon balance was checked in every run, and it was found to be better than 95% in each case. Pure furfural, pure furfuryl alcohol, and an equimolar mixture of the two were used as feeds. To examine the effects of water on reaction rates, in some runs, the H2 gas was saturated with water at 40°C. A rate expression that includes the concentrations of furfuraldehyde, furfuryl alcohol, and 2-methyl furan, based on the conventional Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, was used to fit the experimental results. Nonlinear least-square regression analysis of the differences between the experimental values and the calculated values was used to simultaneously fit the data for several temperatures and several initial feed compositions. To ensure that the fitting resulted in the global minimum, we tried different initial guesses of the adjustable parameters to make sure that the program always converged to the same minimum with the same fitting parameters for the different initial guesses. This simultaneous fitting of different runs at different temperatures and over a wide range of concentrations using a single set of kinetics parameters illustrates the goodness of the rate expression. The validity of the fitting parameters was further tested by a set of additional reaction runs, in which mixture feeds with different proportions were used. The experimental yields obtained with these mixtures were compared with the values predicted from the model obtained from the initial set of runs."
4,Infrared absorption spectroscopy of furfural adsorbed on Cu metal,"2.3 Infrared absorption spectroscopy of furfural adsorbed on Cu metal Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformation (DRIFT) spectra of adsorbed furfural were recorded in a high temperature DRIFT cell (HVC, Harrick) with CaF2 windows. The Cu sample powder (100mg) was loaded in the sample cup of the cell, reduced in situ at 500°C for 1h under a flow of H2 (30ml/min), and then purged with He (30ml/min) for 30min. Finally, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, and the background spectrum was recorded. A He carrier gas (30ml/min) saturated at 0°C with furfural vapor was passed by the cell for approximately 30min. The sample was then purged under He flow at room temperature for another 30min. The DRIFT spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4cm−1 and accumulating 256 scans."
5,Density functional theory calculations,"2.4 Density functional theory calculations Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were made using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [33–37], in which the Kohn–Sham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms. The valence electrons were described by plane wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 300eV, and the core electrons were replaced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials [38,39] for improving the computational efficiency. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 4×4×1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh. The exchange–correlation functional was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [40]. The Methfessel–Paxon method was employed to determine electron occupancies with a smearing width of 0.2eV. Both Cu(111) and Cu(110) slab models were constructed based on a 5×5 unit cell. The Cu(111) slab model consists of three metal layers and seven equivalent vacuum layers (>16Å); the Cu(110) slab is also composed of three metal layers, with a ∼18Å vacuum gap in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The lattice constant of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu from our bulk calculation, 3.626Å, was in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.610Å [41]. The two uppermost layers of the slab were allowed to relax to their lowest energy configuration, while the atoms of the bottom layer were fixed to the bulk positions, keeping their optimized lattice constants. The slab model was relaxed until the forces were convergent to 0.01eV/Å. Surface adsorption takes place on the topmost layer of the slab. Three adsorption types for furfural molecules, named parallel-ring modes, perpendicular-ring modes, and single-site adsorption modes, were examined. All adsorbate atoms were allowed to relax to their optimized positions. The adsorption energy, Eads , is given by the following equation E ads = E slab / ads - E slab - E gas in which Eslab/ads is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates, Eslab is the energy of the slab, and Egas is the energy of the adsorbates in gas phase. For the hydrogenation reactions, the minimum energy paths, transition states (TS), and energy barriers were determined by the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [42,43]."
6,Results,
7,Cu/SiO2 catalyst characterization,"3.1 Cu/SiO2 catalyst characterization A typical TEM image of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the metallic copper clusters are well dispersed on the silica support, with an average particle size of ∼3nm. Estimated Cu dispersion (based on TEM Cu cluster size), Cu content, and BET total surface area of the catalyst are reported in Table 1 . As shown in the TPR profile of Fig. 2 , the maximum rate of H2 consumption was observed at about 350°C. Therefore, complete reduction of Cu can be expected after a pre-reduction treatment conducted in pure H2 at 350°C for 1h."
8,Furfural reaction over Cu/SiO2,"3.2 Furfural reaction over Cu/SiO2 No deactivation was observed in any of the catalytic activity runs during 4h of steady-state conversion. However, to compare the runs under identical conditions, a fresh catalyst was used in each separate experiment. In agreement with a previous report [44], the reaction of furfural (FAL) on Cu/SiO2 gives mainly furfuryl alcohol (FOL), with 2-methyl furan (MF) as a minor product, which is significant only above 230°C. As shown in Fig. 3 , 2-methyl furan is clearly a secondary product of the aldehyde (i.e. zero derivative at low W/F in Fig. 3a), but a primary product of the conversion of the alcohol (i.e., non-zero derivative at low W/F in Fig. 3b). Therefore, it is apparent that furfural is first converted into furfuryl alcohol, and the deoxygenation only occurs from the alcohol. As shown in Fig. 3a, at high W/F, the yield of furfuryl alcohol reaches a plateau as the aldehyde/alcohol equilibrium conversion is approached. Similarly, a plateau in furfural formation is reached at high W/F when the feed is pure furfuryl alcohol (Fig. 3b). However, no decarbonylation product was observed at any temperature of the range in this investigation. In summary, from this simple analysis, the reaction pathway can be described as follows:"
9,Kinetics of furfural deoxygenation,"3.3 Kinetics of furfural deoxygenation From the reaction pathway proposed above, a rate expression based on the conventional Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was derived, with the following assumptions [45,46]: (i) molecular adsorption of furfural (FAL), furfuryl alcohol (FOL), and 2-methyl furan (MF), (ii) dissociative adsorption of hydrogen, (iii) all adsorption sites are equivalent and independent of coverage, and (iv) surface reaction is the rate-determining step. Accordingly, the elementary steps for furfural conversion can be described by the following equations, in which * represents an active site. (1) FAL + * ↔ K FAL FAL * (2) H 2 + 2 * ↔ K H 2 2 H * (3) FAL * + 2 H * → k 1 FOL * (4) FOL * → k - 1 FAL * + 2 H * (5) FOL * ↔ 1 / K FOL FOL + * (6) FOL * + 2 H * → k 2 MF * + H 2 O (7) MF * ↔ 1 / K MF MF + * Since in excess of hydrogen, the partial pressure of hydrogen can be considered constant during the entire reaction period, the rate expressions become: (8) r FAL = - k 1 θ FAL + k - 1 θ FOL (9) r FOL = k 1 θ FAL - k - 1 θ FOL - k 2 θ FOL (10) r MF = k 2 θ FOL where θ FAL is the fractional coverage of furfural, θ FOL the fractional coverage of furfuryl alcohol, and θ MF the fractional coverage of 2-methyl furan. (11) θ FAL = K FAL P FAL θ V (12) θ FOL = K FOL P FOL θ V (13) θ MF = K MF P MF θ V (14) θ H = K H 2 1 / 2 P H 2 1 / 2 θ V Using the conventional LH kinetics derivation, the rate expressions become: (15) r FAL = - k 1 K FAL P FAL θ V + k 1 K K FOL P FOL θ V (16) r FOL = k 1 K FAL P FAL - k 1 K K FOL P FOL θ V + k 2 K FOL P FOL θ V (17) r 2 - MF = k 2 K FOL P FOL θ V (18) θ V = 1 1 + K FAL P FAL + K FOL P FOL + K MF P MF + K H 2 1 / 2 P H 2 1 / 2 The results of the fitting of the experimental concentrations of furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and 2-methyl furan as a function of space time (W/F) with the kinetic model derived from these equations are shown in Figs. 4–6 for the feeds of furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and an equimolar mixture of furfural and furfuryl alcohol, respectively. A very satisfactory agreement between the kinetic model and the experimental data was obtained over the entire range of W/F and temperatures. Only a slight discrepancy has been observed in the prediction of 2-methyl furan, which seems to be slightly higher than the experimental measurement. The equilibrium (Keq ) and kinetic (ki ) constants obtained from the fitting at three different temperatures are shown in Table 2 . As expected, since Keq represents the equilibrium constant for the exothermic furfural hydrogenation reaction, it decreases with temperature. The corresponding heat of reaction (ΔH), calculated by substituting the equilibrium constants in the Van’t Hoff equation, was 11.9kcal/mol. All the kinetic rate constants (ki ) increase with temperature and the Arrhenius plots (see Fig. 7 a) yield straight lines, from which true activation energies are readily obtained. The corresponding values were of 11.8kcal/mol and 12.4kcal/mol for the hydrogenation of furfural (E 1) and the hydrodeoxygenation of furfuryl alcohol (E 2), respectively. These values are also in line with those reported for the same reactions conducted over a copper chromite catalyst [47] and, as shown below, agree well with those predicted from DFT calculations. The equilibrium adsorption constants (Ki ) can be readily derived from the fittings. The Ki values shown in Table 2 decrease with increasing temperature, as expected. Accordingly, the ln Ki vs. 1/T plots (Fig. 7b) can be used to estimate the heat of adsorption for all the species involved, according to the Van’t Hoff equation. In line with previous reports [46], the values of K H 2 are relatively small in comparison with the other Ki on Cu catalyst. From these plots, the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on Cu/SiO2 was determined to be 13.9kcal/mol, which is in excellent agreement with those reported in the literature [45,46]. The heat of adsorption of furfural (12.3kcal/mol) is shown to be higher than that of furfuryl alcohol (6.9kcal/mol). In agreement with these estimates, Rioux and Vannice [46] reported that the heat of adsorption of carbonyl-containing molecules on copper (aldehyde/ketone) is significantly higher than that of molecules containing the COH group (alcohol). More interestingly, the kinetically derived heat of adsorption of 2-methyl furan (3.7kcal/mol) on Cu is dramatically lower than that of furfural and even close to a heat of physisorption. As discussed below, the DFT calculations clearly show that the strongest interaction of furfural with the Cu surface is via the carbonyl oxygen. However, the furan ring is not strongly bound to the surface, but rather it exerts a repulsion that increases with the surface density of Cu atoms. This behavior contrasts with that of other metals such as Pd or Pt, which can strongly bind the furan ring [27,48,49]. The validity of the kinetic model and fitting parameters was tested with additional reactions runs, in which mixtures of furfuraldehyde, furfuryl alcohol, and 2-methyl furan were fed in different proportions. Without changing any of the fitting parameters obtained in the original fitting, the experimental yields obtained with the mixtures were compared with the values predicted from the model. As shown in Fig. 8 , excellent agreement between the predicted values and the experimental data was obtained in each of the additional runs. The kinetic model and all the associated parameters were also valid for predicting the reaction of furfural in the presence of water (at a H2O/FAL ratio of 20mol/mol). To account for the effect of water coverage (θw ), a new term was included in the denominator of the kinetics model. By only fitting the new term in the kinetic model, Kw , but without modifying any of the other parameters obtained previously, the fitting was entirely in agreement with the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 9 . To test the robustness of the model, we allow the rest of the kinetic parameters vary simultaneously with the variation of the water terms. Regardless of the initial conditions chosen for the fitting, the results were the same (within 0.1%), with only the new water term parameter changing with respect to the case of the water-free runs. This result indicates that water competes with the other species for adsorption sites without changing the equilibrium parameters (i.e. Ki ’s) of the other species. That is, the original kinetic model and all the associated parameters were valid for predicting the reaction of FAL in the presence of water. The resulting equilibrium adsorption constant of water (KW ) varied from 0.249 to 0.067 as the temperature varied from 230 to 290°C. The linear plot of ln Kw vs. 1/T in Fig. 7b was used to obtain a heat of adsorption of 12.4kcal/mol for water on Cu/SiO2. As the heat of adsorption of water is relatively high, the competitive adsorption of water with furfuraldehyde molecule on the Cu surface can be expected to lower the conversion, as seen in Fig. 10 . However, in agreement with the rate expression, the effect of water was less pronounced at high temperature, despite the high concentration of water in the vapor phase. Vannice [50] has recommended a set of criteria to validate the thermodynamic parameters extracted from kinetic fittings. The ΔSads must be negative, and it must be in absolute value smaller than the standard entropy in the vapor phase. The calculated ΔSads values for all species, as derived from the fittings, are summarized in Table 2. The calculated entropy change for adsorption of each one of the species obtained from the intercept in the Van’t Hoff plot is negative and complies with the criteria 0<−ΔSads < Sg [50,51]. The ΔSads values for water (−14.2calmol−1 K−1) and for hydrogen (−32.9calmol−1 K−1) adsorption were lower than the value of the absolute gas-phase entropy [52]. The values for gas-phase entropy (Sg ) for FAL, FOL, and MF were not available for comparison, but reported values for similar compounds (e.g. isopropanol, acetone) range between 65 and 75calmol−1 K−1 [46], significantly higher than the −ΔSads values obtained from the fittings. It is interesting to compare the rather high ΔSads value of 32.4calmol−1 K−1 for hydrogen on Cu relative to that of hydrogen on Pd (28.9calmol−1 K−1) [53] and gas-phase Sg value of 34.1calmol−1 K−1 [52]. The conclusion would be that H atoms should be quite mobile on the Cu surface."
10,DRIFT spectra of furfural adsorbed on Cu,"3.4 DRIFT spectra of furfural adsorbed on Cu Barteau and co-workers have extensively investigated the nature of surface species during the adsorption of aldehydes on different metals [54–57]. They have shown that, depending on the type of metal surface and reaction conditions, aldehydes tend to form surface intermediates, in which either only the carbonyl O is adsorbed atop a metal atom, i.e. η 1(O), or both C and O interact with the surface, i.e. η 2(C,O). For example, they have shown that while the η 2(C,O) state is preferred on clean Pd surfaces, the η 1(O) state is preferred when oxygen is present [55,56]. In this work, we have conducted DRIFT spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of the most abundant surface aldehydes on Cu. On a high surface-area-supported catalyst, such as Cu/SiO2, furfuraldehyde mainly adsorbs on the surface of silica [58], as seen by the decrease in the intensity of the silanol group band (SiOH, 3740cm−1) [59] and the rising of a broad band at 3450cm−1 due to the interaction of silanol with furfural (Fig. 11 a). The silanol group band can be recovered by increasing the temperature to 400°C (Fig. 11b). Therefore, due to the strong interaction between furfural and silica, the adsorption of furfural on Cu cannot be clearly observed. Therefore, to eliminate the effect of the support, pure copper metal was used. Gas-phase furfural shows the CO stretching vibration mode at 1720cm−1 along with the CH stretching band of the aldehydic hydrogen at 2700cm−1 and 2800cm−1. As shown in Fig. 12 , the CO stretching band in the adsorbed furfural species appears at around 1670cm−1, downshifted from the wavenumber observed for gas-phase furfural. This lower frequency indicates a weakening of the CO bond as a result of the interaction with the surface [60,61], but only through an interaction with the carbonyl O, that is η 1(O). Formation of a bi-coordinated η 2(C,O) surface species would result in a much larger downshift, i.e., below wavenumbers of 1450cm−1 [62]."
11,DFT calculations,"3.5 DFT calculations 3.5.1 Adsorption of furfural on Cu(111) Calculating the adsorption of furfural on Cu(111) is complex because of its numerous plausible adsorption modes, and it could be even more complicated if intermolecular interactions of furfural molecules are taken into account. In order to neglect intermolecular interactions of adsorbed molecules on the Cu(111) surface, we choose a low-coverage surface (1/25 ML) by setting a relatively large unit cell (5×5). The furfural contains two O atoms, one in the carbonyl and one in the aromatic ring. According to our DFT calculations, the distance between these two atoms, which are the possible adsorption points in the furfural molecule, is 2.809Å (in the gas phase). This distance is comparable to the distance between the centers of two hollow sites or between one top and one hollow site (2.96Å) on the Cu(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 13 . Accordingly, we suppose that the oxygen atoms are located on top and/or hollow sites. Plausible adsorption configurations of furfural are thus constructed and can be classified into three types: (a) parallel-ring adsorption: the furfural molecule is roughly parallel to the surface; (b) carbonyl adsorption: the CO bond is involved in the interaction with the surface; and (c) perpendicular adsorption: the furfural molecule is approximately perpendicular to the Cu(111) surface. Fifteen initial geometries investigated by our DFT calculations were compared (see Table 3 ). Our calculations show that none of the parallel-ring configurations (structures 1–6 in Table 3) are stable on Cu(111). The adsorption energies range from 1.38 to 11.53kcal/mol. The carbonyl oxygen atom is ∼2.0–2.1Å from the metal surface, indicating a strong interaction between the O and Cu atoms. Nevertheless, these adsorption modes destabilize the aromatic furan ring structure. Compared to the geometry in the gas phase (Fig. 13), the bond lengths d4, d5, and d7 are elongated in the adsorption state, while d6 is slightly shortened (Table 3). In general, the weakened aromatic bonds raise the total energy of the absorbed molecule, leading to a positive (endothermic) adsorption energy. Moreover, the bond length of CO, d 1, is 0.03–0.07Å longer in the parallel mode, mainly due to the interaction between O and the surface. The perpendicular-ring mode (structures 9–15) shows stronger surface adsorption than the parallel-ring one. The values of Eads range from 3.92 to 2.77kcal/mol. Only two configurations, 12 and 15, possess negative adsorption energy. Two possible points for adsorption in the furfural molecule are the carbonyl oxygen atom and the ring oxygen atom. The optimized geometries show that the carbonyl O is closer to the Cu(111) surface compared to the ring O, suggesting that the interaction between the carbonyl O and the Cu(111) surface is the main contributor to the adsorption. In general, a short carbonyl O-surface distance results in strong surface adsorption. Since the 3d band of the surface Cu atoms partially overlaps the anti-bonding orbital of the aromatic ring, the ring OCu surface interaction may reduce the binding strength. This is confirmed by comparing the adsorption energy of two similar configurations (12 and 15): Configuration 15 has a stronger binding strength (Eads =− 3.92kcal/mol) but a much longer ring O-surface distance (3.08Å), corresponding to a weaker ring O-surface interaction. Moreover, the carbonyl O-surface distance in the perpendicular configurations is comparable to that in the parallel configurations. The stronger surface adsorption in the perpendicular-ring mode can be attributed to the approximately unchanged structure of the aromatic furan ring. Our calculations reveal that the initial carbonyl configurations, in which both the C and O atoms interact with the surface are not stable on Cu(111). It is observed that the carbonyl C atom moves away from the Cu(111) surface after energy optimization. Consequently, the binding strength solely depends on the carbonyl OCu interaction. This adsorption mode (structures 7 and 8 in Fig. 14 ) is determined as the most stable. For the top–top and top-bridge geometries, the calculated adsorption energies are −2.99 to −3.46kcal/mol, respectively. The top-bridge geometry, 8, is slightly more stable than the top–top geometry. 3.5.2 Adsorption on Cu(110) As shown in Fig. 13, the Cu(110) surface has higher rugosity and is not as close-packed than Cu(111). This configuration may lessen the repulsion of the furan ring when the carbonyl O approaches the surface. Consequently, more stable binding of furfuraldehyde molecules is expected on Cu(110) than on Cu(111), on which interaction with the aromatic ring was found unfavorable. Analogous to the adsorption on Cu(111), the adsorption configurations can also be roughly divided into parallel, carbonyl, and perpendicular modes. We select five typical geometries to examine their respective adsorption behavior on a low-coverage Cu(110) surface (1/25ML), including one parallel configuration, one carbonyl adsorption configuration, and three perpendicular configurations. The adsorption of furfural is stable for all five configurations. The calculated adsorption energy varies from −2.77kcal/mol to −7.38kcal/mol, which are stronger than those on the Cu(111) surface. The geometric parameters are summarized in Table 4 : a longer CO bond (d 1) and a shorter CC bond (d 2), primarily arising from the carbonyl O-surface interaction, are found in the adsorbed furfural molecule. In the parallel-ring configuration, the furan ring has the closest distance to the surface, corresponding to the weakest binding strength on Cu(110) (Eads =−2.77kcal/mol), in line with the repulsion effects seen in the case of Cu(111). The adsorption, however, is still stronger than the parallel-ring mode on Cu(111), because less Cu atoms are involved in the interaction with the aromatic ring on the (110) surface. The distortion of the ring structure is also observed and the general trend is similar to that on Cu(111), with elongated bond lengths, d 3, d 4, d 5, and d 7, and a shortened bond length d 6. Comparing with the carbonyl adsorption on Cu(110) and that on Cu(111), we notice significant difference between them: The carbonyl C atom shows a tendency to stay away from the Cu(111) surface, whereas it gets much closer to the Cu(110) surface. The CCu and OCu distances are 2.39 and 2.01Å, respectively. The discrepancy can be attributed to the different structures of Cu(111) and Cu(110). The furfural molecule is inclined to keep a planar structure owing to the conjugation effect. Cu(110), as a sparse surface, is able to bind the carbonyl C atom and to keep the planar structure as well (Fig. 15 ). The close-packed Cu(111) surface, however, cannot allow the carbonyl C adsorption and the planar furfural structure simultaneously. The calculated adsorption energy (−4.84kcal/mol) indicates a little stronger binding strength on Cu(110). Among the perpendicular configurations, 3 is found to be the most stable one (Eads =−7.38kcal/mol), because of the relatively long distance of the ring atoms and the surface (Fig. 15). In configurations 4 and 5 (not shown), the furan ring comes nearer to the (110) surface and the additional adsorption sites weaken the binding strength due to the same reason described in the previous section. 3.5.3 Hydrogenation of furfural on Cu(111) A mechanism for the hydrogenation of propanal and acetone has been proposed [29], in which hydrogenation of the carbonyl group first takes place on the C atom, leading to an alkoxide intermediate. In the following step, addition of a second hydrogen atom to the alkoxide intermediate yields an alcohol. An alternative mechanism is also possible [30,31], in which hydrogenation occurs in the first step at the carbonyl O atom with formation of a hydroxylalkyl intermediate, followed by addition of the second hydrogen atom to form furfuryl alcohol. In this work, first, we examine both mechanisms on Cu (111) and aim at comparing their similarity and differences using configuration 8 (Table 3). Dihydrogen dissociation yields adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the metal surface, and the most stable adsorption site is determined as fcc hollow according to our calculations. We therefore suppose the hydrogen atoms are located on the fcc site initially. The detailed geometries of the adsorbed furfural molecules, their transition states, and intermediates are given in Fig. 16 for mechanisms (a) and (b). In mechanism (a), a weak surface adsorption of furfural is observed: The distance between the surface and the carbonyl O is 2.50Å. The adsorbed H atom located below the furfural molecule moves toward the carbonyl C atom in the process. The energy barrier of this step is 10.84kcal/mol. The geometry of the transition state is similar to the alkoxide intermediate, suggesting an endothermic reaction. The bond length of CO increases from 1.25Å to 1.39Å, indicating that the bond is significantly weakened and partially converted to a single bond. The alkoxide species is strongly absorbed by the metal surface with a short CuO distance of 1.94Å, as the unpaired electron on the O atom forms a bond with the Cu(111) surface. Analogous to mechanism (a), the formation of the hydroxylalkyl intermediate is also an endothermic reaction in mechanism (b), with a reaction energy of 7.38kcal/mol. The surface species, however, moves apart from the Cu(111) surface during the process. This may be explained by the hydrogen addition to the carbonyl O atom reducing the surface-O interaction. Notably, the CC bond decreases from 1.44Å to 1.39Å in the hydroxylalkyl intermediate, whereas the bond length increases in the alkoxide intermediate. The CC bond in furfural is shorter than a normal CC single bond due to the delocalization of Π electrons. The conjugation effect ceases after the hydrogen atom in addition to the carbonyl C in the alkoxide species, leading to a longer CC bond. In the hydroxylalkyl species, the unpaired electron on the carbonyl carbon atom delocalizes to the aromatic ring and thus strengthens the CC bond."
12,Discussion,"The hydrogenation of furfural on Cu yields furfuryl alcohol at high selectivity. Our combined experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the molecularly adsorbed furfural interacts with the Cu surface via the lone pair of oxygen to produce η 1(O)-aldehyde species. This intermediate then becomes a precursor for the hydrogenation reaction. While the di-sigma complex η 2-(CO) aldehyde could also be a precursor for hydrogenation [64], our DRIFTS results suggest that furfural adsorbs via the carbonyl O atom. Similarly, our DFT calculations show that the carbonyl perpendicular mode (O on top) is preferred on both Cu(111) and (110). The calculated adsorption enthalpies are in reasonable agreement with the fitting values obtained from kinetics model. The interaction between C and Cu atoms surface is relatively weak. There is a tendency of the adsorbed aldehyde to shift the C atoms away from the surface, even when both the C and O atoms were placed close to the surface in the initial configuration. That is, the η 2(CO) aldehyde, commonly observed on other metals (e.g. Pd, Pt), is not preferred on the Cu surface. The DFT calculations also give evidence for a repulsion of the furan ring from the Cu(111) surface, presumably due to the overlap of the 3d band of the surface Cu atoms and the anti-bonding orbital of the aromatic furan ring. On the Cu(110), the furan ring comes closer to the surface because a lower density of Cu atoms is involved in the interaction with the aromatic ring. It is interesting to contrast the molecular interactions occurring on Cu with those on noble metals. For example, as opposed to Cu, Pd is known to adsorb the furan ring rather strongly due to a sp2-to-sp3 rehybridisation [48,49]. A similar comparison can be made with the interaction of a molecule such as crotonaldehyde, which contains a carbonyl and a CC bond. Analogous to the behavior shown here for furfural, it has been shown that on the Cu(111) surface, crotonaldehyde is bonded to the surface through the carbonyl O atom, with the CC bond remaining largely unaffected and away from the surface [63]. By contrast, on Pt(111), the adsorption includes both CO and CC groups, with formation of η 2(C,O) and di-σCC, respectively [64]. To analyze the hydrogenation reaction pathway on Cu, one can start with the η 1(O) species. Two possibilities for the first attack by a H atom to the carbonyl group have been considered in the present contribution. The corresponding surface intermediates adsorbed on the surface are shown below:  Based on the DFT calculations, a first H attack to the O atom of the carbonyl that results in the formation of a hydroxyalkyl species (mechanism b) would have a lower energy barrier than a first H attack to the C atom of the carbonyl, which would lead to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate (mechanism a). The difference in stability between the two intermediates can be ascribed to the stabilization role played by the aromatic furan ring. The addition of the first H atom to the O atom produces an unpaired electron on the C atom, which can be delocalized by the furan ring, which favors the formation of the hydroxylalkyl intermediate. A similar concept can be applied to explain the higher stability of the hydroxyalkyl intermediate compared to the alkoxide intermediate in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes on Pt(111) [29–31]. In that case, the conjugation with the CC bond would be expected to lower the energy barrier for the H attack at the O atom."
13,Conclusions,"The conversion of furfural on Cu/SiO2 yields mainly furfuryl alcohol from hydrogenation of the carbonyl, with only small amounts of 2-methylfuran, obtained from a subsequent cleavage of the CO bond in furfuryl alcohol. A kinetic model for furfuraldehyde conversion has been developed based on a Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. The results from the fitting show a good agreement with experimental data obtained independently and the model shows to be valid when different mixtures are used as a feed, including the addition of water. Water is found to suppress furfural conversion, particularly at low temperatures. The physical parameters obtained from the fitting (heat of adsorption and activation energies) are in line with values previously reported in the literature. The rate constant for the hydrogenation of furfuraldehyde (k 1) is significantly higher than that for hydrodeoxygenation of furfuryl alcohol (k 2) to produce 2-methyl furan. The heat of adsorption (ΔHads ) for furfural (12.3kcal/mol) is similar to that of adsorption of water (12.4kcal/mol), but higher than those for furfuryl alcohol (6.9kcal/mol) and 2-methyl furan (3.7kcal/mol). Moreover, the heat of adsorption of furfural is in agreement with the adsorption energy predicted by the DFT calculations using a Cu(110) surface (7.3kcal/mol). The DRIFTS and DFT results demonstrate that the adsorption of furfural takes place preferentially in a η 1(O)-aldehyde (perpendicular) binding mode. Two possible mechanisms for furfuraldehyde hydrogenation have been compared, based on the order of the first H atom attack to the carbonyl group, resulting in two possible surface intermediates adsorbed on the Cu surface. The activation energy barrier for the first H addition to the O carbonyl group to form adsorbed hydroxyalkyl intermediates was found to be lower than when the first addition of H is to the carbonyl C forming an alkoxide intermediate (i.e., 7.6kcal/mol compared to 10.8kcal/mol). These results suggest that the presence of the aromatic furan ring helps stabilizing the hydroxylalkyl intermediate, lowering the energy barrier for this path."
