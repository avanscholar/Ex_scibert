0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes or ketones is one of the most fundamental organic transformations and has received significant attention in laboratory and chemical industry because aldehydes and ketones are important intermediates or precursors for making pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, vitamins and fragrances [1,2]. Oxidizing reagents including dichromate and permanganate have traditionally been used for the oxidation of alcohols, but these stoichiometric oxidants are expensive and/or toxic, and even produce a large amount of heavy-metal wastes. In recent years, the photocatalytic technique provides a green and sustainable chemical process to achieve the selective oxidation of alcohols by using molecular oxygen (O2) as a “green” oxidant under the irradiation of solar light [3–7]. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is usually producedasa secondaryproductof the photocatalytic selective alcohol oxidation in the presence of O2 [8,9]. Much effort has been devoted to photocatalytic H2O2 production as an alternative to fossil fuels in the last few years [10–12]. From the economic viewpoint, the integration of photocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 with the selective oxidation of alcohols represents a more efficient solar energy conversion system that can achieve the simultaneous productions of solar fuel and value-added organic chemicals [13,14]. Nevertheless, most of the current researches only focus on photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols or H2O2 production [3–7,15–18]. The photocatalysts for synchronous productions of H2O2 and high value-added chemicals as well as their photocatalytic mechanism require more efforts to explore. Compared with various heterogeneous photocatalysts [19–26], bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) is an attractive candidate owing to its excellent intrinsic properties such as suitable band gap energy (2.5–2.8 eV), high chemical and thermal stability, unique electronic structure and non-toxicity [27–29]. Furthermore, as a typical aurivillius oxide, Bi2MoO6 possesses the perovskite-like layered structure composed of the interlaced (Bi2O2)2+ and (MoO4)2− layers, which enables the accessibility of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets and effectively improves the photocatalytic performance as a result of the increased surface area [30,31]. The Bi2MoO6 nanosheet-built hierarchical hollow microspheres are more desirable for the photocatalytic applications because their high specific surface area and special three-dimensional (3D) porous structures provide the fast molecular diffusion, high substrate adsorption and efficient charge transport [32–34]. Moreover, the increased spatial dispersibility of Bi2MoO6 nanosheet-built hierarchical hollow microspheres makes the photocatalyst easy to disperse and recycle in the reaction system. More recently, several examples have demonstrated that the Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres exhibited superior performance in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants [35,36]. However, the application of the Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres in the selective oxidation of alcohol coupled with H2O2 production as well as the influence of their surface defects on photocatalytic performance has rarely been reported. The adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen on photocatalysts is crucial for the selective oxidation of alcohol coupled with H2O2 production with O2 as a green raw material [7,37]. However, the poor interaction of O2 with the defect-free surface of Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts restricts the photocatalytic efficiency. Many pioneering studies have testified that the surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) engineering of metal oxide semiconductors is a powerful strategy to promote O2 activation in photocatalytic reactions [38,39]. The introduction of surface OVs can not only endow the photocatalysts with broader visible light absorption and more efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, but also provide abundant absorption sites of O2 for efficient molecular oxygen activation [40–42]. For example, the OV-rich Bi2MoO6 exhibited the greatly enhanced efficiency for photoconversion of CO2 to CH4 with high selectivity under visible-light, compared with the OV-poor Bi2MoO6 sample [43]. Therefore, it is expected that the simultaneous manipulation on morphology and surface OVs of Bi2MoO6 nanostructures can further enhance the photocatalytic performance for photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohol coupled with H2O2 production. Based on the above considerations, herein, the hierarchical Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres assembled by nanosheets are synthesized by a facile solvothermal process. Surface OVs of the hierarchical Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres are subsequently modulated by thermal reduction in H2/Ar mixed gas at 200 °C for a controlled time (x hour), to obtain a series of Bi2MoO6-H2-x (denoted as BMO-H2-x) photocatalysts. Benefiting from the hierarchical hollow structure and abundant surface OVs, the BMO-H2-x photocatalysts show enhanced activity toward photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2O2 production. The effect of OV content on the photocatalytic efficiency is studied systematically by comparing the performance of various Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts. The benzaldehyde and H2O2 production rates over the OV-rich Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst are 2.3 and 4.0 times those generated from the OV-poor Bi2MoO6 one. The photocatalytic mechanism and possible reaction pathway of the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2O2 production are discussed according to the characterizations and in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) tests."

3,Synthesis of Bi2MoO6 (BMO) hierarchical hollow microspheres,"2.2 Synthesis of Bi2MoO6 (BMO) hierarchical hollow microspheres The hierarchical Bi2MoO6 (BMO) hollow microspheres are synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Typically, 0.100 g C18H33NaO2 is dissolved in 30 mL ethylene glycol by magnetic stirring. Then, 0.485 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.121 g Na2MoO4·2H2O are successively dissolved into the solution by stirring to form the precursor solution. The precursor solution is then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, which is sealed and kept at 140 ℃ for 24 h. After the solvothermal reaction, the precipitate is collected by centrifugation, washed by deionized water and ethanol in sequence, and finally dried at 60 ℃ to obtain the BMO hollow microspheres."
4,Modulating the surface OVs of Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres,"2.3 Modulating the surface OVs of Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres The surface OVs of BMO hierarchical hollow microspheres are enriched by thermal reduction in a mixed H2/Ar (5 vol% H2 and 95 vol% Ar) atmosphere at 200 °C, with a heating rate of 5 ℃ min−1, for a controlled time. The as-synthesized BMO hollow microspheres are exposed to the thermal reduction process for different times (0.5, 1 and 2 h), and the corresponding products are labeled as BMO-H2-0.5, BMO-H2-1 and BMO-H2-2, respectively. In contrast, the surface OVs of BMO hierarchical hollow microspheres are reduced by thermal treatment of the as-synthesized BMO hollow microspheres in air at 350 °C for a controlled time, with a heating rate of 5 ℃ min−1. The products obtained by the thermal treatment for different times (0.5, 1 and 2 h) are labeled as BMO-air-0.5, BMO-air-1 and BMO-air-2, respectively."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are acquired on a DX-2700 XRD analyzer with Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are obtained by a ZEISS Ultra-55 SEM working at 3.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images are taken on a JEL-2100 TEM working at 200 kV. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution are determined at 77 K on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M after the samples are degassed at 150 °C in vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) are taken on a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) are recorded on UV-2600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Electron spin resonance (ESR) tests are performed on a JES-FA200 spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are taken on Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer (HORIBA)."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical properties of photocatalysts are measured on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system having Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode is prepared by spin-coating the photocatalyst-ethanol slurry on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and drying at 60 ℃. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M) is used as the electrolyte. The simulated sunlight is provided by Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.). The transient photocurrent is measured under the Xe lamp irradiation at a bias potential of 0.4 V, and the Mott-Schottky plots are recorded at the frequency of 1000 Hz with the potential from −1.0 V to 1.0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are recorded in the frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV at a bias potential of 0 V."
7,Photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2O2 production,"2.6 Photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2O2 production The photocatalytic reactions are carried out in a transparent quartz test tube filled with ambient air. The Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight) equipped with a reflector can afford the simulated sunlight with the main wavelength range of 320–800 nm, as shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). For a typical reaction, 0.05 mmol benzyl alcohol and 5 mg catalyst are dispersed in 2 mL acetonitrile to form a reaction suspension. After the reaction suspension is stirred in dark for 30 min, the test tube is sealed by parafilm and exposed to the simulated sunlight with an optical power density of 200 mW cm−2 provided by the Xe lamp. As the reaction proceeds for a certain time, the reaction solution is collected, centrifuged, and filtered through a syringe filter to remove the photocatalyst particles. The filtrates are quantificationally analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (LC-2030 Plus, SHIMADZU). The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for producing benzaldehyde are calculated according to the following equations, where C0, C alcohol and C aldehyde are the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol, detected concentrations of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, respectively. (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = C 0 - C alcohol / C 0 × 100 (2) S e l e c t i v i t y % = C aldehyde / C 0 - C alcohol × 100 The amount of H2O2 generated in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol is determined by iodometry [44]. After the reaction for a certain time, the reaction solution is collected, centrifuged, and filtered through a polymer filter membrane. Then, 1 mL of potassium hydrogen phthalate (C8H5KO4, 0.1 mol L−1) aqueous solution and 1 mL of potassium iodide (KI, 0.4 mol L−1) aqueous solution are added into 1 mL of the filtrate, where H2O2 can react with iodide anions (I−) under acidic condition (H2O2 + 3I− + 2H+ → I3 − + 2H2O) to produce triiodide anions (I3 −). The amount of I3 − is determined by UV–visible spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-2600) according to its characteristic absorption at 350 nm. As a result, the amount of H2O2 produced during each photocatalytic reaction is calculated. In addition, the recyclability of the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst is examined by performing five cyclic photocatalytic reactions with 5 h for each cycle. After each cycle, the photocatalyst is separated from the solution by centrifugation, washed with ethanol for several times and then dried in a vacuum at 60 ℃ for the next cycle."
8,Detection of the photocatalytic reactive species,"2.7 Detection of the photocatalytic reactive species The reactive species generated in the photocatalytic system are determined by a series of controlled experiments with adding different radical scavengers. Potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4), isopropanol (IPA) and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) are used as scavengers for photogenerated electrons (e-), holes (h+), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and superoxide radical (• O 2 - ), respectively. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is used as a scavenger for both carbon-centered radical and reactive oxygen species. Additionally, • O 2 - and carbon-centered radicals have been detected by in situ ESR spectroscopy, using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to trap the spin-reactive species."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Chemical compositions and structures,"3.1 Chemical compositions and structures The crystalline phases of BMO, BMO-H2-2 and BMO-air-2 samples are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns (Fig. 1 ) of the three samples match well with that of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS No. 76-2388). Moreover, it is noticed that the diffraction peak of (131) crystalline plane is weakened and widened after the thermal reduction in H2/Ar atmosphere, suggesting the decreased crystallinity of BMO-H2-2, which can be ascribed to the introduction of more defects on Bi2MoO6 [45]. In contrast, the (131) diffraction peak of BMO-air-2 is more sharp than that of BMO, suggesting the increased crystallization of Bi2MoO6 after thermal treatment in air. According to SEM observation, the BMO product (Fig. 2 a) is composed of hierarchical hollow microspheres with diameters in the range of 0.5–1.0 μm and these hollow microspheres are built by numerous thin nanoflakes. After both the thermal treatments in air and H2/Ar mixed gas, the as-obtained BMO-air-2 (Fig. 2b) and BMO-H2-2 (Fig. 2c) inherit well the morphology of the nanoflake-built hierarchical hollow microspheres. The microstructures of BMO-H2-2 are further analyzed by TEM and HRTEM characterizations (Fig. 2d-f). The nanoflakes in hollow microspheres have sizes of 10–20 nm. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 2f), the nanoflakes are well crystalline and the distinct lattice spacing is measured as 0.315 nm which belongs to the (131) crystalline plane of orthogonal Bi2MoO6. The specific surface areas and porous features of BMO, BMO-H2-2 and BMO-air-2 are further determined by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. The three photocatalysts exhibit type IV adsorption–desorption isotherms with obvious hysteresis loops (Fig. 3 a), suggesting their mesoporous characteristics. The mesopores in these hollow microspheres should be originated from the compact assembly of nanoflakes. Compared with those of BMO and BMO-H2-2, BMO-air-2 shows the lower specific surface area and larger average pore size (Table S1, Supporting Information), probably because of the diminished surface defects and increased crystal sizes of BMO-air-2 caused by the thermal treatment in air. In comparison, the specific surface area and pore size of the photocatalyst after thermal reduction in H2/Ar mixed gas remain less changed. The surface elements and chemical states of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are further identified by XPS analysis (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). The survey spectra of three samples confirm the existence of Bi, Mo and O elements (Fig. S2 and Table S2, Supporting Information). In Fig. 4a, Bi 4f spectrum of BMO contains two peaks centered at 159.5 and 164.8 eV, respectively, corresponding to the binding energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of Bi3+ ions [46]. By comparison, the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks of BMO-air-2 are shifted by 0.1 eV towards the high binding energy while those of BMO-H2-2 are shifted by 0.2 eV towards the lower binding energy, which can be attributed to the variations in surface OV contents of the photocatalysts [47]. The Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks located at 232.8 and 235.8 eV indicate the presence of Mo6+ in BMO (Fig. 4b). In particular, the O 1 s spectra (Fig. 4c) of the samples can be fitted with three peaks located at around 530.4, 531.7 and 533.3 eV, respectively, corresponding to the oxygen atoms at three chemical environments of lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups [48,49]. From the proportion of the peak at around 531.7 eV in O 1s spectra, the surface OV contents of BMO-H2-2, BMO and BMO-air-2 are estimated to be 24.3%, 21.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The peaks of Mo 3d and O 1s spectra for BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 present the similar shifts to those of the Bi 4f spectra as compared with BMO. In addition, the Raman spectra (Fig. 4d) of both BMO and BMO-H2-2 samples exhibits the typical stretching and bending vibrations modes of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 [29,38,48]. The Raman peaks of BMO-H2-2 sample become weakened and broadened, compared to those of the BMO sample, suggesting that BMO-H2-2 contains more defects in its crystalline structure. Notably, the peaks at 147 and 185 cm−1 of BMO corresponding to the bending vibrations of BiO3 tetrahedra shift to 151 and 194 cm−1 in BMO-H2-2 (inset of Fig. 4d), which should be ascribed to the partial oxygen loss in Bi-O bonds [43]. The differences in Raman spectrum of BMO-H2-2 from that of BMO further confirm the existence of more OVs in the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst."
11,Photoabsorption and photogenerated charge behaviors,"3.2 Photoabsorption and photogenerated charge behaviors Surface OVs of metal oxide semiconductors have a notable influence on their photoabsorption properties [50,51]. The OVs existing in the different photocatalysts of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are semi-quantitatively determined by ESR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the ESR spectrum of BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst shows a more remarkable signal of OVs at g-value of 2.001 [43], compared with those of BMO and BMO-air-2. The results affirm that the thermal reduction in H2/Ar mixed gas has obviously increased the OV content of BMO while the calcination in air leads to a decrease in the OV content. Therefore, the surface OVs of BMO photocatalyst can be modulated by changing the atmosphere and time of thermal treatment. The photoabsorption properties of the photocatalysts are characterized by UV–vis DRS spectra (Fig. 5b). Compared with the pristine BMO, the photoabsorption of BMO-air-2 in visible light region is weakened and the absorption edge presents a blue-shift, whereas the photoabsorption of BMO-H2-2 in visible light region is enhanced because the OV energy level located under the conduction band edge can narrow the bandgap of Bi2MoO6 [51,52]. Additionally, the optical band gaps of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are estimated to be 2.28, 2.33 and 2.14 eV, respectively, by the curves of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν), as shown in Fig. 5c. The results confirm that the increase of OV content reduces the band gaps of photocatalysts and endow them with enhanced visible light absorption. Furthermore, PL emission spectra of the three photocatalysts are measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the interfacial charge separation. Under an excitation of 340 nm, all the Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts display a broad emission band in the region of 400–550 nm (Fig. 5d). In comparison, the PL intensity of BMO-air-2 photocatalyst is enhanced whereas that of BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst is a little quenched. The lower PL intensity reflects that the photogenerated electron-hole recombination in the photocatalyst is suppressed [53]. The results indicate that the introduction of surface OVs facilitates the separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Subsequently, the photoelectrochemical tests are utilized to further determine the photoinduced charge transfer and separation efficiencies as well as the band structures of the photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 a, BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst shows the higher photocurrent intensity than those of BMO and BMO-air-2, which is consistent with the quenching behaviors of their PL emissions. Additionally, the arc radius of EIS Nyquist plot reflects the charge transfer resistance of the electrode material [54]. Among the three typical photocatalysts, BMO-H2-2 photoelectrode exhibits the smallest arc radius of EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 6b), meaning that the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst has the highest electron transportation ability. These results demonstrate consistently that the introduction of OVs on the surface of Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres can promote the separation and transfer of photo-induced electrons and holes. Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky (M−S) plots are measured to determine the energy band potentials of the photocatalysts [55,56]. As shown in Fig. 6c, all the M−S plots of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 exhibit positive slopes, indicating that they are n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials (Efb) of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are determined as −0.73, −0.78 and −0.57 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, from the tangent intercepts of the M−S plots on x-axis. Accordingly, their flat band potentials relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (Efb(vs. NHE, pH = 0)) are calculated to be −0.53, −0.58 and −0.37 V, respectively. Since the conduction band minimum (CBM) of n-type semiconductors are more negative by about 0.1 V than their flat band potentials [57], the CBM values of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are determined to be −0.63, −0.68 and −0.47 V (vs. NHE), respectively. It indicates that all the photo-generated electrons of the three photocatalysts are thermodynamically capable of reducing O2 into • O 2 - (-0.33 V vs. NHE) [29]. The valence band maxima (VBM) values of BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 are calculated to be 1.65, 1.65 and 1.67 V, respectively, according to their optical band gaps (EVBM = Eg + ECBM), as shown in Fig. 6d."
12,Photocatalytic performance toward selective alcohol oxidation with H2O2 production,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance toward selective alcohol oxidation with H2O2 production To evaluate the photocatalysis of Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres with different OV contents, the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol is carried out in air atmosphere followed with detecting the generation rate of benzaldehyde and H2O2, as shown in Fig. 7 a and b. The H2O2 productions from the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol are determined by the iodometric method (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). The selectivities of all photocatalysts for benzaldehyde production are higher than 90% (Table S3, Supporting Information). The production rates of benzaldehyde and H2O2 over the pristine BMO are 1072 and 47.6 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres declines gradually along with prolonging the thermal treatment in air atmosphere (Fig. 7a). Specifically, the production rates of benzaldehyde and H2O2 over BMO-air-2 photocatalyst are 568 and 16.8 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. In contrast, the thermal reduction in H2/Ar mixed gas elevates the photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 production. For the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst, the benzaldehyde and H2O2 generation rates reach up to 1310 and 67.2 μmol g−1 h−1, which are 2.3 and 4.0 times those from BMO-air-2 photocatalyst, respectively. Fig. 7c and d show the evolutions of benzyl-alcohol conversion (%) and H2O2 production along with the reaction time (h) over the three typical photocatalysts (Table S4, Supporting Information). Obviously, the OV-rich Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres (BMO-H2-2) exhibit the superior photocatalytic activity for selective alcohol oxidation with H2O2 production. The production rates of benzaldehyde and H2O2 are greatly promoted by the increased surface OVs. In comparison with the photocatalysts reported previously (Table S5, Supporting Information), the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst developed in this work exhibits a favorable performance for the simultaneous productions of benzaldehyde and H2O2. Subsequently, the universal application of BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst is demonstrated in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of various alcohols, to further verify the excellent performance of OV-rich Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 8 a and Table S6 (Supporting Information), the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity toward the selective oxidation of alcohols for a broad scope of substrates. The aromatic alcohols containing electron-donating groups (–CH3, –OCH3) exhibit higher reactivities than those containing electron-withdrawing groups (-Cl, -F), probably due to that the electron-donating groups can elevate the electron density of –CH2OH group and thus accelerate the activation of –CH2OH by photo-generated holes to generate the carbon-centered radical [58]. The BMO-H2-2 catalyst also exhibits obvious photocatalysis for the selective oxidation of alkyl alcohols to corresponding aldehydes although it is more challenging than the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols [59]. Furthermore, the recyclability of BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst is examined by conducting five cyclic photocatalytic reactions with 5 h for each cycle, where the separation of photocatalyst from reaction solution would cause a little mass loss of the photocatalyst. The BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst retains about 85% of its original activity after five cycles (Fig. 8b-c; Table S7, Supporting Information). Both XRD (Fig. 8d) and Raman (Fig. 8e) characterizations indicate that the crystalline structure of the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst after cyclic photocatalytic reaction remain almost the same as that of the fresh one. Moreover, the XPS analysis (Fig. S4, Supporting Information) demonstrates that the used BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst has a very proximate content (23.9%) of oxygen vacancies to that (24.3%) of the fresh one. These results confirm the good durability of the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst."
13,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism To understand the photocatalytic mechanism, a series of controlled experiments with BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst are conducted under different atmospheres or by adding various radical scavengers. As shown in Fig. 9 a and Table S8 (Supporting Information), the photocatalytic reaction conducted in pure O2 atmosphere presents the higher production rate of benzaldehyde than those in N2 atmosphere and even in air, which means that the presence of O2 is beneficial to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Subsequently, the contributions of the active species are identified by a series of controlled experiments with adding the corresponding scavengers. The addition of K2S2O8 (electron scavenger) [60] or (NH4)2C2O4 (hole scavenger) [61] into the reaction system results in a significant declination of benzaldehyde production, indicating that both electrons and holes play crucial roles in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. When benzoquinone (BQ) is used to scavenge superoxide radical (• O 2 - ) in the reaction solution [35], the benzaldehyde production is also greatly suppressed, suggesting that • O 2 - makes a dominating contribution to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Whereas, the addition of isopropanol (IPA) for scavenging ∙OH radical [35] leads to only a little decrease in the production of benzaldehyde, meaning that ∙OH radical has negligible effect on the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the present case. As butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is used as a scavenger to eliminate both carbon-centered radical [62] and reactive oxygen species [63], the benzaldehyde production rate declines significantly, proving that the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol undergoes a radical-initiated pathway. The above results indicate that h+, • O 2 - , and carbon-centered radicals play key roles in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst. Furthermore, the in-situ ESR technique is used to identify the active radicals generated in the photocatalytic reaction systems with BMO, BMO-air-2 and BMO-H2-2 photocatalysts, respectively, with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) a radical-trapping regent. Under the irradiation, two sets of ESR signals are detected from the photocatalytic reactions of the three photocatalysts (Fig. 9b). The quartet peaks (☆) are corresponding to DMPO−•O2− and the sextet peaks (♢) can be assigned to DMPO − carbon-centered radicals [64,65]. In comparison, the ESR signals from the photocatalytic reaction with BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst are much stronger than those from the reaction systems with BMO and BMO-air-2, confirming that the BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst has a higher ability to generate the active radicals in the photocatalytic reaction. Additionally, the controlled photocatalytic experiment with adding excessive H2O2 (0.25 mol L−1) in the reaction solution is carried out to reveal the influence of H2O2 on both production rate and selectivity of benzaldehyde. The results (Table S9, Supporting Information) confirm that the existence of H2O2 has little effect on either the production rate of benzaldehyde or the product selectivity. The H2O2 could not oxidize benzaldehyde in the present reaction system possibly because H2O2 has a low reactivity in acetonitrile (CH3CN) solvent [66]. Based on the above experimental results, the photocatalytic mechanism of BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst and the reaction pathway for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 production are shown in Fig. 10 . Under the simulated sunlight irradiation, the OV-rich BMO-H2-2 photocatalyst is excited to generate electrons (e-) and holes (h+). The photogenerated electrons are readily trapped by the OV energy level (Fig. 10a), which enhances the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. For the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 10b), the chemisorbed O2 on OVs acquires an electron to produce • O 2 - radical. Meanwhile the adsorbed benzyl alcohol molecule is activated by a hole to generate the active intermediate of carbon-centered radical, along with the release of a proton. The • O 2 - radical combines with a proton to form •OOH radical. Finally, the •OOH radical acquire a proton from the carbon-centered radical to produce H2O2 and benzaldehyde. The presence of OVs on the surface of Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres can promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes as well as provides more active sites for the adsorption and activation of O2 molecules, therefore greatly boosting the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2O2 production."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, the Bi2MoO6 hierarchical hollow microspheres assembled by nanosheets are synthesized by a facile solvothermal process, and their surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) are enriched by the thermal reduction in H2/Ar mixed gas for a prolonged time. The different Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres are employed as photocatalysts for the light-driven selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol accompanied by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, which represents a more efficient solar energy conversion system due to the simultaneous productions of solar fuel and value-added organic chemicals. The increase of surface OVs on Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres facilitates the generation and separation of charge carriers as well as enhances the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules. Therefore, the benzaldehyde and H2O2 production rates over the OV-rich Bi2MoO6 hollow microsphere photocatalyst reach up 2.3 and 4.0 times those from the OV-poor one. The OV-rich Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst also exhibits good universality in the selective oxidation of various alcohols and the favorable stability in the long time photocatalytic reaction. This work not only demonstrates an effective approach for improving the photocatalytic performance by morphology design and surface modulation of materials but also highlights a more efficient strategy of solar to chemical energy conversion by synchronous productions of solar fuels and high value-added chemicals. The optimized photocatalyst and the photocatalytic reaction with a high atom economy have a great potential in the future solar-driven green synthesis."
