0,Introduction,"Electro-catalytic water splitting through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient and environmentally friendly method for hydrogen production [1]. Iron group metal phosphide based catalysts have been confirmed theoretically and experimentally, to be very effective in electro-catalytic HER [2–11]. They have great potential for substituting Pt for H2 generation in an alkaline water solution, owing to their low cost, high catalytic activity, acceptable electric conductivity, and excellent chemical stability [12,13]. Nevertheless, the iron group metal based catalysts generally used suffered from following shortcomings [14–17]: (1) catalytic activity of the electrodes was decayed by the introduction of polymer binder such as Nafion which hindered the electron transport between catalysts and current collector [18], and exfoliation of the electrocatalysts generally occurred at high current density [19,20]; and (2) the commonly used glassy carbon electrode, was not a valid working electrode in practical use due to its limited surface area. To further improve the catalytic performance and feasibility of electrodes for HER under large current density, self-supporting three-dimension (3D) porous phosphide catalysts, especially those loaded on a Ni foam (NF) template were developed [21–28]. The 3D framework with good mechanical strength, excellent electro-conductibility and porous morphology offers large surface areas and high-speed multidimensional electron transport pathways, resulting in a reduced overpotential caused by resistances of ion, gas diffusion and charges transfer [29–31]. All these features make metal foams more suitable than their bulk counterparts to load catalytic active materials. However, almost all of the relevant studies published previously used commercial Ni foam (PNF) with low porosity and large pore size ranging from 450 to 3200 μm, so the performances of the final electrodes were generally not satisfactory [32]. It is commonly accepted that decreasing pore size and increasing porosity of the foam could lead to increase in the specific surface area and thus significantly enhanced catalytic performance of the final electrodes [33]. Therefore, in the present paper, we report a novel strategy to fabricate Co foam with 90% porosity and pore size less than 100 μm, on which hierarchical NiCoP/NiOOH nanoflowers can be formed and used as electrocatalysts towards HER. First, Co foams of ultrahigh porosity were constructed by freeze-drying. Then hierarchical Ni–Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflowers were grown on the Co foams via hydrothermal treatment (See the experimental section for details, Fig. S1). Finally, the as-prepared LDH nanoflowers were subjected to phosphorization treatment to form hierarchical NiCoP/NiOOH nanoflowers. The self-supporting NiCoP/NiOOH nanoflowers on ultrahigh porosity Co foam exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance for HER and even achieved a relatively stable electrode structure at high current density, which would be significant for future industrial application."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Raw materials used directly without further purification were chitosan (high viscosity, > 400 m Pa s) from Aladdin, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, nickel nitrate hexahydrate and acetic acid from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, cobalt powder (5000 mesh, ~3.3 μm) from Jinjia metal materials Co., Ltd, and hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) from Alfa Aesar. The water used was purified through a Millipore system."
3,Synthesis of Co foam,"2.2 Synthesis of Co foam Chitosan (3 g) was dispersed in 80 mL deionized water under 10 min stirring and acetic acid (6 g) was injected into the formed suspension to form a uniform gel. Then, Co powder (8 g) was added, followed by further 5 min homogenization under high-speed mechanical stirring using a manual mechanical stirrer of 300 r min−1. The slurry was immediately poured into an ice cube container (3 × 3 × 2.4 cm3) and cooled down to −4 °C in a refrigerator. The frozen solid slurry was then treated via freezing drying for 60 h at −42 °C. Subsequently, the Co foam was prepared by a well-designed step by step annealing process (Fig. S1). Specifically, the temperature was first raised to 350 °C and kept for 2 h in an argon atmosphere followed by annealing in air at 500 °C for 2 h. Finally, Ar/H2 (5% H2) was introduced and the temperature was kept at 1000 °C for 2 h to reduce the partially oxidized Co and sinter the foam. All the heating processes were carried out at a heating speed of 5 °C min−1. The prepared Co foam was cut into 5 × 5 × 1 mm3 slices using a sharp blade and polished using abrasive papers for later use."
4,Synthesis of Co foam loaded with NiCoP/Ni–Co hydroxide (NiCoP/CF),"2.3 Synthesis of Co foam loaded with NiCoP/Ni–Co hydroxide (NiCoP/CF) Ni–Co LDH on Co foam was synthesized by a conventional hydrothermal method. Typically, 3 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 3 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were added into a combined solution of 50 mL water and 30 mL methyl alcohol under magnetic stirring for 10 min. The mixed solution and three Co foam slices were transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 8 h (the foam slices lay flat on the bottom). After the autoclave had been cooled down to room temperature, the treated slices were taken out and washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, before being vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The slices were annealed with 0.5 g NaH2PO2 for 2 h at 320–380 °C for 2 h (the heating speed was 5 °C min−1) under flowing Ar gas, and finally rinsed several times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The samples treated at 320 °C, 350 °C and 380 °C were denoted as NiCoP/CF-320, NiCoP/CF-350 and NiCoP/CF-380, respectively. For comparison, the commercial Ni foam was also treated by the identical process at 350 °C and loaded with NiCoP/Ni–Co LDH/PNF (denoted as NiCoP/PNF-350). It needs to be noted that the commercial Ni foam was initially immersed in 3 M HCl and ultrasonically cleaned for 10 min. In addition, a Co foam slice of 5 × 5 × 1 mm3 was directly annealed with NaH2PO2 at 350 °C for 2 h (with a heating speed of 5 °C min−1) under flowing Ar to prepare Co foam supported cobalt phosphide (denoted as CoP/CF-350)."
5,Materials characterization,2.4 Materials characterization Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a MiniFlex 600 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were taken on a JEOL JSM-6700F SEM. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was performed on an AutoPore IV9510. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a JEM-2100. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an AMICUS ESCA 3400 XPS with Al Kα radiation. All XPS spectra were calibrated by shifting the detected adventitious carbon C 1s peak to 284.8 eV.
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The as-synthesized NiCoP/CF was tightly adhered to the surface of a silver foil by a magnet on the back and was directly used for electrocatalytic HER. The HER measurements were performed on a chemistry workstation (CHI 660E) at room temperature using a standard three-electrode cell, where a Hg/HgO electrode (1 M KOH) and a graphite rod served as the reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. 1 M KOH (pH = 13.6, average value of three measurements by using a pH meter) was used as the electrolyte. The working electrode was electrochemically pre-activated by 20 cyclic voltammetric scans at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For HER measurements, linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were measured from 0 to −0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a scan rate of 3 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at open potential over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The potentials were presented according to the equation: (1) E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.14 V + 0.0592 pH − iR where R is the solution resistance from EIS results."
7,DFT calculation,"2.6 DFT calculation All periodic density functional theory calculations with spin polarization were carried out using density functional theory with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional as implemented in the VASP code. The interactions between core electrons and ions are described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, and the valence electronic states are represented with a plane-wave basis set with the energy cutoff of 400 eV. The structures of transition states are obtained by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method, where six images between reactant and product are inserted to achieve a smooth energy curve with the force tolerance of 0.05 eV Å−1. The mainly exposed (001) surface of Co2P is modeled by a 5-layer p (1 × 1) unit cell of 5.705 Å × 5.705 Å, and the (0001) surface of NiCoP/NiOOH is modeled by a 2-layer p (1 × 1) of NiCoP (001) plus two molecular layer of NiOOH (0001). During the geometry optimization, the bottom two layers are fixed while the atomic positions of other layers and adsorbates are relaxed until all the remaining forces on these atoms are less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone integration is performed using a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 5 × 5 × 1 special k-points. The hydrogen chemisorption energy is defined as: (2) Δ E H = 1 n ( E ( s u r f + n H ) − E ( s u r f ) − n 2 E ( H 2 ) ) where n is the number of H atoms in the calculations, E(surf+nH), E(surf), and E(H 2 ) are respectively the total energies of the adsorption of n H atoms, clean surfaces and gaseous hydrogen molecule. The hydrogen absorption free energies are calculated as: (3) Δ G H ∗ = Δ E H + Δ Z P E − T Δ S where ΔE is the difference between the energy of the adsorption state and pure surface, E H 2 the energy of H2 in gas phase, ΔZPE the zero-point energy change and ΔS the entropy change."
8,Results and discussion,"The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photos of the as-prepared Co foam are shown in Figs. S2, S3 and S4, revealing that the Co foam consisted of porous three-dimensional crosslink networks uniformly distributed in long-range. The open porosity and bulk density measured by the Archimedes principle were 90% and 0.8 g cm−3, respectively. Mercury intrusion porosimetry showed that the pore sizes were mainly around 28 and 52 μm (Fig. S4), much smaller than in the case of commercial Ni foam (PNF, usually > 450 μm, Fig. S5). These results indicated that the as-prepared Co foam had ultrahigh porosity and showed the distinct porous structure, making it potentially more suitable as a catalyst support than PNF to construct self-supported electrocatalysts for HER. The surface of as-prepared Co foam could be directly converted into phosphides which could have superior performance in electro-catalyzing HER, via phosphorization with NaH2PO2. Prior to the experiments, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH∗) on Co2P (001) surface was calculated based on the density function theory (DFT). The calculated ΔGH∗ is −0.60 eV (Fig. 1 a and Fig. S6), which is far different from the value (~−0.1 eV) of Pt (111) reported by Norskøv et al. [34] and Luo et al. [35], indicating that the simple phosphorization might not be an effective strategy. A previous research suggested that hydroxides surrounding Pt could promote the production of hydrogen intermediates and molecular hydrogen [36]. The combination of hydroxides with phosphides might also modulate the H chemisorption and desorption strength. Moreover, phosphides could become even more active via cationic substitution. Thus, the construction of NiCoP/hydroxides double-layer interface on the Co foams by the introduction of Co–Ni layered double hydroxide (LDH) could be a potential approach to the further improvement in the HER performance. To confirm the hypothesis, DFT calculation was performed, which shows that ΔGH∗ (Fig. 1a and Fig. S6) on NiCoP/NiOOH (−0.24 eV) is very close to the value of Pt (111) [2,37], suggesting that NiCoP/NiOOH should have a high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards HER. The differential charge density of NiCoP/NiOOH was also calculated (Fig. 1b), which demonstrates an electron accumulation at the double-layer interface of NiOOH and NiCoP and a significant electron transfer from NiOOH to NiCoP (as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1b). The significant electron redistribution may provide a fast electron transfer and then modulate the adsorption abilities of intermediates during the electrocatalytic reactions [38]. For the HER in an alkaline solution, an initial water dissociation is also very important [39]. Thus, the adsorption energy of a H2O molecule and activation energy for H2O dissociation on the Co2P (001) and NiCoP/NiOOH (0001) surfaces were further calculated (Fig. 1c and Fig. S7). It has been found that the adsorption of water is much more favorable on NiCoP/NiOOH (0001) surface (−0.65 eV) than on Co2P (001) surface (−0.43 eV). Meanwhile, the activation energy for H2O dissociation is 0.60 eV on NiCoP/NiOOH (0001) surface, smaller than that on Co2P (001) surface (0.80 eV). These synergistic effects at the double-layer interfaces of NiCoP/NiOOH could lead to a moderate energy barrier for the initial water dissociation step and an appropriate ΔGH∗ for subsequent H2 generation, suggesting that the NiCoP/NiOOH is effective in cleaving O–H bonds of water and a highly active HER catalyst in alkaline media. The hierarchical NiCoP/NiOOH nanoflowers loaded on the Co foam were prepared by in-situ growing Ni–Co hydroxide (Ni–Co LDH) in hydrothermal conditions followed by phosphorization method. Powder samples were striped from the surface of Co foams by ultrasound vibration and used for XRD characterization. The XRD patterns of Ni–Co LDH and NiCoP/CF-350 (“350” indicates phosphorization at 350 °C, so below) are shown in Fig. 2 a, indicating that the peaks at 10.8°, 22.2°, 33.6°, and 60.4° indexed to (003), (006), (009) and (110) planes of Ni–Co LDH hydrotalcite [40] became invisible after phosphorization. In the meantime, characteristic peaks of sample NiCoP/CF-320, NiCoP/CF-350 and NiCoP/CF-380 at 41.0°, 44.9°, and 47.6° can be indexed to (111), (201) and (210) planes of hexagonal NiCoP (JCPDS No. 71–2336) [41], indicating the successful phosphorization of Ni–Co LDH, i.e., the formation of phosphides. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. For the sample Ni–Co LDH before phosphorization, the peaks at 3631 cm−1 and 3438 cm−1 were assigned to the O–H stretching vibration, and the peaks at low wavenumber ranging from 500 to 1000 cm−1 were assigned to the M-O and M-O-M lattice vibration (M represents Ni or Co) [40]. Peaks around 1385 cm−1 for NO3 − asymmetric stretching vibration indicated a small amount of NO3 − was introduced into the interlayer of LDH during the hydrothermal process. After phosphorization, peaks at 1268 and 1085 cm−1 ascribed to stretching vibration of PO were detected, revealing that the partial phosphorization of LDH to form phosphide and partial P atoms bonded with O of hydroxide. Meanwhile, the peaks around 3415 and 1618 cm−1 became weaker but were still visible, indicating that there was still a fractional LDH remained on the surface. These results revealed the simultaneous existence of phosphide and hydroxide on NiCoP/CF-350. SEM images of as-synthesized Ni–Co LDH loaded on Co foams (Fig. S8) showed that lots of petaloid nanosheet arrays were in-situ grown on the surface of Co foams vertically and uniformly, in accordance with widely reported typical morphology of iron group metals LDH [42,43]. After phosphorization, the petaloid morphology of the sample treated at 320 °C was well retained (Fig. S9). With increasing temperature to 350 °C, the wall thickness of petal became slightly thicker (Fig. S10). On further increasing the phosphorization temperature to 380 °C, the flower-like structure almost completely collapsed due to etching by the PH3 released from NaH2PO2 (Fig. S11) [3]. It is believed that, this kind of three-dimensional (3D) porous and hierarchically integrated electrode consisting of both microporous skeleton and dense petaloid nanosheet should contain a large number of active sites and could also facilitate mass transfer in the catalysis [44,45], making it a promising electrochemical catalyst for HER. Fig. 3 a shows an HRTEM image of an individual nano-petal of Ni–Co LDH which shared a similar morphology of a nanosheet. The lattice fringe of 0.24 nm corresponds to the (012) plane of Ni–Co LDH [46]. Elemental mapping images showed that Ni, Co and O elements were homogeneously distributed in the entire nanosheet (Fig. 3b) and the atom ratio of Ni to Co was close to 2:1, indicating the formation of Ni–Co LDH hydrotalcite [47,48]. After 2 h phosphorization at 350 °C, porous and butterfly spots-like morphology was seen on the nanosheet (Fig. 3c). The lattice fringes of 0.19, 0.20 and 0.22 nm were determined from the HRTEM image of NiCoP/CF-350 (Fig. 3d), corresponding respectively to the (210), (201) and (111) planes of NiCoP [41]. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Inset of Fig. 3d) shows polycrystal diffracting rings of NiCoP. The STEM and elemental mapping images (Fig. 3e) suggest that Ni, Co, P and O elements are homogeneously distributed in the entire sheet. These results indicated that the nanosheet was composed of hydroxide and NiCoP nanocrystals. The samples after phosphorization at 320 °C and 380 °C showed similar morphology and composition. With the increase in phosphorization temperature, the amounts of spots increased significantly, which should be due to the pyrolysis of LDH (Fig. S12). EDS characterization (Fig. 3e) revealed that the atomic ratio of O was as high as 66%, suggesting the possible hierarchical phosphide/hydroxide structure of the as-prepared NiCoP/CF samples. To get a deep insight into the interfacial composition and structure of nanosheet, XPS depth profiling was performed for NiCoP/CF-350 sample from the surface to 80 nm depth by Ar ion etching. Before phosphorization, the peak of 855.7 eV for Ni 2p3/2 spectrum and peak of 781.4 eV for Co 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 4 a and b) suggested the formation of Ni–Co LDH [49]. After phosphorization, the peaks at 853.1 eV for Ni 2p3/2 and 788.4 eV for Co 2p3/2 were respectively attributed to the Ni–P and Co–P bonds, indicating a successful phosphorization of Ni–Co LDH, and the formation of NiCoP [41,49]. The main peak at 856.6 eV corresponding to the main peak of γ-NiOOH arising from the Ni(OH)2 pyrolysis was detected [49]. Since that oxyhydroxides would decompose into oxides around 200–500 °C [50–52], peaks of Ni–O bond at 853.8 eV and Co–O at 782.2 eV were also detected. For the P 2p spectra, the weak peak at 129.5 eV and the peak at 134.0 eV were assigned respectively to the phosphide and the P–O bond [53,54]. With the increase in the etching depth, Ni–P and Co–P peaks became weaker and finally disappeared at a depth of 80 nm, while the Ni–P and Co–P bonds were weakened, but the Ni–O bond appeared at the depth of 40 nm and 80 nm. Moreover, the ratio of P to Ni/Co from the XPS spectrum reduced gradually with etching depth increasing from 0 to 80 nm (Fig. S13 and Table S1). The XPS results further proved that the nano-petals on Co foam contained interfaces of hydroxide and phosphide. During the thermal phosphorization, initially LDH was decomposed to produce oxyhydroxides and oxides initially, then only several outer layers of samples were converted to phosphides owing to the insufficient supply of NaH2PO2 and incomplete decomposition of LDH at such a short time and low temperature [50–52]. As a result, the outer layer of final samples was mainly phosphides and the inner layer was consisted of small amount residual oxyhydroxides that not yet fully decomposed. Finally, the electrocatalytic performance of NiCoP/CF-350 for HER was evaluated in an alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH) using a standard three-electrode cell. To compare the HER performance of NiCoP/CF-320, NiCoP/CF-350, NiCoP/CF-380, CoP/CF-350, and NiCoP/PNF-350, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the samples were determined and are shown in Fig. 5 a. It can be seen that the NiCoP/CF-350 sample exhibited a lower onset potential and a higher current density for the HER than the other samples. Specifically, the current density of −10 mA cm−2 (a common criterion to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity) can be reached on NiCoP/CF-350 at a low overpotential of −47 mV. In contrast, higher overpotentials of −54, −66, −75 and −124 mV are respectively required for the samples of NiCoP/CF-320, NiCoP/CF-380, CoP/CF-350 and NiCoP/PNF-350, to achieve the same current density. At the same time, as shown in Fig. 5b, the NiCoP/CF-350 sample also exhibited the smaller Tafel slope of 92 mV dec−1 than the control samples (96 mV dec−1 for NiCoP/CF-320, 111 mV dec−1 for NiCoP/CF-380, 116 mV dec−1 for CoP/CF-350, and 130 mV dec−1 for NiCoP/PNF-350, respectively). The low overpotential of the as-prepared hierarchical NiCoP/CF-350 compares favorably to those of other representative self-supported electrocatalysts reported in the past five years (Fig. 5c and Table S2). Taking the best among those reported electrocatalysts as an example, the porous CoP nanosheets converted from Co–Al LDH on carbon paper required 57 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH [56], slightly higher than that of NiCoP/CF-350 sample. Furthermore, to achieve current density of −50 mA cm−2, -100 mA cm−2 and -200 mA cm−2, NiCoP/CF-350 only required overpotential of −95 mV, −126 mV and −172 mV, respectively. In addition, the released H2was collected and the Faradic efficiency was calculated at a current density around −250 mA cm−2 (constant potential of 180 mV vs. RHE) (Fig. S14). The result showed that the amount of released H2 was closed to the theoretical value with 95% Faradic efficiency. The double-layer capacitances (Cdl) were measured based on cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves. Corresponding capacitive current plots against the scan rate, the Cdl for NiCoP/CF-350, NiCoP/CF-320, NiCoP/CF-380, CoP/CF-350 and NiCoP/PNF-350 sample were measured as 70, 65, 36, 13 and 2.3 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5d and Fig. S14). These results indicated that the NiCoP/CF-350 had a relatively large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and exposed more active sites for HER, which would result in the promoted electrocatalytic performance [64]. Compared with NiCoP/PNF-350, the higher HER performance of NiCoP/CF-350 sample in alkaline media was ascribed to its much higher ECSA (70 mF cm−2 for NiCoP/CF-350; 2.3 mF cm−2 for NiCoP/PNF-350), suggesting the superiority of the Co foam prepared in this work. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was fitted by an equivalent circuit (Fig. 5e). The characteristic of the half ring in the high frequency region and the straight line in the low frequency region indicated that the electrode process was controlled by both charge transfer and mass diffusion. The EIS results indicated that the NiCoP/CF-350 had a relatively smaller charge transfer resistance (R ct ) compared with CoP/CF and NiCoP/PNF, resulting in the improved electrocatalytic performance. Besides, NiCoP/CF-350 with NiCoP/NiOOH heterogeneous structure showed a higher HER activity in the alkaline medium than CoP/CF-350 (Fig. 5a). The reasons could be attributed to (1) The introduction of Ni–Co LDH to NiCoP can weaken the binding energy between hydrogen and NiCoP which was proved by the DFT calculation (Fig. 1), inducing easy releasing of hydrogen gas; (2) The NiCoP/NiOOH double-layer interface could favor the water adsorption and lower its consequent dissociation barrier for Volmer step (H2O + e− + ∗ → H∗ + OH−, the first step of HER in alkaline media) [21], promoting facile dissociation of water; (3) The charge-transfer resistance of the NiCoP/CF was lower than that of CoP/CF and NiCoP/PNF, as characterized by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 5e), in agreement with the DFT calculation (Fig. 1). These theoretical and experimental results proved the effectiveness of our strategy in significantly enhancing the HER performance of NiCoP by using a Co foam of ultrahigh porosity as a 3D support and tuning the electronic structure through the introduction of Ni–Co LDH. Given a stable working current density more than −500 mA cm−2 required by the industry [65], the long-term electrocatalyst durability of the NiCoP/CF-350 was also tested at an initial current density of −550 mA cm−2 (constant potential of −281 mV vs. RHE), as shown in Fig. 5f. The results showed that the NiCoP/CF-350 exhibited a very good stability in the long-term testing, and only a small fluctuation of current density between −500 mA cm−2 and -600 mA cm−2 was observed during the 16 h testing, which was superior to many recently reported values under high current density (Table S3). After such an intensive continuous operation, the SEM images (Fig. S15) revealed that NiCoP/CF-350 was stable after the durability test since the ultrahigh porosity foam structure was still well retained and the petal-like morphology was hardly damaged, indicating that the hierarchical structure was survived. Noticeably, the current density increased slightly at the later stage during the long-term testing, which seemed to be a common phenomenon since several reports on iron group metal-based electrodes toward HER in 1M KOH also showed the similar results under high current density [60,66]. However, there was still no specific explanation currently, though a possible reason might be the mild evolution of chemical composition for electrocatalyst during the long-term testing. On the basis of the aforementioned discussions, a plausible electrocatalytic mechanism with the HER processes in the basic electrolyte at the interface of NiOOH/NiCoP foam can be proposed. The ultrahigh porosity of Co foam could provide a reaction pathway and construct more active sites along with the advantage of excellent electrical conductivity of Co metal. Furthermore, the inner NiOOH of the pedal on the Co foam could act as an electron porter, promoting effectively electron transfer to the active sites of NiCoP on the nano-petal surface. Overall, owing to the ultrahigh porosity of the Co foam, the high intrinsic activity of NiCoP, and the accelerated electron transfer from the Co foam inside to the NiCoP outside by NiOOH, the designed NiCoP/NiOOH/CF exhibited a superior performance towards HER."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have presented a combined theoretical and experimental study on constructing hierarchical NiCoP/NiOOH foam used as a highly active and earth-abundant electrocatalyst for HER. The Co foam with an ultrahigh porosity of 90% was prepared and acted as a self-supporting framework. Taking advantages of high porosity and further surface enhancement by introducing petal morphology of LDH, the active sites were increased significantly. As a result, the as-prepared NiCoP/NiOOH porous nanostructures loaded on the Co foam showed a better HER performance in alkaline media than the sample using the commercial Ni foam as a support and other metal phosphides reported previously. Our results suggested that ultrahigh porosity Co foam could significantly increase the active sites, the introduction of a layer of hydroxide between metallic phosphides and the Co foam could effectively modulate the electrodes structure of the compounds and tune the hydrogen adsorption energy and water dissociation energy, thus dramatically enhance the catalytic activity. This work achieved a relatively stable electrode structure at high current density and proposed a new strategy for designing HER electrocatalysts by replacing commercial Ni foam with ultrahigh porosity Co foam. We believe that our electrode with superior performance could hold the promise for future large-scale hydrogen production."
