0,Introduction,"As a substantial unexploited source of mixed sugars (hexose and pentose), lignocellulosic biomass has a potential for the production of ethanol, methane, and hydrogen bio-fuels by applying fermentation or anaerobic digestion. These energy carriers have the potential to reduce fossil fuels for transportation and for heat and power production. Additionally, bio-fuel production from lignocelluloses could decouple the production of food and energy, increase the value of the world’s production from agriculture and forestry, reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions, and certainly provide a more stable and secure supply of energy (Larsen et al., 2008). In order to utilize sugars consisted in lignocelluloses for bio-fuels production, pre-treatment is required to break down their dense structure and improve digestibility. At commercial scale, hydrothermal pre-treatment is an efficient and potential way of pre-treating lignocelluloses. During the hydrothermal pre-treatment, the cellulose (C6 sugars) and lignin are recovered in a solid fraction, while hemicelluloses (C5 sugars) and degradation products are contained mainly in a liquid fraction called hydrolysate. Fermentation of the C6 sugars present in the solid fraction by using wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae for bio-ethanol production has been demonstrated successfully, but utilization of hydrolysate (C5 sugars) is currently inefficient and uneconomical for bio-ethanol production (Larsen et al., 2008). Alternatively, hemicelluloses hydrolysate can be converted to hydrogen by using mixed extreme thermophiles in the UASB reactor with a high yield of 203ml-H2/g-sugars (Kongjan and Angelidaki, 2010). Moreover, soluble products such as volatile fatty acids, lactic acids, and alcohols generated simultaneously during the fermentative hydrogen production from hydrolysate could serve as ideal substrate for methane production by a subsequent anaerobic digestion (Kaparaju et al., 2009b). Methane production is, therefore, considered as suitable additional step to hydrogen production. Two-stage anaerobic digestion for bio-fuels (hydrogen and methane) production and organic waste treatment has now emerged as an attractive and promising process. In this process, two separate reactors are connected in series, separating acidogenesis and methanogenesis, are operated at different temperatures, acidity and hydraulic retention time (HRT) appropriate for individual optimization of growth of the different communities of micro-organisms in each reactor (Demirel and Yenigun, 2002). Acidogenic bacteria convert organic substrates mainly into hydrogen, organic acids, solvents and CO2 in the first stage under slightly acidic (pH∼5.0–6.0) conditions, and typically shorter HRTs of 1–3days. Methane producing micro-organisms in the second stage, on the other hand, have a lower growth rate, requiring a longer HRT (10–20days) at a more neutral acidity (pH∼7.0–8.0) for converting organic acids and solvents contained in the effluent from the first reactor to methane (Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006). More importantly, controlling the acidification in the first reactor could prevent the overloading and/or inhibition of methanogenesis in the second reactor and consequently increase the stability of the whole process. UASB reactors are extensively used in anaerobic digestion for treating various dilute liquid wastes consisting typically of 1–3% total solid concentration with high organic loading rates and short HRTs because they can retain high biomass concentrations with high specific activity in the form of granular sludge (Lepistö and Rintala, 1999; Batstone et al., 2004). It has also been shown that UASB reactors are less sensitive to fluctuations of environmental parameters (e.g. acidity and HRT) than a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), resulting in process better stability (Gavala et al., 2006; Kotsopoulos et al., 2006). Hydrogen producing UASB reactors can risk developing methanogens because cells are immobilised and are not washed out from the UASB reactor, even at flow rates much higher than the maximum growth rate of the methanogens. In such immobilised-type reactors, a combination of operating at extreme thermophilic temperatures and a slightly acidic environment at 5.0–6.0 pH can be applied to effectively eliminate methane production (Kongjan and Angelidaki, 2010; Kotsopoulos et al., 2006). Combination of the advantages of the two stage process with the advantages of UASB reactors, for treatment of carbohydrate rich substrates would give the possibility to efficiently produce hydrogen and methane in a two step process at a high rate and fully utilise the energy contained in the organic matter. Application of UASB reactors in a two stage process of hemicelloses hydrolysate, a by-product for second generation ethanol processing has not been tried to date. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated a two steps process in UASB reactors, operated in series, with a hydrogen producing reactor at 70°C, and subsequent methane reactor at 55°C, from diluted hydrolysate. Microbial communities of selected mixed cultures of two-stage process were assessments by PCR-DGGE based on 16S rDNA."
1,Methods,
2,Wheat straw hydrolysate,"2.1 Wheat straw hydrolysate Hydrolysate was kindly provided from Department of Biosystems, Risø DTU (Denmark), generated by the hydrothermal pre-treatment of wheat straw in a three step reactor system. The hydrothermal pre-treatment of wheat straw resulted in a solid fraction containing the mainly the cellulose and lignin; and a liquid fraction so-called hydrolysate, mainly containing hemicelluloses (Kaparaju et al., 2009b). Hydrolysate used in this study, had a total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) content of 3.3% and 4.4%, respectively, and was consisting of 12.6g/l pentoses and 2.9g/l hexoses. More detailed composition of the hydrolysate can be found in Kongjan et al. (2010)."
3,Experimental set-up and operation,"2.2 Experimental set-up and operation Continuous hydrogen and methane production were carried out in 2 UASB reactors with a 220-ml working volume each. The reactors were maintained at 70 and 55°C for H2 UASB reactor (R1) and CH4 UASB reactor (R2), respectively, by circulating hot water inside a water jacket surrounding each UASB reactor. A hydrogen UASB reactor fed with 25% (v/v) hydrolysate at 1day HRT in our previous investigation (Kongjan and Angelidaki, 2010) was used. For avoiding clogging in the tubes (i.d.3.2mm) the influent to reactor contained hydrolysate diluted with water (6:4v/v) and basic anaerobic (BA) medium (1:1v/v), corresponding to 30% (v/v) hydrolysate and an organic loading rate (OLR) of 9.9g-VS/d·l. BA medium containing nutrients and bicarbonate buffer was as previously (Angelidaki et al., 1990) and was amended with 1g/l of yeast extract. After reaching steady state characterized by a constant gas production rate (±5%), the R1 effluent was collected (Table 1 ) was kept at −20°C for further use in the R2 reactor. The R2 reactor was filled with 40ml of methonogenic granules from a potato-processing wastewater treatment plant (Kruiningen, Netherlands) and 60ml of digested manure from a thermophilic pilot scale plant (Lyngby, Denmark), for providing a good diverse thermophilic inoculum for methane production. Subsequently 120ml of a mixture consisting of R1 effluent and BA medium (1:1v/v) was then manually added into the reactor. The R2 reactor was then purged with nitrogen gas for 10min to establish anaerobic conditions. The homogenised effluent from R1 was initially fed into the methane reactor at 5.2days HRT. The reactor OLR was afterwards increased stepwise by decreasing the HRT to 4.4, 3.0, 1.8, 1.0 and 0.5days, corresponding to the organic loading rates of 1.6, 1.9, 2.7, 4.5, 8.2, and 15.7g-VSR1-eff/dl, respectively. Each level of loading was kept, after steady state was achieved, for 2 HRTs. The process was considered to be in steady state when the variation of biogas production was less than 5% (Kaparaju et al., 2009a)."
4,Monitoring and analysis,"2.3 Monitoring and analysis The composition of the biogases produced (H2, CH4 and CO2) were daily monitored, and liquid samples were taken daily for further analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, lactate, formate, total sugars, total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS). Hydrogen, methane and CO2 were determined by gas chromatography (GC) (MicroLab, Arhus, Denmark) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Kotsopoulos et al., 2006). The VFAs and alcohol were measured using a GC (GC-2010 Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Zebron (ZB) – FFAP column (dimensions 30m×0.53mm) (Kongjan et al., 2010). Lactate and formate were analyzed by suppressed ion exclusion chromatography equipped with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump (L2100 Hitachi), a HPLC auto-sampler (L2200 Hitachi), a suppressor (Dionex AMMS-IEC2), and a column (ICE-AS1) at 9×250mm (Kongjan et al., 2009). Sugars were analyzed by HPLC equipped with refractive index (RI) detector, and toxic compounds of furfural and HMF were determined by a HPLC fitted with an ultraviolet (UV) detector (Kaparaju et al., 2009b)."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was used to study microbial community structure in the two-stage process. Liquid samples were collected from bioreactors under steady state conditions. Genomic DNA extractions as well as PCR-DGGE for bacteria were made as previous described (Kongjan et al., 2010). PCR-DGGE for archaea, genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR reactions with a primer pair specific Arch21f and Arch958r (Lane, 1991) in order to detect archaea populations in methanogenic reactor. Genomic DNA from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and Sulfolobus islandicus were used as negative and positive controls for archaea – PCR, respectively. First, archaea – PCR products were used as a template for nested PCR reactions with a primer pair specific for archaea (PARCH519R and PARCH340F with 40bp GC clamp at the 5′ end (Keyser et al., 2006) were used to amplify the 200bp fragment of the V 3 region. The amplicons were used as DNA template to incorporate a GC clamp in the DNA fragment prior to DGGE (Muyzer and Smalla, 1998). The second archaea-PCR program corresponded to 20 cycles of three steps: 94°C for 1min, 65°C for 0.75min, and 72°C for 1min, 10cycles of three steps: 94°C for 1min, 55°C for 0.75min, and 72°C for 1min followed by a final step at 72°C for 10min. Amplification was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products before DGGE analysis. DGGE analysis of the amplicons obtained from second PCR was performed as previously described by Zoetendal et al. (2001) and the DGGE Marker II set (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) was co-electrophoresed with the samples. DGGE profiles were compared using the Quantity One software package (version 4.6.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Most of the bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified. After re-amplification, PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by database searches in Gene Bank using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,H2 UASB reactor operation,"3.1 H2 UASB reactor operation No traces of methane could be detected during operation of the R1 reactor for over 3months. Within 1week of operation with 30% (v/v) hydrolysate, the R1 reactor reached steady state, with an average hydrogen production rate of 883ml H2/d·l, giving a hydrogen yield of 190ml H2/g-sugars (89ml H2/g-VS). The reactor could provide satisfactory removal of HMF and furfural with the efficiency of 53.3% and 63.4%, corresponding to the effluent concentrations of 26.0 and 19.6mg/l, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the pH was able, without external pH control, to be maintained at 5.1, which is still in the favourable range of 5.0–5.5 for extreme thermophilic hydrogen production (Kotsopoulos et al., 2006). Feeding with hydrolysate concentration of 30% (v/v) in this investigation, resulted in slightly lower hydrogen yield and higher hydrogen production rate, compared to the hydrogen production yield and rate of 212ml-H2/g-sugars and 821ml-H2/d·l, respectively, that was achieved from the H2 UASB reactor fed with 25% (v/v) hydrolysate at 1day HRT (Kongjan and Angelidaki, 2010). Lower hydrogen production yield generally occurs when metabolic products like, propionate, lactate, and ethanol are increasingly produced compared to acetate and butyrate, which is observed when the OLR is increasing (Antonopoulou et al., 2008). Additionally, consumption of H2 by H2-consuming processes, such as methanogenesis or homoacetogenesis, can also cause low hydrogen production. This is highly depended on the operational conditions such as pH, HRT, as well as substrate and inhibitor concentrations (Kongjan et al., 2010; Koskinen et al., 2008). The VS removal efficiency in the R1 reactor was 17.5%, which was contributed mainly to cell mass growth and hydrogen production, while the main part of organic matter still remained in the H2 reactor effluent (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the soluble end products in the H2 reactor effluent were mainly comprised by acetate, followed by much lower concentrations of butyrate, while other competing productions of lactate, propionate, ethanol, and formate were simultaneously generated in lower concentrations. Acetate is an ideal substrate for a subsequent anaerobic digestion as it is directly consumed by methanogens via aceticlastic methanogenesis (Batstone et al., 2004)."
8,CH4 UASB reactor operation,"3.2 CH4 UASB reactor operation In the second anaerobic stage, methane was expected to be produced by converting residual organic matters present in the effluent of R1 reactor, which still have high VS concentration of 8.2g/l and are mainly dominated by VFAs, organic acids (lactate and formate), and ethanol (Table 1). However, other by-products than acetate are needed to be converted to acetate by acetogens. Later on, methanogens can convert acetate to methane and carbon dioxide (Stams et al., 2005). The process data of R2 is shown in Fig. 1 . The homogenized R1 effluent was initially fed into R2 reactor at a HRT of 5.2days, corresponding to 1.1g-VSR1-eff/dl. For the first 4days of operation, reactor was stressed, as indicated by the high concentrations of VFAs (∼70mM), and the very low pH (∼4.9). Additionally, the methane content was only around 41%, and significant hydrogen concentration was detected in the gas phase (∼20%). However, VFA concentrations sharply decreased after day 4 and stabilised to less than 3mM from day 15 onwards. Meanwhile, methane content in the gas phase suddenly increased and stabilized at around 70% from day 6 onwards, associating with hydrogen disappearing. Increasing pH (which stabilised to around 7.0) was observed simultaneously with significantly decreasing VFA concentrations. This pH was optimal for the methane production process. Optimum pH was reported to be in the range of 7.0–8.0 for the growth of acetogens and methanogens in the second stage (Antonopoulou et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2006). The increase of pH was mainly due to consumption of VFA, but also to release of ammonia during the degradation of proteins contained in the hydrolysate (Kaparaju et al., 2009b). However, the contribution of proteins was probably small, as the protein concentration in the influent was only 0.33g-N/l. A stable methane production rate of 506ml-CH4/d·l, corresponding to a methane yield of 323ml-CH4/g-VSR1-effl was achieved during the period R2 was operated at 5.2days HRT. The methane yield increased linearly up to the highest value of 372mlCH4/g-VSR1-effl corresponding to a methane production rate of 1012 ml-CH4/d·l at the OLR of 2.7g-VSR1-effl/dl (3days HRT). At the same time the VFAs in the methane reactor were still almost fully degraded with less than 1mM remaining. Therefore, based on the nearly complete degradation of the organic matter, hydrolysate could be considered as stabilized. Increasing OLR by decreasing the HRT to 3days, resulted in higher methane yields, indicating the anaerobic digestion was in substrate-limited conditions. However, further increasing the OLR to 8.2g-VSR1-effl/d·l (1day HRT) caused a decrease in the methane yield to 256ml-CH4/g-VSR1-effl and increase of VFA concentration indicating sign of process overloading. Beyond an OLR of 15.7g-VSR1-effl/dl, or a HRT of 0.5day, the biogas process became unstable, as indicated by decreasing of the methane yield along with sharp increase of VFA concentrations (42.7mM) and drop of the pH to 5.85."
9,Microbial community in two stage process,"3.3 Microbial community in two stage process The structure of the microbial community in the two-stage process for hydrogen and methane production from hydrolysate was investigated by molecular biological analysis. The microbial community in the extreme thermophilic acidogenic reactor R1 consisted of Thermoanaerobacter weigelii, Caloramator fervidus, Thermoanaerobacterium sp., Caldanaerobacter subteraneus and Thermodesulfovibrio sp. (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, methanogenic archea were not detected in the first stage of acidogenesis, indicating the suppression of methanogens. Among the extreme thermophilic acidogenic bacteria monitored, Thermoanaerobacter wiegelii was the most abundant followed up by C. fervidus and probably played an important role in hydrogen production under first stage of acidogenesis. The presence of Thermoanaerobacter sp. is in good agreement with other studies that have identified Thermoanaerobacter sp. besides Caldanaerobacter sp., as the main hydrogen-producing bacteria, at extreme thermophilic conditions (Kongjan et al., 2010; Yokoyama et al., 2007). Thermoanaerobacterium sp. was identified in R1. It has been reported as a thermophile with optimal growth temperature at 60°C, which is able to convert carbohydrates to hydrogen with butyrate as the end soluble product (O-Thong et al., 2008). In our study, the operation temperature of R1 was 70°C. Although the temperature was higher than the reported optimum temperature of Thermonanaerobacterium sp., it could, due to its thermo-tolerance, still be maintained in the reactor. It has been reported that this organism was tolerant to extreme thermophilic temperature and was able to compete with other extreme thermophiles (Kongjan et al., 2010). C. fervidus was also present it the reactor. This organism is a strictly anaerobic, hydrogen producing extreme thermophile, has a growth range of 45–75°C, with an optimum of 68°C. C. fervidus utilizes various carbohydrates, including xylose, glucose, and xylan. The fermented end products are hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetate, with trace amounts of butyrate, ethanol, and lactic acid (Yokoyama et al., 2007). This soluble products profile was in agreement with the one we found in R1. Microbial communities in thermophilic methanogenesis were comprised of both archaea (Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, Methanothermobacter defluvii and Methanosarcina mazei) and bacteria (Thermoanaerobacterium sp., Clostridium roseum, Clostridium isatidis, Thermodesulfovibrio isladicus) (Fig. 3 ). The dominant methanogens in thermophilic R2 reactor were M. mazei that showed a strong intensity DGGE band, whereas the other important aceticlastic genus of Methanosaeta was not found. This is probably due initially high acetate concentration in the R2 reactor (Fig. 1). Methanosaeta was found dominant at very low acetate concentration (<1mM) and has high affinity to acetate but relative lower maximum specific growth rate (Ks =20mg/l and k max =2–4g-COD/g-VSS·d). On the other hand, genus Methanosarcina was able to tolerate at high acetate concentration and has much lower substrate affinity but higher maximum specific utilization rate (Ks =400mg/l and k max =6–10g-COD/g-VSS·d) (Karakashev et al., 2005; Tatara et al., 2005). Methanosarcina sp., which are coccoid organisms, at growing at temperature range of 50–60°C, are primarily utilising acetate as substrate, although they are also capable of utilizing other substrates such as H2/CO2, methanol, or methylamines (Ohba et al., 2006). Methanosarcina, has a doubling time of approximately 1day or more, even under optimal growth conditions (Chauhan and Ogram, 2005). Micro-organisms with slow growth rates like acetolastic methanogens can easily attach themselves to support materials by using their hydrophobic membranes, allowing longer sludge retention time than HRT (Tatara et al., 2005). The presence of Thermoanaerobacterium sp., C. roseum, and C. isatidis, which are H2 producing bacteria (Chang et al., 2006; Compton et al., 2000; Yokoyama et al., 2007) indicates that H2 and CO2 were also produced in the second stage reactor. The hydrogen produced was apparently consumed by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens M. defluvii and M. thermautotrophicus, which were also found in R2. M. defluvii and M. thermautotrophicus can reduce CO2 to CH4 with H2, formate or acetate as terminal electron acceptors (Weiss et al., 2008). Thermodesulfovibrio sp. detected in both R1 and R2 reactors are non spore forming sulfate reducing bacteria and able to convert effectively furfural to acetate (Brune et al., 1983; Boopathy, 2002). This implies that the removal of furfural and presumably also of HMF, contained in hydrolysate (Table 1), was probably due to the degradation activity of Thermodesulfovibrio sp. Meanwhile, phenol is also able to be converted to acetate under anaerobic conditions by sulfate reducing consortia (Haggblom and Young, 1995)."
10,Potential in recovering energy from biomass by using a two stage anaerobic process,"3.4 Potential in recovering energy from biomass by using a two stage anaerobic process Based on g-VS added of hydrolysate fed into the two stage anaerobic system (Fig. 4 ), a hydrogen yield of 89ml-H2/g-VS was achieved from the hydrogen UASB reactor fed with hydrolysate and a HRT of 1day. In the meanwhile, the optimum methane yield obtained from the second UASB reactor operated at a 3days HRT and fed with the hydrogen reactor effluent was 307ml-H2/g-VS. The equivalent energy produced is 13.4kJ/g-VS, which is 87.5% of the hydrolysate potential energy of 15.4kJ/g-VS (Kaparaju et al., 2009b) and drastically increased from 1.15kJ/g-VS (7.5% of hydrolysate potential energy) generated from the first stage. Furthermore, the overall VS removal efficiency was 81%, which is more or less the same with% COD removal efficiency since the COD/VS ratio of hydrolysate (1.15) (Kaparaju et al., 2009b) is presumably assumed to be constant through the whole two-stage process. Hemicellulosic sugars contained in hydrolysate are the main organic substrate to be utilised by mixed micro-organisms in an anaerobic process for hydrogen and/or methane production. Furfural and HMF were complete degraded probably by Thermodesulfovibrio sp. in the two stage reactor at total HRT higher than 2.8days. However, those toxicants started increasing at total HRT below 2.8days could indicate the limiting degradation of toxic compounds. This implies that further increasing OLR in the system might result in process failure caused by too high toxicants. Kaparaju et al. (2009a) previously found that toxicant contained in 50% (v/v) hydrolysate was the main cause for complete failure in the thermophilic methanogenic UASB reactor operated at a 2days HRT. The treatment of hydrolysate by using activated carbon to remove those toxic compounds before feeding them to the reactor (Mussatto et al., 2005) could possibly be alternative option to achieve higher OLRs. Processing hydrolysate by a two stage process, with extreme thermophilic acidogenic first step and methanogenic second step, at an OLR of 9.9g-VS/dl could result in stable hydrogen and methane production. The good process stability was mainly attributed to the optimization of the environmental conditions for the growth of micro-organisms in each reactor (Demirel and Yenigun, 2002). However, UASB reactor systems are capable of using for high rate degradation only diluted substrates like hydrolysate as successfully demonstrated in our investigation. Food waste as a represent of high solid content substrate was previous studied in a two stage thermophilic process by combining a sequencing batch reactor and a packed-bed reactor using cylindrical polyethylene as carriers for hydrogen and methane production with the satisfactory yields of 114ml-H2/g-VS and 450.6ml-CH4/g-VS, respectively. Good stability and organic loading capacity was achieved as well (Lee et al., 2010). Energy costs for thermophilic and extreme thermophilic treatments, should be considered. Generally, the energy cost for operating the Danish biogas plant at thermophilic temperature is approximately 10% of the energy produced as described in Kongjan et al. (2009). Additionally, regulations for waste sanitation require pasteurization of biogas effluents before soil application, at 70°C for 1h. Effective insulation of the reactors, along with good heat exchanging would be needed for ensuring energetic justification of a process combining extreme thermophilic dark fermentation and thermophilic anaerobic digestion. Furthermore, the capital investment and operation costs of a two-stage anaerobic digestion system are higher than that of the traditionally one stage anaerobic digestion system. However, a higher efficiency and process stability could justify the extra costs. Nutrients including buffer used for ensuring optimal growth conditions of the micro-organisms, especially for hydrogen-producing bacteria is the main cost for the two stage process (Ljunggren and Zacchi, 2010). However, mixing with other wastes containing good buffer capacity and nutrients, could a way of avoiding nutrients and buffer addition. This would reduce the operational cost, and improve the two-stage anaerobic process for industrial applications. Furthermore, hydrogen and methane produced from the two-stage process could possibly be mixed as the new form of bio-fuel called hythane. It has been shown a methane hydrogen gas mixture has superior combustion properties, compared to methane alone. Even small addition of hydrogen to methane (5–30% by volume that means ∼1.5–10% by energy) leads to many advantages, due to the specific physical and chemical properties of the two fuels, such as significant reduction of CO, CO2, and NO x emissions; increased engine efficiencies (by 5–7%) and more stable combustion in internal combustion engines (Gattrell et al., 2007). Meanwhile, the total size of two separate reactors should be smaller than that of one stage anaerobic digestion as the consequences of the effective running the two stage process at (extreme) thermophilic temperature (Demirel and Yenigun, 2002; Lee et al., 2010; Kongjan et al., 2009). This could compensate for construction cost."
11,Conclusion,"Applying a two stage anaerobic process using wheat straw hydrolysate as the substrate was shown to be feasible, with 81% VS removal. Hydrogen and methane yields of 89ml-H2/g-VS and 307ml-CH4/g-VS respectively, corresponding to 87.5% of hydrolysate potential energy, were achieved. In the first stage of acidogenesis, the hydrogen-producing bacteria of T. wiegelii, C. subteraneus and C. fervidus were dominating. Meanwhile, at the thermophilic methanogenesis stage, M. mazei and Methanothermobacter sp. were the dominant methanogens, while the Thermoanaerobacterium sp., C. roseum, and C. isatidis were dominating the bacterial community."
