0,Introduction,"Nanomaterials, defined by size within the nanoscale (typically 1-100 nm), are of great interest as a result of their infinite application possibilities in biomedical field [1]. From health care diagnostics to therapeutics, and even prevention, [2] the nanotechnology landscape has been rapidly evolving. Of particular interest are nanofibers, which are fibers with diameters in the nanometer range with lengths significantly larger. Nanofibers present advantageous characteristics such as large surface area-to-mass ratio, tunable size, morphology, and ability to form porous mesh that creates a perfect three-dimensional (3D) network environment accounting for their enhanced functionalities [3] specially in medical care field [4,5]. Nanofibers can be employed as scaffolds for tissue and regenerative engineering [6,7], wound dressing [8], controlled drug delivery [9], and biosensing [4,10]. They can be particularly useful in cancer therapy [11,12]. Importantly 3D in vitro cultures using nanofibers manufactured in a controlled manner were shown to be excellent molds for cellular growth [13–16], and as a base to 3D model development for in vitro study of cancer [13,17]. Therefore, personalized medicine can benefit from associating the nanofibers ability to support in vitro cell growth to its potential to control drug release, aiming the prediction of patient's response to treatments. Different techniques can be used to generate nanofibrous mats aiming towards their use in biological systems [3,18–20]. Among those, the electrospinning technique has been used to produce homogeneous and versatile nanofibers from natural or synthetic polymers with the purpose of biological systems application [5]. One of electrospinning technique advantages is its low-cost to produce nanofibers in large-scale [5] from a variety of synthetic and natural polymers for diverse biomedical applications [6,21–25]. Nanofibers from synthetic polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polylactic acid (PLA), poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL), and polyglycolic acid (PGA) present good tunable mechanical properties and are biocompatible, but usually lack the bioactivity exhibited by natural polymers [6]. Blending of natural and synthetic polymers combines the desirable material characteristic that allows achieving the best result for an intended application. Natural gums like karaya and kandagogu [26], arabic [26,27], Azivash [28,29] and almond [30] blended with synthetic polymers have been used successfully in the past to produce nanofibers by electrospinning. Particularly, gum arabic, a complex heteropolysaccharide relevant for many fields of applications [31], has been successfully used in biocompatible scaffolds such as gelatin-hydrogels [32], chitosan films [33], in composite with hydroxyapatite [34], chitosan-gelatin nanofibers [35], and PCL/zein nanofibers with or without Calendula officinalis extract [36,37]. Depending on the polymers nature, different solvents are used. Water-soluble polymers are eco-friendly and biocompatible, therefore a blend of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and gum arabic is advantageous. PVA as a synthetic polymer offers high hydrophilicity, biodegradability, non-toxicity with good electrospinnability [38,39], while GA as natural polymer [40] is widely employed and recognized as safe and effective biopolymer used in biomedical application [23]. Nanofibers functionalization is commonly carried out to improve biocompatibility [41,42], and functionality [43–45]. Nanoparticles-decorated nanofibers can be used in this sense [46,47] where the nanoparticles can act as sensors [48], carries [49], and effectors [50]. One of the most explored, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), offers several advantages for biomedical applications and are found to be potentially useful in cancer treatments. The most notable merit of AuNPs is the ability to synthesize it with tunable size and shape, and the flexibility of easily coating its surface with desired molecules of interest. Its intrinsic antitumoral properties [51] and the possibility of applying nanoparticle green synthesis makes them even more appropriate as cancer therapeutic agents [52]. Tumor cytotoxicity mediated by AuNPs is mainly induced by reactive oxygen species generation leading to cell death [53–55]. Moreover, green synthesized AuNPs demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells [56,57]. Therefore, gold nanoparticles-decorated nanofibers can potentially offer dual action as scaffolds and as effective therapy. The personalized medicine concept is based on molecular profiling and genetic mutations of patients to choose the best treatment. This concept has recently drawn attention in cancer [58], and especially in melanoma [59]. Immunotherapy and target therapies have revolutionized metastatic melanoma patients' survival [60], however, resistance to therapy, disease relapse, and high toxicity account for the high rates of current treatment failure [61–63]. Although targetable mutations are not always present in cancer patients, drug efficacy and cell response could still be predicted by previous in vitro testing with patients-derived cells [64]. Thus personalized medicine using in vitro designed drug-delivery platforms could benefit from potentially testing drug efficacy tailored to one patient. Two-dimensional cell cultures are an important tool that allowed drug discovery and drug development. However, many limitations in terms of in vivo reproducibility lead to the constant improvement of in vitro techniques towards the use of 3D cell cultures [65–69]. Considering the possibility of manufacturing nanofibers and also incorporating AuNPs to them, in this work we describe the production of a cell-friendly in vitro environment based on blended PVA/GA nanofibers that form a biocompatible ECM-like platform capable of delivering GA-AuNPs nanocomposites that could be useful for in vitro testing in precision medicine."
1,Material and methods,
2,ECM-like PVA/GA nanofibers production by electrospinning,"2.1 ECM-like PVA/GA nanofibers production by electrospinning Nanofibers of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA - MW89.000-98.000 – 99% hydrolyzed - Sigma-Aldrich) with gum arabic from acacia tree, branched polysaccharide (GA - Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained using the electrospinning technique. The best concentration and proportion of both materials were determined based on data from the literature [26], with modifications. Briefly, varying percentage of PVA (10, 12, or 15 wt%) was dissolved in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ.cm resistivity) at 90 °C under constant agitation for 3 h. The solutions were cooled down to room temperature, GA was added to it (mass ratio 20:80 PVA:GA) and homogenized overnight under constant agitation. Five minutes before its use, the solutions were heated to 37 °C and collected in a 1 mL Norm-Ject syringe (Henke Sass Wolf) coupled to a Sterican needle (Braun) with a straight tip and placed on a syringe pump, connected to a power supplier (E-fiber, SKE Advanced Therapies). A stationary square-shaped metal collector was covered in aluminum foil and nanofibers were deposited either directly on the aluminum foil surface, or in round glass coverslips, and electron microscopy nickel grids. Parameters were set after obtaining nanofibers homogeneous in appearance observed by inverted light microscope EVOS using a 20× objective, being as follows: flow rate 0.7 mL/h; voltage of 13-13 kV; distance of tip-collector plate of 15 cm. The time of deposition varied from 15 min to 30 s. Environmental conditions were: temperature ranged from 20 to 22 °C and relative humidity from 30 to 42%. Crosslinking was performed by heat-treatment based on literature [71], describing the best reticulation time and temperature for PVA nanofibers, resulting in highly stable nanofibers, with modifications. For all membranes, coverslips, and grids containing nanofibers, crosslinking was carried out (except for those used as characterization controls). Briefly, samples were incubated at 180 °C for 8 h in a laboratory oven and subsequently were kept in desiccator until use."
3,Nanofibers characterization,"2.2 Nanofibers characterization Nanofibers morphology, diameter, and distribution were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Electrospun nanofibers mats, crosslinked or not, were gold sputtered-coated with 10 nm of gold prior to be observed under a FE-SEM microscope Carl Zeiss Merlin, equipped with a Gemini II column and a complete High Angle Annular/Annular Dark Field/Bright Field (HAADF/ADF/BF) STEM detector system. Sample images were acquired by using the microscope both in SEM mode and in HAADF – STEM mode, at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV and 20 kV, respectively; with short acquisition times (a few seconds) to avoid sample damages. Images were acquired from at least 3 different areas from different mats. FIJI software [72] was used to determine the diameter of the nanofibers, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated based on 30 measurements per image sample. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was used in the range 500-4000 cm−1 to confirm polymers incorporation into the PVA/GA electrospun fibers and to evaluate the crosslink after heat-treatment (HT = 180 °C, 8 h). The spectra of nanofibers produced from PVA only (following the same parameters described) heat-treated and untreated were used as controls, as well as GA. Samples were prepared according to the procedures described above, samples were attached to sample holder, and analyzed in a Vertex 70 FT-IR Spectrometer (Bruker). Water stability, the degree of swelling, and weight loss of electrospun nanofibers mats were determined by mats immersion in ultrapure water at 25 °C. Mats were cut into 2 cm2 pieces, weighed, incubated for 96 h in water, and subsequently weighed again. Considering that the heat-treated mats remained stable after the incubation period, samples were air-dried (protected from dust), weighed, and processed to SEM. The degree of swelling (SD) and weight loss (WL) percentage were calculated based on the following equations: SD = ((Wt-Wd/Wd)x100 and WL = ((W0-Wd/Wd)x100; where Wt = wet weight, Wd = dry weight, and W0 = initial weight after crosslinking [73]. To determine mats behavior under cell culture condition, the glass coverslips containing electrospun nanofibers were UV sterilized for 1 h, placed in a 35 mm cell culture plate and incubated in complete cell culture media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium - DMEM, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum – FBS) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 96 h. Nanofibers stability was determined by observing them under inverted light microscope EVOS using a 20× objective and by SEM microscope."
4,"Nanoparticles synthesis, characterization and nanofibers functionalization","2.3 Nanoparticles synthesis, characterization and nanofibers functionalization GA-gold nanoparticles (GA-AuNPs) were synthesized according to previous description [56]. Briefly, HAuCl4 (7.056 × 10 mol/L) (Sigma-Aldrich) was reduced by NaBH4 (0.4 mmol/L) (Vetec/Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of GA (0.04 wt% in water - Sigma-Aldrich) forming GA-AuNPs. The suspension was washed and concentrated using Amicon-Ultra tubes 10 kDa (Millipore) for 15 min at 5000 rpm and 4 °C. To obtain fluorescent-labeled GA-AuNPs (GA-AuNPs@RBITC), GA was labeled using rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) as previously described [74]. Briefly, GA-AuNPs were incubated overnight in sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5), and 0.2 mg/mL RBITC in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), washed, and concentrated as described above. The gold concentration of all produced nanoparticles was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific). All final nanoparticles solutions were filtered-sterilized using 0.22 μm PVDF membranes (Millipore) and stored at 4 °C until their use. The absorption profile of GA-AuNPs after synthesis was determined by Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent) and fluorescence profile was determined by Cary Eclipse 300 spectrofluorimeter (Agilent). Nanoparticles size and morphology were observed under a JEM 1200EX-II transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Jeol). Nanofibers functionalization was obtained by overnight incubation with either 2.44 mg/L GA-AuNPs or 2.44 mg/L GA-AuNPs@RBITC (protected from dust and light) on PVA/GA electrospun nanofibers. Samples were washed 3 times in ultrapure water and adsorbed GA-AuNPs@RBITC were observed using a 60× H2O immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.27) under a A1R MP+ confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) (Nikon), GA-AuNPs were observed by a Merlin SEM/STEM microscope (Zeiss)."
5,Nanofibers in vitro biocompatibility and GA-AuNPs delivery,"2.4 Nanofibers in vitro biocompatibility and GA-AuNPs delivery Nanofibers electrospun over glass coverslips were placed on 24 well plates and UV sterilized. To test nanofibers biocompatibility, different tumor cells lines were used. MiaPaCa-2 (human pancreas carcinoma – ATCC, CRL-1420™), MCF7 (human breast cancer – ATCC, HTB-22™), and B16-F10 (murine metastatic melanoma - BCRJ, 0046) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), supplemented with 1 U/mL penicillin and 1 μg mL−1 streptomycin (Gibco), and 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For subculture and seeding cells were washed with PBS (Sigma-Aldrich), detached using trypsin/EDTA (Gibco), and counted in hemocytometer. Cells were used for no more than 5 passages. One hundred microliters of a cell solution (containing 5 × 104 cells) were seeded over the nanofibers, and cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min in the incubator. Complete and appropriated media was added to each well and cells were incubated for up to 96 h. Cell attachment and growth were monitored by observing the plates under an inverted light microscope. SEM was performed to determine cytocompatibility by observing cell morphology. Samples containing B16-F10 cells grown on nanofibers for 96 h were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2) for 1 h, post-fixed for 30 min in 1% OsO4 protected from light at room temperature, washed in cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations, and CO2 critical point dried. Samples were then gold-sputtered and analyzed using a JSM-6360 LV SEM (Jeol). Delivery of GA-AuNPs adsorbed onto the nanofibers was observed by CLSM. Briefly, 5 × 104 B16-F10 cells grown on glass coverslips containing electrospun nanofibers adsorbed with 24.4 mg/L GA-AuNS@RBITC were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Next, the samples were fixed in 1% paraphormaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, incubated for 20 min with ActinGreen™ 488 ReadyProbes™ Reagent (Molecular Probes) and mounted on glass slides with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were imaged by CLSM A1R MP+ (Nikon) using a 60× H2O immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.27), and analyzed using FIJI software [72]. Next, to investigate GA-AuNPs effects, thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed on cells grown over nanofibers adsorbed with GA-AuNPs in 3 different concentrations (2.44 mg/L, 24.4 mg/L, and 244 mg/L) based on previous work [74]. BALB/3T3 clone A31 (murine fibroblast - ATCC® CCL-163™), CHL-1 (human metastatic melanoma – ATCC, CRL-9446™), and B16-F10 cells were grown for 96 h in each specific nanofiber sample adsorbed with GA-AuNPs and incubated with 0.5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Next, the supernatant was carefully removed and formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Merck). The solution from each well was transferred to a clean 24 well plate and absorbance was mesuared using a microplate reader Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments). At least 3 independent assays were performed for each concentration. Data from cells exposed to adsorbed GA-AuNPs were compared to 0.4% GA. The nonparametric test Kruskal-Wallis statistic test was chosen to analyze the data as experimental “N” is considered small [75], and was followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant."
6,Results and discussion,
7,PVA/GA nanofibers preparation and characterization,"3.1 PVA/GA nanofibers preparation and characterization Electrospun nanofibers were produced from PVA/GA solutions. Padil et al in 2016 prepared nanofibers based on natural polysaccharides, including GA. It was demonstrated that 10 wt% PVA solution with GA in different ratios (70:30 to 90:10 PVA:GA) produced beadles nanofibers with uniform diameter [26]. However, we observed that 10 and 12 wt% PVA in the solution produced a great number of fibers with beads (data not shown). Homogenous and beadless nanofibers were obtained from 15 wt% PVA solution (Fig. 1A). Several parameters can influence nanofibers formation and morphology, such as environmental conditions (room temperature and humidity conditions) [19,76], as well as solution viscosity, polymer concentration, and electrospinning parameters [29,77] and these parameters may have influenced the difference found. Therefore, we chose the 15 wt% PVA solution with GA to continue this study (Fig. 1A). The electrospun nanofibers were observed under SEM. Fibers randomly distributed, were uniform in diameter, presented a smooth surface, and beads were rarely detected (Fig. 1B). Diameter varied from 148 to 303 nm with a mean diameter size of 227 nm (Fig. 1C). PVA and GA interact via hydrogen bonding which was reported to change the solution viscosity and consequently enhance electrospinnability producing uniform fibers [26]. FT-IR analysis was used to confirm PVA and GA interaction. The spectrum of blended PVA/GA fibers was compared to the spectrum of PVA fibers and GA at the same concentration, as no fibers were formed from GA solution (Fig. 1D). GA spectrum presented peaks at 3400 cm−1 related to OH stretching vibration and at 2933 cm−1 associated with alkyl stretching vibration. Peaks at 1610 cm−1 and 1417 cm−1 corresponding to COO- symmetric and asymmetric stretching, respectively, were also observed. Finally, peaks at 1140 cm−1 and 1062 cm−1 corresponding to C-O-C stretching vibrations were recorded. These represent the fingerprinting region of carbohydrates (ν = 1200-900 cm−1) of various sugar moieties present in the gums [78,79]. As this area is overlapped with the PVA spectrum bands it is difficult to detect exclusive GA peaks. The only selected peak was at 1610 cm−1 which is also present in PVA/GA spectrum confirming GA incorporation. Water-soluble polymers are of extreme value when producing nanofibers prospected for biomedical purposes. However, to prevent instant nanofibers solubility in an aqueous environment, different crosslinking methods are employed. Glutaraldehyde vapors, immersion in methanol, and temperature variations are reported techniques to stabilize PVA nanofibers [71,80]. To avoid the presence of toxic molecules, crosslinking based on temperature was preferred. Crosslinking temperature of 180 °C was based on previous article describing the best reticulation time and temperature for PVA nanofibers, resulting in highly stable nanofibers. Although the high temperature could affect GA structure, and consequently the nanofibers, neither FT-IR nor SEM analyses comparing heat-treated to non heat-treated nanofibers showed changes in GA FT-IR profile or damage to the nanofibers. Therefore, PVA/GA nanofibers were heat-treated, observed by SEM, and morphology and fibers diameter were analyzed. After 8 h at 180 °C the membranes color changed from white to caramel (Supplementary Fig. 1A) as previously described for PVA nanofibers [71]. No changes in morphology were detected (Fig. 2A), although a mean diameter size of 180 nm was found (Fig. 2B), probably due to loss of residual water.

PVA and PVA heat-treated nanofibers FT-IR spectra were used as control (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Besides the major peaks associated with PVA [81], an important peak was verified at 1093 cm−1, attributed to PVA crystallization, related to the -COOH stretching vibration. Also, the OH- deformation vibration peak at 1560 cm−1 decreased when compared with the non-heat treated PVA. After heat-treatment (Fig. 2C), a peak at 1140 cm−1 usually used as an assessment tool of PVA structure because of its semicrystalline synthetic nature [82] can be observed. Also, a peak at 1230 cm−1 related to the C–O–C group is observed. FI-TR was performed to confirm PVA crosslinking.

8,PVA/GA bare nanofibers in vitro biocompatibility,"3.2 PVA/GA bare nanofibers in vitro biocompatibility Biocompatibility is long known to be highly dependent on material surface and hydrophilicity [83,84]. As water or other biological fluid absorption may influence cells-material interaction PVA/GA nanofibers swelling behavior and its consequences on fibers weight and morphology were observed. Nanofibers incubation for 96 h resulted in high levels of water absorption, presenting a mean swelling degree of 950% (Supplementary Fig. 2C), indicating that the material is compatible with biological environment. When dried after the incubation period no weight loss or any difference in nanofibers morphology (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and diameter distribution (Supplementary Fig. 2B) were observed, indicating very good stability. PVA/GA nanofibers were also submitted to cell culture conditions and no changes on fibers morphology (Supplementary Fig. 2D) or membrane detachment were observed during the incubation period (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that PVA/GA nanofibers are a good candidate to be a biocompatible scaffold to cells growth.

Taken together these results indicate that PVA/GA nanofibers are a good candidate to be a biocompatible scaffold to cells growth. Next, to test the material applicability to in vitro tumor cells growth on nanofibers mimicking the 3D topography of extracellular matrix (ECM) pancreatic, mammary, and melanoma tumor cells types were used. Three-dimensional cultures using nanofibers manufactured in a controlled manner are excellent molds for normal and tumor cells growth [13,14], serving as a base to 3D model development for in vitro study stem cells and tissue regeneration [85–87], and cancer [17,88]. Therefore, cells were plated on coverslips containing the bare ECM-like PVA/GA nanofibers and were incubated under standard cell culture conditions for up to 96 h. Biological environments are rich in biomolecules that can potentially interact with nanomaterials creating a corona, and therefore interfering with cells interaction [89]. Consequently, nanofibers exposed to the biomolecule-rich cell culture media is subjected to this effect. However, all tested tumor cells were able to adhere and grow over time (Fig. 3 ), showing that the produced nanofibers submitted to biological environment is suitable to this purpose. Under SEM it was possible to observe that cells could interact with fibers (arrows - Fig. 3C), and proliferate on it (Fig. 3C.1), forming a monolayer. Standard morphological characteristics of MiaPaca-2, MCF-7, and B16-F10 were observed, indicating that the platform created is a cell culture-friendly ECM-like environment that can be used to monitor tumor cell growth over time."
9,PVA/GA nanofibers functionalization and GA-AuNPs delivery,"3.3 PVA/GA nanofibers functionalization and GA-AuNPs delivery Bare blended PVA/GA nanofibers were demonstrated to support tumor cells adhesion and growth (Fig. 3), therefore the next step was to investigate their treatment delivery ability. Ultrasmall GA-AuNPs synthesized by green chemistry were adsorbed onto the nanofibers and using RBTIC labeled GA-AuNPs it was possible to determine their incorporation. Intense RBTIC fluorescence was detected by CLSM (Fig. 4A). To confirm GA-AuNPs, SEM, and HADAAF - STEM images were obtained (Fig. 4B and C). GA-AuNPs were observed as bright dots onto nanofibers surface (arrows - Fig. 4B and C), distributed homogeneously along the fibers, corroborating the nanofibers functionalization with GA-AuNPs. Although some melanoma patients can benefit from immunotherapy and targeted drugs, unresponsive and/or late stages patients (2/3) are only left with chemotherapy option, which is highly cytotoxic and brings severe adverse effects [62,90]. Previous published results demonstrated that gold nanoparticles stabilized by GA (GA-AuNPs) directly decrease melanoma cells viability and growth without affecting non-tumoral cells [56]. In non-cytotoxic concentrations, it reduced key metastatic parameters of melanoma cells such as invasion and colony formation [74]. Therefore, here we incorporated GA-AuNPs to PVA/GA ECM-like nanofibers aiming to use this platform to deliver GA-AuNPs to melanoma cells grown in an ECM-like 3D environment. In our previous work, we have shown that B16-F10 melanoma cells internalized GA-AuNPs which explains its effects [74]. For this reason, we chose to use the same cell type to observe nanoparticles delivery. Following nanofibers decoration (24.4 mg/L RBTIC@GA-AuNPs), B16-F10 cells were able to internalize it, as seen by the presence of red fluorescence on the cytoplasm of the cells after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 4C). Actin filaments were stained (Fig. 4D) and those images overlay revealed cytoplasmic RBTIC@GA-AuNPs presence (Fig. 4E). Despite mutation burden of melanoma being one of the highest [90] among cancers, B16-F10 and CHL-1 are representative of triple-negative phenotype. Therefore, as a proof of concept, GA-AuNPs functionalized nanofibers were used to evaluate mitochondrial metabolism related to those cells' viability (MTT assay - Fig. 5A). Previous published data showed that 24.4 mg/mL GA-AuNPs decreased the viability of both B16-F10 and CHL1 murine and human melanoma cells, respectively [74], when compared to GA-AuNPs control (0.4% GA solution). Now, when the cells were grown in the blended PVA/GA ECM-like nanofibers functionalized with 2.44, 24.4, and 244 mg/L GA-AuNPs and compared to its respective control, the same pattern was observed, although statistical difference was observed solely for CHL-1 (Fig. 5C). Also, a non-tumoral fibroblast cell line (BALB/3 T3) was used to evaluate cells viability. No cytotoxicity was observed, similar to previous results where selectivity was detected [56]. This cell line was chosen in accordance to ISO 10993-5:2009 for testing in vitro cytotoxicity of medical devices [91]. No changes were observed in this cell line viability (Fig. 5D), in agreement with previous results [56]. The main objective of this study was to design a biomimetic in vitro platform that could contribute to drugs testing. Taking the results together, we could efficiently produce nanofibers of blended biocompatible polymers incorporated with green synthesized nanoparticles that proved to be effective to grow tumor cells and to delivery those nanoparticles to the cells. However, it is worth nothing that in our previous work we have shown that GA-AuNPs in non-cytotoxic concentrations were able to impair metastatic melanoma cells migration [74]. As nanofibers dressings can be prospected for a therapeutic application, the material described here presents a great potential in this area. Thus a more comprehensive study should be performed, including the functionalized-nanofibers ability to prevent melanoma cells migration both in vitro and in vivo."
10,Conclusion,"Despite great advances in cancer treatment, developing nanotechnology for biomedical application is of particular interest as this can potentiate diagnosis and therapeutics. Especially, in precision medicine were tailored treatments are advocated, improving in vitro tools that can anticipate patient response to a specific treatment is extremely useful. Here, we have demonstrated that an in vitro platform can serve not only as a non-cytotoxic biomimetic environment to proper cell growth but also as a nanocomposite delivery platform positively contributing to determine treatment efficacy. Importantly, triple-negative melanoma cells were used as a model, a genotype that does not respond to target therapy as it lacks the common driver mutations. Therefore, the described platform could be potentially used as an in vitro starting point to tailored treatment tests and further investigations towards its application in precision medicine of triple-negative metastatic melanoma should be investigated.
