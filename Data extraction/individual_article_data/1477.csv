0,Introduction,"Regarding the continual increase in energy resources, finding an eco-friendly renewable source is considered essential. Fuel cells have got a great consideration as a renewable energy solution that directly converts the chemical energy of small molecules into electricity. Thus, different materials are widely used as fuels for direct fuel cells, such as methanol, ethanol, urea, ethylene glycol [1–4]. Ethylene glycol (EG) has got great attention due to its lower toxicity, higher ignition point, cheapness, and non-volatility over other alcohols. Besides, the energy capacity of EG is ca. 20% higher than that of methanol [5]. Based on the structure of EG, the complete conversion of EG to CO2 evaluate ten e- per one molecule of alcohol, and the reaction can be expressed as follows Eq. 1 [6]: (1) (CH2OH)2 + 2 H2O ⇄ 2CO2 + 10 H+ + 10e− Noble metal surfaces such as Pt [7], Au [8], and Pd [9] were mainly used for EG electrooxidation. So, most of the researchers paid attention to investigate the EG electrooxidation over cheap surfaces or at least with surface modification of noble metal surfaces to reduce the cost without losing electrode activity [10–14]. For this, the Ni-based catalyst can offer an excellent alternative as a cheap and durable surface for EG electrooxidation in an alkaline medium. The electrooxidation of EG upon Ni-catalyst depends on the conversion of NiO to Ni(OH)2 in the presence of (OH-), where the activity of Ni-based catalyst is mainly dependent on the formation of active species of NiOOH as the following equation Eq. 2: (2) Ni ( OH ) 2 ( s ) + O H − ⇄ Ni OOH ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) + e − Marchionni et al. and Kannan et al. investigated new Ni-based catalysts for EG electrooxidation like Pd-Ni-Zn [15], Pt-Ni@Manganite [16], respectively. Electrochemical catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for Hydrogen production [17–21]. The Hydrogen evolution reaction plays a vital role in many technologies, including water electrolysis [22], metal electrodeposition [23], corrosion studies [24], and reduction of CO2 for fuel productions [25]. Additionally, nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 can synergistically affect HER in alkaline media that provide active sites for cleaving H-OH bonds [26–28]. Nickel-manganese binary catalyst is considered as a common electrocatalyst that has interesting properties for the electrooxidation process. Consequently, several Ni-Mn co-catalysts were reported for electrooxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions such as NiMn2O4 [29], NiMn carbides [30], Pt-Ni-Mn [31] for ethylene glycol electrooxidation. At the same time, other composites like Ni-Mn-P [32], Ni-Mn-graphite [33], Ni-S-Mn [34], Ni-Fe-Mn [35] were employed in hydrogen evolution reactions. However, the most accepted mechanism of the HER in alkaline media consists of the following three steps Eq. 3, 4 and 5: (3) H 2 O + e − ⇄ H ads + O H − ( Volmer step ) (4) H ads + H 2 O + e − ⇄ H 2 + O H − ( Heyrovsky step ) (5) 2 H ads ⇄ H 2 ( Tafel step ) In the first step (Volmer step), the water molecule is splitting on the catalyst surface, followed by hydrogen generation by either electrochemical process (Heyrovsky step) or chemical process (Tafel step) [36–40]. Since the decrease in the amount of catalyst used is the demanding point in the process, much effort was paid to find suitable catalyst support to increase the dispersion of catalyst, electrical conductivity, and stability of the catalyst on the surface. Carbon can efficiently work as catalyst support in fuel cell applications due to its cheapness, conductivity, and relative abundance [41]. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is widely used as catalyst support due to its superior properties, including extended surface area, high electrical stability, and excellent thermal and mechanical properties [42]. The RGO is considered as carbon support for energy-related applications like fuel cells [43,44], supercapacitors [45,46], batteries [47,48] and water splitting [49,50]. In this work, binary hydroxide of Ni-Mn was prepared by hydrothermal technique. The surface of the prepared electrocatalysts was characterized using several techniques, e.g., SEM, Raman, and XRD. Then a comparative study was performed to find out the efficiency toward EG electrooxidation using various modified electrodes of double hydroxide-reduced graphene oxide. The electrodes were tested for ethylene glycol electrooxidation and hydrogen evolution in a solution of KOH using the electrochemical techniques, e.g., cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. Some thermodynamics parameters of the prepared electrocatalysts were calculated from studying the dependence of the oxidation peak current on the temperature. The prepared electrocatalysts showed a remarkable activity towards both electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and the hydrogen evolution reaction."

Then the solution of pH was adjusted by ammonium hydroxide. The solution was transferred to 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, sealed and maintained at 140 °C for 6 hrs, then cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, the product was collected and washed with a water-ethanol mixture and dried in the oven overnight at 80 °C."
4,Preparation of nickel-manganese double hydroxides,"2.3 Preparation of nickel-manganese double hydroxides Nickel-manganese double hydroxide was prepared using a microwave-assisted sol-gel method. The precursors of NiMn were prepared by dissolving 0.262 g of NiSO4.6H2O and 0.169 g of MnSO4·H2O in 100 mL double-distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to be 10 using a solution of 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide. After that, the solution was exposed to microwave radiation with a power of 700 W for 10 min. The suspended particles were filtrated and washed several times with water and ethanol, then dried in an oven overnight at 80 °C. Finally, the as-prepared NiMn double hydroxide was characterized by XRD and mixed with RGO for further electrochemical measurements."
5,Preparation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO),"2.4 Preparation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) The graphene oxide was prepared using Hummer’s method [51]. The synthesized graphene oxide was reduced to graphene form chemically. In brief, graphite flakes powder was treated with 5% HCl in the early stage of preparation. Then, the solution was inserted into the ice bath where H2SO4 (98%) and KMnO4 were added carefully with stirring for two hrs. A solution of 30% H2O2 was diluted with distilled water for termination of the graphite oxidation reaction. Finally, the graphene oxide was collected using filtration and washed several times with 10% (HCl) solution to dissolve excess metal and salts. Sodium borohydride was then employed as a reducing agent for graphene oxide into graphene using the adopted method by Murat et al. [52]. Here, a certain weight of graphene oxide was sonicated in double-distilled water for two hrs. The pH value of this mixture was raised to 9–10 by adding drops of saturated Na2CO3 solution. NaBH4 solution was introduced drop by drop to the above mixture with constant stirring at an elevated temperature of 50 ºC for 24 hrs. The obtained graphene powder was then separated by filtration, washing, and drying at 40 ºC under vacuum."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The structure of β-Ni(OH)2 and NiMn double hydroxides catalysts were confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) by Panlytical X′Pert using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Ǻ). The structure and surface morphology of the electrocatalyst samples were investigated using Quanta FEG 250 (USA) instrument and an EDAX Unit (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyses) coupled to SEM with accelerating voltage 30 kV magnification 14 × up to 106 × and resolution for Gun). The samples were coated with a gold layer using an EMITECH k550x sputter coater to enhance SEM images’ resolution. The evidence of graphene oxide conversion to reduced-graphene oxide was utilized using Raman spectroscopy (Horiba-LABRAM HR Evolution) with laser wavelength (532 nm). The DSC analysis was performed using SHIMADZU DSC-60. The sample operation was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at an operating temperature range of 30–400 °C, where the sample was held in aluminum."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical properties of all prepared electrocatalysts were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques utilized by Autolab PGSTAT128N. The impedance spectrum was analyzed with electrochemistry software, NOVA (Version 2.1, Metrohm Autolab, and Utrecht, Netherlands). A Three-electrode cell was connected to the above potentiostat. It involved Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat.) as a reference electrode and Pt wire as an auxiliary electrode. Different composites of β-Ni(OH)2 and Ni-Mn double hydroxide electrocatalysts were cast on graphite electrodes of 5 mm diameter and 0.196 cm2 surface area with different strategies and used as working electrodes. A constant AC potential value was adjusted during the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements by applying an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range from 1 × 104 Hz to 0.1 Hz. The obtained data were fitted by using an electrochemical equivalent circuit with the NOVA program. All electrochemical studies were carried out in deaerated solutions at room temperature. The current density for each modified electrode was normalized using the electroactive surface area (ESA) estimated by the integrated area under the CV in 1.0 M KOH and calculated as 8.6, 11.3, 17.4, and 28.1 m2 g−1 for β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, RGO-NiMn, respectively."
8,Modification of graphite electrode with β-Ni(OH)2 and Ni-Mn double hydroxides,"2.7 Modification of graphite electrode with β-Ni(OH)2 and Ni-Mn double hydroxides Firstly four bottles of suspensions of 20 mg of β-Ni(OH)2, 20 mg NiMn double hydroxide, 20 mg of NiMn double hydroxide, and 10 mg of RGO, 10 mg of RGO were prepared and labeled as A, B, C, and D, respectively. Then the powders were dispersed in 1 mL of isopropyl alcohol, 1 mL double-distilled water, and 1 mL 5 wt% Nafion solutions with ultrasonic agitation for 20 min to prepare the ink. As represented in Scheme1, the first electrode was prepared by casting 50 μL of a bottle (A) ink, the second electrode by casting 50 μL of bottle (B) ink, the third electrode by casting 20 μL of the bottle (D) and 50 μL of the bottle (B) ink, and the fourth electrode by casting 50 μL of the bottle (C) ink. The modified surfaces were kept dry in a desiccator overnight. The four modified electrodes were denoted as (B-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn)."
9,Result and discussion,
10,Analysis,"3.1 Analysis The crystal structure of prepared nickel and manganese catalyst was characterized using XRD. as given in Fig. 1, the β-Ni(OH)2 have main characteristic peaks at 2ϴ values of 19.46, 33.4, 38.5, 52.2, and 58.8, which are indexed to the (001), (100), (011), (012), and (110) reflection planes, respectively, of β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No.14–0117) [53] the β-Ni(OH)2 exists in trigonal crystal structure with point group P3m1(164) (a= 3.165, b= 3.165, c = 9.354 Å). The NiMn double hydroxide was characterized using XRD, as given in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks were observed at 2ϴ values of 11.4, 22.3, 33.7, 38.9, 46.2, 60.2, 63.4 for corresponding planes of (003), (006), (012), (015), (110), (110), and (113), respectively [54]. XRD data was supported using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as illustrated in Fig. 2 (a-b). For β-Ni(OH)2, the DSC diagram showed one exothermic peak extended from 265 to 334 °C, where nickel hydroxide decomposition was observed (Fig. 2a). The enthalpy of nickel hydroxide was recorded as − 457.48 J g−1. Furthermore, the NiMn double hydroxide was studied as represented in Fig. 2b. The NiMn powder showed three exothermic peaks. The first peak at 123.9 °C (dH=−80.25 J g−1) corresponding to the evolution of water molecules incorporated in the double hydroxide crystals. The other two overlapped peaks at the temperature ca. 268 and 297 °C corresponding to the decomposition of double hydroxide to relative metal oxides. However, the enthalpy of the binary hydroxide decomposition equaled to − 29.6 and − 24.1 J g−1 for nickel and manganese hydroxides form, respectively. The prepared RGO was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, two bands were observed from the RGO sample; one at 1582 cm−1 (G-band) corresponding to the first scattering of E2g photon of sp2 carbon atom, while the second peak at 1335 cm−1 (D-band) that regards to the breathing mode of K-point phonons of A1g symmetry with ID/IG = 1.203. The morphology of the surface was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 4a, The image of a mixture of micro-hollow sphere NiMn double hydroxide and RGO, whereas the particle is appeared to be homogenous distribution with particle size in a range of 200–300 nm. Fig. 4b represented the higher magnification of the RGO that was physically mixed with NiMn composite to improve the catalytic power. Thus the sheet of RGO was observed on the surface of the electrode. Further, the elemental mapping was utilized for composite RGO-NiMn to determine the elemental distribution of Ni, Mn, C, and O overall the surface as shown in Fig. 5."
11,The electrochemical measurements of ethylene glycol electrooxidation,"3.2 The electrochemical measurements of ethylene glycol electrooxidation The electrochemical oxidation criteria of ethylene glycol in the basic medium were utilized using cyclic voltammetry for different prepared modified electrodes. Fig. 6 showed the cyclic voltammograms for the different modified electrodes (β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. However, the electrooxidation of a small organic molecule like ethylene glycol upon Ni-based catalyst depends on the formation of NiOOH active species followed by electrooxidation of adsorbed fuel molecule obeying the following equations Eq. 2' and 1': [55]. (2′) 6 Ni ( OH ) 2 ( s ) + 6 O H − ⇄ 6 Ni OOH ( s ) + 6 H 2 O ( l ) + 6 e − (1′) (CH2OH)2 + 2 H2O ⇄ 2CO2 + 10 H+ + 10e− Therefore, the electrocatalyst was first activated in 1.0 KOH using repeated 50 cycles with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 until the nickel (Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) redox peak current is reached to steady-state. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the CVs of the different modified electrodes in 1.0 M KOH in the absence of EG, only one redox peak appeared in the potential range (+300 to + 400 mV). The synergistic effect between Ni-Mn double oxides was observed by increasing the anodic oxidation current for ethylene glycol by a percentage of 40% compared with pristine β-Ni(OH)2. The addition of the RGO layer to the hydroxide layer as in RGO/NiMn increased the anodic current from 19 mA cm−2 to 27 mA cm−2 due to the high electrical conductivity of RGO that enhances the electron transfer step for the electrocatalysis process. Additionally, the physical mixture of RGO and double hydroxide (RGO-NiMn) showed superior activity towards EG due to the distribution of catalyst particles on available high extended surface areas. The onset potential was shifted towards more negative potential, indicating that the EG electrooxidation became more thermodynamically favored and faster at RGO-NiMn surfaces. Using RGO as carbon support for catalysis is regarding the high surface area and excellent electrical criteria. Two different methods studied the addition of RGO, first is by using two layers of RGO and NiMn composite (RGO/NiMn), and the second is a physical mixture of RGO and NiMn composite (RGO-NiMn). The electrochemical activity of our prepared modified electrode for EG electrooxidation was compared with the other prepared Ni-based composites. For enhancing the catalytic performance and decreasing the cost, a combination between precious metals and nickel was reported in the literature [56–58]. The electrochemical activity of our prepared modified electrode (38 mA cm−2) was found to be comparable with the results of other catalysts based on precious metals such as PdNiP (31.33 mA cm−2), Sulfonate-MWCNT- PdNi (35.3 mA cm−2), Pd0.25Mo0.75 (32 mA cm−2) [56–58]. López-Coronel et al. [59], reported Palladium and nickel nanoparticles, Pd70Ni30, as the most efficient catalyst for ethylene glycol electrooxidation in 2.0 M KOH (320 mA cm−2). The authors owed their superior result as the following “The improved activity was related to the enhancement of the electron transfer by the presence of Ni species. Thus, the development of more active materials should be address in the use of transition metal oxides/hydroxides that allow to provide oxygenated species, promoting a more efficient electron transfer” [59]. The study of electrooxidation of ethylene glycol is mainly related to many different applications. The concentration of EG is mainly responsible for the target application. Consequently, the electrooxidation of modified electrodes was performed in different EG concentration ranges (0.05 – 1.0 M). As seen in Fig. 7, the catalytic activity was studied by a CV of different concentrations at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The inset figure represents the linear relationship between EG concentration (mol L−1) and anodic oxidation current. However, the electrodes did not expose surface saturation until the concentration reached 1.0 M, whereas the generation of active sites after the oxidation process is considered adequate. The durability and stability of the electrodes were studied using constant potential chronoamperometry at EG oxidation potential (500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) for various surfaces, namely β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, RGO-NiMn in a solution of 1.0 M KOH containing 1.0 M EG for 2 hrs. Fig. 8 represented the chronoameperograms that reflect the NiMn composite’s high stability compared with Ni(OH)2 counterparts. Consequently, the activity of the following electrodes (β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn) was decreased by 19.2%, 16.2%, 10.7%, and 8.1%, respectively. Whereas the composites modified with RGO showed higher stability due to converting CO to CO2 over the graphene surface [60]. The double potential chronoamperometry technique was performed to estimate the diffusion coefficient (D) and rate constant (k). Fig. 9a showed the double potential chronoamperometry at the potential of 500 mV, and 350 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for different electrode surfaces carried out in (1.0 M EG + 1.0 M KOH) solution. In addition, the double chronoamperometry was carried out for the RGO-NiMn at different EG-concentrations ranges (0.05–1.0 M), as given in Fig. 9b. However, the Cottrell Eq. 6 is widely used for the potential controlled experiment to describe the relationship between the current and time as the following; [61]. (6) i = nFA C o D π t Where i: is anodic oxidation current, n: number of electron involved in the oxidation process (n = 6), F: Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1), A: the electrode surface area, C°: EG concentration (mol cm−3), D: diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), t: time of electrooxidation (s). The diffusion coefficient can be determined from the dependence of anodic peak current on t−1/2 as presented in Fig. 9(c-d). The values of D for each electrode and concentration were listed in Tables 1 and 2. The diffusion coefficient of the ethylene glycol molecule was found to have a small value due to the high intermolecular interaction (hydrogen bond) between the fuel and the solution. One of the principles studied by the double potential chronoamperometry is the rate constant (ks) of the modified surfaces at different concentrations of EG (Tables 1 and 2). Regards the following relation Eq. 7 [62]: (7) I C / I L = π 1 2 k C o t 1 / 2 Where Ic: the catalytic anodic current (A), IL: the electrode current in the absence of EG, C: initial EG concentration (mol cm−3), k: the rate constant of EG conversion (mol−1 L s−1), t: time of catalytic conversion (s). The rate constant was estimated by the slope of the relation between IC/IL vs. t1/2 (given in Fig. 9 (e-f)). As reported in Table 1, the rate constant was found to have various broad values for different surfaces, where the addition of RGO to double hydroxides composite leads to an increase in the rate constant of more than two folds. On the other hand, the change in the rate constant versus the EG concentration due to the small value of diffusion coefficient provided that a higher concentration of fuel increases the availability of EG near the electrode and diminishes the effect of diffusion difficulties. The activation energy was estimated for EG electrooxidation upon different composite β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn using chronoamperometry at different operating temperature range 10–50 °C. The activation energy was calculated using the following Arrhenius relation Eq. 8: (8) Log (I) = - 2·303 Ea/RT + Log A Where: I is anodic peak current (A), A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1), and Ea is the activation energy (J mol−1). Fig. 10 showed the linear relation between Log(I) versus 1/T (K−1). The activation energy of the EG was calculated as 5.183, 4.636, 3.813, 3.371 kJ mol−1 For β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn, respectively. The lowest value of activation energy of the RGO-NiMn electrode indicates the facility of oxidation compared with the other composite."
12,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),"3.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) The effect of changing the composite on the electrochemical behavior towards EG electrooxidation was studied using EIS spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 11a, Nyquist plots of each modified electrode (β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn) in a solution of 1.0 M of EG and 1.0 M KOH at the EG oxidation potential of + 500 mV. The diameter of semi-circles is matched with the data collected in CV, where the electrode with the highest activity, RGO-NiMn, exhibits the lowest value of charge transfer resistance (R2). Conversely, the high value of R2 of β-Ni(OH)2 agreed with its obtained lowest activity. The data of EIS was fitted with circuit (1) (inset Fig. 11a), and components values were listed in Table 3a as follows: In the circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, R1 is the charge transfer resistance, Q1 is the constant phase element of double layer, R2 is inner layer resistance, and Q2 is the constant phase element associated with the inner layer. However, the constant phase element is widely used to represent the capacitance to characterize the porous electrochemical system without surface homogeneity [63]. The charge transfer resistance, Rct, achieved by β-Ni(OH)2 was found to be 36.89 Ohm cm2. While the Ni-Mn double hydroxides EIS data were fitted with circuit 2 (inset Fig. 11a), in the circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, R1 is the charge transfer resistance, C1 is the capacitance of double layer, R2 is inner layer resistance, and C2 is the capacitance associated with the inner layer. The EIS fitting parameters for different Ni-Mn modified electrodes were reported in Table 3b, that the charge transfer resistances were matched with the electrochemical activity for each electrode. In Table 3b, Rct of the different prepared modified electrodes was found to be 29.05, 22.72, and 8.44 Ohm cm2 for NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn, respectively. That is proved the highest activity of the prepared modified electrodes than β-Ni(OH)2 toward the EG electrooxidation as a result of the electron transfer rate. Otherwise, the constant phase element is an EIS circuit element with a mathematical relation very similar to the capacitor, as represented in the following equation: Z = (1/Y0)/ (Jω)α The constant phase element describes as a capacitor when the constant Y 0 = C (the capacitance) and the exponent α = 1. The change in the EIS fitting element in Ni(OH)2 and NiMn regarded different compositions and catalyst distribution on the electrode surface [63–66]. The change in fuel concentration has a synergistic effect on electrochemical behavior. However, EIS was studied for the electrode with the best EG electrochemical oxidation value (RGO-NiMn) in a solution of 1.0 M KOH at a potential of 500 mV. Nyquist plots of different EG concentration range (0–1.0 M) are represented in Fig. 11b. As reported in Table 4, the charge transfer resistance of the surface decreases with increasing the concentration of EG due to the electrochemical oxidation process, where the lower charge transfer resistance indicates the faster electron transfer during the oxidation process [67]. The Rct obtained in the case of using 0.05 M EG was higher than that obtained in the case of using 1.0 M EG by ca. 2 folds. Else, the capacitance of the double-layer (C1) is directly proportional to the concentration of the EG. The dependence of charge transfer resistance on the electrolyte concentration as a logarithmic function was studied. As given in Fig. 11c, a linear relation was obtained with regression equation (R1 = −0.29 Log (EG Conc.) + 0.586), and a regression coefficient equals 0.9764."
13,Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),"3.4 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) The hydrogen evolution reactions over the modified nickel-based modified electrodes were performed using the linear sweep voltammetry in 1.0 M KOH, as given in Fig. 12a. The electrode modified with pristine β-Ni(OH)2 showed the lowest activity for HER compared with double hydroxide electrodes. The addition of RGO to double metal hydroxide enhanced the electrode’s performance owing to the amazing electronic criteria of the RGO. However, the current density of RGO-NiMn was ten folds higher than the pristine β-Ni(OH)2 at a potential − 600 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). The synergistic effect of RGO was often reporting to enhance the ability of the catalyst for hydrogen production like MoS2 [68], Cu2O [69], ReSe2 [70], and Cu3SnS4 [71]. However, the double hydroxides NiMn showed higher current density (8.3 mA cm−2) compared with the pristine β-Ni(OH)2 (3.9 mA cm−2), while the RGO modified electrode was found to have higher activity (RGO/NiMn (17.3 mA cm−2), RGO-NiMn (25.4 mA cm−2) at the potential of − 700 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) due to the extended surface area of graphene. Fig. 12b showed the galvanostatic stability of HER for 5 h in 1.0 M KOH solution at a current density equals 10 mA cm−2. However, the HER potential was established as − 750, − 700, − 670, and − 600 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn, respectively. The electrode showed high durability after five hours of the constant current experiment, whereas the addition of RGO to the composite was mentioned to enhance the long-time stability of HER [72–74]. The effect of changing the current density of HER was carried out for the electrode with the best results (RGO-NiMn). Fig. 12c, showed the long-time chronopotentiometry at current densities of 10, 20, 30, and 50 mA cm−2 and the output potential was recorded as − 600, − 720, − 790, − 830 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) respectively. On the other hand, the stability of the electrode was performed using constant potential chronoamperometry and potential of − 700 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 2 h, as given in Fig. 12d. The electrodes exhibit high stability toward hydrogen evolution reaction, showing partial current decreasing for two hours of continuous electrocatalysis. The decrease in HER current was calculated as 11.7%, 10.2%, 6.3%, and 5.9% for β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn, respectively."
14,Conclusion,"A nickel-manganese binary hydroxide was successfully prepared as a dual catalyst to enhance EG-electrooxidation and promote hydrogen evolution reactions. The catalyst shows unusual activity by mixing physically with reduced graphene oxide. The addition of graphene to the composite was studied by different strategies, i.e., layer by layer and physical mixture. The physical mixture of RGO and binary hydroxide achieved higher activity due to its higher surface area and electrical conductivity. The comparative study was carried out between pristine β-Ni(OH)2, NiMn, RGO/NiMn, and RGO-NiMn. The composite of RGO-NiMn exhibits higher activity and stability for EG electrooxidation and higher efficiency for hydrogen evolution reactions. The current density for RGO-NiMn is ca. three folds higher than β-Ni(OH)2 for EG electrooxidation and ten times better for hydrogen evolution at 400 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). The durability of the RGO-based composite was estimated by chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry, where the long-time stability was recorded for 5 hrs with a small insignificant decrement of ca. 6%."
