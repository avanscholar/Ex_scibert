0,Introduction,"In recent years, CO2 capture and conversion has attracted great interest by researchers due to the growing deterioration of climate and diminishing of fossil resources [1]. Therefore, much effort has been put forth to the capture and the transformation of CO2 into fuels and value-added chemicals [2,3]. Among the transformation of CO2, one attractive route is the hydrogenation of CO2 process, which can produce many kinds of fine chemicals such as methanol [4], hydrocarbon [5] and higher alcohols [6]. Although the CO2 hydrogenation has been extensively studied in the last decades, it still exists a large room to develop new catalytic routes for the transformation with high active and high selectivity [7,8]. Among these CO2 hydrogenated products, methanol contains high hydrogen weight content (12.5 wt%) and it is also a basic commodity chemical for the synthesis of aromatics, olefins (ethylene and propylene) and other chemicals [9]. The industrial methanol is produced from synthesis gas (CO + H2) with a small amount (<5%) of CO2 [10]. Catalysts that devoted to the methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation mainly bases on the modified catalysts for the synthesis of methanol from syngas including low pressure Cu/ZnO or high pressure ZnCrOx catalyst [11], noble-metal based catalysts [12,13], and others [14]. The hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol is exothermic reaction, but the competitive reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is endothermic process. Therefore, the hydrogenation of CO2 at low temperature and high pressure favors the formation of methanol from the thermodynamic viewpoint [15]. The widely studied zinc chromite catalyst (ZnCrOx) for the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol was generally performed at a relative high reaction temperature in the range from 350 to 410 °C [16] To improve the catalytic activity of the ZnCrOx catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol, a second metal such as Cu and Co were used as the co-active site low temperature [17]. In this bifunctional system, the metal sites facilitate the dissociation od H2 and the oxide supports primarily facilitate CO bond cleavage [18]. Cobalt based catalysts, which are well-known as an efficient catalyst for CC coupling-based reactions (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) would enhance the sustainability of CO2 hydrogenation [19]. In our precious previous study, partly reduced Co3O4 promotes the production of alcohol, however, metallic Co improves the production of methane in CO2 hydrogenation reaction [6]. In this paper, we prepare the Cu/ZnCr and Co-Cu/ZnCr catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol species in a fix-bed reactor. The effect of chemical composition of Zn/Cr, the content of Cu and Co are investigated. From the above works and systematic comparisons, we aim to produce a more comprehensive understanding of different component function for the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation ZnCr mixed oxide was prepared by the co-precipitation method. Briefly, 14.56 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 5.6 g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, 5.25 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O were first dissolved in 150 ml distilled water. Then 100 ml (NH4)2CO3 aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.1 M was added dropwise into the above solution at 70 °C with a rate of 2 ml/min, and then the mixture aged for 3 h at the same temperature. Then the precipitate was filtrated and washed by distilled water. The solid powder was dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in the air. The as-prepared support was denoted as ZnCr-3.5, in which 3.5 represents the molar ratio of Zn to Cr. Similarly, the other ZnCr-X supports were also prepared by the use of different molar ratio of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. Cu/ZnCr and Co-Cu/ZnCr catalysts were prepared via the impregnation method. 0.18 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 1 ml deionized water, and then the solution of Cu(NO3)2 was added in 1 g of ZnCr support. The product was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined in air at 400 °C for 4 h. The obtained catalyst was denoted as 10Cu/ZnCr. For the Co-Cu/ZnCr catalysts, 0.15 or 0.29 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O mixed with 0.18 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 2 ml deionized water, and then the solution was added in 1 g of ZnCr support. The other step was the same as the 10Cu/ZnCr catalyst. The prepared catalysts were denoted as 5Co-10Cu/ZnCr and 10Co-10Cu/ZnCr. The weight content of Cu was 10% in theory, the weight content of Co was 5% or 10% in theory."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an automated powder X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, Bruker-D8) using a Cu Ka radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the range of 10–80 with step size of 2°/min. The surface area and pore volume were measured by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption (77 K, quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-MS). The specific surface area was determined from the linear portion of the using standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) plot. The total pore volumes and the average pore sizes were calculated from the desorption branch of the adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) formula. Before the adsorption measurements, the sample was degassed at 350 °C under vacuum for 3 h. H2-temperature program reduction (H2-TPR) was experiments were carried out using AMI-200 from Zeton Altamira Company. For each measurement, about 100 mg of the catalyst was placed in a quartz tube reactor and outgassed at 150 °C at a ramp rate of 10°/min under Ar stream with 30 ml/min for 1 h to remove traces of water. After cooling to 50 °C, the sample was heated from 50 °C to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar (30 ml/min)."
4,Typical procedure of CO2 hydrogenation,"2.3 Typical procedure of CO2 hydrogenation All catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed stainless steel mini-reactor (length of 53 cm and inside diameter of 8 mm). The mixture gas (22.5% CO2, 67.5% H2 and 10%N2) were used without further purification. The pressure of the reactor was controlled with a backpressure regulator. For each experiment, the catalyst (0.2 g) was mixed with 0.2 g of silica, and then reduced at 300 °C (2 °C/min of ramping rate) for 2 h with H2 flow rate of 20 ml/min at atmosphere pressure. After the reduction, the temperature was cooled down to room temperature and the system was pressurized to 2 MPa by feeding mixture gas at 20 ml/min. The catalyst was kept for 50 h at 250 °C or 300 °C and GHSV = 6 L h−1gcat −1. The gas products were analyzed on line by Agilent GC3000 gas chromatography (thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors). The liquid product was collected in cold trap and analyzed by 4890 gas chromatography (flame ionization detectors) off line. The reaction parameters of CO2 conversion, selectivity and space time yield (STY) are defined as (where MeOH refers to methanol).

5,Results and discussion,"The X-ray diffraction patterns of the ZnCr supports and the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively. The XRD patterns of ZnCr-0.875 (Fig. 1) show the peaks with 2θ at 30.3°, 35.7°, 57.5°, and 63.1°, which were assigned to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) crystalline planes of ZnCr2O4 (JCPDS Card No. 22-1107). With the increase of Zn content, the main diffraction peak gradually shifted from 35.7 to 36.2°, which should be attributed to the appearance of the ZnO crystalline. It was reported that the peaks with 2θ around 36.2° and 56.6° were assigned to the (1 0 1) and (1 1 0) crystalline planes for ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 36-1451). As shown in Fig. 2, the diffraction peaks of ZnO become more obvious after the impregnation of Cu (Fig. 2). This indicates that some ZnO dissociated from ZnCr2O4 with the assist of Cu. Compared with the supports, two additional peaks with the 2θ value centering at 35.5° and 38.7° were correspond to the (0 0 2) and (1 1 1) crystalline planes of CuO (JCPDS Card No. 45-0937). The size of CuO was calculated from the XRD peak (38.7°) widths using the Scherrer equation, and the calculated crystallite sizes of CuO were 27.5 nm, 30.6 nm, 35.2 nm for the three 10Cu/ZnCr-0.875, 10Cu/ZnCr-1.75 and 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalysts, respectively. The N2 absorption isotherms of both the ZnCr supports and the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts are shown in Fig. S1. All of them have Type-IV reversible isotherms, which were the characteristics of the mesoporous structure. The surface area, pore diameter and total pore volume of all samples were observed to decrease with the increase of Zn content, and then increased by the further increase of Zn content. Compared with ZnCr supports, the surface area and pore volume of the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts greatly decreased, which should be due to the loading of CuO nanoparticles in the pores of the ZnCr supports (Table 1 ). The reduction ability of ZnCr and 10Cu/ZnCr were then studied by H2-TPR method (Figs. 3 and 4 ). The main reduction peak at 289 °C and the small reduction peak at about 350 °C were observed in H2-TPR profile of the ZnCr-3.5 catalyst, which resemble to the reduction of ZnCr2O4 and ZnO particles on the surface [20]. Interestingly, the reduction peak shifted to lower temperatures with the decrease of Zn content. As far as the reduction peaks of the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts (Fig. 4), all of them demonstrates a new reduction peak at low temperature, and this peak was attributed to the reduction of CuO phase along with the support in the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts [21]. This reduction peak shift from 230 °C for the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst to 220 °C for the 10Cu/ZnCr-1.75 and 10Cu/ZnCr-0.875 catalysts, which suggested that the interaction between Cu and the ZnCr-3.5 support in the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst was stronger than the others. The catalytic performance of the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts were evaluated by the hydrogenation of CO2. Fig. 5 shows CO2 conversion during the 50 h test, which reveals that CO2 conversions over the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts were almost the same around 11% at the 250 °C. Only methanol and CO were detected as the products with the hydrogenation of CO2. No other hydrocarbons were identified. The results indicated that the 10Cu/ZnCr catalysts demonstrated the catalytic activity towards both reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) and the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. The selectivity of MeOH decreased from 48% over the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst to 28% over the 10Cu/ZnCr-0.875 catalyst (Table 2 ). The highest space time yield (STY) of MeOH was obtained in 3.2 mmol gcat −1h−1 over the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst. The Cu/ZnCr catalysts had similar physical structure and Cu dispersion, which indicated that the production selectivity might be related to the chemical properties of the supports. It seems that some dissociated ZnO in 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 increased the interaction between Cu and the ZnCr support, which inhibited the reverse water gas shift reaction, and thus improved the production of methanol. Tisseraud and co-workers have also found that the increase of the surface Zn concentration enhanced the methanol selectivity during the hydrogenation of CO2 [22]. It should be pointed out that our prepared 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst demonstrated better catalytic performance towards the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol than the reported Cu based catalysts (Table 3 ), which achieved a much high value of STY of methanol under low pressure. The low reaction pressure was more suitable for the industrial application. To further improve the selectivity of methanol, the addition of Co into the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst was also prepared. The morphology of the 5Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 and 10Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalysts and the particle size distribution were characterized by TEM technology (Fig. S2). TEM images reveal that most of Cu and Co nanoparticles dispersed homogeneously on the ZnCr-3.5 support. The weight percentage of Cu and Co were detected by EDS method (Table S1), which were similar as the content in theory. The molar ratio of Zn to Cr was nearly to 1:2, which indicated that most of Zn and Cr existed in the form of ZnCr2O4. The XRD patterns of 10Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 display three new peaks with 2θ at 31.3°, 36.8° and 59.3°, which were assigned to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (5 1 1) crystalline planes of Co3O4 (JCPDS Card No. 43-1003) (Fig. 6 ). In addition, it was observed that the XRD peak intensity of the dissociated ZnO decreased with the increase of Co content. The H2-TPR results of three catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The main peak at 220 °C and an accompanied peak at 360 °C are noted for the 5Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst. The main peak shifted to 225 °C with the increase of Co content, and the peak at 360 °C became more obvious in 10Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5. Similar H2-TPR results were also reported by Pierro and co-workers. [25]. The reduction peak at the low temperature was corresponded to the simultaneous reduction of Co3O4, CuO and Co1−xCuxCo2O4 phases to CoO and Cu. The high temperature peak was attributed to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co. Our early results indicated that metallic Co improved the production of methane in CO2 hydrogenation reaction, but partly reduced Co3O4 promoted the production of alcohols [6]. Melaet et al. also found that TiO2 supported Co catalysts with an oxidized state, was superior to the metallic state of Co for the hydrogenation of CO2 [26]. Based on the above analysis, the temperature of the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol was set at 300 °C for the Co-Cu/ZnCr catalysts in the following experiments. The CO2 conversion and the product selectivity over the three representative catalysts are shown in Table 4 . Compared with results listed in Table 2, CO2 conversion increased and the selectivity of methanol decreased with the increase of reaction temperature. It should due to the fact that CO2 hydrogenation into methanol is exothermic reaction, and thus low temperature favored the formation of methanol from the thermodynamic viewpoints. After the addition of Co with the percentage of 5%, CO2 conversion dropped slightly, but the product selectivity changed drastically. The selectivity of CO decreased greatly from 68.9% to 12.9% over the 5Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst. On the meanwhile, the selectivity of methane increased from zero to 50.3%. Besides the formation of C1 product, higher hydrocarbons (ethane, propane and butane) and higher alcohols (ethanol, propyl alcohol and butanol) were produced due to the CC coupling activity of Co. The CO selectivity decreased and CH4 selectivity increased by the further with the increase of Co content to 10%. The methanol selectivity decreased with the addition of Co. The 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst gave the highest STY of methanol among three catalysts (4.7 mmol/gcat/h), followed by the 5Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst with 3.4 mmol/gcat/h, the 10Co-10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst with 1.9 mmol/gcat/h. This is due to the high activity of Co towards the hydrogenation of CO2 into methane. According to the above results, we can conclude that the addition of Co promoted the subsequent hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbon and alcohols, but metallic Co increased the selectivity of methane at the expense of the decrease of the methanol selectivity."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, series of Cu/ZnCr catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method, and the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 demonstrated the best catalytic performance towards the CO2 hydrogenation into methanol. The methanol could be produced in a high yield of 4.7 mmol/gcat/h over the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst. The ratio of Zn/Cr was found to have a great effect on products selectivity without the change of CO2 conversion. XRD results confirmed the existence of some dissociative ZnO in the 10Cu/ZnCr-3.5 catalyst. The dissociative ZnO increased the interaction between Cu and ZnCr2O4, and improved the generation of methanol. Furthermore, the addition of Co decreased the selectivity of CO drastically, but greatly increased the selectivity of methane at the expense of the decrease of the methanol selectivity."
