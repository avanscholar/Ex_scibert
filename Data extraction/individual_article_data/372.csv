0,Introduction,"Throughout all the decades, hydrogen (H2) has played an outstanding role in the chemical industry mainly as feedstock for ammonia and methanol synthesis (27 %), in refineries for hydrocracking and hydrothermal treatment of oil streams (17.5 %), and even in the steel industry (1 %) [1,2]. Recently, H2 has been considered as an alternative to decarbonize the energy sector since it could be used as feedstock to supply electricity by using fuel cell (FC) devices ascribed to its high efficiency and low pollutant emissions [3]. Decarbonization of the energy sector by using H2 depends on the pathway conversion and the biomass source [4]. Currently, steam methane reforming (SMR) is the cheapest alternative to produce H2 with high efficiencies in comparison to other pathways such as alkaline electrolysis and biomass gasification [5]. However, SMR contributes to about 830 Mt of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, which represents 2.2 % of the global CO2 fossil production (i.e., 37,887 Mt yr−1) [6]. Hence, biofuels must be considered to replace methane as feedstock to produce H2 by steam reforming. Thermodynamically, alcohols are more reactive than hydrocarbons and, consequently, H2 yield is higher when alcohols are reformed [7]. Among alcohols, bioethanol has been regarded as a suitable alternative to produce H2 by steam reforming since it is highly produced worldwide, is a free-sulfur renewable source, and the infrastructure is highly available in countries such as Brazil, USA, and Colombia [8,9]. H2 production from bioethanol encompasses 3 main stages: (i) bioethanol production; (ii) bioethanol purification; and (iii) biofuel processor, which comprises ethanol steam reforming (ESR), gas treatment, and purification [10,11]. The purified H2 could be fed into a FC to produce power for a wide variety of applications. Technical analysis of reformer units reveals that about 1.54 L h−1 of ethanol will produce 0.123 kg h−1 of H2 [12]. Besides, hydrous ethanol is preferred than anhydrous ethanol for producing H2 by ESR since energy savings in the distillation units could be accomplished [13,14]. Several catalysts, such as CoPt/CeO2–ZrO2–Al2O3 [15], Ni/La2O3–Al2O3, Ni/CeO2–La2O3 [16], RhPt/CeO2, and RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 [17,18] has been tested to convert bioethanol into H2 by ESR. However, the presence of impurities on hydrous bioethanol, such as fusel alcohols, acetic acid, esters, and sulfur compounds, limits the H2 production during ESR [19]. For instance, Rass-Hanssen et al. [20] assessed the effect of two different distillation fractions on the H2 production by ESR over Ru/MgAl2O3 at 400 °C, pointing out that catalyst deactivated faster when higher amount of impurities were presented in the bioethanol sample. Sanchez et al. [21] reported similarly results during ESR of bioethanol samples coming from sugarcane press-mud over RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 at 700 °C. Recently, Cifuentes et al. [22] showed that H2 yield is higher in the absence of impurities during ESR over monoliths washcoated with RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 at 700 °C. The effect of impurities has not only a clear effect on the ESR, but also in the overall yield on the biofuel processor. Indeed, the reduction of bioethanol impurities by almost 27 % would increase the H2 production by 31 % [23]. The impurities production during biomass fermentation is closely associated with the biomass source [19]. Hence, differences in the biomass composition will lead to different ethanol profiles and consequently different H2 yields. For instance, the overall yield of H2 by ESR from wood bioethanol was 0.83 g H2 kg−1 biomass; whereas it was higher than 2.1 g H2 kg−1 from sugarcane press-mud [16,21]. Environmentally, H2 production from bioethanol by ESR has a higher carbon footprint than other technologies such as biomass gasification, wind electrolysis, and solar electrolysis. The environmental impact of ESR of bioethanol is closely associated with the biomass feedstock. For instance, ESR of bioethanol coming from corn and wheat straw has a lower and higher carbon footprint than SMR, respectively [24]. Concerning the conversion of ethanol into H2, life cycle assessment (LCA) showed that both autothermal steam reforming (ATR) and ESR of bioethanol present similar environmental impact to produce 1 kg H2. For instance, global warming potential (GWP) for ATR and ESR was 8.8 kg CO2-eq and 9.2 kg CO2-eq, respectively [25]. The main hotspot for producing H2 by ESR is the bioethanol stage production due to the large amount of heat required to purify the bioethanol by distillation [26,27]. Distillation has a high energy cost, commonly accomplished by fossil heat sources such as coal, rising the pollutants emissions [28]. According to literature review, flash distillation has been regarded as a suitable alternative to purify bioethanol for its further conversion to H2 by ESR, because heat consumption could be minimized [7,20,29–31]. However, the main drawback of flash distillation lies on the low ethanol purity and recovery that would limit the production of H2 by ESR. Hence, other purification technologies should be analyzed as alternatives to purify bioethanol for its further conversion into H2 by ESR. Herein, we considered two other alternatives to purify bioethanol. On the one hand, a mash column was considered, which is commonly used in sugar mills to concentrate the fermentation broth from 8 wt% to ca. 46 wt% [32,33]. This concentration is appropriate to carry out the ESR, which stoichiometrically requires a molar steam/ethanol ratio (S/E) ≥ 3. The main advantage of mash column is that removes harsh impurities such as sulfur compounds that have a detrimental effect on ESR [19]. On the other hand, bioethanol can be purified by a distillation train system, formed by a mash column and a rectification unit; this configuration is commonly used to produce absolute ethanol (i.e., 96 wt%). Using a distillation train will guarantee that mostly of the volatile impurities are removed, but with an elevated energy cost and the need to add extra water to adjust the S/E ≥ 3. However, the main benefit of this configuration is its high technology readiness level. Based on the above, this paper aims to give insights on the most appropriate process configuration to produce power from residual biomass, combining technical and environmental assessments, and to determine the main environmental hotspots within the life cycle for producing H2 from residual biomass by ESR. To do so, firstly, the process flow diagram to produce H2 from biomass for its further conversion into power is shown. Afterwards, technical analysis, in terms of yield and energy efficiency, and environmental impacts (e.g., global warming potential, acidification potential) are presented to ease the selection of the purification technology. Then, a contribution analysis is displayed to determine the main hotspot within the life cycle for producing H2 by residual biomass. Finally, environmental benefits of using biomass instead of sugarcane molasses are described."
1,Methodological approach,"In this study, LCA was selected as the methodology to quantify the environmental impacts. LCA follows the ISO 14040/14044 guidelines, where the environmental impact of inputs and outputs were quantified. The following steps were considered: (i) Goal and scope definition, (ii) inventory analysis, (iii) impact assessment, and (iv) interpretation. LCA was performed in OpenLCA V1.9 (GreenDelta, Germany). In the upcoming sections, we explain each of those stages related to the impact assessment of power production in a low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC) from sugarcane press-mud."
2,Goal and scope definition,"2.1 Goal and scope definition The aim of this study is to compare the environmental performance of the power production from sugarcane press-mud by using three different alternatives to purify bioethanol. Likewise, environmental results were compared with the use of first-generation, anhydrous ethanol from sugarcane molasses as feedstock to produce power in a biofuel processor coupled with a LT-PEMFC (also named as fuel ethanol in the results). The solid fraction of sugarcane press-mud was used as feedstock to produce heat to cover the energy demand of the biofuel processor. While for upgrading first-generation, anhydrous ethanol into power, natural gas was used to supply the heat demand, as commonly reported [11]. This study is based on the Colombian conditions employing sugarcane press-mud obtained from small facilities located in the Andean region. The functional unit was set to 1 kWh of power generated in a H2-LT-PEMFC. The power produced could partially substitute the energy yielded in a diesel engine, which is the common alternative to produce power in rural areas [34]. Fig. 1 a shows the system boundaries based on the cradle-to-gate approach, which includes the inputs obtained from the nature and its further transformation in the technosphere [35]. System boundaries include the following foreground stages: bioethanol production (P1), bioethanol purification (P2), H2 production (P3), and power production (P4). Besides, the manufacturing of auxiliary chemicals, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), peptone, yeast extract, and catalyst synthesis, were included within the system boundaries. Transportation of raw materials from the production site to the power plant was also considered. Three scenarios were compared: Scenario 1, which uses a flash distillation unit to purify raw bioethanol; Scenario 2, which uses a mash column; and Scenario 3, which uses a rectification train formed by two columns. In all scenarios, the raw bioethanol was purified until an S/E = 3. For Scenario 3, absolute ethanol (⁓96 wt%) was mixed with water to adjust the S/E = 3. Each Scenario produced an ethanol stream with different impurities profiles which affect ESR [21]. The best scenario was compared with the production of power in a LT-PEMFC by using first-generation, anhydrous ethanol derived from sugarcane molasses as feedstock. Fig. 1b shows the system boundaries to produce power from first-generation, anhydrous ethanol that includes H2 production and purification followed by power generation. Multiple outputs in the process complex LCA. Commonly, when processes have multiple outputs streams, environmental burdens must be allocated to the co-product of the system. According to ISO 14041, allocation should be avoided by either system division or system expansion. Fig. 1a shows that one co-product is obtained in the P1: Raw bioethanol production, in the step of sugarcane press-mud pretreatment, called mud [21]. This residual biomass is obtained by sieve separation after the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud at 130 °C for 1 h. Proximal analysis of this residual biomass shows that volatile matter is 82.8 % [36], and therefore, it could be potentially used as feedstock to produce biogas [37]. Hence, mud was converted into biogas and upgraded to biomethane, which we used as fuel to supply heat to both ESR and distillation by using a burner. The remaining biomethane could be used to avoid the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking in rural areas, which is the 40 % of this energy in Colombia [38]. Similarly, digestate, obtained as by-product during anaerobic digestion, was considered to avoid the production of nitrogen fertilizer such as ammonium nitrate. On the one hand, substitution of LPG was done based on the lower heating value (LHV) of biomethane (i.e., 41.5 MJ kg−1) and LPG (i.e., 46.6 MJ kg−1) according to Eq. (1). On the other hand, substitution of ammonium nitrate was done based on the nitrogen content according to Eq. (2). (1) m LPG = m Biomethane LHV biomethane ∗ w methane LHV LPG (2) m NA = 80 ∗ m Digestate ∗ w solid ∗ w N 28"
3,Limitations and assumptions,"2.2 Limitations and assumptions Limitations and assumptions are also determining in the decision-making process. The main assumptions to perform the LCA are shown as follows: • Sugarcane press-mud is an agroindustrial product with low revenue. Hence, we employed the zero-burden approach [39,40]. • Power grid was modelled according to the electricity grid of the Andean region in Colombia based on government reports, as shown in the Data in Brief. • Life Cycle Inventory of bioethanol production (P1, in Fig. 1) was gathered from experimental data. In addition, the effect of bioethanol impurities over H2 production was obtained from previous reports [21]. • Power production was assumed to occur close to the facilities where it is possible to collect sugarcane press-mud. Therefore, transportation distance of biomass was assumed to be 30 km. • Most of the auxiliary materials were imported. Hence, transportation routes were split in three sections. The first one from the factory to the harbor by rail train. The second one, from harbor to harbor by transoceanic ship. And the last one, from harbor to the power facility by lorry. Land and overseas transportation distances were calculated based on expected road-transport and sea-transport distances, respectively. • Infrastructure was not considered within the system boundaries because the environmental impacts per process unit is negligible in comparison with the production process [41]. • LCI of catalysts were build based on laboratory conditions. The synthesis process for both RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 and AuCuO/CeO2 were retrieved from previous studies conducted in our research group [17,42]. Catalyst lifetime was assumed to be 1 year [43]. • Lifetime of the LT-PEMFC was assumed to be 32,000 h according to Ecoinvent V3.4. Transportation of the fuel cell was assumed to be done from Portland (USA) to Colombia through freight ship (average distance of 7395 km). • Biogas production from mud was simulated in Aspen Plus based on the theoretical biogas potential and the ultimate analysis [44]. Besides, biogas upgrade to biomethane was performed by simulation in Aspen Plus, as shown in the Data in Brief. • Biomethane was adiabatically burned, along with the off gas from the PSA unit and the unconverted H2 from the LT-PEMFC, to produce a hot gas stream that is used preheat the bioethanol stream and to cover the energy demand of the ESR process. • 5 % biogas leakage during anaerobic digestion was assumed, based on a study performed under Colombian conditions [38]. • Heat consumption during biogas production was calculated based on the moisture content of the feedstock [45]. • The digestate, a co-product obtained from the anerobic digestion of wastes, was considered as an avoided product since it can be used as nitrogen fertilizer. • CO2, CO, and CH4 were considered as biogenic emissions since they are derived from biomass."
4,Life Cycle Inventory and system description,"2.3 Life Cycle Inventory and system description In the life cycle inventory (LCI) phase, inputs and outputs information to fulfill 1 kWh power was gathered. Two kind of data can be distinguished, background and foreground. Background data is the data associated with the production of generic materials, energy, transport, and waste management. While foreground data is required to modelling the process for the specialized product [46]. Herein, background data was obtained from Ecoinvent database V3.4 (Ecoinvent, Switzerland) and foreground data were acquired from both experimental tests and simulation results at a laboratory scale. Simulation was performed in Aspen Plus V.9 software (Aspentech, Bedford, MA, USA) according to Fig. 2 and using the non-random two liquid with Redlich-Kwon (NRTL-RK) as thermodynamic package. The simulation includes the conversion of bioethanol coming from sugarcane press-mud into power in a LT-PEMFC. Calculator blocks and Design specs, along with FORTRAN statements, were employed along the simulation to determine key parameters in the simulation, such as water consumption and H2 production on ESR. Convergence methods in the simulation includes the Secant method with 30 iterations for single design specs and for multiple design specs the Newton convergence method with 30 iterations was employed. The bioethanol composition was retrieved from previous works performed by our research group [47]. The simulation was split in five stages: bioethanol purification, syngas production, H2 purification, power production in a LT-PEMFC, and biomethane combustion, as briefly explained in the upcoming sections. Mass and energy balances were collected from the simulation results and used to build LCI. Detailed information about simulation is shown in the Data in Brief. Data from the ethanol production from sugarcane was obtained from Ecoinvent V3.4, while production of power from first generation, anhydrous ethanol was estimated in Aspen Plus, as shown in Section 2.2.5. In the upcoming sections, main stage processes are briefly described, as well as the data sources employed to model each of the stages portrayed in Fig. 1. Detailed information of LCI and simulation description for all the main stages are described in the Data in Brief. 2.3.1 Raw bioethanol production Raw bioethanol is produced by pretreatment and subsequent fermentation of the hydrolysates. Input data used to produce raw bioethanol from sugarcane press-mud was experimentally obtained from previous work [21]. Moreover, input data to model the production of dry yeast was retrieved from the literature [48]. 2.3.2 Bioethanol purification Raw bioethanol, obtained from sugarcane press-mud, can be purified by using three different technologies, as described in Section 2.1 . The composition of the raw bioethanol was obtained from our previous work [21]. Firstly, Fig. 2a shows that bioethanol is purified in a flash drum, modelled as FLASH2 module in Aspen Plus. Design specs were used to calculate the proper conditions of the flash unit to warrant an S/E = 3. Secondly, Fig. 2b shows that bioethanol is purified in a mash column (T-101, in Fig. 2b). Finally, Fig. 2c shows that bioethanol is purified in distillation train system formed by a mash (T-101, in Fig. 2c) and rectification columns (T-REC, in Fig. 2c). T-101 and T-REC are multi-stages distillation systems that operates at 1 atm with 24 and 58 equilibrium stages, respectively. Pressure drop and efficiency of both columns were calculated based on heuristics rules. Both columns were modelled using a RADFRAC module in Aspen Plus, which is a rigorous method for simulating multi-stage vapor-liquid fractionating operations [49]. The solving method for RADFRAC units was the Standard convergence method with 25 iteration for T-101 and the Strongly non-ideal liquid convergence method with 50 iterations for T-REC. The Standard convergence employed the method of Boston and Britt while the Strongly non-ideal liquid convergence used a modification of the Boston and Britt method. FORTRAN statements were employed to adjust the vapor inlet to warrant an S/E = 3 in the distillate stream of the T-101. 2.3.3 Biofuel processor unit to hydrogen production H2 production from bioethanol (S/E = 3) with traces of impurities were simulated according to the flowsheet shown in Fig. 2 and based on experimental results obtained at laboratory scale. Briefly, bioethanol is fed to a steam reforming reactor at 700 °C to obtain syngas by using a RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 catalyst. This reactor was modelled using a RGIBBS module in Aspen Plus (R-101, in Fig. 2) which minimizes the Gibbs free energy to calculate the equilibrium compositions [50]. Since impurities have an outstanding effect on the H2 yield, a CALCULATOR block, using an Excel flowsheet, was employed to include a linear empirical model of the effect of impurities on ESR [21]. Syngas is a mixture mainly formed by H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. CO must be removed if LT-PEMFC is used as device to produce power. Hence, CO is initially removed by using Au–CuO/CeO2 as catalyst at 260 °C. In this catalytic reactor, CO conversion is complete, but some H2 is consumed [42]. Similar to the ESR reactor, the CO-PROX reactor was modelled using a RGIBBS subroutine in Aspen Plus. In this case, a CALCULATOR block with FORTRAN statements were employed to calculate the CO and H2 production based on CO and H2 conversion at the reaction conditions. Those models were retrieved from our previous work [51]. Since laboratory conditions were used to build LCI, we considered the use of nitrogen as carrier gas to perform both ESR and CO-removal. Catalysts are key in the biofuel processor; thus, the synthesis of the catalysts were modelled according to the guidelines stated by Ecoinvent and data from laboratory conditions [17,51,52]. CO removal is an exothermic reaction and to keep isothermal conditions, the bioethanol stream was used to control the reaction temperature [53]. After CO removal, condensation steps are carried out to remove water from the gas. Dry gas is then sent to a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) to obtain H2 at 99.99 vol%, which is suitable to be fed to a LT-PEMFC. Input conditions to simulate PSA in Aspen Plus were retrieved from Galera et al. [54]. Besides, the amount of adsorbent required to clean the gas was obtained from literature [55,56]. Leaving gas from the PSA unit is sent to a burner to produce energy, which is used to heat up the reforming unit, as it is commonly done in commercial processes [10]. Pure H2 is then sent to the LT-PEMFC to produce power. 2.3.4 Power production in LT-PEMFC Power production in LT-PEMFC was modelled in Aspen Plus along with an Excel flowsheet to calculate the fuel cell voltage and power. As shown in Fig. 2, LT-PEMFC was modelled by using a separator and a RGIBBS that represent the anode and the cathode, respectively. LT-PEMFC was modelled for a Ballard's fuel cell. Ballard is known to be one of the biggest company in the production of FC for a wide variety of applications [57]. A CALCULATOR block with Excel flowsheet was employed to determine the power produced in the LT-PEMFC. Operating conditions such as temperature and H2 usage were selected according to literature. Internal air-cooled system was assumed. This kind of cooling method is commonly employed for low power production (i.e., <4 kW), where air commonly enters with a stoichiometric feed rate of 20 [58]. 2.3.5 Biomethane production from mud Biomethane is obtained through the upgrade of biogas produced during the anaerobic digestion of agroindustrial wastes. Herein, a theoretical approach was employed based on the ultimate analysis of the mud derived from the pretreatment [36]. The highest methane production was observed when mud is diluted until a solid concentration of about 10 % [37,59]. Hence, mud was initially diluted in water until the desired concentration. Anaerobic digestion of mud produces biogas and digestate. Biogas up-grading was performed by high pressure water scrubbing due to is low operational cost and the fact that is a simple and easy technology to maintain [60]. While the digestate was considered as an avoided product, as previously stated in Section 2.1.1 . Aspen Plus was used to simulate the biogas production. Biomethane was also employed to produce power in a Rankine cycle. The power produced in the Rankine cycle was used to cover the power during biomethane production. The resulting biomethane was adiabatically burned in a RGIBBS reactor (Furnace, in Fig. 2), along with the output gas and the unconverted H2 from the PSA and LT-PEMFC units, respectively. The amount of biomethane required was calculated using the design specification tool, in Aspen Plus, to produce an output stream at 100 °C (EM-OUT, in Fig. 2). Detailed information about simulation of biogas is shown in Data in Brief. 2.3.6 Power from first generation, anhydrous ethanol Fig. 3 shows the aspen flowsheet to produce power in a LT-PEMFC by using first generation, anhydrous ethanol as feedstock. Noteworthy differences between power production from anhydrous ethanol (Fig. 3) and sugarcane press-mud (Fig. 2) are the feedstock and the heat source employed. In the latter case, natural gas is employed as heat source when anhydrous ethanol is obtained in the market and used as feedstock. LCI of both natural gas and first generation, anhydrous ethanol (fuel ethanol) was retrieved from Ecoinvent V3.4."
5,Life cycle impact assessment and interpretation,"2.4 Life cycle impact assessment and interpretation The analysis of the inputs and outputs obtained from LCI was done in terms of the following impact categories at the mid-point level: Global warming potential, acidification potential, abiotic depletion potential, and eutrophication potential; as recommended in the LCA analysis for FC [61]. On the one hand, IPCC 2013 was chosen as the impact method to quantify global warming potential, as it is highly recommended and gives satisfactory results [62]. On the other hand, CML 2000 was selected to model the other impact categories such as abiotic depletion, acidification, and eutrophication. Said impact methods have been previously used in LCA studies focused on both H2 and FC-power production [26,27]. Aside from the above impact categories, ecotoxicity categories and water consumption were addressed. Ecotoxicity categories were quantified by using USEtox impact method [62,63], while water consumption by the AWARE method. The latter method has been employed to assess the LCA of H2 production from emerging technologies [24]. Besides, fossil cumulative energy demand was calculated as a useful tool to quantify the renewability of the process, as shown in Section 2.5 . Interpretation of the environmental impacts were performed by contribution, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis. Uncertainty analysis was performed by Monte Carlo Simulations, considering a triangular distribution for the foreground data with ±10 %. Besides, 1000 iterations and 95 % confidence interval were reckoned [64]."
6,Process energy calculations,"2.5 Process energy calculations The efficiency of the process was estimated according to the models described by Authayanun et al. [27] and shown in Eqs. (3) and (4). Ethanol LHV is 26.8 MJ kg-1 [65], LHVf in Eq. (3). (3) η S = P FC LHV F ∗ ( m F ) ∗ w ETOH + QT (4) Q T = Q ESR + Q PSA − Q CO − Q Rec Moreover, the renewability (Rn) value was calculated according to Eq. (5). Rn relates the bioenergy output in comparison to the total fossil cumulative energy demand [28]. Bioenergy output was calculated according to Eq. (6). (5) R n = Bioenergy output Fossil Cumulative Energy Demand (6) Bioenergy output = m H 2 LHV H 2 + m Biomethane LHV biomethane"

8,Proposed process to produce power from sugarcane press-mud,"3.1 Proposed process to produce power from sugarcane press-mud Fig. 4 shows the proposed process to produce power from sugarcane press-mud. Briefly, the process encompasses four main stages. The P1 stage refers to the bioethanol production where, firstly, sugarcane press-mud is pretreated at 130 °C and 1 h to obtain a solid and a liquid fraction. Afterwards, the liquid fraction is used as feedstock to produce raw bioethanol by fermentation at 30 °C for 17 h using an industrial S. cerevisiae strain. The solid fraction is converted into biomethane by coupling anaerobic digestion and high-pressure scrubbing processes. Resulting biomethane is used as heat source for the biofuel processor. Surplus biomethane avoids the use of fossil sources such as LPG, which is the main heat source in the Colombian rural areas for cooking. The P2 stage is the purification process. In this stage, raw bioethanol is distilled until S/E = 3. In the P3 stage, purified bioethanol is initially converted into syngas over RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 at 700 °C. The yielded syngas is cleaned in a CO-removal unit over Au–CuO/CeO2 at 260 °C and then purified to produce H2 (99.9 vol%) in a PSA unit by using an adsorbent made of zeolite and activated carbon. Lastly, in the P4 stage, pure H2 is sent to a LT-PEMFC to produce power. The off gases from PSA and the P4 stage are sent together with biomethane to the burner to produce heat. Table 1 summarizes the main inputs and outputs flows for the process depicted in Fig. 4, along with a comparison among the distillation scenarios. According to Table 1, the use of a flash distillation unit requires the larger amount of sugarcane press-mud and consequently, the larger consumption of both raw materials and energy. Indeed, it requires 20-fold times more sugarcane press-mud than other scenarios to fulfill 1 kWh power in a LT-PEMFC through the process described in Fig. 4. Flash distillation is a single equilibrium stage operation and therefore, ethanol recovery is low. On the contrary, distillation columns, such as mash and rectification units, have at least 24 equilibrium stages, recovering more ethanol. Scenario 2 requires 1.25 times more sugarcane press-mud than Scenario 3 and the energy demand for Scenario 2 was 52 % higher than Scenario 3. Despite energy demand in Scenario 2 is higher than Scenario 3, in Scenario 2 larger amounts of energy can be recovered, mainly in the CO-Prox reactor. Table 1 shows that the energy recovered in Scenarios 2 and 3 was 8.12 and 5.31 MJ kWh−1, respectively. The energy recovered from the CO-Prox reactor was used to preheat the bioethanol and avoid the use of extra energy sources in the process. Herein, biomethane was used as energy source to cover the energy demand of the biofuel processor. Scenario 2 consumes less biomethane (0.046 kg) than Scenario 3 (0.12 kg), as shown in Table 1. Higher energy recovered per kg of sugarcane press-mud reflected higher energy efficiencies. For instance, Table 1 depicts that Scenario 1 had an energy recovered of 0.031 MJ kg−1 and a global efficiency of 16.1 %, whilst Scenarios 2 and 3 showed efficiencies of 55.93 and 37.16 %, with energy recoveries of 0.42 and 0.34 MJ kg−1, respectively. Those efficiencies were higher than those reported in the literature [27,66]. For instance, Authayanun et al. [27] reported an overall efficiency of 29 % when dehydrated ethanol is fed to a biofuel processor formed by a train reaction system. Hence, the selection of the separation process will strongly influence the energy efficiency of the overall process. Aside from H2, which was used to produce power in a LT-PEMFC, biomethane was yielded as a co-product. Biomethane could be partially employed as heat source in the biofuel processor by combustion. However, surplus biomethane could be potentially used as heat source for other purposes outside the system boundaries described in Fig. 1. Based on the LHV of both H2 and biomethane, bioenergy output was calculated for all the Scenarios, as shown in Table 1. Scenario 1 displayed the highest surplus biomethane production (1.61 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud), but the lower H2 production (0.031 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud). Hence, bioenergy output for Scenario 1 was 1.63 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud. On the contrary, Scenario 3 showed the lowest surplus biomethane (1.40 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud), but the highest H2 production (0.56 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud) with an overall bioenergy output of 1.96 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud. Differences in H2 production were ascribed to the elevated impurities content of the bioethanol obtained by flash distillation, that highly affect H2 yield on ESR. Therefore, more efficient bioethanol separation processes are needed in a biofuel processor to yield larger amounts of H2. Despite Scenario 3 shows the largest H2 yield (0.56 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud), Scenario 2 would be a better alternative from an energy point of view since a higher energy efficiency was attained (55.93 %) and similar bioenergy output was yielded (2.1 MJ kg−1 sugarcane press-mud), as shown in Table 1. Hence, the use of a single mash column in a biofuel processor is enough to produce H2 for power production. Moreover, Scenario 2 shows a higher efficiency than the first generation, anhydrous ethanol Scenario, whose efficiency was 38.46 %. Differences in the material and energy consumption will have an important effect on the environmental impacts, which are analyzed in the upcoming sections."
9,Environmental impacts,"3.2 Environmental impacts Environmental impacts were calculated by means of the global warming potential, abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, human toxicity, water consumption, and cumulative energy demand. Fig. 5 shows their relative contribution, calculated as the ratio between the impact of the scenario and the maximum value observed [28]. Characterization results at mid-point level of those impacts are displayed in Table 2 . According to Fig. 5, the use of flash distillation along with the biofuel processor (Scenario 1) showed the highest environmental impact in almost all categories, except on abiotic depletion potential and AWARE. The environmental impact for Scenarios 2 and 3 remained low (<15 %) in comparison to Scenario 1. However, Scenario 2 showed better environmental impacts than Scenario 3 in six categories. For instance, Table 2 shows that carbon footprint for Scenarios 2 and 3 was 1.21 and 2.60 kg CO2-eq, respectively. It means that GHG emissions were 2.15-fold higher in Scenario 3 than Scenario 2. On the other hand, water consumption was measured by means of the AWARE impact category, which measures the water consumption per unit of surface in a given watershed relative to the world average, after human and aquatic demands have been fulfilled [24,67]. Table 2 depicts that Scenario 1 showed the lowest AWARE. Indeed, 48.96 m3 of water could be returned to the watershed if a flash unit is employed together with the biofuel processor. Whereas Scenarios 2 and 3 will return 1.09 m3 and 0.41 m3 of water, respectively. The best performance of Scenario 1 in terms of water use was attributed to the fact that water is not required to carry out the bioethanol purification; on the contrary, Scenarios 2 and 3 need it. For instance, the mash column operates with open steam heating to deliver enough energy to carry out the separation, as shown in Fig. 2b. In the case of the rectification unit (Scenario 3), both water cooling and water process are needed to yield the suitable bioethanol composition before sending it to the reforming unit (Fig. 2c). Moreover, water savings was also associated with the substitution of fossil fuels like LPG by biomethane. Aside from the impact categories shown in Fig. 5, fossil cumulative energy demand is an outstanding parameter that gives insights into the environmental performance of a process [68]. The term Rn, calculated by Eq. (5), is useful to determine whether the process described in Fig. 4 has a renewable feature. Table 1 shows that all scenarios presented a renewability >1, it means that more bioenergy is produced than the fossil energy consumed in the overall life cycle, from a cradle-to-gate perspective. Scenario 1 showed the greatest Rn (2.92), followed by Scenario 3 (1.43), and scenario 2 (1.24). From the previous analysis, the following outcomes can be elicited: (i) Scenarios 2 and 3 require less amount of energy and materials to produce 1 kWh power in a LT-PEMFC; (ii) Scenario 2 displays the best environmental performance in almost all the impact categories; and (iii) Scenario 2 shows the highest energy efficiency. Therefore, separation process design must be selected to keep the impurities concentration as low as possible by reducing the energy consumption. This goal was accomplished by using a mash column, which is a single multi vapor-liquid stage separation process, that reduces the impurities concentration which have not a significant effect on ESR. Hence, a contribution analysis was performed to identify possible hotspots for scenario 2. Contribution analysis splits the LCA results into its individual process contributions [69]. In the upcoming section, we explore the environmental contribution for each of the stages shown in Fig. 2."
10,Discussion,
11,Contribution analysis,"4.1 Contribution analysis Fig. 4 shows that the overall process was split into 4 stages: P1: bioethanol production, P2: bioethanol purification, P3: H2 production, and P4: power production. Herein, characterization results were split into the same stages. Moreover, for each stage, the following background systems were considered in the contribution analysis: (i) electricity, (ii) heat, (iii) chemicals manufacturing, (iv) and transportation. Fig. 6 shows the contribution analysis for the power production from sugarcane press-mud by using a mash column to purify bioethanol (Scenario 2). The negative and positive values represent the avoided and induced impacts, respectively [70]. The avoided impacts give environmental savings to the overall process and, consequently, lower the overall impact of the process since the production of fossil compounds like LPG is substituted by biomethane [71]. Herein, avoided impacts was observed on stages P2 and P3 for almost all the impact categories where biomethane was used as heat source. Avoided impacts were not observed on the acidification and eutrophication potential. When biomethane derived from the solid fraction of sugarcane press-mud is produced, the NH3 and NOx are emitted as pollutants. These pollutants have an important effect on those impact categories; thus, rising the acidification and eutrophication potential, as shown in Fig. 6c and d, respectively [72]. Otherwise, the induced impacts cause a negative effect on the overall environmental impact. Among the main processes, H2 production (P3) had the greatest share for all the impact categories. For instance, carbon footprint for said stage was 1.38 kg CO2-eq. Similarly, for the acidification and eutrophication potential, the share of the H2 stage was about 67 and 64 %, respectively. For those categories, manufacturing of chemicals was the main contributor to the environmental impact. In fact, chemicals manufacturing contributed to at least with 30 % in the acidification, eutrophication, and global warming potential. Within the chemicals that are employed in P3 stage, nitrogen, oxygen, and both RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 and Au–Cu/CeO2 catalysts have an important influence on the environmental impact. Table 3 shows the contribution of nitrogen, oxygen, RhPt/CeO2–SiO2, and AuCuO/CeO2 on the impact categories during the production of power from sugarcane press-mud. Contribution was done by excluding the avoiding impacts. Among them, nitrogen has the greatest share, with at least 30 % in all the impact categories. Cryogenic distillation is the most widely separation technology to purify nitrogen, which requires a larger energy demand to fulfill the separation [73]. Larger energy demand is correlated with larger environmental impacts [74], and therefore, the use of nitrogen derived from cryogenic units will lead to greater impacts. Table 3 also shows that the synthesis of RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 catalyst employed on ESR contributes to 18 % to the overall acidification potential. While Au–CuO/CeO2 catalyst, employed on CO-removal stage, contributes by 7 and 18 % to the eutrophication potential and human toxicity non-cancer potential, respectively. Metals such as Rh and Pt are extracted from Platinum group metal ore mines and purified [75] in an energy-intensive process that highly contributes to SO2 emissions because sulfur components (e.g., copper (II) sulfide, iron (II) sulfide) present in the ore are oxidized [76]. Precipitation of SO2 as acid rain, snow, or mist is absorbed by water sources [77]; thus, acidifying and contributing to acidification. On the other hand, phosphate emissions are responsible of the high eutrophication levels during the synthesis of Au–CuO/CeO2. Whereas the emissions of metals such as arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg), derived from the gold mining, mainly contribute to human toxicity [78,79]. However, in comparison with non-noble metals such as nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), noble metals could be easily regenerated, are more active against impurities, and their lifetime is longer [11,19]. Moreover, the impacts to produce 1 kg of Co and Ni would be lower than the noble metals, associated with the economic allocation [80]. However, the environmental contribution of noble metals is lower than transition metals due to the low consumption rates. For instance, Cortés et al. [41] reported that a Sepiolite base with 15 wt% Ni and 2 wt% La contributed by at least 10 % to all the impact categories to produce power from alcoholic waste, by means of a SOFC. Contrariwise, both RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 and Au–CuO/CeO2 contributed by at least 5 % to the impact categories, except for those described above (i.e., acidification, eutrophication, and human toxicity non-cancer potential), as shown in Table 3. Followed by H2 stage (P3), bioethanol production (P1, in Fig. 4) is the second largest contributor to the environmental impact, mainly on the ecotoxicity categories where power grid is the main responsible on the contribution to the aforecited categories. Nonetheless, the transportation of sugarcane press-mud has an important influence on the carbon footprint and abiotic depletion potential, as shown in Fig. 6a and e, respectively. Bioethanol purification stage (P2) contributes to a less extent to the environmental impact than the H2 (P3) and bioethanol (P1) production stages. Indeed, the greatest share is observed for the acidification and eutrophication potential, whose values are 22.6 and 28.3 %, as shown in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. Herein, heat, supplied by means of the combustion of biomethane coming from the anaerobic decomposition of solid and subsequent up-grading through high pressure water scrubbing, is the main contributor. Combustion of biomethane in the furnace leads to the formation of NOx that are responsible to both acidification and eutrophication potential [72]. In this study, carbon footprint of the bioethanol production stage (i.e., P1 and P2, in Fig. 6) is −0.19 kg CO2-eq kWh−1 power (−2.61 kg CO2-eq kg H2 −1). Hajjaji et al. [25,26] reported a bioethanol production from wheat with a carbon footprint of 4.24 kg CO2-eq kg H2 −1. Authayanun et al. [27] used cassava as feedstock to produce power in a LT-PEMFC and reported a 0.58 kg CO2-eq kWh−1 power during the bioethanol production stage. In both studies, the purification stage had a greater contribution than that shown in this study. Differences could be attributed to the system boundaries, since biomethane surplus was employed to avoid the use of LPG. Furthermore, Authayanun et al. [27] reported an overall carbon footprint of 1.44 kg CO2 kWh−1 when dehydrated ethanol from cassava was employed as feedstock. This value was higher than that reported in this study (1.21 kg CO2 kWh−1), as shown in Table 2, eliciting the benefits of using residual biomass instead of edible sources such as cassava. Finally, power production in a LT-PEMFC contributes to a less extent in all the impact categories, as shown in Fig. 5. According to the contribution analysis, main hotspots during power production are: (i) power consumption during bioethanol production, (ii) transport of sugarcane press-mud, (iii) synthesis of RhPt/CeO2–SiO2, (iv) synthesis of Au–CuO/CeO2, and (v) the use of nitrogen as carrier gas. These hotspots had a great share on different impacts. For instance, while nitrogen had a great share in all the impact categories, catalysts mainly affected acidification, eutrophication, and human toxicity non-cancer potentials. Since the environmental impacts are based on the data and assumption of the LCI, as shown in Section 2.1.1 , it is pertinent to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters that had the largest effect on the environmental impact [81]. Besides, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to determine the robustness of the LCA."
12,Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis,"4.2 Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis Sensitivity analysis was performed by means of the sensitive ratio (SR), which is defined as the ratio between the relative changes of the impact category and the parameters [69]. A variation of ±10 % was adopted for the following parameters: electricity demand on bioethanol production, transport of sugarcane press-mud, mass of RhPt/CeO2–SiO2, AuCuO/CeO2, and nitrogen in the biofuel processor. Fig. 7 shows the SR for those parameters. Changes in the nitrogen requirements during H2 production have the greatest influence in almost all the impact categories (SR > 0.10), mainly on AWARE and global warming potential. Transportation has also an important effect on global warming potential, whilst electricity influences the ecotoxicity categories. Regarding the catalysts, variation in the amount of RhPt/CeO2–SiO2 and AuCuO/CeO2 show a great influence on acidification and human toxicity non-cancer potential, respectively. But the manufacturing of those catalysts does not influence other impact categories such as global warming potential, water consumption, and fossil cumulative energy demand. Among all the analyzed hotspots, nitrogen as carrier gas in ESR must have the main priority from an environmental point of view. The carrier gas plays an important role, since its flow rate affects the product distribution [82]. Hence, analysis of the product distribution with less carrier gas must be evaluated to warrant a proper H2 production and consequently a less environmental impact. Concerning the uncertainty analysis, Table 2 shows that the variation of the impacts is low (CV < 25 %) for almost all the mid-point indicators. Hence, impact results are reliable and robust [64]."
13,Environmental benefits of the use of residual biomass to produce power via hydrogen as energy vector,"4.3 Environmental benefits of the use of residual biomass to produce power via hydrogen as energy vector Nowadays, there is a need to move towards cleaner and renewable sources. Herein, we present a renewable alternative to produce power, by means of the conversion of sugarcane press-mud into power in a LT-PEMFC. The use of this kind of agroindustrial wastes to produce clean energy will increase the social and economic development of the rural areas, since non-centrifugal sugar is an outstanding source in the job creation in many Latin-American, Caribbean, Asian, and African countries [83]. Some environmental benefits were observed if ethanol derived from agroindustrial wastes is employed instead of the ethanol derived from sugarcane molasses. Fig. 5 portrays that environmental impacts are higher when ethanol from sugarcane is converted into power by the process depicted in Fig. 3. Indeed, GHG could be reduced by 62 % when sugarcane press-mud is used instead of sugarcane. In the sugarcane industry, ethanol is produced from molasses and the conversion process encompasses the farming and conversion stages [9]. Tonini et al. [70] reported that residues always portrayed environmental benefits in terms of global warming potential. Besides, it has been shown that the use of second-generation bioethanol leads to lower GHG emissions than first generation bioethanol [71]. The environmental impact of H2 production technology highly depends on the primary source [4]. Regarding the other impact categories, Fig. 5 shows environmental benefits if sugarcane press-mud is used to produce bioethanol instead of ethanol derived from sugarcane molasses. However, freshwater ecotoxicity shows a worse performance when sugarcane press-mud is used as feedstock owing to the wastewater, which is mainly formed by higher alcohols, obtained as a bottom product from the rectification column. Alcohols such as 3-methyl-1-butanol and ethanol account for freshwater ecotoxicity. Hence, it is affordable to use residual biomass to mitigate the environmental impact of H2 production by ESR. In comparison with other studies, we reported a carbon footprint of 1.21 kg CO2-eq kWh−1 whose value was lower than that reported by Cortés et al. [41]. Indeed, about 1.93 kg CO2-eq kWh−1 was obtained, when alcoholic waste, from distilleries, was reformed to produce H2 and subsequently used in a SOFC. Likewise, Authayanun et al. [27] reported 1.44 kg CO2 kWh−1 during the power production in a LT-PEMFC using H2 from the SR of dehydrated bioethanol. Similar results allow to elicit that power production from sugarcane press-mud is feasible in comparison with other feedstocks by using similar technologies. Nonetheless, carbon footprint for other technologies was lower than that reported in this study. For instance, Mohammadi et al. [81] reported a carbon footprint of 0.20, 0.38, and 0.35, when combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion of sugarcane bagasse and cane trash were employed to produce 1 kWh in a cogeneration unit, respectively. Low values were associated with the electricity surplus generated in the cogeneration system that avoids the use of the Iranian power grid which is mainly generated from natural gas and oil. Suwanmanee et al. [84] reported a carbon footprint of −0.25 kg CO2 kWh−1 during the power production in a HT-PEMFC by using H2 obtained from gasification of rice husk. Environmental savings observed in that study was associated with CO2 capture during the farming stage. Parascanu et al. [85] reported that the combustion and gasification of sugarcane bagasse and agave produced about 0.44 and 0.29 kg CO2 per kWh generated in a Rankine cycle, respectively. Differences in the carbon footprint among processes could be associated with the biomass composition, assumptions, and system boundaries."
14,Conclusions,"The production of power from sugarcane press-mud, a residual biomass, was explored by means of material and energy balances, and a life cycle perspective to select the more suitable separation process to produce bioethanol for its further conversion into H2 and power by ESR and LT-PEMFC, respectively. Material and energy flow rates analysis reveals that a mash column could be used along with a biofuel processor to purify the bioethanol, reducing the demand of both sugarcane press-mud and energy. Hence, the environmental impacts associated with global warming potential, human toxicity, AWARE, fossil cumulative energy demand, and abiotic depletion potential, could be decreased in comparison with other possible purification technologies such as flash distillation and train distillation system. Besides, contribution analysis revealed that the carrier gas employed on ESR showed the greatest environmental impact and hence, strategies to reduce the amount of carrier must be assessed. Finally, the use of sugarcane press-mud, as biomass source, had environmental benefits in comparison to the use of anhydrous ethanol from sugarcane molasses as feedstock. Environmental benefits were related to the surplus of biomethane to heat the fuel processor, which avoids the use of fossil fuels like LPG, commonly used in Colombian farms."
