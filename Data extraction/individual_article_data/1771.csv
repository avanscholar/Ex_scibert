0,Introduction,"Depletion of the traditional fossil fuels and the growing concerns over global warming in the past decades (Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002) have made renewable fuels a significant alternative to the conventional energy (Wargacki et al., 2012). Petrodiesel-like fuels (Sunde et al., 2011), also called green diesel or renewal diesel, is derived from biological sources (e.g., biomass) and is chemically the same as petrodiesel. They show great potential for the supplement of petrodiesel (Knothe, 2010), due to its high quality and combustion efficiency (Knothe, 2010). Recently, many methods, such as pyrolysis (Wang et al., 2011) and deoxygenation reactions (Lam and Marko, 2011), were used to remove the oxygen from the diesel fuel to produce straight chain hydrocarbons. However, these approaches can cause the loss of carbon and decrease energy content of the produced fuel (Cacchi et al., 1986), which might lead to the low efficiency of diesel production. Thus, a novel renewable way to produce the petroldiesel-like fuels, such as long straight-chain alkanes, is becoming increasingly important. Fatty alcohols, which usually contain a chain of 8–22 carbons, are mainly used as the detergents and surfactants (Mudge et al., 2012) for cosmetics and food industries. Attributed to their amphipathic nature, fatty alcohols can behave as nonionic surfactants (Merz et al., 1994), which can also be utilized as emulsifiers, emollients and thickeners in cosmetics and food products. Fatty alcohols were originally obtained by reduction of wax esters with sodium by the Bouveault–Blanc reduction process (Barton and Motherwell, 1981). In the 1930s catalytic hydrogenation was commercialized (Turek et al., 1994). Fatty alcohols were also prepared from petrochemical sources (Metzger and Bornscheuer, 2006), which are exhausted because of the huge demand of fossil energy. Hence, the demand for the new resource of fatty alcohols is increasing dramatically. Microalgae, one of the most promising microorganism for biofuel production, have been shown to have a great potential in the fatty acid formation for the biodiesel transesterification (Chisti, 2007). In the last a few years, the production of fatty acid from algae has been an area of considerable interest because of their several advantages. First, algae have higher productivities than land plants (Loomis and Williams, 1963), with some species having doubling times of a few hours. Second, some species can accumulate very large amounts of triacylglycerides (Guschina and Harwood, 2006). Third, production of algal biomass does not require for the high quality agricultural land (Fabricius et al., 2005). Finally, microalgae can be cultured using seawater, blackish water, and even waste waters. However, little effort has been made to produce alkane and fatty alcohol using microalga. This paper focused on the petrodiesel-like fuel production using the microalga Chlorella sorokiniana 21. The characteristics, structure alterations, composition and high production yields of the straight chain alkane and fatty alcohol derived from this strain have been investigated using 1H NMR and GC/MS methods."
1,Methods,
2,Experimental organisms,"2.1 Experimental organisms Microalgal strain C. sorokiniana 21 used in this study was collected by the Key Engineering Laboratory for Algal Biofuels from the coastal waters of Shenzhen, Guangzhou Province, China. The strain was maintained on BG-11 media with 1.5% agar supplemented. Individual cultivation experiments were carried out for 10days with three replicats. Slots on a shaker platform were randomly assigned and reassigned after each sampling to prevent bias and account for any variance in lighting. For cultivation, 80ml of axenic culture in exponential phase with dry cell mass density of 50mgL−1 ±0.08 SE was inoculated into 800ml of sterile BG-11 broth (pH 7.1) in flasks (1000ml) stoppered with autoclavable foam and incubated at 26°C. Three banks of cool white portable fluorescent lights (EIKO, PAR100, 220V) set on a timer provided an average photosynthetically active radiation of 100.5μmolm−2 s−1 ±2.0 SE of light (Jorquera et al., 2010) with air bubbling. Light was on for 12h and off for 12-h (12L:12D photoperiod). The same condition was also applied to the rotary shaking cultivation without aeration."
3,Measurement of optical density (OD) and biomass,"2.2 Measurement of optical density (OD) and biomass Optical density (OD) at 680nm was measured daily as the algal density indicator using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800, SHIMADZU), with triplicate biological replicates (n =3). To determine biomass, algal cultures were filtered through Gelman glass fiber filters (25mm in diameter, Type A, 0.45μm) and the resulting filters dried at 65°C for 1h. For chemical analysis, aliquots of the mixed algal cultures were centrifuged, re-suspended in distilled water, and then treated further analysis. A linear relationship between OD and dry weight (DW, gL−1) was determined for this strain using the following equation (Wang et al., 2010): Dry weight ( gL - 1 ) = 0.3728 OD 680 + 0.0431 , R 2 = 0.995 The growth rate (GR, d−1) (Donk and Hessen, 1993) was calculated by fitting the OD for the first 5days of culture to an exponential function: GR (d−1)=(lnOD t −lnOD0)/t, where OD0 is the optical density at initial day, OD t is the optical density for day t and t is the time between the two measurements."
4,Extraction yield determination,"2.3 Extraction yield determination Individual sample (1.5g) was extracted with chloroform/methanol (1/2, v/v) by soxhlet extractor at 75°C for 12h (Krohn et al., 2011; Torres-Durán et al., 1999). The supernatants were collected and pooled together, filtered with Whatman filter No. 1 (Whatman, USA), and washed with Milli-Q water. The lower organic phases were collected and dried using a vacuum rotary evaporator in a water bath at 50°C. Total lipid contents were determined gravimetrically. After weighing, 10ml of n-hexane is added to each flask for subsequent chemical analyses."
5,Chemical structure analysis,"2.4 Chemical structure analysis To determine the structure of individual chemical compounds, 1H NMR Spectra (Zhou et al., 2010) were collected using a Bruker 500 utra shield I100605 400-MHz spectrometer outfitted with a 5-mm broadband probe. Samples were prepared by dissolving 1ml of microalgal extraction in n-hexane containing 0.03% tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Samples were then filtered (0.45-μm PTFE) to remove any suspended particulates before loading into 5-mm diameter NMR tubes. 1H spectra were acquired with a 90° pulse angle, spinner frequency of 20Hz, sweep width of 8000Hz across 32 transients."
6,Composition analysis,"2.5 Composition analysis Extraction compositions were analyzed (Vijayaraghavan and Hemanathan, 2009) by using an Agilent 5973 series high-temperature gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS), equipped with an auto injector. The main focus of GC–MS analysis was exclusively for alkane and fatty alcohol identification. For GC–MS analysis, a capillary column (DB-5ms, 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm film thickness) (J and W Scientific) was used. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 280°C while the initial column temperature was set at 80°C. A 1-μl sample volume was injected into the column and ran using a 100:1 split ratio. After 3min, the oven temperature was raised to 315°C at a ramp rate of 5°Cmin−1 and finally maintained at this temperature for 12min. Helium was used as the carrier gas and was programmed to maintain a constant flow rate of 2mlmin−1. The mass spectra were acquired and processed using both Agilent ChemStation (Agilent, USA) and AMDIS32 software."
7,Results and discussion,
8,OD analysis and biomass production,"3.1 OD analysis and biomass production Optical density of algal growth cultivated under different conditions is summarized in Fig. 1 a. Comparing with cultivation on the rotary shaker, the microalga C. sorokiniana 21 grew faster with air bubbling during the whole cultivation period time without obvious lag phase in 10days. After the 7th day, the growth curve of algae cultivated with air bubbling started to increase dramatically. However, algal culture on the shaker grew steadily and relatively slowly in the whole cultivation period of 10days. The growth rate trends of C. sorokiniana 21, which decreased steadily during the whole cultivation time, were almost identical under shaking and air bubbling conditions (Fig. 1b). However, the growth rate of cultivation under aeration condition is much higher (with the highest rate of 0.781d−1) than that of shaking-cultivated culture. There is no surprise for this type of growth rate because algal growth is dependent on CO2, nutrients (El-Nabarawy and Welter, 1984), light (Sorokin and Krauss, 1958), pH (Azov and Shelef, 1987) and temperature (Talbotand de la Noiie, 1993). The relationship between optical density and biomass production has been estimated using the calculation equation referred in Section 2.2. The final biomass produced by C. sorokiniana 21 with air bubbling reached up to 1.44gL−1 after 10days cultivation, compared with that of 0.27gL−1 cultivated with shaking cultivation. Clearly, aeration significantly enhanced the growth of C. sorokiniana 21 (Fig. 1) and thus was used in the subsequent research for the alkane and fatty alcohol production."
9,Extraction yields and chemical structure analysis,"3.2 Extraction yields and chemical structure analysis The yield and chemical analyses of extracts derived from C. sorokiniana 21 were carried out using Soxhlet extraction method (Demirbas and Fatih Demirbas, 2011) and 1H NMR spectra (Suppl. Fig. 1). The integral values of selected regions of individual spectra on the percentage basis are presented in Table 1 . The extraction yield from C. sorokiniana 21 reached up to 24.90%. 1H NMR spectra suggested that there were two major distinct components in the extracts derived from the microalga C. sorokiniana 21, which were alkanes and alcohols. The extracts contained 38.80% of alkanes (0.5–1.5ppm), with relatively lower alcohol functionality (37.48%) (Vardon et al., 2011). Furthermore, C. sorokiniana 21 produced 14.06% of α-to-heteroatom/unsaturated functionality (1.5–3.00ppm), which is possibly due to the unsaturated aliphatic chains (Mullen et al., 2009). The predominant products of C. sorokiniana 21 extracts were alkanes and alcohols, which were contrast to the previous report on the other stains of C. sorokiniana (Chen and Johns, 1991). Moreover, 7.81% of carbohydrates and 1.45% of aromatic functionality were found in the extracts of C. sorokiniana 21, as well. It is worth mentioning that the extracts of alkanes and alcohols from C. sorokiniana 21 might result from the structure destruction of aromatic rings and carbohydrates, which are the main components of microalgal cell wall (Kokinos et al., 1998)."
10,Extraction composition analysis by GC–MS,"3.3 Extraction composition analysis by GC–MS The GC–MS chromatogram of extracts derived from the microalga C. sorokiniana 21 (Suppl. Fig. 2) displayed 14 peaks, indicating the presence of fourteen compounds. The chemical compounds identified in the extraction of C. sorokiniana 21 are presented in Table 2 . GC–MS results revealed that hexadecanoic acid–methyl ester, 9-octadecenoic acid (Z)-methyl ester, and octadecanoic acid-3-hydroxy-methyl ester accounted for only 3.06%, 3.16% and 1.69% of the total compounds, respectively. These results suggested that the microalga C. sorokiniana 21 only produced 7.91% aliphatic esters, which can be used for biodiesel (Knothe, 2008). On the other hand, GC–MS results indicated that the alkane compounds were the major component of extracts derived from C. sorokiniana 21. Interestingly, these alkanes ranged from C17 to C44 and made up to 35.93% of the extracts with heptadecane-C17 alkane (21.13%) as the main component. Long-straight chain alkanes (Erhan et al., 2008) have been reported to be an important portion of petrodiesel with high quality (Myint and El-Halwagi, 2009) and lubricity (Masuch et al., 2011). Thus, C. sorokiniana 21 can be a promising microorganism for the production of petrodiesel-like fuels. Furthermore, C. sorokiniana 21 produced large amount of alcohols, 3-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-nonanol (29.09%), 1-ethynyl-cyclohexanol (12.86%), 1-hentetracontanol (2.96%), 2,2′-methylenebis[6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methyl-phenol (8.82%). Because of their amphipathic nature, these alcohol compounds are good candidates as emulsifiers (Filippini et al., 2010), emollients (Lestage et al., 2010) and thickeners (ALBERT et al., 2012) in cosmetics and food industries."
11,Conclusions,"The microalga C. sorokiniana 21 can produce large amount (35.93%) of long-chain straight alkanes, with the predominant component (21.31%) of heptadecane. Moreover, alcohols (53.73%) especially fatty alcohols are also the main products obtained from C. sorokiniana 21, with 29.09% of 3-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-nonanol. In conclusion, of the extracts of C. sorokiniana 21, long-chain straight alkanes and fatty alcohols are the major products, which can provide a significant supplement for the petrodiesel-like fuel and a promising natural resource for the detergent and emulsifiers."
