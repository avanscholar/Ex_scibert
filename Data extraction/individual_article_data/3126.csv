0,Introduction,"Sensing tasks use the specially designed dyes which are called fluorescent molecular sensors. Biomolecules and cellular organelles are specifically targeted by some sensors while others allow sensing and imaging of pH, temperature, metal ions, etc [1–9]. Owing to potential finely tunable characteristics, their small size, and ease of chemical modification, fluorescent sensors are of exclusive significant. Life science studies need to find application using molecules with polarity responsive emissions [10–12]. Considering this account, we focus on sensory molecules that affect its emission properties with respect to fundamental properties of polarity. Solvatochromism is the reversal of the electronic spectroscopic properties (absorption, emission) of a chemical structure caused by solvents. This change is often caused by variation in the polarity of the solvents. This affects the charge transfer mechanisms of solvatochromic compounds and causes color or emission change. One of the most widespread impurities in organic solvents is water which is often adverse effect to many industrial production processes and many chemical, particularly to fine chemicals, electronics and organic synthesis [13–17]. Water may limit the reactivity of organometallic compounds and suppress the reaction or reduce the yield. Therefore, control and determination of water in organic solvents has attracted much notice recently. Considering the conventional technique of the Karl Fisher titration [18], water sensing probes build on emission and absorption display remarkable benefits due to low cost, in situ monitoring, their convenience, simplicity [19–24]. Especially, fluorescent probes have been remarkably improved due to their high selectivity and sensitivity [25–32]. Dye-Al3+ complexes demonstrate interesting emission properties [33–37]. Dicyanovinylene group in IPA serves as an efficient acceptor site and aniline as donor site. The D–π–A type dicyanovinylene dyes has many beneficial properties such as comparatively high emission efficiency, saturated red emission, and good thermal and chemical stability [38]. Due to intense red fluorescence in the solid state, dicyanovinyleneisophorone dyes are utilized interest in the development of bioimaging and biochips [39]. Several bioimaging [40], strong two photon absorption [41] and viscosity sensitive dyes [42] were established on the triphenylamine based multibranched isophorone derivatives. In the present study, metal ion sensing ability of IPA was tested in the presence of a series of analytes. Only Al3+ among the tested metal ions displayed “turn-on” NIR response. Al3+ complexation of IPA produced red‐shifted emission and absorption, improved solvatochromic and solvatofluorochromic properties. Then, we are interested in understanding solvatochromic effect of IPA and IPA-Al3+ complex in different solvents with high emission intensity. The fluorescence response of IPA-Al3+ is being used for the selective detection of trace water in alcohols. The polarity of the solvent causes remarkable effect on the absorption and fluorescence spectra of IPA-Al3+ in many solvents, especially in alcohols. Several solvatochromic cyanine dyes have been developed in recent years [43–45]. However, the novelty of this work is that IPA displays not only solvatochromic property but also high sensitivity towards water down to 0.062% and “turn-on” emissive and chromogenic sensing response towards aluminum at a concentration as low as 1.05 µM."

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue dissolved in CHCl3 (40 mL) washed with a solution of NH4OH (pH≈9) (2 × 15 mL). After the evaporation of solvent, the resulting red oil was used without any additional purification to produce the probe IPA.

3,Theoretical calculations and analytical measurements,"2.2 Theoretical calculations and analytical measurements The optimize structures of IPA and IPA-Al3+ complex were achieved by the Gaussian 16 software at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G level [48]. These optimized structures were used to obtain the electronic transitions in IPA and IPA-Al3+ complex by TD-DFT. The spectral analyses were taken in the different alcohol solvents at rt. The probe IPA solution was prepared at 5.0 µM for emission and UV–vis measurements. The stock solutions (10.0 mM) of the guest metal ions were used to determine themetal ion sensing properties of probe IPA. The excitation wavelength was 445 nm by slit 5.0 nm, and all of the spectral analysis were recorded at room temperature. The 1H NMR titration experiment was performed to investigate the complexation sites responsible for the optical changes occurred in the probe IPA (0.068 M) by the addition of Al3+ ion in CDCl3-CD3CN mixture."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Preparation of the probe IPA,"3.1 Preparation of the probe IPA As depicted in Scheme 1, compound 2 was produced by the substitution reaction between 1 and potassium phthalimide in 90% of yield. Then, to obtain the compound 4 which has π-conjugation structure, Knoevenagel condensation reaction was performed between 2 and 3-dicyanomethylidene-1,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene (3). This reaction was confirmed by the disappearance of the proton signal belong to aldehyde unit of 2 at δ 9.55 ppm. The phthalimide groups in 4 were removed by using hydrazine hydrate reagent in ethanol to give 5. The obtained compound 5 was finally condensed with 2-aminophenol to generate the probe IPA. The structural characterizations were made by the 1H/13C NMR, TOF-MS and FT-IR techniques (Supporting information, Figs. S1-S6)."
6,Sensing properties of the probe IPA,"3.2 Sensing properties of the probe IPA To insight the sensing behaviors of IPA towards metal ions, fluorescence and UV–vis spectra were recorded by interacting a solution of IPA (5.0 µM) with various metal ions (15.0 equiv.) in EtOH. Free IPA showed an emission band at 605 nm due to the ICT process between aniline and dicyanovinyl group when excited at 445 nm. The emission behavior of IPA was not changed in presence of Na+, Mg+, Ag+, Mn2+, Co2+ whereas Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions induced to blue-shift with the decrease of emission intensity. Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ led to emission quenching. Unlike these, a NIR-emission band at 658 nm was detected by a large Stokes shift (Δλ = 103 nm) after the addition of Al3+ (Fig. S7). As a result, orange fluorescence of IPA turns to a fascinating red fluorescence which could be easily monitored only for Al3+ under UV light. The metal-induced responses in the absorption spectra of IPA were also illustrated in Fig.S8. The absorption of free IPA indicated a major band which centered at 425 nm. The significant spectral change was only observed after the addition of Al3+, and a new absorption band was emerged at 555 nm with a significant color change from light yellow to purple. No noticeable change was detected in the presence of other metal ions, only Fe3+ and Cr3+ caused to a weak band at 555 nm. The results indicate the formation of a strong complex between Al3+ ion and the probe IPA. In addition, the interference experiments revealed that Al3+ can be discriminated from other competitive metal ions (Fig. S9). The effect of solvent type on the emission and absorption spectra of IPA and IPA-Al3+ complex was investigated in EtOH, MeCN, DMSO, DMF, THF, Acetone and CHCl3. As shown in Fig.S10a, a hypochromic shift in the emission spectra of IPA was observed by the decrease in solvent polarity while no significant changes were monitored in the absorption spectra of IPA (Fig. S10c). Stability of excited state of IPA in polar solvent with respect to ground state is responsible for these prominent emission spectral changes in the solution [49–51]. When Al3+ was added to a solution of IPA in the different solvent, a prominent emission band at 658 nm was only observed in EtOH and CHCl3 (Fig. S10b) whereas the new absorption bands in the range of 555–571 nm was emerged in EtOH, MeCN, Acetone and CHCl3 (Fig. S10d). Thus, EtOH was selected in the spectroscopic measurements because it is water-miscible. In addition, to estimate solvent effects, the Lippert-Mataga plot was used [52]. As depicted in Fig. S11a and b, IPA showed more the positive solvato-chromism effect than IPA-Al3+ complex, which powerfully supports that the IPA has indeed ICT characteristic. To investigate the sensing ability of IPA for Al3+, the emission titration of IPA (5.0 μM) with Al3+ (0–15.0 equiv.) was performed in EtOH. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , upon the addition of Al3+, a proportional quench in the emission band was monitored at 605 nm and a progressive increase of new red emission band was observed at 658 nm until the amount of Al3+ reaches 15.0 equiv. since the ICT process in IPA was inhibited through the coordination of Al3+ to IPA. The binding ratio of Al3+ to IPA was detected by TOF-MS (Fig. S12) and found to be 1:1 of ratio. Based on the fluorescence emission ratios (I658/I605) and the concentration of the added Al3+, the detection limit and the binding constant were determined as 1.05 µM according to 3σ/slope (Fig. S13a) and 5.08(logKa) according to the Benesi–Hildebrand plot (Fig. S13b), respectively. Otherwise, we realized the UV–vis absorption measurements of IPA (5.0 μM) with the different concentration of Al3+. By the addition of Al3+ (0–15.0 equiv.), the absorption band at 425 nm gradually decreased and a new band centered at 555 nm was appeared with increasing intensity in the low energy region. Similarly, Al3+ induced an absorption band shift from 318 to 364 nm at the high energy region. Also, three isosbestic points at 334, 379 and 463 nm was clearly observed with increasing concentrations of Al3+ (Fig. S14). Colorimetrically, the detection limit of IPA for Al3+ was calculated as 2.51 μM according the UV–vis titration data. These data showed that IPA was an effective chromogenic and fluorogenic sensor for quantitatively and qualitatively detecting Al3+."
7,Fluorescence response of IPA and IPA-Al3+ in the various alcohol solvents,"3.3 Fluorescence response of IPA and IPA-Al3+ in the various alcohol solvents As mentioned in Fig. 1, IPA showed a distinct red emission at 658 nm towards Al3+ in EtOH unlike other water miscible solvents, along with the solution color change from orange to red under 365 nm lamp. To examine the effect of the different alcohols on the emission spectra of IPA and IPA-Al3+, the emission spectra of IPA and IPA-Al3+ was taken in methanol, 1-butanol and 2-propanol. The obtained data was presented with the results in EtOH (Fig. S15). The emission band of IPA was bathochromically changed, and the intensity decreased with the increase of alcohol solvent polarity due to the stabilization of its excited state in the highly polar environments. However, the emission band at 658 nm formed by addition of Al3+ not effected from the polarity of alcohols, which may be influence of the intermolecular electrostatic/hydrogen-bonding interactions on the fluorescent states. Also, the slight changes were observed in the UV–vis spectra of IPA and IPA-Al3+ (Fig. S16). The Stokes shifts (Δλ) values in methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol and 2-propanol were calculated as 188, 181, 168, 167 nm for IPA, and 122, 103, 102, 100 nm for IPA-Al3+, respectively. Notably, IPA exhibited more Stokes shift than that of IPA-Al3+, which can be attributed to the larger dipole moment in the IPA in the excited sate as compared to that of IPA-Al3+."
8,Detection of trace water in alcohol solvents,"3.4 Detection of trace water in alcohol solvents The IPA-Al3+ complex indicated a strong emission band in EtOH, which is a protic solvent, compared with aprotic water-miscible solvents. This observation motivated us to check the effect of water. Therefore, we measured the emission and absorption spectra of IPA-Al3+ in EtOH containing trace concentration of water (0.0–2.0 v/v, %) (Fig. S17a). The increasing water content in EtOH led to efficient fluorescence quenching at 658 nm, and fluorescence enhancing at 600 nm. Similarly, the UV–vis spectra of IPA-Al3+ with different water amounts restored to the initial absorbance properties of free IPA when 2.0% water (v/v) was employed (Fig. S17b). This phenomenon may be explained due to partial or complete displacement of Al3+ from IPA-Al3+ in the presence of water molecules. The intensity at 658 nm linearly decreased at low water amount (0–0.3 v/v %) with a correlation coefficient of 0.9698 and the limit of detection (v/v, %) was found to be 0.062% (Fig. S18). In addition, the change in emission intensity of IPA-Al3+ in the other alcohol solvents were observed by addition of water, and these changes was also plotted against the water concentration (v/v %) (Fig. S19a-f). The detection limit values (v/v %) in methanol, 1-butanol and 2-propanol were found to be 0.115, 0.076 and 0.037, respectively. The solvent order for water selectivity is 2-propanol > 1-butanol > ethanol > methanol, which shows that IPA-Al3+ is more sensitive to water molecules in 2-propanol. Considering the crucial effect of water on some special organic reactions, the determination of the water content in the organic solvent is of important. Thus, the performance of the prepared fluorescent probe was tested in the commercial alcoholic solvent named as Teksoll 96%. It contains the ethanol (≥95.0), 2-propanol + water (≤5.0) and supplied from Tekkim company in Turkey. Moreover, to observe the effect of Teksoll in the formation of IPA-Al3+, Teksoll-like mixtures were prepared as 95/5% (v/v) by using other alcohols without water. For this, the ethanol/2-propanol, ethanol/methanol and ethanol/1-butanol mixture was selected. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 a, the emission band and intensity of IPA at 605 nm could not be influenced by these mixtures. But, the addition of Al3+ to these solutions caused a distinct difference in the emission spectra. While IPA indicated significantly a red-shift emission band towards Al3+ in the water-free alcoholic mixtures, it did not show in Teksoll due to the presence of water (Fig. 2b). These observations imply that the weak association of Al3+ with IPA in the presence of water and IPA-Al3+ could be used a fluorescent probe to detect trace water in an alcohol or alcoholic mixtures. Alternatively, the solutions of IPA (5.0 μM) in EtOH containing at the various concentrations of water were prepared, then interacted with Al3+ (15.0 equiv.). As seen in Fig. 3 a, the emission intensity at 650 nm gradually decreased, depending on the increasing amount of water. The color of a solution was fluorometrically turned from red-fluorescence to weak orange (Fig. 3b), and colorimetrically from purple to light yellow (Fig. 3c), which allows to easily control the purity of ethanol, which is commonly used in organic chemistry."
9,Interaction mechanism and computational calculations,"3.5 Interaction mechanism and computational calculations The 1H NMR titration and TOF-MS analysis were used to further ensure the coordination mode of IPA and Al3+. As depicted in Fig. S20, the phenolic-OH (Ha) at δ 13.31 ppm was disappeared probably because of the interaction of the Al3+, and imine proton (Hb) at δ 8.30 ppm of IPA is shifted to δ 8.55 ppm upon addition of Al3+ (0.0–1.0 equiv.). The amine-N linked Hc and Hd signals at δ 3.74 and 3.80 ppm were shifted downfield to 3.88 and 3.98 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, the aliphatic-CH2 proton signals (He and Hf) in the isophorone moiety indicated slightly downfield shift compared to that of IPA. Therefore, the results clearly show that the imine, phenolic-OH and the amine-N donor units are effective in the formation of IPA-Al3+ complex (Fig. S21) Additionally, the TOF-MS analysis was conducted to verify the complexation of IPA-Al3+. As shown in Fig. S6, a characteristic peak at 654.3471 m/z was observed, corresponding to [IPA + CH3OH + K+] +. By the addition of the sufficient amount of Al3+, the formation of IPA-Al3+ in a 1:1 of stoichiometry was confirmed by the appearance of a peak at m/z 678.3031 assignable to [IPA + Al3++CH3OH + H++K+] (Fig. S12). Also, to test the effect of water on this complex, the water was added to the complex solution, and a new peak appeared at 654.3450 m/z due to the formation of [IPA + CH3OH + K+] + suggesting that the dissociation of Al3+ from IPA-Al3+ in the presence of water (Fig. S22) To further support the sensing mechanism, DFT and the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) calculations of IPA and IPA-Al3+ were conductedat the B3LYP/6-31G level through the Gaussian 16 package in gas phase, and the frontier HOMO/LUMO orbitals and MEPs were illustrated in Fig. 4 . The negative or positive potential sites of IPA and IPA-Al3+ were presented as the red- or blue-colored sites on their MEP surfaces. For the IPA, the electron density of HOMO located at the -N-phenyl (aniline) unit while the LUMO are centered on the isophoronemoiety, indicating the active Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) processes. Otherwise, the HOMO-LUMO orbitals of IPA-Al3+ showed the different profiles in their electron densities. The HOMO of IPA-Al3+ dominantly spread over the aniline-isophorone conjugate, and LUMO on the salicylimine group. The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO of IPA were decreased from −4.98 and −2.82 eV to −7.02 and −5.42 eV, respectively, showing the stability of IPA-Al3+. In addition, the energy gap in the IPA-Al3+ (1.60 eV) was 0.56 eV lower than that of IPA (2.16 eV), which is in accordance with the changes in the UV–vis spectra. The negative potential sites of IPA located around the oxygen and nitrogen atoms on its MEP."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we have developed an effective probe (IPA) for the colorimetric and fluorescence detection of Al3+ and trace water in alcohol solvents. Upon the complexation with Al3+ of IPA, a significant change in the emission color of IPA from orange to red was observed through the blocking of ICT process. Also, the prepared IPA-Al3+ was used as fluorescent probe for the detection of water in alcohols (ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol). The dissociation of Al3+ from IPA-Al3+ in the presence of water is responsible for the fluorescence and colorimetric change and it was confirmed by TOF-MS. The IPA-Al3+ indicated highly responsive to water in ethanol (DL = 0.062, v/v %), methanol (DL = 0.115), 1-butanol (DL = 0.076 wt%) and 2-propanol (DL = 0.037), which provides an alternative and convenient approach for determination of water content in the alcohols before using them in water-sensitive reactions."
