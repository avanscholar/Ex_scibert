0,Introduction,"Every year, Europe generates around 700,000 to 1,000,000 tons of waste cooking oil, including oils from snack food and potato fries. As for the selection of waste cooking oil as a raw material to produce methyl ester, it is not only simple to acquire, but also cheap in price due to it being a disposed item. Besides, the utilization of waste cooking oil for production of biodiesel can lessen the disposal of waste cooking oil to landfills and water systems which helps to reduce the impacts to environment health and human health. Waste cooking oil has been estimated to be commonly manufactured globally and in the United States almost 5 kg of waste cooking oil are manufactured annually per person, while in Europe about 0.49–0.7 million gallons of waste cooking oil are collected per day [1,2]. Furthermore, in Asian nations such as Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, etc, it was estimated 40,000 tonnes of WCO are generated per year [2]. Waste cooking oil is detrimental to consumers ' environment and health. Cooking oil waste is thought to cause cancer owing to the toxicity of the oil generated by the fried foods. The oxygenation process of water system will change due to the release of waste cooking oil into the water system. Besides, the life of aquatic will be in danger as the water surface will be covered by layer of oil and stopping the dissolution of oxygen in the water system [2]. Aluminum is manufactured primarily from bauxite mines around the world, reaching 270 million metric tons (Mt) in 2015 compared to 183 million tons in 2006. By contrast, aluminum consumption has tripled by 45 to 120 Mt, respectively, between 2006 and 2015, with a growth rate of 4% per year [3]. Aluminum waste recycling is a very beneficial contribution to saving our natural environment and wealth. The need for pollution-free atmosphere occurs as pollution increases. It has been discovered that synthesizing aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst from waste aluminum foils are appropriate to make the green-based catalyst since it is one of the effective method to lessen the mining of bauxite, reduce the environmental impact on landfills as well as decreases the cost of biodiesel production. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a replacement of natural polymer, made of polyvinyl acetate by a method known as hydrolysis. It is used in many sectors including automotive, medical, commercial, food industry and in many end items such as resins, surgical strings, food packaging materials and lacquers [4]. These artificial polymers are also combined with other polymer compounds such as biopolymers, and other polymers with hydrophilic nature. PVA is extremely common because of its use in cross-linking products and nanofillers [4]. The advantages of PVA includes boosting mechanical properties of films because of its stable structure and hydrophilic properties, non-hazardous to living tissues, safe, nontoxic, and biodegradable. Transesterification process as shown in Figure 1 shows the catalyst which is present in the reaction will catalyze the chemical reaction between glycerides (present in oils or animal fats) and an alcohol to form esters and glycerol. The properties of diesel fuel versus biodiesel is shown in Table 1 . The fuel standard is based on ASTM D 975 and ASTM D 6751. Table 2 describes the comparison of heterogenous catalyst for biodiesel production. The highest yield of 91.7% was achieved using rapeseed oil at temperature 60℃, methanol to oil ratio of 12:1 and cataltst loading at 2.5wt%. The main objective of this study is to synthesize aluminum chloride hexahydrate catalyst for biodiesel production. The generation of methyl ester was produced by using waste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstock and aluminum chloride hexahydrate catalyst to catalyze the reaction which was prepared from aluminum foil waste and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Besides, this research also concentrates on the optimization of the transesterification process by investigate the effect of parameters such as methanol to oil ratio, temperature, and amount of catalyst on the generation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization 2 g of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) granules were added into 150 ml distilled water to prevent the formation of lumps. The process was performed at the temperature of 90 ℃ using hot plate stirrer for about 2 h until aqueous polyvinyl alcohol is attained. Wastes of aluminum foil were obtained from IIUM cafeteria. The aluminum wastes were then washed and dried. The 13.5 g of cleaned aluminum foil wastes were dissolved in a 200 ml hydrochloric acid solution until aluminum chloride solution was obtained. The aluminum chloride solution was then evaporated using a hot plate at 90 °C (overnight) and heated at 120 °C to eliminate all the excess moisture before aluminum chloride was collected in powder form (2 to 3 days). Next, the aluminum chloride powder was dissolved into aqueous PVA, and left to dry at room temperature until a thin film layer was formed. The sample was then cut into 1 cm × 1 cm before moving on to the next stage of transesterification. The X Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) characterized the structure and morphology of aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalysts in film form. The X-ray diffractometer machine (SHIMADZU XRD-6000) was used to determine the pattern of catalysts using XRD. The Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis has also analyzed both the structure and composition of aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalysts. By using Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR Spectrometer, the sample was scanned with a wavelength ranges from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 and at a resolution spectrum of 4 cm−1."
3,Transesterification and FAME conversion,"2.2 Transesterification and FAME conversion For optimization of biodiesel production, three parameters were taken into considerations: methanol to oil ratio, amount of the catalyst, and reaction of the temperature. The value of those parameters was in the ranges of 6:1 – 18:1 for methanol to oil ratio whereas the amount of catalyst and reaction of the temperature were in the ranges of 2% – 8% and 55 ℃ to 65℃ respectively. In this reaction, the aluminium foil wastes that have been synthesized with PVA was utilized as the catalyst. The methanol, waste cooking oil (WCO), and catalyst were put into conical flask. Then, the conical flask was placed in the incubated shaker for about 3 h with different value of methanol to oil ratio, amount of catalyst, reaction temperature which were based on DOE and with a fixed value of rotation speed of 250 rpm to obtain the optimum production of biodiesel. After the transesterification process, the mixture was heated at 75℃ to evaporate the methanol and followed by filtration of the mixture by using filter paper to recover the catalyst for next biodiesel production. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for approximately 10 min. Next, the mixture was left overnight in a separatory funnel until two layers of mixture was formed in which the upper layer was dominated by fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) whereas the bottom layer was occupied by glycerol which was removed and discarded. The composition within biodiesel was analyzed by Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (HP 5973 GCMS). Before the sample was injected into GS for analysis, 1 ml of the sample was diluted with 4.9 ml n-hexane. After the analysis, the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was calculate by using Eq. (1): (1) FAME Y i e l d % = Weight o f b i o d i e s e l g Weight o f o i l u s e d g × 100 % The characterization of biodiesel generated from transesterification can be signified by the percentage of FAME yield. The mass of ester-rich phase was weighed and then divided by the mass of oil used and multiplied with 100 percent to obtain the fatty acid methyl ester yield in percentage form."
4,Optimization of biodiesel by using DOE,"2.3 Optimization of biodiesel by using DOE The data attained from the experiments can be analyzed as interpret by using Design of Experiment (DOE) which is a mathematical procedure that is used for planning and conducting the said experiments [5]. DOE is also a statistical tool that is utilized in countless kind of process, system, product design, development, and optimization [5]. To optimize the effect of parameters such as methanol to oil ratio, amount of catalyst, and reaction temperature yield, the Factorial Central Composite Design (FCCD – Design Expert 11) was employed by using three central points and 17 runs."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) was used to determine the functional groups present in the catalyst of aluminum chloride hexahydrate ( AlCl 3 6 H 2 O ) which generated from aluminum foil waste. The infrared (IR) spectra of aluminum chloride hexahydrate catalyst is shown as in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2, the spectrum frequencies of 3291, 1644, 1329, 1143 1092, and 848 cm - 1 presented strong peaks whereas medium peaks were observed at wavelength of 2944 and 2908 cm - 1 . The spectrum frequency at 3291 cm - 1 was strong and broad because of the presence of intermolecular bonded of O – H stretching. The peak at wavelength 848 cm - 1 showed a strong C – Cl stretching which indicated the existence of acid catalyst in the crystalline form of aluminum chloride hexahydrate catalyst. The medium and repetitive peaks presented at wavelength 2944 and 2908 cm - 1 were because of the formation of C – H stretching. The sharp peak at 1092 cm - 1 could be attributed to O – H strong band linked to water molecules. Table 3 summarizes the vibration frequency (cm−1) of aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst. Fig. 3 displayed a XRD patterns of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3a, a diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 19.5° which is assigned to the (705) plane of pure PVA membrane. This suggests that PVA evolves as a semi- crystal. The PVA display a wide peak with a low intensity which indicates the semi crystal of the PVA [6]. Fig. 3b shows the catalyst XRD patterns as prepared with PVA concentration of 1.33 g⁄ml. It is the result of samples exhibited a well-crystallized aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst in cubic phase. The diffraction peak appeared at 2θ = 20.0° and 41.0°corresponding to (258) and (68) planes of aluminum chloride hexahydrate supported by PVA (aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst) become stronger at 65℃ with methanol to oil ratio of 18:1, and amount of catalyst of 2 wt% than that of pure PVA membrane. This implies that the addition of PVA to the catalyst preparation process can improves the crystallite aggregation of aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst [7]. From XRD results, there were presence of gibbsite ( AlC l 3 6 H 2 O ) which is one of the mineral forms of aluminum hydroxide. In conclusion, the addition of aluminum (III) oxide led to the formation of aluminum chloride hexahydrate which can improve the activity of catalyst."
7,Optimization of biodiesel by using DOE,"3.2 Optimization of biodiesel by using DOE For the experimental design of this study, the Design Expert software (version 11.0) had been utilized to fit the model in order to evaluate the effect of parameters such as methanol to oil ratio, amount of catalyst, and reaction temperature on the yield of biodiesel as well as optimization on the production of biodiesel. This experimental design composed of 17 runs altogether and was executed by using Factorial Central Composite Design (FCCD) with three central points. Each runs were being executed twice and the results of the optimization of the yield of biodiesel is presented as in Table 4 . The numerical and graphical optimisation methods of the programme helped to analyse variance (ANOVA) and response surfaces. According to Table 5 , the sum of squares obtained from the quadratic model was selected and the additional terms were significant. Model F-value of 9.30 indicated a 0.13% probability that such a high F-value will happen due to noise. The p-values that are less than 0.0500 suggested that the terms of the model were important. In this situation, the only important modelling terms were A, C, and AC. Values above 0.1000 suggested that the model term were not relevant. As there were several meaningless terms to the model, this model can be enhanced by model reduction. The lack of fit F-value of 0.74 suggested that there is no substantial lack of fit which was relative to the pure error. There was a 68.95% probability that there might be a lack of fit F-value due to noise. It can be inferred, based on Table 5, which the values obtained were in a fair agreement with an R2 value of 0.8481. The expected value of R2, 0.5884 was in fair agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.7569, because the variance was less than 0.2. The signal-to-noise ratio is calculated with reasonable accuracy and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable. It showed from the analysis that the ratio of adequate precision was 9.768 indicating an adequate signal, thus allowing this model to be used to traverse the design space. The Design-Expert three-dimensional plot surface is used to evaluate the interactions between the parameters on yield of biodiesel. It can be observed that the combined effects of methanol to oil ratio along with amount of catalyst were influencing the yield of biodiesel significantly. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the highest yield of biodiesel was achieved at 98.40% when the optimum conditions were methanol to oil ratio of 6:1, amount of catalyst of 2 wt% and temperature at 55℃. The increment of biodiesel yield was not significant when the methanol to oil ratio was more than 6:1 since there were 0.23% and 0.85% difference when methanol to oil ratio were at 12:1 and 18:1 respectively. Both increments happened at a higher temperature of 60 ℃ and 65℃ respectively and catalyst loading at 5 wt% and 8 wt% respectively. This revealed that higher temperature and catalyst amount are required to increase biodiesel yield even when the methanol to oil ratio is increased. The biodiesel yield also increases to 98.63% when amount of catalyst increased to 5 wt%. The increase in yield may be due to the presence of more catalyst’s active sites with increase in amount of catalyst. However, when the amount of catalyst was used in beyond this value, the viscosity of the biodiesel also increases which leads to problem with mixing and thus greater consumption of power is required for an adequate stirring [8]. It should be noted that the biodiesel yield could not achieved a higher value when excessive amount of catalyst is used since the reaction had reached equilibrium [9]. Based on Fig. 5 , it showed that the yield of biodiesel significantly increased from reaction temperature of 55℃ to 65℃. The efficiency of transesterification is improved when the reaction temperature increased. Hence, the yield of biodiesel also increased. The yield of biodiesel at 65℃, methanol to oil ratio of 18:1 and amount of catalyst at 8 wt% showed the highest achievement at 99.25%. However, when the temperature of reaction was greater than 65℃, the yield of the biodiesel starts to decrease. This indicated that the yield of biodiesel will be reduced due to the evaporation of methanol that lower the contact time between methanol and oil [9]. According to results presented in Fig. 5, the yield of biodiesel of 98.40% was obtained when the molar to oil ratio was 6:1 and temperature of the reaction was 55℃. This is because increasing methanol to oil ratio causes the equilibrium to shift to the product side and thereby favouring biodiesel production. However, when the methanol to oil ratio surpass the 6:1 M ratio, the yield of biodiesel was less significant since the increment was small but required higher temperature and catalyst loading. According to Lin & Hsiao, 2012, this was mainly due to increased solubility of the by-product (glycerol) when the methanol was in excessive quantity which compelled a reverse reaction in the process and thus lower the yield of biodiesel. Besides, the difficulty in separation of biodiesel will also double due to the excess solute of the by-product [10]. Therefore, methanol to oil ratio of 6:1 might be the optimal operating parameter for a higher yield of biodiesel with 98.40% at a reaction temperature of 55℃ and amount of catalyst of 2 wt%. Fig. 6 showed that the yield of biodiesel increased when the amount of catalyst and temperature increased. The highest yield of biodiesel of 98.63% was attained when the temperature of the reaction was 60℃ and amount of catalyst was 5 wt%. However, once the temperature exceed 65℃, the yield of biodiesel starts to decrease which showed that methanol was a volatile compound since it can easily evaporated into gases and generated a great amount of bubble once it exceed its boiling point which was 64.7℃ [11]. The transesterification will go even faster when the temperature was increased since the activity of the catalyst was intensified. This occurred due to the increased acceleration movement of molecule which boosted the frequency of collision from one molecule to another molecule [11]. The biodiesel compounds composed of long-chain methyl ester fatty acid with several carbon atoms ranging from 14 to 22 were classified using GC–MS analysis. Based on Table 6 , the percentage of each compounds present in the biodiesel was determined. The biodiesel was produced using waste cooking oil catalyzed by aluminum chloride hexahydrate/PVA catalyst at a concentration of 2 wt%, 6:1 methanol to oil ratio, and reaction temperature of 55℃ was used. It revealed the presence of palmitic acid with a retention time of 18.04 and its composition at 57.68% from the results of the GC–MS analysis. The sample also exhibited the presence of oleic acid with retention time of 24.14 and its composition at 35.98%. This finding is in accordance with Istiningrum, Aprianto, & Pamungkas, 2017, where it is stated that the main fatty acid content of WCO derived from palm oil are palmitic and oleic acid [12]."
8,Conclusion,"Biodiesel has received substantial global attention because of its renewability, biodegradability, non-toxicity and environmental benefits. For transportation, it is an innovative development alternative energy source. Transesterification is a widely used technique to produce biodiesel. This method capable to reduce the viscosity of oil or fat in the presence of acid or base catalyst and alcohol. Heterogeneous catalysts have greater product separation and better product consistency but possessed extreme conditions for reaction. The optimization of biodiesel using DOE, has been successfully attained. The heterogeneous acid catalyst ( AlCl 3 6 H 2 O )/PVA had been successfully synthesized from aluminium foil wastes supported by PVA. Based on the GC–MS analysis, there were 57.68% of palmitic acid and 35.98% of oleic acid present in the biodiesel yield. The maximum yield of biodiesel of 98.40% can be attained with optimum operating parameters of 6:1 for methanol to oil ratio, 2 wt% of amount of catalyst, and temperature of 55℃. The utilization of wastes as alternative ways to generate renewable source of energy would greatly contribute to reduction of cost production of biodiesel and reduction of waste disposal in general."
