0,Introduction,"With the declining of fossil fuels, it is urgent to develop more alternatives to meet the current demands [1,2]. It is well known that carbonyl compounds as the precursors of value-added chemicals have been extensively used in the confectionary fragrance and pharmaceutical industries [3–5]. Selective conversion of alcohols is an effective approach to obtain the intermediates of high-value chemicals. However, traditional strategies in transforming alcohols typically require toxic oxidants such as Cr (VI) or Mn (VII), which are hazardous to the environment [6]. Within this context, light-driven alcohols oxidation has attracted increasing attention because of its environmental friendliness and low consumption [7,8]. Among various photocatalytic alcohols transformation investigations, O2-mediated photocatalytic alcohols oxidation has been most studied [9–16], in which O2 acts as electron acceptors to promote the conversion of alcohols [6,17]. In comparison, replacing of oxygen with hydrogen protons for photoredox reaction is an ideal access to not only effectively utilize the energy of electron and holes but also acquire green fuels [18,19]. Therefore, photocatalytic alcohols oxidation coupling with hydrogen (H2) evolution under anaerobic conditions is a promising scheme to make full use of photogenerated electrons and holes simultaneously to obtain useful chemicals. In this regard, a number of semiconductor-based materials are applied on photo-driven splitting of alcohols into corresponding carbonyl compounds and H2, especially chalcogenides [18–22]. ZnIn2S4 (ZIS), a kind of ternary metal sulfide, is one of visible light response photocatalysts on account of its intrinsic band gap [23]. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of blank ZIS is limited because of the rapid recombination of photoexcited charge carriers [24]. One of the most effective approaches to ameliorate this obstacle is to introduce co-catalysts or design composites to accelerate the separation and transfer of the electron-hole pairs. To date, transition metal nickel (Ni) [22,25–27], with the advantages of non-toxicity and low-cost, is an ideal non-precious metal co-catalyst for photoreduction reaction (such as photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2 evolution), in which Ni can promote the charge migration by trapping the photoexcited electrons to improve photocatalytic efficiency. However, there are no reports on the application of Ni surface-modified ZIS composites in simultaneously tuning the photoredox activity and selectivity of product-oriented cooperative alcohol oxidation and H2 evolution. In this work, we have reported the synthesis of nickel-modified ZIS composites (Ni:ZIS) via a facile photodeposition method, and their high activity for photoredox dual reaction, selective conversion of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) integrated with H2 evolution under visible light by simultaneously utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes. In Ni:ZIS composites, Ni modification can not only speed up the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs but also act as α-H abstraction active sites to tune the selectivity. Moreover, the quenching experiments and the analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra jointly demonstrate that the photocatalytic BA conversion reaction occurs via a carbon-centered radical mechanism. The synergy of improved photogenerated charge transfer and Ni-assisted α-H abstraction for product-oriented alcohol oxidation integrated with H2 evolution can also be extended to Ni-based compounds (NixP and NiS) modified ZIS. It is anticipated that this study would be beneficial to rational modification of metal sulfide semiconductor with visible light response toward tuning activity and selectivity of photoredox-catalyzed cooperative production of value-added fine chemicals and H2 from biomass intermediates."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Thioacetamide (TAA, 99 %), indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O), nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), thiourea (H2NCSNH2), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetonitrile (MeCN), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), tert-butyl alcohol (C4H10O, tBuOH) and triethanolamine (C6H15NO3, TEOA) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (shanghai, China).

All reagents were used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water used in all the experiments was from local sources."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) was prepared according to a literature procedure with minor modifications [23]. The details were described in the Supporting Information. 2.2.2 Preparation of nickel modified ZIS (Ni:ZIS) composites Ni:ZIS was prepared by an in situ photodeposition method [22,28]. In detail, 30 mg ZIS was added in a mixture solution of a certain amount of NiCl2·6H2O and ethanol (30 mL). Subsequently, the resultant suspension was purged with nitrogen (N2) for 30 min to remove air and then irradiated under ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) light for 1 h with stirring. After illumination, the as-prepared Ni:ZIS composites were washed by ethanol, and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Finally, the as-obtained samples were kept under N2 atmosphere. The obtained ZIS with different weight ratios of Ni (0.3 %, 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %) were labeled as 0.3%Ni:ZIS, 0.5%Ni:ZIS, 1%Ni:ZIS, 2%Ni:ZIS, respectively. 2.2.3 Preparation of NixP:ZIS composites The preparation method of NixP:ZIS was the same as that of Ni:ZIS except using the NiCl2·6H2O and NaH2PO2 as the precursors. The obtained ZIS with different weight ratios of NixP (0.3 %, 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %) were labeled as 0.3%NixP:ZIS, 0.5xP:ZIS, 0.5%NixP:ZIS, 1%NixP:ZIS, 2%NixP:ZIS, respectively. 2.2.4 Preparation of NiS:ZIS composites The preparation method of NiS:ZIS was the same as that of Ni:ZIS except using the NiCl2·6H2O and thiourea as the precursors. The obtained ZIS with different weight ratios of NiS (0.3 %, 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %) were labeled as 0.3%NiS:ZIS, 0.5%NiS:ZIS, 1%NiS:ZIS, 2%NiS:ZIS, respectively."
4,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) integrated with hydrogen (H2) evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) integrated with hydrogen (H2) evolution The experiments were conducted referring to the previous work with some modifications [25]. Typically, photocatalysts (5 mg), 10 mL DI water and 0.1 mmol BA were added into a quartz reactor. Before irradiation, the mixture sonicated for 2 min and then purged with N2 gas for 15 min to remove air. Subsequently, the above mixture irradiated with visible light (λ > 420 nm) by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd) with energy output of 800 mW cm–2 measured by a Thor labs PM100 optical power and energy meter. Photoactivity of quenching experiments with addition of different scavengers (TEOA as scavenger for photogenerated holes [20], tBuOH alcohol as scavenger for hydroxyl radical [5,23], DMPO as scavenger for free radical species [30], and CCl4 as scavenger for photogenerated electrons [20]) were carried out similar to the above photoredox-catalyzed BA conversion integrated with H2 evolution except that scavengers (0.1 mmol) were added to the reaction system. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered through a 0.22 μm Nylon syringe filter and then analyzed using an external standard method by high performance liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu HPLC-LC20AT, C18 column, SPD-M20A) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Shimadzu GC–MS-QP 2010 SE, SH-Rxi-5Sil MS, helium (He) carrier). The produced gases were analyzed by gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014C, MS-5 A column, TCD, argon (Ar) carrier)."
5,Recycling tests of Ni:ZIS composites,"2.4 Recycling tests of Ni:ZIS composites The recycling tests for photocatalytic conversion of BA coupled with H2 evolution in water over Ni:ZIS were performed as follows. After the first run with light illumination (λ > 420 nm), the mixture was centrifuged, and washed by DI water for twice, then mixed with 10 mL DI water containing 0.1 mmol BA for continuous test. The conversion of BA and selectivity of BAD were calculated with the following equations [19]: Conversion ( % ) = n 0 − n BA n 0 × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = n BAD n 0 − n BA × 100 Here n0 is the initial moles of BA; nBA and nBAD are the moles of the residual BA and the corresponding BAD at a certain time after the catalytic reaction, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"The synthesis of nickel modified ZnIn2S4 (Ni:ZIS) composite is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Firstly, the blank ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) has been prepared via a hydrothermal method [23], and its morphology has been analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As disclosed in Fig. S1, the blank ZIS shows a flower-like morphology with size ranging from 0.5 μm to 4.5 μm. Afterward, Ni has been loaded onto the surface of ZIS via a photodeposition process with NiCl2 acting as the precursor [22,28] to obtain the composite of binary Ni:ZIS. As depicted in Fig. 1B and C, there is no significant change in the morphology of the Ni:ZIS compared to that of the blank ZIS. Additionally, from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), the identified lattice spacing of 0.32 nm is observed in Fig. 1D, which is indexed to the (102) crystal plane of ZIS [30,31]. The crystal plane of Ni species is hardly seen, which might be due to their amorphous structure and relatively low contents [32,33]. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum (Fig. 1E) reveals the existence of Ni, Zn, In, and S elements in the Ni:ZIS composite. Similarly, the element mapping results further verify the presence of these elements in Ni:ZIS (Fig. 1F). The above results demonstrate that Ni is uniformly loaded on ZIS nanoflowers, thereby forming the binary sample of Ni:ZIS composite. To glean more information of the crystal phase structure of the as-prepared samples, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been performed. Fig. 2 A displays XRD patterns of ZIS and Ni:ZIS with different weight ratios of Ni. Three main diffraction peaks at around 21.5°, 28.3°, and 47.2° of ZIS (JCPDS No. 65-2030) [24] appear in all as-obtained samples, indicating that the feature structure of ZIS is unchanged after the introduction of Ni. Noticeably, no diffraction peaks for Ni can be observed in Ni:ZIS composites because of its noncrystalline form and low loading weight [28], which are in great agreement with TEM results as discussed above. The valence states and element compositions of as-prepared samples are probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of Ni:ZIS composite (Fig. S2) manifests the presence of S, In, Zn and Ni elements in such binary sample, which is in accordance with the element mapping and EDX results as mentioned above. As sketched in Fig. 2B, the characteristic peaks with the binding energies of Zn 2p1/2 at 1045.5 eV and Zn 2p3/2 at around 1022.2 eV are ascribed to Zn2+ of ZIS [20,24]. The peaks of In 3d are centered at 452.8 eV (In 3d3/2) and 445.2 eV (In 3d5/2), which belong to In3+ [20,24] (Fig. 2C). The binding energies of S 2p peaks of 162.7 eV (S 2p1/2) and 161.4 eV (S 2p3/2) in Fig. 2D are assigned to S2– [24]. The Ni 2p peaks appear at 856.2 eV and 873.4 eV (Fig. 2E), which are in good agreement with Ni2+. The other doublet satellite peaks at 862.5 eV and 879.9 eV are attributed to Ni2+ in NiCl2 [26]. Notably, there is no peak indexed to the Ni metal (Ni°) because the metallic Ni is unstable under air and is easily oxidized to Ni2+. The optical properties of all as-obtained samples have been investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). As mirrored in Fig. 2F, blank ZIS shows a strong absorption edge at wavelength around 510 nm, attributing to the intrinsic band gap of ZIS [23]. Furthermore, owing to the Ni loading onto the surface of ZIS, the light absorption of Ni:ZIS binary composites in the region of visible light (500−800 nm) gradually enhances with the increase of the depositing weight ratios of Ni, which is in line with the color change of these samples (Fig. S4). To test the photoactivity of the as-obtained samples, the photoredox dual reaction for selective benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation along with hydrogen (H2) evolution is carried out in water under visible light (λ > 420 nm) for 5 h. As displayed in Fig. 3 A, the blank ZIS exhibits a relatively low photoactivity for H2 evolution (4.6 μmol) and benzaldehyde (BAD) (7.6 μmol) production. Hydrobenzoin (HB) (16.7 μmol) is the major product over blank ZIS by the C–C coupling reaction [20,34]. When Ni is decorated onto ZIS, the significantly increased photoactivity of both BAD and H2 generation has been achieved over Ni:ZIS. As shown in Fig. 3A, the 0.5 %Ni:ZIS photocatalyst displays the best H2 production of 36.5 μmol and an optimal BAD generation of 90.2 μmol, which are approximately 7.9 and 11.4 times as high as those over blank ZIS, respectively. Notably, BAD is the dominated product over Ni modified ZIS (Fig. S5), indicating the C–C coupling reaction is remarkably inhibited, thereby resulting in the enhanced BAD selectivity. This might be ascribed to the superior efficiency of Ni-assisted α-H abstraction [35]. Moreover, no significant inactivation is observed over the 0.5% Ni:ZIS after 5 times recycling experiments (Fig. 3B), indicating the good stability of the binary composite. As illustrated in Fig. S6, no remarkable difference of crystallographic structures is detected in 0.5%Ni:ZIS composites after recycling tests, further confirming the good phase stability of 0.5%Ni:ZIS composites. To in-depth elucidate the roles of Ni loading for enhancing the photocatalytic BA oxidation along with H2 evolution, the photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) measurements have been performed. Fig. 4 A depicts the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of ZIS and 0.5%Ni:ZIS electrodes without light irradiation, from which it can be found that the addition of Ni onto ZIS can obviously enhance the current density at a similar potential range, demonstrating that the loading of Ni can efficiently enhance the charge transfer [36]. The transient photocurrent responses of ZIS and 0.5%Ni:ZIS under chopped visible light irradiation displays in Fig. 4B. The blank ZIS shows a lower photocurrent response than that of 0.5%Ni:ZIS, indicating that the introduction of Ni can inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in binary 0.5%Ni:ZIS [37]. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) has been performed to investigate the charge transport between the sample and electrolyte [38]. As displayed in Fig. 4C, the 0.5%Ni:ZIS demonstrates more depressed semicircle at high frequency than blank ZIS, confirming that the more efficient transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is obtained over the 0.5%Ni:ZIS than that over blank ZIS. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of different samples measured under 430 nm monochromatic light excitation are employed to gain insight into the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. As depicted in Fig. 4D, the PL intensity decreases after photodepositing Ni onto ZIS, which clearly reveals an efficient suppressing recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in 0.5%Ni:ZIS composite. All of above results confirm that the loading of Ni can efficiently facilitate the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, thereby boosting the activity of photoredox-catalyzed cooperative BA transformation and H2 evolution. To further investigate the reaction process, several control experiments have been conducted (Table S2). As disclosed in Table S2 (entries 1–3), either in dark or in the absence of photocatalyst, the photoredox dual reaction is hardly conducted, implying that such photoredox dual reaction is indeed a light-driven process. When deionized (DI) water is replaced by acetonitrile (MeCN), the yield of H2 decreases from 36.5 μmol to 1.08 μmol (Table S2, entry 4). This is clear that H2 is mainly from water. In order to investigate the possible reaction mechanism, various quenching experiments are conducted to verify the active species in this system. As shown in Table S3 (entries 2 and 3), when the triethanolamine (TEOA) scavenger for holes [20] or the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) scavenger for electrons [20] is added into the reaction system, the yield of BAD or H2 is in a decline, demonstrating both photogenerated holes and electrons are consumed in the reaction. Additionally, the addition of 0.1 mmol tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH), a hydroxyl radical ( OH) scavenger [39], shows a negligible influence on the conversion of BA (Table S3, entry 4), manifesting that OH is not the active species in the reaction. To gain more hints on radical intermediates mechanism, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique using 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping regent is utilized to detect the carbon-centered free radicals in this reaction. As mirrored in Fig. 5 , there is no free radical signal in dark. However, the signal for DMPO−CH(OH)Ph located at g = 2.0063 appears over 0.5 %Ni:ZIS with visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm), indicating the generation of CH(OH)Ph free radicals [21,40,41]. Furthermore, with addition of DMPO as a free radicals scavenger [27], the generation of BAD reduces from 97 μmol to 55 μmol (Table S3, entry 5), confirming that the selective BA oxidation occurs via the carbon-centered radical mechanism [29,42]. Similarly, a signal associated with DMPO−CH(OH)Ph is also observed on blank ZIS irradiated by visible light, but the intensity of the EPR signal of this DMPO−CH(OH)Ph for blank ZIS is weaker than that for 0.5%Ni:ZIS, which is in accord with the above photoactivity trend. In terms of above analyses, the surface modification of Ni is a facile strategy with high performance for selective BA oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. We further extend to other Ni-based compounds such as NixP and NiS using the analogous photochemical deposition method. The XPS results confirm the existence of Ni, P on the NixP:ZIS composite as well as Ni, S on the NiS:ZIS (Fig. S7), indicating that NixP:ZIS or NiS:ZIS has been successfully prepared. As disclosed in Fig. S10, NixP or NiS modified ZIS exhibits the similar photoactivity and selectivity consequences to the Ni:ZIS, suggesting that the introduction of Ni-based compounds not only enhances the photoactivity of BA oxidation as well as H2 formation, but also boosts the selectivity of BAD. These results together prove the generality of Ni-based compounds modified ZIS for boosting the activity of such photoredox dual reaction and tuning the product selectivity. Based on the above analyses, we propose a tentative mechanism for photoredox-catalyzed BA conversion coupled with H2 evolution over Ni:ZIS (Scheme 1 ). Upon the illumination of visible light, ZIS in Ni:ZIS composite is first excited to generate electrons and holes, and then the electrons migrate from the conduction band (CB) of ZIS to the Ni sites. These photogenerated electrons combine with protons from water to produce H2. Meanwhile, a proton abstracted from the OH group of the BA is adsorbed on ZIS surface and the other proton abstracted from C–H adsorbed on Ni site, affording a carbon-centered radical and two abstracted protons. Subsequently, this carbon-centered radical is oxidized by holes to form BAD, and abstracted protons are either adsorbed on Ni:ZIS or reduced by photogenerated electrons to yield H2."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we have synthesized binary samples of nickel surface-modified ZnIn2S4 (Ni:ZIS) via an in situ photodeposition approach to boost the activity of the photoredox dual reaction, in which benzyl alcohol (BA) is oxidized by photogenerated holes into benzaldehyde (BAD) under visible light (λ > 420 nm), while proton hydrogen from water is reduced by electrons to produce hydrogen (H2). Compared to the blank ZIS, the Ni modified samples exhibit enhanced capacity of the charge carrier separation, which leads to a significant increase in the production of H2 and BAD. In addition, the introduction of Ni is favorable to α-H abstraction, thereby resulting in a superior BAD selectivity on Ni:ZIS. On the other hand, quenching experiments and spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance studies together elucidate the carbon-centered free radicals are the primary active species for the BA transformation. Notably, Ni-based compounds (NixP and NiS) modified ZIS are also found to be feasible for tuning the activity and selectivity of photoredox-catalyzed dual BA conversion integrated with H2 evolution. This work is expected to aid rational design of photocatalysts with ancillary surface modification to efficiently utilize photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby obtaining the high-value added fine chemicals and clean fuels."
