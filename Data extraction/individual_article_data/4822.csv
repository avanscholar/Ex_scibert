0,Introduction,"There are noticeable opportunities in the transport and energy sector to use alternative fuels to replace petroleum fuels due to growing concerns about climate change and air quality. An example of such an alternative fuel is “renewable” methanol (MeOH) produced using surplus electricity from renewable energy sources (RESs). It can be successfully used as a replacement or addition to diesel and gasoline [1]. The development of RESs is based on the adopted Directive 2009/28/EC, which indicates that EU member states should increase their share of electricity production from RESs to 20% by 2020. The directive contains mandatory goals for each individual member state until 2020. In the case of Poland, this is 15% for the entire energy sector and 10% for the transport fuel sector [2]. The production of “renewable” methanol is based on four basic sources: biomass, municipal waste, industrial waste, and CO2 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]. The first three variants mentioned are based on gasification technology and catalytic conversion. The main producers on the global market who use these technologies include: Chemrec and Värmlands Methanol (Sweden), Blue Fuel Energy and Enerkem (Canada), BioMCN (Netherlands), and Carbon Recycling International (Iceland) [8] [9]. The last option uses CO2, water, and surplus electricity from RESs. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 is currently the technology with the largest development perspective and a relatively high probability of being introduced as a large-scale commercial technology in the near future [10]. The integration of a wind farm with a hydrogen production installation and then methanol also looks interesting from the point of view of the new RED II Directive [11]. The directive sets the consumption targets for renewable energy sources in 2021–2030. It also introduces many changes in the area of certification of sustainable biofuel production, which will apply from 2021. Together with the Energy Efficiency Directive [12] and the Energy Union Management Regulation [13], they constitute the new EU energy strategy for the next decade. The aim of the adopted regulations is to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the EU energy mix to 32% by 2030, which in turn is expected to lead - along with the implementation of measures to increase energy efficiency - to reduce EU CO2 emissions by 40% compared to emissions in 1990. This, in turn, is in line with the European Green Deal policy on reducing CO2 emissions [14]. Prosumers who have a lot of space devoted to RED II because the directive introduces the definition of ‘renewable energy prosumer’ should contribute to increasing the EU’s 2030 target for renewable energy. This means that the subject of research treated as an investment may also include the construction of its own wind farm to produce electricity as a prosumer, which will significantly affect the economic effect. Methanol and its synthesis products, such as DME (dimethyl ether), MTBE (tert-butyl methyl ether), and MTG (Methanol-to-gasoline), are used in both the energy and fuel sectors. The literature on the subject [15] [16], promoting this approach, has introduced the so-called “methanol management” concept, based on the production of methanol from coal, CO2, biogas or other sources for use in transport and energy based on the methanol combustion process. The DMFC (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell) [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and RMFC (Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell) [23] fuel cells are an alternative technology for the use of methanol in the energy field. The use of “renewable” methanol gives an opportunity to achieve the objectives set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, popularizing RESs, and improving the functioning of the energy system through energy storage. Renewable methanol is an ultra-low carbon chemical produced from sustainable biomass, often called. Bio-methanol, or from carbon dioxide and hydrogen produced from renewable electricity. Renewable methanol is chemically identical to fossil based methanol with one, internationally accepted specification (IMPCA). The largest functioning commercial plant producing methanol from CO2 is the George Olah plant (belonging to Carbon Recycling International) established in Svartsengi in Iceland near a 76.5 MW geothermal power plant [24]. This installation produces 5 million dm3/year using 5500 tons of CO2 per year. This methanol produced is sold on the fuel market under the trade name Vulcanol™. A commercial methanol plant that converts captured CO2 to methanol was also built at the Lünen coal power plant in Germany. The installation at the Lünen power plant belongs to Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe and produces 1 ton of methanol per day, consuming 1.4 tons of CO2 and 1 MW of electricity. This unit is the first attempt in history to integrate a commercial coal power plant operating at variable load with the generation of liquid methanol [25]. Worldwide, over 90 methanol plants have a combined production capacity of about 110 million metric tons (almost 36.6 billion gallons or 138 billion liters). According to IHS, global methanol demand reached 75 million metric tons in 2015 (24 billion gallons/91 billion liters), driven in large part emerging energy applications for methanol which now account for 40% of methanol consumption. Each day, nearly 200,000 tons of methanol is used as a chemical feedstock or as a transportation fuel (67 million gallons/254 million liters). That’s enough methanol every day to fill nearly 7500 tanker trucks stretching end-to-end for 63 miles or 100 km [26]. The examples of such installation (existing and planned) are compared in Table 1 . It should be noted that so far only one and the most recent installation works with CO2 obtained from flue gas (from power plant) and H2 obtained from electrolysis. Its productivity (365 tons/year) is very small, the subject of this article may contribute to the development of this type of installations, in particular to increasing their efficiency. The available literature in this field of research is carried out mainly by chemists and focuses on the chemical side of the problem of liquid methanol production [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36]. Analyses covering the production of methanol from renewable energy sources such as solar farms [37] or wind farms [38] [39] [40] [41] are usually conducted for one operating point. The advantage of this research is the fact that the model of the analyzed installation was integrated with the generation characteristics of a real wind farm. The methanol yields obtained from the analyzed structure of the “renewable” methanol production plant are consistent with those presented in the literature [42], therefore it can be assumed that the tested system is correctly validated. The CO2 used for methanol production can come not only from power plants, but also from industrial plants, iron works, chemical plants, refineries, and cement plants. Carbon Recycling International (CRI) oversees the FReSMe project to build an installation producing methanol from CO2 from steel works. The installation is to be implemented at the Swerea MEFOS facility in Sweden. The methanol produced will be entirely used by the Swedish ferry operator Stena, which operates the passenger ferry Stena Germanica, powered by liquid methanol [43]. Due to the potential of the described methanol production technology, the authors will present an analysis of an installation for the production and purification of methanol produced from CO2 and H2, the latter being produced from surplus electricity from renewable energy. A literature overview of issues regarding production of liquid methanol from CO2 and H2 generated from renewable energy is given by Gonzalez-Aparicioet al. [44]. Although the idea of methanol generation from wind farm and captured CO2, including an economic assessment thereof, has been presented in literature [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52], none of these studies addresses integration options for utilities between electrolysis, CO2 capture and methanol synthesis. In this study options for heat integration between process steps are evaluated. The production of methanol from air and nuclear energy has been proposed by Steinberg and Dang [53] in 1977 already. Moreover, this study is one of the few [53] [54] to include CO2 capture in the process evaluation instead of assuming the availability of a pure CO2 feed stream [46] [51] [52]. In these earlier studies, opportunities for process integration are disregarded. Besides integration of utilities, this is the first study to evaluate physical integration of process steps for standalone methanol production. Methanol has proven to be an ideal engine fuel in many respects. Due to the high heat of vaporization and the relatively low calorific value, a much lower combustion chamber temperature is achieved than with conventional motor fuels. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are also lower. One problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols corrode some metals, particularly aluminium. Methanol can be used in various proportions along with conventional petroleum products. Increasing the percentage of methanol in gasoline, however, necessitates the modification of motor vehicles and fuel distribution [55]: • M3, a mixture of 3% methanol with 2–3% solubilizers (for example isopropyl alcohol) in a commercial motor fuel. This system is already widely used. • M15, a mixture of 15% methanol and solubilizer with motor fuel; in this case, changes to the motor vehicles are necessary. • M85, methanol containing 15% C4–C5 hydrocarbons to improve cold starting. It is necessary to modify the engine and fuel distribution system. • M100, pure methanol. Vehicles must have significant modifications and be fully adapted to work with methanol. Necessary operational modifications of engines include the replacement of plastics used in the fuel system. They must also have a properly adapted ignition system and fuel injection unit. The M85 and M100 fuel mixtures must be preheated prior to combustion, as evaporation of a stoichiometric amount of methanol in the injection system will cool it by 120 °C. It is not possible to use methanol directly in diesel engines because the methanol cetane number is too low and the methanol does not ignite. Therefore, methanol must be converted to dimethyl ether (DME), which is considered an excellent alternative to diesel fuel. Methanol after conversion with appropriate fats and oils allows obtaining fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), called biodiesel. In 2011, 6% of global methanol production was used to produce 35 biodiesel. Further biodiesel production is expected to increase, especially in South America [56]. An interesting case of using methanol as a fuel is the use of methanol produced by Swerea MEFOS in Luleå, Sweden to drive the Stena Germanica passenger ferry owned by the Swedish ferry operator Stena. This solution allowed to reduce sulfur emissions by about 99%, nitrogen by 60% and carbon dioxide by 25% compared to traditional fuel [57]. From January 1, 2020, all new cars sold in Europe will comply with the Euro 6D-Temp emission standard. It obliges manufacturers to sell cars with an average CO2 emission per km of 95 gCO2/km. This standard also covers new types of combustion engines developed according to the “rightsizing” concept in the LD and HD versions, also adapted to a new generation of engine fuels and alternative fuels (with additives HVO, ethanol/methanol, low carbon fuels, CNG, hydrogen) [58]. This article presents energy storage technology in the form of “renewable” methanol based on the use of H2 generated in the process of water electrolysis and CO2 obtained as a result of sequestration from a power plant’s exhaust gas. This system is therefore an extensive chain of power-to-fuel-to-power technologies. To assess the potential of energy carrier production in the form of liquid fuel with wide applications, the analysis began with a simulation of the cooperation of RESs together with the installation of HGs. A real wind farm WF with a nominal power of 40 MW was selected as a distributed renewable energy generating unit and calculations were made for the annual work cycle. The article contains a unique (compared to the literature on the subject) analysis of integration of renewable energy source (wind farm), hydrogen generating installation (electrolysis installation) with methanol production and purification installation carried out in a wide range of power used from a renewable source, combined with the selection of the structure of installations preparing substrates to the methanol reactor. Research in the production of “renewable” methanol, i.e. produced from H2 (obtained from overproduction of electricity from RESs) and captured CO2 (e.g. from a power plant’s exhaust gases) is part of the current trend of searching for new methods in the field of energy storage and future fuel production. Due to the fact that H2 is characterized by a low energy density per unit volume and there are problems in its storage due to the size of the gas particles (H2 penetration through the walls of the tank) and the issue of transport (injection into the existing natural gas pipeline and the need for its separation at the destination), it was proposed to convert it to liquid methanol, which is not characterized by the abovementioned problems. The aim of the research was to study the use of overproduced electricity from RES, in particular by a real wind farm. Overproduced electricity - produced during the night valley period is very difficult to sell, usually at a very low price (sometimes even negative - which means that the buyer receives money for receiving energy). The available literature in this field of research is carried out mainly by chemists and focuses on the chemical side of the issue of liquid methanol production. The authors presented this topic in the energy aspect. An additional advantage of this research is the fact that the model of the analyzed installation was integrated with the generation characteristics of a real wind farm. The benefit of this study is both the presentation of the problem from the perspective of maximizing the efficiency of the entire installation (selection of the ratio NHG. nom/NWF.nom; selection of the number of CO2 compression sections and presentation of the relationship between the efficiency of the hydrogen generator and the methanol generator (eq. (10)) but also from the energy side (showing how small the power from the power plant must be to cover the installation’s needs CO2). A unique methodology for determining the efficiency of the entire methanol production plant was also developed. This allows to maximize this efficiency. The influence of the ratio of the hydrogen generator power to the wind farm power (NHG/NWF) and the number of compression sections on this efficiency is shown here. From the energy side. It is also unique to show the capacity of a fossil fuel-fired power plant from which CO2 is captured depending on the NHG/NWF. It should be noted that the tests (calculations) were performed as a function of the dimensionless NHG/NWF ratio - thus the work is universal - the results can be transferred to any power of these devices."
1,Methodology for assessing the efficiency of the entire system,"Fig. 1 shows the energy diagram of the installation for the production of “renewable” methanol with balance shields. Surplus electricity from an RES (in the case at hand from a WF) is directed to a water electrolysis installation (HG), in which H2 and O2 are produced. The H2 stream is directed to the compression installation to prepare it as a substrate for the MR. The CO2 captured from the exhaust gases emitted by the power plant is directed to its compression system and then it goes to the reactor, in which liquid methanol is produced. The production of methanol is based on exothermic reactions of H2 with CO2 or carbon monoxide according to the following reaction equations: (1) CO g + 2 H 2 ( g ) ↔ CH 3 OH ( l ) Δ H = - 128 kj/mol ( 298 K ) (2) CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) ↔ CH 3 OH ( l ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H = − 87 kJ/mol ( 298 K ) In parallel, there is also an endothermic reaction of the reverse conversion of water gas: (3) CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) ↔ CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H = − 41 k J / m o l ( 298 K ) The mass of substrates and products in the methanol synthesis reaction (2) for 1 kg H2 is as follows: (4) 7.277 Kg CO 2 ( g ) + 1 kg H 2 ( g ) ↔ 5.298 kg CH 3 OH l + 2.979 H 2 O ( g ) where molar masses were taken from Ref. [59]: MCO2 = 44.00950 g/mol; MH2 = 2.01588 g/mol; MCH3OH = 32.04190 g/mol; MH2O = 18.01528 g/mol. The efficiency of the entire methanol production unit was defined as the quotient of the chemical energy of the methanol produced and the sum of power supplied to the generator together with the power for the unit’s own needs: (5) η = E ˙ c h M e O H N H G + N δ = m ˙ M e O H ⋅ H H V M e O H N H G + N δ The efficiency of the HG was calculated as the product of the mass stream of H2 produced and its heat of combustion related to the power supplied to the generator: (6) η H G = E ˙ c h H 2 N H G = m ˙ H 2 ⋅ H H V H 2 N H G The efficiency of the MG was determined as the product of the mass flow of methanol produced and its heat of combustion related to the sum of the chemical energy of H2 and the power for their own needs of individual installations: (7) η M G = E ˙ c h M e O H E ˙ c h H 2 + N δ = m ˙ M e O H ⋅ H H V M e O H m ˙ H 2 ⋅ H H V H 2 + N δ The power for their own needs of individual installations is understood as the sum of the power needed to drive a H2 compressor, a CO2 compressor, and two fans in the methanol purification installation: (8) N δ = N H 2 + N C O 2 + N F (9) N F = N F . 1 + N F . 2 Using the above dependencies on the efficiency of individual installations, and taking into account the power supplied to the H2 production installation and the power for their own needs of individual installations, the efficiency of the entire system can also be presented as follows: (10) η = η M G ⋅ η H G ⋅ α + 1 η H G α + 1 where: (11) α = N H G N δ The efficiency of the MG (equation (6)) can also be defined taking into account the efficiency of electricity transmission from the reference power plant to the methanol purification installation and the efficiency of electricity generation in the reference power plant according to the formula: (12) η M G . η = m ˙ M e O H ⋅ H H V M e O H m ˙ H 2 ⋅ H H V H 2 + N δ η t r ⋅ η e l . R If the heat recovery from the installation and the energy contained in the so-called residual gases, the efficiency of the net MG will be: (13) η M G . Q = m ˙ M e O H ⋅ H H V M e O H + ∑ i = 1 2 Q ˙ i m ˙ H 2 ⋅ H H V H 2 + N δ (14) η M G . Q . E ˙ = m ˙ M e O H ⋅ H H V M e O H + ∑ i = 1 2 ( m ˙ R e s G a s ) i ⋅ ( H H V R e s G a s ) i ˙ + ∑ i = 1 5 Q ˙ i m ˙ H 2 ⋅ H H V H 2 + N δ"
2,Analysis of the potential of using energy from a wind farm,"The first step necessary to determine the possibility of producing H2 based on electricity from renewable sources was the analysis of the annual work cycle of a WF with a nominal capacity of 40 MW located in Poland in the temperate transition zone. Zero power generation periods are therefore not included in real-time operation. For the purposes of illustrating the annual degree of utilization of the nominal power, the WF rated power index was introduced, which was defined according to the relationship (15) as the ratio of the average annual farm power to its nominal power. When determining the average power, periods of zero power generation were taken into account. (15) δ W F = N W F . a v N W F . n o m Knowing the actual farm operation time, it is possible to determine the average power and the rated power index in relation to its level. It was decided, however, to present these values for the full year to include periods with zero power generation. Data on the WF are presented in Table 2 . Analyzing the data collected in Table 2, it should be noted that power generation took place over 92.71% of the duration of a full year. The rated power indicator indicates that slightly more than 22.6% of the nominal WF capacity is used annually. The annual work cycle of the analyzed WF, which illustrates its generation instability, is presented in Fig. 2 . The farm operation characteristics shown in Fig. 2 show the occurrence of significant power fluctuations. The production shows diversity in both its daily and annual cycles. In order to fully illustrate the annual operation of the farm and determine the time of work with a given power, it is convenient to use the ordered graph, which is shown in Fig. 3. It presents the ratio of WF power to rated power to facilitate the interpretation of the obtained production level. The analyzed WF did not work for 639 h. Assuming its use in the electrolysis process only as part of the energy generated by a WF, one should expect a reduction in the operation time of the energy installation due to periods of zero power generation. For about 1330 h, which corresponds to just over 15.1% of the overall duration of the year, the WF obtained power below 1% of the rated power or no electricity was generated at all. For nearly 3625 h (including the zero generation period), the farm obtained power below 10% of the rated power, so for a significant part of the year (about 41.4% of the year) energy production was relatively low. In addition, it is worth noting that the farm had a power generation exceeding the level of 50% of the rated power for only 1250 h, and the level of 80% for less than 410 h. Thus, the degree of utilization of the rated power takes high values for a relatively short time in a year. In order to determine the average annual WF capacity, the annual energy generation was determined in the first step. For this purpose, numerical integration using the trapezoidal method was used. It was assumed that the average power of a farm in a given hour occurred at its beginning. Thus, the average power in the first hour is the first point on the power waveform N WF = f(τ) graph shown in Fig. 2. An ordered chart of wind farm power is presented in Fig. 3 . The electricity generated is therefore the area under the curve. The use of the trapezoidal method increases the accuracy of energy determination due to better mapping of the area under the curve relative to the rectangular method. For the adopted method, the approximate integral value is calculated from the general formula: (16) ∫ τ s τ e f ( τ ) d τ ≈ 1 2 ( τ e − τ s ) ⋅ [ f ( τ s ) + f ( τ e ) ] The integration interval starts from 1 h to 8760. The wide integration interval reduces the accuracy of the method, so it is necessary to specify the integration step and divide it into sub-ranges. As part of determining the energy value, it was divided into n = 8759 sub-ranges, which correspond to the number of hourly intervals, taking into account that average-hourly values are brought to the beginning of a given hour. Therefore, the area was divided into n rectangular trapezoids with a height corresponding to the integration step, which is determined by the formula: (17) d τ = τ e − τ s n The integration step determined in accordance with equation (17) is d τ = 1. Thus, the value of the function f(τ) at subsequent points, assumes the power values for subsequent hours. The formula used for the trapezoidal method to determine energy production, is as follows: (18) E W F = ∫ τ s τ e f ( τ ) d τ ≈ d τ [ f ( τ s ) + f ( τ e ) 2 + ∑ i = 1 n − 1 f ( τ s + i ⋅ d τ ) ] Based on the determined value of the annual energy generation, the average annual power of the WF was determined by dividing the energy production for the full duration of the year, τ real = 8760 h, which is described by the relationship (19): (19) N W F . n o m = E W F τ r e a l The rated WF capacity index, δ F W , determined as part of the analysis is defined as the ratio of the average annual WF power to its nominal power: (20) δ W F . r e a l = N W F . a v N W F . n o m The calculations made it possible to determine the annual energy production of the analyzed WF, which in the analyzed year amounted to approximately 79,265 MWh. The average annual power calculated on this basis was 9.05 MW. The annual rated power utilization rate of 0.2262 indicates that the potential of the WF was not fully utilized due to the occurrence of variable weather conditions. In order to equalize energy production, and especially energy accumulation during the night, it is convenient to use energy storage. Therefore, an analysis of the cooperation of the analyzed farm with the installation of HGs was conducted."
3,Analysis of the cooperation of the hydrogen generator with a wind farm,
4,Assumptions for analysis,"4.1 Assumptions for analysis As part of the analysis of the cooperation, it was assumed that the energy generated by the WF is stored during the night valley from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. It is used directly for the electrolysis process. As part of the analysis, the dynamics of the HGs was omitted, not taking into account their load characteristics in the range of the variable load. It was assumed that the installation might consist of several smaller HGs that operated at their rated efficiency. This assumption justifies the omission of the use of load characteristics and changes in the efficiency of the installation. The characteristics of the generator’s rated efficiency as a function of its capacity were adopted based on our own research [60] in the form of equation (21) and Fig. 4 . The main assumptions in the analysis are summarized in Table 3 . (21) η H G . n o m = η 0 + a ⋅ l n ( m ˙ H 2 . n o m ) where: a = 0.03106675; η 0 = 0.62846617."
5,Calculation methodology,"4.2 Calculation methodology In the first step, the amount of energy transferred to the H2 installation during the night valleys was determined, as it determines the amount of H2 produced (see Fig. 6 ). The amount of energy supplied to HGs depends not only on WF production, but also on the adopted level of their nominal power. The method of its determination is identical as in the case of a WF, i.e. trapezoidal integration was used. However, it should be noted that the power waveform is limited by the nominal power of the HG. The excess power obtained from the farm is transferred to the network, whereas if the farm power is less than the nominal power, the whole amount is directed to the water electrolysis process. An example of a graphical interpretation of the cooperation is presented in Fig. 7 . The dashed line marked on the graph Fig. 7 symbolizes the level of the nominal power of the HGs. The field is limited by the farm power curve and the straight line in the period of 10 p.m. - 6 a.m. expresses the amount of energy transferred to the energy storage installation. The equation of the straight line passing through two points and the place of intersection of this straight line and the simple nominal power of the HG are then determined. The place indicated on the x-axis gives the moment of time in which the intersection point occurs. The coordinates of the intersection point are determined using the system of equations: (22) { y = a 1 x + b 1 y = b 2 = N H G . n o m However, it is necessary to solve the system of equations by first determining the straight-line equation. For this purpose, the matrix method can be used, or it is possible to specify the coefficients for the line passing through two points. As part of the analysis, matrices were used to determine the solution. The area under the curve was then determined taking into account the intersection point. One sub-compartment was calculated by the rectangle method: (23) E H G . i . a r e a . I . r e a l = ∫ τ s x f ( τ ) d τ ≈ ( x − τ s ) ⋅ f ( x ) The second one – by the trapezoidal method: (24) E H G . i . a r e a . 2 . r e a l = ∫ x τ e f ( τ ) d τ ≈ 1 2 ( τ e − x ) ⋅ ( f ( τ e ) + f ( x ) ) (25) E H G . i . r e a l = E H G . i . a r e a . I . r e a l + E H G . i . a r e a . 2 . r e a l For the calculation of annual H2 production, it is necessary to determine the total annual electricity transferred to the electrolysis process, which was carried out according to the exact method. (26) E H G . r e a l = ∑ i = 1 n E H G . i . r e a l The average annual efficiency of HGs can be determined by the relationship: (27) η H G . r e a l = m H 2 . r e a l ⋅ H H V H 2 H G . r e a l where: m H2. real – annual amount of H2 produced. HHV H2 – higher heating value. The authors combined both methods in order to obtain the exact value of the energy transferred to the electrolysis installation. For hours where there is no intersection, the rectangle method was used, while for hours where there is an intersection, i.e. only a certain part of a given hour, energy is transferred to the hydrogen generator, the trapezoidal method was used, because this is the field, as shown in Fig. 7 in the manuscript. If only 1 integration method was used, the obtained results would be erroneous. On the other hand, based on the annual production of H2, its average hourly stream per year can be determined, directed to the methanol production installation according to equation (30), assuming the number of hours of operation of the methanol production installation in the year τ real [e.g. τ real = 8760 h]: (28) m ˙ H 2 . a v = m H 2 . r e a l τ r e a l The evaluation of energy storage installations is conveniently based on the size of dimensionless indicators. Using them allows interpretation of the impact of assumed parameters on the installation’s operation. In addition, it is beneficial when performing variant analysis. Therefore, the values of indicators for the installation of HGs cooperating with a WF were determined, which include both working time as well as power and energy. The indicators used included: a) The maximum working time indicator, d, was defined as the ratio of the actual working time of the energy storage installation, τ H G to the maximum installation time, τ H G . m a x : (29) d = τ H G τ H G . m a x b) The nominal power of HG indicator, δ HG – this indicator expresses the ratio of the average power of the HGs, N HG. av , during installation operation to their nominal power, N HG,nom : (30) δ H G = N H G . a v N H G . n o m The average annual power of HGs is determined as the quotient of energy transferred to the energy storage installation, E HG. real to its actual working time τ H G : (31) N H G . a v = E H G . r e a l τ H G c) The electricity storage indicator, γ, is defined as the ratio of the annual energy transferred to the HGs E HG. real , to the total energy generated by the WF, E WF : (32) γ = E H G . r e a l E W F d) The working time with nominal power indicator, ε, expresses the ratio of working time with nominal power τ H G . n o m to the actual working time of the energy storage installation, τ H G : (33) ε = τ H G . n o m τ H G"
6,Assessment of the possibility of cooperation between a hydrogen generator and a wind farm,"4.3 Assessment of the possibility of cooperation between a hydrogen generator and a wind farm In studies on the energy use of hydrogen, attention should be paid to the possibility of its production by electrolysis, especially when electrolysers can be powered by electricity from photovoltaic cells or wind generators. Currently, there are three types of electrolysers in which water is decomposed to obtain hydrogen fuel. Those are (comparison is presented in Table 4 ): • Alkaline electrolysis Cell (AEC): The electrolyte in these electrolysers is an aqueous solution of hydroxide, most often KOH. The electrodes are separated by a porous membrane to prevent mixing of the released hydrogen and oxygen. The process is carried out at a temperature of 60–80 °C under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 90–100 °C in pressure electrolysers. The efficiency is around 70%. • Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (PEMEC): The electrolysis process is mediated by a polymer membrane with high ionic conductivity. The charge carrier in this case are hydrogen ions (protons). The materials used to make the membranes are manufactured by a number of companies. During the electrolyser operation, hydrogen is evolved at the cathode. The electrolysis is carried out at a temperature of 50–80 °C. The electrolysis efficiency is 70–80%, while the obtained hydrogen has a purity of 99.999%. These devices are in the pre-commercial phase. • Solide Oxide Electroysis Cell (SOEC). The electrolyte in these electrolysers is a ceramic membrane which is conductive through oxide ions. Typically, these membranes are made of yttrium oxide stabilized zirconium oxide. As a result of the electro-reduction reaction, atomic oxygen is formed, while hydrogen mixed with water vapor is in the cathode compartment of the electrolyser. The electrolysis temperature is 650–1000 °C. High temperature electrolysers are currently very expensive due to the materials used in their construction. The electrolysis process itself requires a lot of energy. The energy transferred to the energy storage installation was determined in accordance with the given methodology, and the results obtained for various levels of the nominal power of the generator relative to the nominal power of a WF are illustrated in the graph presented in Fig. 8 . It was changed starting from a level of 45% with a step of 2.5%, with the minimum value equal to 1%. When analyzing the graph presented in Fig. 8, it can be seen that a higher level of the nominal power of the HG determines the possibility of storing additional amount of energy generated in the night valley by the WF. The positive effect of increasing the amount of energy transferred to the energy storage installation is increasingly limited as the installed capacity of HGs increases. The results of further analysis, including the values of the defined indicators d, δ HG , γ, and ε, are presented in Fig. 9 . Additionally, Fig. 9 shows the production potential of the storage installation, understood as the annual amount of H2 produced. Analyzing the results of the analysis presented in Fig. 9, it can be seen that the indicator for the use of the maximum working time, d, remains independent of the adopted level of nominal power of the HG installation. The value of this indicator indicates that the storage installation worked for about 93.9% of the total duration of the night valleys during the year. It is worth noting that the analyses omitted the minimum power needed to start the HG installation, which may further limit the operating time. When analyzing the graph in Fig. 9, it can be seen that the rated power indicator of the HGs, δ HG , shows a downward trend in relation to the increase in the level of their nominal power. This decrease is caused by the extension of the working time with power below the nominal power. When assessing this indicator, it is convenient to refer to the ordered power WF graph (Fig. 3) and to the working time indicator with nominal power, ε. As emphasized, the generation capacity of a WF is below 50% of its rated capacity for a significant part of the year. The operating time index with nominal power is more limited than the rated power index of HGs as their nominal power increases. At a level of 45% of the farm’s nominal power, it decreases to around 16.8%. The operating time when the installation uses its full potential is therefore relatively short. The electricity storage index, γ, is characterized by an increase with an increasing ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom . It should be emphasized that the increase in its value along with the increase of the nominal power level is gradually limited. If the load characteristics are taken into account, this would lead to the system’s longer operation with reduced energy conversion efficiency. One should be aware that the value of the γ indicator, which depends on the amount of energy transferred to storage, is inseparably connected with the amount of H2 produced in the installation. Considering a change in the efficiency from the load, it could turn out that despite an increase in the γ indicator, the amount of H2 produced decreases. This would be due to a limitation in efficiency. An unambiguous answer to the question of up to which point an increase in the rated power of the energy storage installation is economically justified requires an in-depth economic analysis. To determine the annual amount of H2 produced, m H2. real , the average hourly stream of H2, ṁ H2. av , and the nominal efficiency, η HG.nom , of the HGs used, the system of equation (22), (29), and (30) is used. It is solved assuming η HG.real = η HG.nom . η HG and ṁ H2. av are shown in Fig. 10 . The chart in Fig. 10 shows that a higher level of nominal power of the energy storage installation leads to an increase in the production of the H2 stream."
7,Analysis of the “renewable” methanol production installation,
8,Selection of gas compression installation for methanol production,"5.1 Selection of gas compression installation for methanol production The structure of methanol production and purification installations is shown in Fig. 11 . It should be remembered that it is necessary to properly prepare both the H2 and CO2. The H2 pressure after the hydrogen generator is about 2.5 MPa. In the case of captured CO2 from a separation installation in a power plant, the gas pressure is about 0.1 MPa. Both gases should be compressed to a pressure of about 7.8 MPa. This pressure depends on the catalyst used in the methanol reactor. For Cu/ZrO2, Au/Zn/ZrO2, and Cu/Zn/ZrO2 catalysts, the reactor pressure should be in the range of 7.8–8 MPa [5]. Table 5 presents a comparison of methanol synthesis reactors with their operating parameters. Comparing the results in Ref. [64] [65] [66] [67], it can be seen that the increase in temperature in the reactor causes a decrease in methanol selectivity, while this improves CO2 conversion. However, the most effective solution is to increase the working pressure of the reactor operation, resulting in an increase in CO2 conversion of about 9 p. p. And methanol selectivity of 14.9 p. p. (for Cu/Zn/ZrO2), which is why the authors chose high pressure reactor for analysis. Multi-sectional CO2 compression with applied intersection cooling is used in CCS installations. The pressure ratio is the key in this case. Pressure ratio for a carbon dioxide compressor is equal 78 (7.8 MPa/0.1 MPa), while for a hydrogen compressor it is only 3.12 (7.8 MPa/2.5 MPa). In compressors with such a low pressure ratio (3.12), intercooling is not used. The outlet gas temperature of a single stage CO2 compressor is almost 3 times higher than the H2 temperature at the outlet of a single stage compressor (see Table 4). Hence, it is reasonable to use a compressor with intercooling for CO2. Multistage compressors (8 stages) have been analyzed by the Authors in Ref. [78] [79]. By reducing the energy consumption of CO2 compression and using waste heat, we can improve the energy balance of the entire installation. The authors conducted an analysis for a single-section H2 compressor and a multi-section CO2 compressor with intersection coolers (a range of one to eight sections with isothermal CO2 compression). However, it is worth remembering that increasing the number of compression sections, and thus the number of heat exchangers, results in an increase in capital costs. Assumptions for the gas compression are presented in Table 6 . Table 7 presents the results of the analysis of the substrate preparation installation (H2 and CO2) for the production of liquid methanol. The compression installation analysis was carried out for 1 kg/hH2(g) and the amount of CO2 consistent with a stoichiometry (equation (4)) of 7.277 kg/h. The unit work of H2 compression, L H2, in kJ/kg and the unit work of CO2 compression, L CO2, in kJ/kg were determined. Table 4 shows that the isothermal compressor is the least energy-consuming unit, which results from the smallest unit work of such a compressor being just over 340.24 kJ/kg Q ˙ 1 is the heat stream recovered from the H2 compression system (this stream is 0 due to the use of single section compression without coolers), while Q ˙ 2 is the heat stream recovered from the CO2 compression system. Isothermal compression gives over 548 W of additional recovered heat from 1 kg CO2. The compression work for 1 kg of H2 is 4–6.5 times higher than the compression work for 1 kg of CO2."
9,Methanol production and purification installation,"5.2 Methanol production and purification installation Analysis of the methanol production and purification installation was carried out for 1 kg/h2(g). This means that the installation is supplied with an amount of CO2 according to the stoichiometry of equation (4), which amounts to 7.277 kg/h. The analyzed installation is based on reaction (3), which takes place in the methanol synthesis reactor (RMeOH). Fig. 11 shows a schematic diagram of the methanol synthesis installation with a reaction loop. The H2 stream and the CO2 stream in Fig. 11 are the streams at the compression installation outlet. Table 8 presents the main assumptions for this installation. The higher heating value of methanol was assumed to be at a level of HHV = 22137.5 kJ/kg. The higher heating values of the residual gases were HHV 14 = 3934.9 kJ/kg and HHV 22 = 6715.8 kJ/kg, respectively to Fig. 11 (see Table 9 ). The installation process begins with the mixing of H2 (from the water electrolysis system) and CO2 (captured from the plant’s exhaust gas). The H2 and CO2 mix is again mixed with the recycled gas stream. This stream is heated in a heat exchanger HX1 to 210 °C and injected into an adiabatic reactor with a fixed bed RMeOH. The gases leaving the reactor are split into two streams in the separator S1: the first (representing 60% of the initial stream) is used to preheat the gas mixture in the heat exchanger HX1 at the reactor inlet, while the second is directed to the heat exchanger of the distillation column DC (the reboiler - Re) and is also used for heating the feed stream to the distillation column (HX3). The two streams are mixed again in the mixer and are water-cooled to 35 °C in the heat exchanger HX2. Water and methanol that have condensed in the heat exchanger HX2 are separated from the unreacted gases in the separation tank (S1). Some of the unreacted gases (e.g. 1%) are purified to minimize the accumulation of inert substances and by-products in the reaction loop. Purification loops are used to reduce the amount of unreacted substrates and to reduce the amount of by-products (and thus increase the selectivity of the expected product). In each process of producing alternative fuels using chemical reactions, they are used due to the imperfection of a given product synthesis reactor, as presented by the Nobel laureate Professor George Olah in Ref. [80]. In addition, due to the fact that there are losses of pressure of raw gas flowing through individual devices of the system, it is necessary to use a fan/compressor in the purification loop so that the recirculated gas can be returned before the reactor, which increases the energy consumption of the system. The liquid stream leaving the first separation tank (S1), called raw methanol, consists of methanol, water and other dissolved gases. Raw methanol is expanded to 1.2 bar in a throttle valve. The residual gases are then almost completely removed in another separation tank (S2). The remaining stream is heated to 80 °C in the heat exchanger HX3 and then directed to the distillation column (DC). The water flowing out of the bottom of the column at 102 °C contains 23 ppb methanol. Methanol is withdrawn from the top of the column at 1 bar pressure and 64 °C in gaseous form containing 69 ppm water and unreacted gases. The methanol is then compressed (F2) and cooled in the heat exchanger HX4 to 40 °C. In the separation column (S3), unreacted gases are collected from the top of the column, while “pure” methanol is obtained from the bottom of the column in liquid form."
10,The results of the analysis of the work of the liquid methanol production installation,"5.3 The results of the analysis of the work of the liquid methanol production installation The methanol production and purification installation is characterized by a pure methanol yield of 4.643 kgCH3OH/kgH2 for H2 and a pure methanol yield of 0.638 kgCH3OH/kgCO2 for CO2. Table 6 presents the results of the analysis of the methanol synthesis installation and its purification. The actual methanol yield in relation to the stoichiometric yield is 0.8677 and is expressed by the equation: (34) u C H 3 O H = m ˙ M e O H ( m ˙ M e O H ) s t o c h In Table 6, the power for the system’s own needs (N δ ) is presented as the sum of the fan power N F1 (F1 Fig. 11) and N F2 (F2 Fig. 11) and the power needed to drive the H2 compressor N H2 (Table 4) and the CO2 compressor N CO2 (Table 4) according to equation (7). The efficiency of the MG was determined according to equations (9) and (10). Considering only the energy consumption of the compressors and fans, the best process method is to apply isothermal CO2 compression (variant I), which illustrates the efficiency of the MG, η MG , where the increase in installation efficiency relative to the worst case (variant A) is 0.64% points. For the efficiency of the generator, taking into account the efficiency of electricity transmission (η tr = 0.95) from the reference power plant (η el.R = 0.42) to the methanol purification installation, η tr , and the efficiency of electricity generation in the reference power plant, η el.R , (equation (12)), the efficiency increase is much greater and amounts to 1.44% points. Fig. 12 shows the efficiency of the entire methanol production system depending on the number of CO2 compression sections, according to the definition of efficiency described by the relationship (9) or (10) taking into account equation (6) without heat recovery. Fig. 14 presents an analogous efficiency; however, in this case equation (10) and equation (13), covering heat recovery from the H2 and CO2 compression installation, were used, while in Fig. 15 equation (14), based on heat recovery from the gas compression installation as well as from the methanol production installation itself and the use of the chemical energy of residual gases, was used. In Table 6, Q ˙ 3 is the heat stream received from the heat exchanger HX2 (Fig. 11), Q ˙ 4 is the heat stream recovered from the heat exchanger HX4 (Fig. 11), and Q ˙ 5 is the heat received from the HX5 heat exchanger (Fig. 11). It can be seen in Fig. 12 that as the N HG . nom /N WF . nom ratio increases for all the analyzed variants, the efficiency of the entire installation increases. There is also a noticeable trend of decreasing efficiency gains for all variants as the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom increases. The variant characterized by the highest efficiency is the system with the isothermal compressor used (variant I), for which the efficiency of the entire installation reaches 52.9% for the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.45. It is also noticeable that as the N HG . nom /N WF . nom ratio increases, the difference in efficiency between the best and worst of the variants analyzed increases. Variant I already reaches 52% efficiency at a ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.24, where by comparison the worst variant with CO2 compression in a single section compressor (variant A) reaches this efficiency only at a ratio of N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.375. Fig. 13 shows the values of the last term of equation (10) as a function of the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom , denoting it as Δη: (35) Δ η = α + 1 η H G α + 1 In Fig. 13 it can be seen that, according to equation (35), the values of Δη are only slightly above 1. For Δη, as the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom increases, the values tend to Δη = 1.011. In the case of heat recovery from the gas compression installation and from the methanol production installation, the efficiency of the entire system exceeds 60% for all the analyzed variants (Fig. 15), while in this case the best variants are variants E and F, which give an efficiency of over 60.4%. Due to the large difference in the amount of heat recovered, Q ˙ 3 , between variants A and I, the variant with isothermal compression (variant I) is not the best solution in this case. Taking into account the degree of CO2 capture from exhaust gases R = 0.9 in a power plant, the equation determining the electrical power used for CO2 capture takes the form: (36) N = m C O 2 R ⋅ e C O 2 ⋅ τ e l . r e a l = m ˙ C O 2 ⋅ τ M G . r e a l R . e C O 2 ⋅ τ e l . r e a l If there are no buffer tanks in the integration structure of the CO2 capture installation of the power plant and the methanol production installation, τ MG.real = τ el.real , and formula (36) takes the form (37). Fig. 16 shows the power of the power plant needed to emit the amount of CO2 that is able to fully supply the methanol production installation (assuming that the unit works during the year for τ el.real = 8000 h). (37) N = m ˙ C O 2 R ⋅ e C O 2 Fig. 16 shows that in the case of a 40 MW WF and 45% HG power, the combined cycle power plant operating 8000 h per year from which the CO2 emitted stream would be taken is approximately 1.28 MW. The power capacity of coal-fired power plants in this case is 0.515 MW for hard coal and 0.463 MW for lignite, respectively. This applies to a degree of CO2 recovery from flue gas of R = 0.9; for R = 0.6 the power values mentioned increase 1.5 times. This result is due to the fact that for methanol production based on the analyzed WF, CO2 capture from a part of the flue gas emitted by a power plant is enough."
11,Summary,"A thermodynamic analysis of energy storage in the form of “renewable” methanol produced from CO2 (captured from flue gas emitted by fossil fuel power plants) and from H2 (generated from overproduced electricity from a 40 MW WF during night valleys) was presented. The article contains a unique (compared to the literature on the subject) analysis of integration of renewable energy source (wind farm), hydrogen generating installation (electrolysis installation) with methanol production and purification installation carried out in a wide range of power used from a renewable source, combined with the selection of the structure of installations preparing substrates to the methanol reactor. A methodology determining the energy efficiency of the methanol production and purification installation (η) has been developed in this article. It requires prior determination of the efficiency of the H2 generator (η HG ) as well as the efficiency of the MG (η MG ). Using the characteristics of the real operation of the WF during the year, the amount of electricity transferred to the HG installation was determined. To evaluate the cooperation of a WF with a HG, a number of indicators have been proposed: the indicator for the use of the maximum operating time, d, the indicator for the rated power of the generators, δ HG , the indicator for energy storage, ε, and the indicator of the time at the nominal power, γ. A method for determining the efficiency of the HG (η HG ) was also presented. Both these indicators and the efficiency were determined for the function N HG . nom /N WF . nom in the range of 1–45%. These quantities, e.g. for N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.1, were d = 0.939, δ HG = 0.793, ε = 0.625, and γ = 0.110, while the efficiency of the HG η HG = 0.7167 with a produced H2 stream ṁ H2 = 17.13 kg/h. For N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.45, the values were d = 0.939, δ HG = 0.449, ε = 0.158, and γ = 0.280, while the HG efficiency η HG = 0.7485 at ṁ H2 = 47.72 kg/h. Regardless of the nominal power of the wind farm, the thermodynamic optimum (for which the efficiency of the entire system takes the highest value) occurs for the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom <1. Only when the efficiency of the entire installation is defined without the energy consumption of gas compression and the use of waste heat in the methanol production installation is the best solution is the use of an isothermal compressor. The lower the efficiency of a power plant, the lower its power at which it covers the entire demand for CO2 for methanol production installations. Due to eq. (10) and the analysis of the term described by equation (35), it can be assumed that the efficiency of the entire installation is the product of the efficiency of the hydrogen generator and the efficiency of the methanol generator. With regard to liquid methanol production, the influence of the number of CO2 compression sections on its efficiency (η MG ) was analyzed: this efficiency ranged from 69% to 69.64%. The use of waste heat from the installation and the heat from cooling the compressors could increase the thermodynamic efficiency of the generator to 69.04–71.03%. Further significant increases in thermodynamic efficiency of this installation to a value of 79.38–79.8% could be obtained by using the chemical energy of residual gases and additional waste heat from the methanol production installation. The methanol production and purification installation was characterized by a pure methanol yield with respect to H2 of 4.643 kgCH3OH/kgH2 and a pure methanol yield with respect to CO2 of 0.638 kgCH3OH/kgCO2. The real methanol yield in relation to the stoichiometric yield was equal to 86.77%. The energy efficiency of the methanol production and purification installation (η) (including the H2 and MGs) ranged from 45.5 to 52.9%. The maximum value was achieved for isothermal CO2 compression (variant I) and at the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.45, while the minimum value was achieved for single-stage CO2 compression (variant A) at a ratio of N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.01. In the case of using the heat of the compressed gases, the maximum efficiency of the analyzed system was also obtained for the case with isothermal compression (variant I) and was η = 53.88%, while in the case of full heat recovery (also from the methanol production installation) and the use of the chemical energy of residual gases, the maximum efficiency was achieved for variants E and F, where it slightly exceeded 60.4%. The power of the fossil fuel power plant from which the CO2 was to be captured for feeding the methanol production and purification installations was small, but increased with the ratio N HG . nom /N WF . nom . For N HG . nom /N WF . nom = 0.45, the required power was 1.28 MW in the case of a combined cycle power plant, 0.51 MW in the case of a coal-fired power plant with hard coal as the fuel, and 0.46 MW in the case of a coal-fired unit using lignite."
