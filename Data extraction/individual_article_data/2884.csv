0,Introduction,"Bio-fuels are attractive alternatives to petroleum-based fuels because they do not cause the net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, as the carbon dioxide evolved from combustion is recycled to new biomass in the carbon cycle [1–3]. Converting biomass to high-quality bio-oil has become one of important issues to solve fossil fuel shortage and environmental problems [4–8]. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is easy to operate and a simple way to obtain bio-oil with high yield [9–12]. But the fast pyrolysis bio-oil is generally corrosive, unstable and immiscible with petroleum fuels [13]. Therefore, the upgrading of raw bio-oil is necessary before its usage [14]. In order to obtain good quality of bio-oil, many processes were used such as catalytic hydrocracking [15], hydrodeoxygenation [16], hydrotreatment [17] by which the high grade bio-oil with low oxygen amount and high H/C radio can be achieved. Esterification is a good method to decrease the content of acids to produce esters by adding methanol or other kinds of alcohols in mild conditions [18]. Hydrogenation of bio-oil in mild condition for oxygen liquid fuels was also investigated [19,20]. Most researches focus on the investigation of catalyst such as Pt [21], Ru [22], Pd [23]and Ni [24] catalysts. Single model compound was selected as probe to test the activity of catalysts. In-situ hydrogenation process is a new method to upgrade bio-oil these years [25–27]. This is a new kind of methods to upgrade bio-oil without hydrogen in water using alcohols or formic acid as hydrogen donor. The aqueous-phase reforming of alcohols and the reforming of formic acid could afford hydrogen for the hydrogenation of the unstable compounds such as ketones, aldehydes and phenols [28,29]. In this process, catalysts, hydrogen donors, the solvent and also other elements will affect the efficiency of the upgrading and the product distributions. The research about this part is less in publication and need further investigation. Our group has focused on this field for some years and got some interesting results. In the previous work, Raney Ni catalyst and Raney Ni catalyst modified by different metal were used in the in-situ hydrogenation of furfural. The effect of different components in bio-oil such as acid, acetone and phenol was investigated including the conversion and the product selectivity in the process of in-situ hydrogenation. In this paper, the effect of different methanol content, hydrogen donors, catalyst dosages and solvents on the mixed model compounds conversion and the product distribution of actual bio-oil were investigated in the in-situ hydrogenation process over 20%Ni/CKM-3 [30], which is one of efficient catalysts for the in-situ hydrogenation of phenols."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (P99.5%, analytical reagent) was purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory. Formic acid (P99.5%, analytical reagent) and o-cresol (P99.5%, analytical reagent) were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagents Factory. Methanol (P99.5%, analytical reagent), acetone (P99.5%, analytical reagent), acetic acid (P99.5%, analytical reagent), ethanediol (P99.5%, analytical reagent), and ethanol (P99.5%, analytical reagent) were purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd. The raw bio-oil was the light fraction which was the condensation product collected below 120°C by pyrolysis of pine saw at 550°C temperature."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts CMK-3 was prepared by the methods described in the literatures [31]. The Ni/CMK-3 catalyst was prepared by wet impregnating CMK-3 with Ni(NO3)2·H2O aqueous solutions. The solution was evaporated while the residue was dried at 120°C and then calcined at 450°C. The catalysts contained 20wt% Ni. Before the usage of catalyst, it was reduced at 550°C in the flow of 5vol% hydrogen mixed with 95vol% nitrogen."
4,Typical procedure,"2.3 Typical procedure The model compounds of bio-oil (MCB) were composed by 1.2g acetone (0.02mol), 1.2g acetic acid (0.02mol), 0.4g furfural (0.005mol), 1.1g o-cresol (0.01mol), 0.4g ethanediol (0.007mol) and 12g water (0.67mol). In the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil process, 5g raw bio-oil and 10.77g water were added, which has considered the water content of raw bio-oil (24.53wt%). So 12g water was present in the procedure of in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil just like MCB. The reactions were performed in a 50mL stainless autoclave in the present of 0.5g catalyst. Methanol, formic acid and glycerol were used as hydrogen donor solvent with water in the mole radio of 10:3 (water: hydrogen-donor solvent). The effect of different molar ratio of water and methanol (10:5, 10:3, 10:1, 10:0.5) on in-situ hydrogenation was realized by adding different amount of methanol (10.70g, 6.40g, 2.13g, 1.07g). In the mixed solvents, 6g water, 6g dodecane and 2.13g methanol were used in the in-situ hydrogenation process. The reactor was sealed and purged with N2 for 3 times to exclude air. An automatic controller was used to control the temperature and the revolution of stirrer (400rpm). The initial pressure was set to 0.1MPa of N2 and the reaction was set at 230°C for 6h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to the room temperature and then sampled the liquid products for GC and GC–MS analysis."
5,Products analysis,"2.4 Products analysis The liquid products of the in-situ hydrogenation of model compounds were sampled for analysis by Shimadzu GC 2010 gas chromatograph. The amounts of products were determined based on GC data using the external standard method. The conversion of reactors (mol%) of main products were calculated as below. Conversion = 1 − Moles of reactants Moles of reactants loaded initially × 100 % The raw bio-oil and the upgrading product were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Trace 2000, Thermo-Finnigan Inc., USA). The separation was realized on a column of HP-INNOWAX, 30m∗0.25mm∗0.25lm, and the oven temperature program was 40°C (holding for 8min) at 6/min to 280°C (holding for 30min). The content of each compound was evaluated by the area percentage of GC–MS."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalyst and raw bio-oil,"3.1 Characterization of catalyst and raw bio-oil The characterizations of CMK-3 catalyst were shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 [30]. As shown in Table 1, CMK-3 had large specific surface area (1128.02m2/g). The specific surface area, avenge pore size and pore volume didn't change much, even after loading Ni. In Fig. 1(A), the typical peaks indexed with 2θ approximately at 44.51, 51.85 and 76.37 were attributed to Ni configurations [32]. From the H2-TPR of Ni/CMK-3 in Fig. 1(B), the Ni catalyst could be reduced below the temperature of 500°C. The property of the raw bio-oil used in this paper was shown in Table 2 . The water content was 24.53% and the pH was 2.00."
8,In-situ hydrogenation of model compounds,"3.2 In-situ hydrogenation of model compounds 3.2.1 Effect of hydrogen donors on the in-situ hydrogenation of MCB Methanol, ethanol and formic acid were chosen as hydrogen donors. The effects on the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil simulation system were shown in Table 3 . The conversions of different model compounds in bio-oil simulation system were quite different using different hydrogen donors. The conversion of acetone, 1,2-ethanediol and o-cresol reached its highest point when using formic acid as hydrogen donor. That might be due to the existence of formic acid, which could promote the hydrogenation happened and also the esterification with ethanediol. For acetic acid, the conversion was considerable using alcohols as hydrogen donor. During this process, esterification and hydrogenation were both the main reactions. We also used glycerol as hydrogen donor, but the coking was really serious. There was no discussion about this part. 3.2.2 Effect of molar ratio of water/methanol on the in-situ hydrogenation of MCB The reforming and aqueous-phase reforming of methanol could afford hydrogen for the hydrogenation during the in-situ hydrogenation of model compounds of bio-oil. So the amount of methanol might affect the efficiency of different compounds. Table 4 showed the results of the effect of methanol adding content on the MCB conversion. From Table 4, the conversions of the compounds in bio-oil simulation system were all influenced by the adding amount of methanol. Overall, the conversions increased with the increasing of methanol addition. Especially when the methanol amount increased from 10:0.5 to 10:1, the conversion of most compounds increased remarkable that might be related with the hydrogen amount product from methanol. But the trend of ethanediol conversion was opposite, which might be ascribed to the competition reaction with acetic acid between ethanediol and methanol. Compared with ethanediol, acetic acid tended to react with methanol. When the ratio of water/methanol was 10:5, most compounds' conversion changed little. 3.2.3 Effect of mixed solvent on the in-situ hydrogenation of MCB Water is the solvent in the in-situ hydrogenation. Except for water, dodecane is one of popular solvents in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process, especially in the HDO of phenolics [33]. The HDO of phenolics always perform well in dodecane over different catalysts [33]. In this part, the effects of mixed solvent on in-situ hydrogenation of MCB were discussed in bio-oil simulation system. As shown in Table 5 , in the mixed solvent of water+methanol+dodecane, the conversion of acetone, ethanediol and o-cresol increased, the conversion of furfural decreased to some extent and the conversion of acetic acid decreased from 54.97% to 49.55%. But after the reaction, there was a lot of char around the container compared with the solvent of water+methanol. The addition of dodecane might promote some polymerization reaction happen in the MCB. When in the mixed solvent was methanol+dodecane, the conversions of most MCB were totally different from that in water+methanol. Without water, the hydrogen production became less because the aqueous reforming of methanol could not happen without H2O. So the hydrogenation was not active during the in-situ hydrogenation. But, the esterification between acetic acid and methanol become active because of not water in the reaction initial and the balance would come to produce ethyl acetate. So the conversion of acetic acid increased significantly. 3.2.4 Effect of catalyst amounts on the in-situ hydrogenation of MCB The catalyst amount is one of the most keys to affect the conversion of reaction. From Table 6 , with the increasing of catalyst amounts, the conversions of model compounds increased remarkably. With the amount of catalyst increased, the active sites increased. And until the amount of catalyst increased to 1.0g, the trend of compounds didn't become flattened. But because the density of CMK-3 is too small, 1.0g of the dosage of the catalyst has larger volume. Therefore, no further increasing of catalyst dosage was performed in the paper."
9,In-situ hydrogenation of raw bio-oil,"3.3 In-situ hydrogenation of raw bio-oil 3.3.1 Effect of different hydrogen donor solvent on the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil The analysis of raw bio-oil and the effect of hydrogen donor on the in-situ hydrogenation of actual bio-oil were shown in Table 7 . From Table 7, there was a lot of acetic acid (31.78%) in the raw bio-oil. Ethanediol, acetaldehyde,hydroxy- were the compounds whose content were above 5%. The content of each phenol was not high but there were many kinds of phenols in raw bio-oil. The total amount of phenolic compounds was 20.85%. After in-situ hydrogenation of raw bio-oil, there was no 2-propanone, 1-hydroxy-, furfural,2(5H)-furanone, propanone, acetaldehyde, hydroxy- detected in the products using ethanol and formic acid, which was similar with the results using methanol as hydrogen donor. But, the product distributions were different using different hydrogen donors. The content of esters increased significantly and the contents of methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were both above 15% in the products using methanol and ethanol as hydrogen donor. So, the usage of alcohols was good for the conversion of acids. Using formic acid as hydrogen donor, ethanediol, monoformate, ethanediol, monoacetate and ethanediol, diacetate could be found in the products, which were the products between ethanediol and acetic acid/formic acid. The contents of phenols decreased in some extent using three different hydrogen donors, which decreased from 20.85% to 8.9%, 15.69% and 10.58% separately using methanol, ethanol and formic acid. 3.3.2 Effect of molar ratio of water/methanol on the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil The analysis of raw bio-oil and the effect of methanol amount on the in-situ hydrogenation of actual bio-oil were shown in Table 8 . From Table 8, no matter how much the methanol was used, acetaldehyde, hydroxy-, furfural, propanone, acetaldehyde,hydroxy- could not be detected in the products after in-situ hydrogenation. Some compounds, like acetaldehyde, hydroxy-, and acetaldehyde,hydroxy-, were active enough and sensitive with hydrogenation. The CO bonds in these compounds were easily converted to CO. The conversion of other compounds, such as furfural and propanone, could reach to 100%, which might be related with the promotion on hydrogenation by other compounds in the bio-oil. For the conversions of these two compounds were hardly to reach 100% in single reactant in in-situ hydrogenation process. In the products, ethanediol, isopropyl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, cyclopentanone were found as the products in the productions of bio-oil. Similar with the hydrogenation process of MCB, the conversion of acetic acid had a huge relationship with the amount of methanol additive. With the increasing of methanol addition, the conversion of acetic acid increased significantly. Methyl acetate could be found in each product and the content increased with the increasing of methanol addition amount. The GC–MS peak time of phenolic compounds were from 7.04min to 13.4min and the content of phenols decreased with the increasing of methanol adding. When the radios of water and methanol were 10:5 and 10:3, the content of phenolic compounds decreased from 20.8% to 10.31% and 9.75%, meanwhile the contents of alcohols and esters in raw bio-oil increased from 18.52% to 51.14% and 48.21%. The compositions of products were affected by the amount of methanol addition significantly, which might be ascribed that the role of methanol was not only the hydrogen source for the hydrogenation of the system, but also the reactor of esterification."
10,Conclusion,"To convert the pyrolysis products of biomass to stable fuel, in-situ hydrogenation of model compounds and raw bio-oil were carried out over CMK-3 catalyst. We got the conclusion below. 1) Methanol, ethanol and formic acid could provide hydrogen for the in-situ hydrogenation but the effects on different reactions were different during the in-situ hydrogenation process. Using alcohols as hydrogen donors, esterification reaction happened between the hydrogen donors and acetic acid except for hydrogenation. Compared with the hydrogen donor of ethanol, the formic acid could promote the phenols conversion which increased from 20.74% to 65.86%, but the conversion of acetic acid was restrained which decreased from 63.59% to 11.78%. 2) The conversions of most model compounds increased with the increasing of methanol and catalyst addition amount. The best molar ratio of water and methanol was 10:3. The mixed solvent of water and methanol was chosen for the better conversion both on esterification and hydrogenation reactions. In the actual bio-oil, when the radio of water and methanol was 10:3 and 10:5, the content of phenolic compounds decreased from 20.8% to 10.31% and 9.75% and the contents of alcohols and esters in raw bio-oil increased from 18.52% to 51.14% and 48.21% respectively. 3) The conversion of phenol in MCB increased from 29.80% to 54.13% adding dodecane to methanol & water solvent but the coking was serious. In the methanol & dodecane solvent, all the hydrogenation reactions were restrained. This might be ascribed to the lack of hydrogen which was only from the reforming of methanol but absent from the aqueous phase reforming without water. 4) In-situ hydrogenation was one of potential ways to upgrading bio-oil without H2 during the process."
