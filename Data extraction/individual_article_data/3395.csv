0,Introduction,"The disturbance instigated by electromagnetic (EM) radiations generated by cellular and electronic instruments like communication antennas is called the Electromagnetic interference (EMI) [1]. The shielding mechanism from EM fields is essential for decreasing interference from other instruments and breakdown. Interference from microwave and radio frequencies may disturb the sensitivity of the electric apparatus [2]. Exposure for a long time to EM radiations may cause some dangerous problems to human health [3]. The surroundings have displayed unexpected altitude of electromagnetic radiations, generally radio frequencies, thanks to the prosperity of communication devices in places like health care facilities [4]. By increasing the number of apparatus that create electromagnetic radiations, it is important to realize the EM compatibility between equipment to ensure the proper functioning of vital life-saving systems and to ensure the safety of equipment operators [5]. High-power EM radio frequencies are omnipresent in various working environments, as they are widely used in such processes as dielectric welding, industrial microwave, wireless communication, and portable devices using high-power transmitters and receivers [6]. Operation of the broadcasting station for Radio/TV signal transmitting and radar systems conjointly contribute to an oversized quantity of electromagnetic radiations [7]. Generally, two approaches have been used to inhibit and block the electromagnetic radiations. First, cancel the electrical field of the electromagnetic radiations by increasing the conductivity of the shielding materials. Second, the magnetic shielding materials have been used to cancel the magnetic field of the electromagnetic radiations. Electromagnetic interference was linked to a large number of materials, containing metals, nonconducting, and/or conducting polymers and their blends [8], carbons and their composites and/or alloys [9]. The traditional materials of EMI shielding were practically depending on metal matrix, which was costly and heavy. As an unconventional, nanocomposites based polymeric materials have already occupied an essential position according to several features, high efficacy, flexibility, high processability, and their corrosion resistance [10]. PVA polymer is considered as one of the most interesting polymers, due to its durability, easy fabrication, availability, and its high dielectric features and other properties [11]. On the other hand, a typical procedure of increasing the effectiveness of the shielding materials is to integrate dopants with high electrical conductivity in the polymer template to improve its permeability and conductivity [12]. Among all various conductive fillers, carbon materials such as graphite, carbon black (CB), graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and others have been recommended [13]. However, graphite and CB are easier to coalesce due to their higher percolation thresholds. Alternatively, graphene and CNTs have low percolation thresholds, but they are expensive and facing difficulties in handling and their large scale production [14]. In fact, the shielding effectiveness (SE) of the shields depends on many factors like permeability, permittivity, conductivity, and thickness of the shields [15]. However, the improving of (SE) of the shields can be achieved by enhancing permeability and permittivity with excluding the conductivity. Many schemes have been applied to decorate graphene as signs of progress to increase their attenuation features against microwaves by adjusting their permittivity for example, BaTiO3 [16], Fe3O4 [17] and others [18–20]. Among all of them, Fe3O4 nanofiller has been extensively studied as promising materials for absorbing microwave radiations thanks to their adequate magnetic behavior, less toxic, largely compatible, and high spin polarization at ambient temperature [19]. Moreover, Fe3O4 nanoparticles display the skin-depth effect and their low conductivity lets the EM radiations pass in effectively [20]. Although the increase in the number of works to improve the shielding properties of the polymer nanocomposite materials, the work is still open in this field due to the shortcomings that these materials facing it. These shortcomings represent in the appearing of the agglomeration and aggregation problems of graphene which leads to effect on the structure of the nanocomposite and block its use in applications, and many other problems [21]. Thus, in this work, we present nanocomposite materials based on PVA polymer embedding with both graphene and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Scheme 1 ). The PVA polymer has been selected in this work due to its dielectric properties and mechanically flexible behaviors [22], which allow this polymer to insert into large production applications. The graphene has been chosen thanks to its higher conductivity. The magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticle was selected in this work thanks to its magnetization function, to increase the electromagnetic shielding function. The preparation of the nanocomposite PVA/Gr(x)/Fe3O4(0.1-x) films was successfully done by casting technique with high homogeneity and excellent distribution, where (x) is the concentration of graphene. It was found that, the crystallinity of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing the concentration of graphene (x), this is due to the decrease in the hydrogen bonding. At higher graphene concentration x = 0.08 wt%, the high electrical conductivity (1.87 S/cm) and lower magnetization (1.89 × 10−3 emu/g) were recorded. Also, the highest EM shielding effectiveness SET (40.7 dB) was obtained at this concentration. The higher magnetization (Ms = 45.85 × 10−3 emu/g) of the nanocomposite was obtained at x = 0.02 wt%, however, this nanocomposite records the lowest SET value. This is maybe due to the high dielectric behavior of the magnetite nanoparticles. The contribution of the shielding by absorption is larger than by the reflection of PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite. Finally, the fine dispersion, high magnetization, and high electrical conductivity are playing together to give this nanocomposite the advantage in many practical applications such as EMI shielding materials and bio-devices."

PVT. LTD; India."
3,.Preparation of graphene (Gr) nanoparticles,"22 .Preparation of graphene (Gr) nanoparticles Graphene nano-filler was synthesized via an exfoliation process of graphite oxide. Graphene oxide was synthesized as a result of the oxidation process of purified natural graphite according to the modified Hummers’ method, as reported elsewhere [23]. In this method, an appropriate amount of (graphite powder + NaNO3) was dissolved in 70 ml of H2SO4. The temperature of the reaction was controlled below 20°C. Then, 9 g of KMnO4 was slowly added to the above solution over 1 h and then followed by stirring for another 1 h, and then the mixture is stirred for 30 min at 35 ± 3°C. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, 150 ml of deionized water was slowly added to the mixture, and this is accompanied by raising the temperature, to obtain a yellowish suspension. After that, the mixture had additionally treated with 400 ml of deionized water and 30 ml of 5% Hydrogen peroxide solution, to remove the remaining permanganate ions. To remove the sulfate ions, the solution was filtered and washed with a 10% HCl aqueous solution [24]. The filtration powder was exfoliated to obtain the graphene powder as reported in the literature [25]."
4,.Preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles,"23 .Preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles Magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized in an aqueous solution via co-precipitation method, as reported elsewhere [26,27]. In this method, appropriate amount of (FeCl3·6H2O + FeCl2·4H2O) was dissolved in 25 ml of 0.40 M HCl. After the complete dissolving, 250 ml of 1.5 M NaOH solution was added drop-wise to the above solution under vigorous stirring for 30 min. After a brownish-black (Fe3O4) precipitates were formed, the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm, then washed with water and dried in the oven for 6 h."
5,.Preparation of PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite films,"24 .Preparation of PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite films The casting technique was used to prepare the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite films [1,3,11,13,21,22,28–34] as a follow: 2 g of PVA powder was dissolved in distilled water for 30 min at 60–70 °C until a clear solution was obtained. Once the PVA solution became viscous, the solution of Gr(x)/Fe3O4(0.1-x) nanoparticles was added drop/second to the PVA solution and stirrer to another 60 min. After that, the obtained solution was cast in a glass dish and left to dry in atmospheric conditions. The thickness of the films was determined by using a digital caliper and found to be 200 μm."
6,Instruments and method,"2.5 Instruments and method XRD patterns of the obtained samples were studied by using (Malvern Panalytical Empyrean X-ray Diffractometer, United Kingdom), with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) and scanning range 2θ = 4° to 80°. The d-spacing and the crystallite size of the samples were determined from the equation [1,3,11,13,21,22,28–34]: (1) 2 d sin θ = n λ (2) D = k λ β cos θ Where D is the crystallite size, k is a factor related to the crystallite shape, λ is the wavelength (0.154 nm for Cu Kα), β is the Full width at half maximum (FWHM in radian) and θ is the peak position (2θ in degree). SEM (Quanta FEG-250, LMA, Dublin, Ireland) was used to study the surface morphology of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 films. Raman spectroscopy (model alpha 300R/AS from witechulm, Germany) was applied for graphene, Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 films to detect the vibrational modes and study their structures. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer, Model: Nicolet DTGS TEC detector, was used to identify the chemical bonds and the compositions of the nanocomposite films in the wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The conductivity of the films was measured by using (Keithley 6517B) electrometer by coating both sides of the film with silver paste. Equation σ = d R A (S/cm) was applied to determine the conductivity, where (A) is the area of electrodes, (d) is the thickness of the film and R is the resistance of the film. The magnetic properties of the samples were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer VSM 7400-S series (Lake Shore Cryotronics, Ohio, USA) at room temperature. The electromagnetic interference EMI shielding parameters of the samples were tested by VNA (Agilent-N9918A, Keysight, USA) using the waveguide method in the X-band frequency (8–12 GHz) range according to ASTM D5568-08. The dimension of the samples was 30 mm × 30 mm. The total shielding effectiveness SET can be calculated from equation (3). In fact, SET equals the summation of shielding effectiveness due to reflection SER, shielding effectiveness due to absorption SEA, and shielding effectiveness due to multiple internal reflections (SEM) [1,3]. (3) S E T ( d B ) = S E R + S E A + S E M In fact, when SET ≥ 15 dB, the contribution due to multiple internal reflections (SEM) is insignificant and becomes negligible. This is attributed to in the case of the thick shielding materials like in our case; the penetrated EM waves inside the film suffer from multiple reflection processes between the two boundaries (surfaces) of the film producing a high absorption of EM waves (SEA). The multiple reflection process repeats more than one time ‘’thousands of times’’ until the amplitude of the EM reflected waves become very small and can be neglected the shielding effectiveness due to multiple reflections (SEM ≈ 0). Practically, at this case/state the SEA is equal or larger than 10 dB and the total shielding effectiveness due to reflection and absorption SET ≥ 15 dB. Moreover, the SEM can be described from the following equation. (4) SE M = 20 log ( 1 - e - 2 d δ ) = 20 log | ( 1 - 10 - S E A 10 ) | Where (d) is the thickness of the sample and (δ) is the skin depth and defined as the thickness below the outer surface at which the incident field is attenuated to 1/e of its initial value. From the above equation, the SEM depends on (d) and is closely related to absorption. Based on this equation when the thickness of the shielding materials is greater than the penetration depth (δ), the shielding effectiveness due to multiple reflections (SEM) can be neglected (more discussion see Supplementary Materials). According to the above statement, the total shielding effectiveness SET can be stated as, (5) SE T = SE R + SE A Therefore, the shielding effectiveness due to reflection (SER), absorption (SEA) and the total shielding effectiveness (SET) are stated from the equation [1,3]; T = | S 21 | 2 R = | S 11 | 2 (6) SE R = 10 log ( 1 1 - R ) = 10 log ( 1 | S 11 | 2 ) (7) SE A = 10 log ( 1 - R T ) = 10 log ( 1 - | S 11 | 2 | S 21 | 2 ) On the other hand, the dielectric constants (real part ε ’ and imaginary part ε ’ ’ ) can be determined from the S-parameters (S11 and S21) according to Nicholson-Ross-Weir model as follows: (8) S 11 = R ( 1 − T 2 ) ( 1 − R 2 T 2 ) a n d S 21 = T ( 1 − R 2 ) ( 1 − R 2 T 2 ) Where R is the reflection coefficient and T is the transmission coefficient. In fact, the reflection coefficient (R) can be deduced as: (9) R = X ± X 2 − 1 Where |R| < 1 is required for finding the correct root (X) in terms of the S-parameters (10) X = S 11 2 − S 21 2 + 1 2 S 11 The transmission coefficient (T) can be written as: (11) T = S 11 + S 21 − R 1 − ( S 11 + S 21 ) R The relative permeability is given as: (12) μ r = 1 + R Λ ( 1 − R ) 1 λ o 2 − 1 λ c 2 (13) 1 Λ 2 = ( ε r μ r λ o 2 − 1 λ c 2 ) = ( 1 2 π L ln ( 1 T ) ) 2 Where λo is free space wavelength and λc is the cut-off wavelength and L is a material length. The relative permittivity can be defined as: (14) ε r = λ o 2 μ r ( 1 λ c 2 − [ 1 2 π L ln ( 1 T ) 2 ] ) Eqs. (13) and (14) have an infinite number of roots since the imaginary part of the term ln ( 1 T ) is equal to j ( θ + 2 π n ) , where n = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 , ... , is the integer of ( L / λ g ) . Then ( n ) can be determined by estimating from λ g using initial guesses values of ε r ∗ and μ r ∗ for the sample. From Eq. (13), we have (15) 1 Λ = j ( γ 2 π ) Where γ = j 2 π λ o ε r ∗ μ r ∗ − ( λ o λ c ) 2 (16) 1 Λ = 1 λ g Where ε = ε ’ − j ε ’ ’ The skin depth ( δ ) was calculated from the equation (17) δ = 1 π f μ r σ Where ε r is the relative permittivity, μ r is the relative permeability, ε r ∗ is the initial guess permittivity, μ r ∗ is the initial guess permeability, λ g is the wavelength in the sample, γ is the propagation constant of the material, and σ is the conductivity of the sample. By equating the Eqs (15) and (16), λ g can be determined and hence the ( n ) value. Once the ( n ) value is determined, the permittivity ε r can be determined."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposites,"3.1 Characterization of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposites In fact, the casting technique has been used in this study to prepare polymeric nanocomposite films. Indeed, there is an interaction that takes place between the nanofillers and the matrix of PVA when the graphene and magnetite nanoparticles were embedded into the PVA matrix. Significantly, the hydrogen bonding interaction produces between the nanofillers and (OH) groups of PVA, which may be reflected in the crystallinity, structure, morphology, and properties of the nanocomposites. To study the effect of both graphene and magnetite nanoparticles and their synergetic effect on the structure and properties of the nanocomposite, the XRD patterns of the nanocomposite were carried out (Fig. 1 ). As seen, Fig. 1a displays the X-ray pattern of the graphene oxide. There is a sharp peak at 2θ = 10.7°, this peak is attributed to the (hkl) plane (001) of the graphene oxide. The distance between graphene oxide layers was calculated and found to be (0.83 nm). This value matches the value reported in the literature [35], which means the graphene oxide has been successfully prepared by the Hummer method. The inset of Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the graphene nanoparticles. A sharp peak was observed at 2θ = 26.5° for the hkl plane (002) of the graphene nanoparticles. Moreover, the distance between the graphene layers was found to be (0.34 nm). This value matches the value in literature [36,37]. Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of Fe3O4 powder. There are eight XRD patterns were detected at 2θ = 18.3°, 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.3°, 53.5°, 57.2°, 62.7° and 74.31° for the hkl planes (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440) and (533) for the face-centered cubic structure (FCC) of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles according to JCPDS (space group Fd3m (227), JCPDS #89–4319) [38]. The crystallite size of Fe3O4 particles was determined for the plane (311) and it was found to be 20 nm. In fact, similar results were observed in the literature [39]. On the other hand, the XRD patterns of the nanocomposite have been done to study the synergetic effect of both graphene and magnetite nanoparticles on the structure of nanocomposites. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns of the nanocomposite films with changing the concentration of graphene (x). As seen, the pure PVA film has a peak at 2θ = 19.5°, this peak is attributed to the (101) plane of the crystalline part of the semi-crystalline PVA polymer (Fig. 1d) [40]. Besides this peak, another peak appeared at 2θ = 6.5° when embedding the graphene into the PVA matrix (Fig. 1c). The appearance of this peak is attributed to the formation of scattering planes due to the strong interaction between PVA chains and graphene. This peak was appeared in many previous works [41]. The intensity of the peak at 2θ = 19.5° decreases with increasing the concentration of graphene (x) in the matrix of PVA, which means decreasing the crystallinity (increasing the amorphous phase) of the nanocomposite. The crystallinity was determined from the integrated area under the crystalline regions divided by the integrated areas of both crystalline and amorphous regions [1,3,11,13,21,22,28–34]. The crystallinity was found to be 40.21, 39.01, 37.89, 37.02 and 36.10% for x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 wt%, respectively. The reason behind the decrease in the crystallinity is attributed to the decrease in the hydrogen bonding (intra/inter types) inside the nanocomposite. This is may be due to the consuming of the (-OH groups) which are responsible for the crystallinity of the PVA polymer during the interaction between PVA and the functional groups of the graphene [42]. The increasing of the amorphous phase of the nanocomposites leads to increasing the segment mobility of the polymer, improving the conductivity of the films [43,44], and hence improving the shielding behavior. These results agree with the results that are reported before [45]. SEM images of the prepared samples were performed (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of the graphene. As seen, the structure of graphene consists of a similar intertwined layered structure. Each particle of graphene contains several sheets with an average sheet diameter of 4 mm. Fig. 2b shows the SEM images of the Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles. It is clear that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles have an average particle size 12 nm, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in nano-scale with spherical shape and without any agglomeration. In fact, this type of structure/morphology of both graphene and magnetite is very important, which helps to improve the EM absorbing features of different shields, as they serve as centers of EM waves attenuation or trap centers of electric/magnetic field producing an electric/magnetic loss. Fig. 2c–f shows the SEM images of the (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) film surfaces at different concentration of graphene (x). The SEM images were performed to study the morphology of the film surface. As shown, both the graphene and the magnetite nanoparticles are well dispersed in the matrix of the PVA. The high degree of the homogeneity and fine distribution of both fillers were obtained (Fig. 2c and d). Moreover, at the sample with x = 0.02 wt% of graphene, there is a high degree of agglomeration and aggregation of the magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles in the films; this is attributed to the magnetic (magnetization) function of the (Fe3O4) nanoparticles. This magnetic function leads to agglomerate the (Fe3O4) nanoparticles during the evaporation of the solvent. However, with increasing the concentration of (x) in the samples, which means decreasing the Fe3O4 concentration, the agglomeration of Fe3O4 was reduced due to the reduction in their concentration (Fig. 2e and f). Increasing the concentration of (x) leads to producing a high packing density of the graphene in the sample; therefore, improving the particle-to-particle connection function and hence increasing the aspect ratio parameter [46]. This reflects increasing the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite and high EMI shielding [47]. Fig. 3 a shows the FTIR spectra of the nanocomposite PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 films with different concentrations of graphene (x). Fig. 3a shows the characteristic peaks of the magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles at around 538–573 cm−1. The broad absorption band at 3261 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching mode of hydroxyl groups (-OH) in PVA. The intensity of this band decreases with increasing the concentration of graphene (x), this is due to the reduction in the hydrogen H-bonding between the nanofillers and the PVA, which is reflected in the decreasing the crystallinity. The bands at 2928 and 2865 cm−1 represent the symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching vibrations of the methylene (-CH2-) group. A peak at 1731 cm−1 is attributed to the CO stretching vibration of the PVA. Functionalized graphene displays at a peak of 1087 cm−1 for the COOH group. The intensities of these bands decreased with increasing the concentration of graphene (x), which confirms the strong interaction between the graphene and PVA chains. Besides, the existence of Fe3O4 in the composite was also detected with the appearance of peaks at around 538–573 cm−1 for Fe–O vibrations. In General, the characterization results indicated that the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 composite was successfully synthesized and can be applied for further research. Raman spectra of the graphene, Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite films were performed (Fig. 3b) to detect their vibrational modes and/or structures. It is clear that the graphene has three Raman spectra at 1314.35, 1630.60, and 2672.67 cm−1, respectively. The spectrum at ∼1630.60 cm−1 is due to the G-band, which is coming from the E2g of the hybridization of carbon (sp2 type) and the spectrum at ∼1314.35 cm−1 is due to the D-band, which is coming from the vibrations of the sp3 carbon atom of defects and disordered graphite. The 2D peak was detected at 2672.67 cm−1 due to double Raman scattering near the k point of the Brillouin zone [48]. The intensity of these spectra is decreased when the magnetite decorated graphene; this is maybe due to the decoration of graphene with magnetite, where the Fe3O4 nanoparticles fill the defects on the surface of graphene. Indeed, the ratio (I2D/IG) is directly related to the number of graphene layers [49,50]. In fact, when the ratio I2D/IG was about ≈ 2–3, this refers to monolayer graphene, when the ratio was 2 > I2D/IG > 1 this refers to bilayer graphene and multilayer graphene was found when I2D/IG < 1. The ratio (I2D/IG) was determined for graphene and it was found to be (0.35), which indicates that the obtained graphene in our work has multilayers structure [45,46,51,52]. In fact, the (ID/IG) ratio numerically presents the number of defects in graphene, the (ID/IG) ratio is determined and was found to be (0.56), and this value increases for Gr/Fe3O4 and PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 composite. However, this value is very small as compared to other values reported before [53]. This refers that a small number of defects on the surface of graphene and small amount of functional groups are present [54,55]. These results agree with the FTIR spectra reported in the above section. This behavior leads to improve the carrier mobility of the Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles and hence improving the EMI shielding performance."
9,Magnetic properties of the nanocomposite films,"3.2 Magnetic properties of the nanocomposite films The hysteresis loops of the nanocomposites were measured to study the impact of the magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles on the magnetic behavior of the nanocomposite films (Fig. 4 ). In fact, Fig. 4 presents the hysteresis loops of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite films at room temperature (300 K). The magnetic parameters (Ms, Mr, and Hc) are tabulated in Table 1 . From Fig. 4, the S-like shape of the hysteresis loop was obtained for the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite was found 1.89 × 10−3 and 45.85 × 10−3 emu g−1 for the graphene concentration x = 0.08 and 0.02 wt%, respectively. As seen, the value of Ms for the nanocomposite at x = 0.02 is higher than that of x = 0.08, this is maybe due to the graphene at x = 0.08 has more (OH) groups, which slightly weakens the magnetic performance. Table 1 shows with decreasing the concentration of (x), increasing the Fe3O4 concentration, the corresponding maximum saturation magnetization increased continuously, which demonstrates the magnetization function of the composites at room temperature. Increasing the ratio of Fe3O4 nanoparticles against graphene shows an increase in the saturation magnetization (Ms) with small coercivity (Hc). This is produced when a large concentration of non-magnetic material (graphene) introduced in the nanocomposite, which decreases the magnetic parameters. But, increasing the concentration of Fe3O4 nanofillers in the matrix boosts the magnetization in the graphene. This allows the graphene to match its dielectric parameters with magnetic parameters so that the impedance-matching characteristics of the graphene are increased, producing a high EMI shielding material."
10,Electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite films,"3.3 Electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite films The electrical conductivity of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposites was measured as a function of graphene (x) and depicted in (Fig. 5 ). The electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite films increases dramatically with increasing the concentration of graphene (x). Even at a low concentration of (x), the conductivity of the nanocomposite improved from 6.9 × 10−7 S/cm for pure PVA to 0.32 S/cm at x = 0.02 wt%. The conductivity increased with increasing the concentration of graphene (x) and it was found to be 0.46, 0.90 and 1.87 S/cm for the x = 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 wt%, respectively. The reason behind increasing the conductivity is attributed to the superior electrical conductivity of graphene and its high aspect ratio. The graphene-based sheet structure leads to make a huge conducting network in the nanocomposite which creates a decrease in the film resistivity (ρ). These results agree with the SEM results. Similar behavior was observed in Ref. [45]. In fact, the nanocomposite films with high conductivity have benefits in electromagnetic shielding materials."
11,EMI shielding properties,"3.4 EMI shielding properties Fig. 6 a shows the total shielding effectiveness (SET) of the nanocomposite as a function of graphene (x) in the X-band. It is clear that the value of SET is increased by increasing the concentration of (x) in the nanocomposite. This is due to the increase in graphene (x) concentration, which improves the particle-to-particle connection behavior by increasing the aggregation of graphene nanosheets in the polymer network and this gives superior SET of nanocomposites as proven by SEM micrographs in (Fig. 2a and b). The total shielding effectiveness SET value of the nanocomposite was measured to be 20.68 dB at x = 0.02 wt% at 8 GHz. However, the values of SET were measured and found to be 27.38, 31.23, and 40.7 dB at 8 GHz for x = 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 wt%, respectively. That is can be said; the increase in graphene leads to improving the EM shielding features of nanocomposites. Moreover, the growth of graphene produces more continuous conductive paths and producing a higher density of electrons or holes (mobile charge carriers) in the nanocomposites, which interacts with an incident EM field and hence increasing the SET of nanocomposites [1,3,56,57]. These results indicate that the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposites can be good shielding materials in industrial commercial applications. The EM shielding mechanism can be illustrated in (Fig. 6b). When the EM wave falls on the film, a portion of the wave is reflected just when reached to the film surface and the residual portion penetrates the film (Fig. 6b). A portion of the penetrated wave was absorbed by graphene, Fe3O4, and PVA segments. The penetrating waves reach to the Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles and divided into the absorbed part, transmitted part, and the other part will be reflected by Gr/Fe3O4 nanoparticles that located close to the film surface, producing an internal reflection between the Gr/Fe3O4 and the internal surface of the film. The internal reflected waves will be reflected and absorbed over and over by the Gr/Fe3O4 in the films, and finally, vanish (this explains why multiple reflected SEM is negligible). This operation can be repeated again and again inside the film due to thousands of the nanoparticles. At the end, a very small portion of waves can leave the film. The SEA and SER values were studied as a function of graphene (x) (Fig. 6c and d). It is clear that SEA and SER are increased by increasing the concentration of (x) in the nanocomposite. However, the SEA values are larger than the SER values, which mean the contribution of the shielding by absorption is larger than by the reflection of PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite. The reason behind the increase in SEA value is attributed to the increase in the crosslinking density and connectivity behavior of the PVA/Gr/Fe3O4 nanocomposite with increasing the concentration of graphene (x). Moreover, the larger Ohmic loss and polarization loss are the reasons behind the higher absorption value with increasing the concentration of (x) [45]. Indeed, a large number of the conductive networks and also a large number of mobile charge carriers are produced in the nanocomposite by increasing the concentration of graphene which can reduce the penetrating wave. In addition, the processes of multiple dipole relaxation (electric and magnetic dipoles) at interface regions, moreover, the dissipation effect of charge carriers in the nanocomposite were sharing in the absorption of the microwave. The skin depth was calculated from the (Eq. (15)) and depicted in Fig. 7 . The reduction in the skin depth was detected by increasing the concentration of graphene (x) in the nanocomposite. This reduction is attributed to the large aspect ratio of graphene nanosheets and high charge carrier concentrations at the surface. This leads to ease interaction at the interface regions between the incident EM fields and the charge carriers in the nanocomposite. The dielectric constants of the nanocomposite were calculated according to Nicholson-Ross-Weir (NRW) method [58,59] using the S-parameters (Fig. 8 a and b). Fig. 8a shows the real dielectric constant ( ε ′ ) as a function of the graphene (x). The growth of the dielectric constant was observed with increasing the concentration of (x). The reason behind the increase in the real dielectric constant is attributed to the growth of the free charge carrier’s concentration in the nanocomposite producing a large EM absorption. Moreover, the growth of the interfacial polarization between the segments of the polymer and the graphene leads to an increase in the dielectric constant [45]. Fig. 8b shows the dielectric loss ( ε ′′ ) of the nanocomposite as a function of graphene (x). The dielectric loss was gradually increased with increasing the concentration of (x). This is due to the increase of the conductivity of the nanocomposite with the concentration of graphene (x), which makes a continuous conductive path of graphene and increase the conductivity and hence increase the dielectric loss according to the relation σ = 2 π f ε o ε ’ ’ [1,3,11,13,21,22,28–34]. The comparison between the SET of our polymeric (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) nanocomposite films and the previous reported non-conductive and conductive polymeric nanocomposite films in the X-band frequency was performed in Table 2 . As seen, the (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) materials possess (SET = 40.7 dB) value greater than the (SET) value of other materials for instance Gr/PDMS Foam (20 dB), Gr/Fe3O4/epoxy (∼17 dB), CNWs/Gr/PDMS (36 dB), PDA-rGO Foam (26.5 dB), Gr Foam (∼25.2 dB) and Fe3O4/Gr/PDMS (32.4 dB). Moreover, the (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) materials possess (SET) value smaller than the (SET) value of other materials for instance CNTs/Gr/PDMS cake (67.3 dB) and Fe3O4@rGO/NR (∼43 dB). From this analogy, our nanocomposite (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) has some features when compared with other polymeric nanocomposites, like its fast and easy production, its flexibility, eco-friendly, affordable, its ease processability, usage of small amounts of raw materials and non-toxic material. Additionally, one of the most important advantages of this nanocomposite is obtaining high conductivity and shielding properties with a very small amount of graphene and Fe3O4. However, our nanocomposite shows some shortcomings such as its SE value and conductivity are still slightly lower than the other polymeric nanocomposites. Finally, it can be suggested that increasing the concentration of both graphene and Fe3O4 nanoparticles or doping this nanocomposite with fillers with high electrical and magnetic properties maybe improve the SE of the producing nanocomposite. Moreover, we can use the conducting polymer such as poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) PEDOT and/or poly (styrenesulphonate) PSS polymers and other polymers to enhance the electrical conductivity and hence, increasing the SE of the nanocomposite."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, the nanocomposite (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) films have been successfully prepared by the casting technique for electromagnetic shielding applications. The structure, morphology of the (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) films and their magnetic and electrical properties were influenced by the synergetic effect of both graphene and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The crystallinity of the films was decreased with increasing the concentration of graphene due to the reduction in the hydrogen bonding inside the nanocomposites. The magnetization of the nanocomposite was decreased with increasing the graphene thanks to the increase of the functionalized (OH) group, which slightly weakens the magnetic performance. The conductivity of the nanocomposite films increases with increasing the concentration of graphene (x) due to the formation of the conductive path of graphene. The dielectric constant was increased with increasing the concentration of graphene due to the growth of the free charge carrier’s concentration in the nanocomposite and the growth of the interfacial polarization between the segments of the polymer and the graphene. The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SET) increased with increasing the graphene, due to the increase in the number of continuous conductive paths and increasing the density of electrons or holes (mobile charge carriers) in the nanocomposites. At very small amount of graphene (x = 0.08 wt%), the nanocomposite displays a high SET value of 40.7 dB and high conductivity of 1.87 S/cm. The absorption of the EM wave was the main mechanism of the shielding effectiveness properties of the nanocomposites. Finally, it can be recommended that the (PVA/Gr/Fe3O4) nanocomposites can be inserted commercially into many appliances like vehicular detection, broadcasting satellites, defense tracking, radar, weather satellite, household applications or more as a shielding material."
