0,Introduction,"Production of renewable fuel from lipid-based feedstocks, such as algae, new and used vegetable oil, and animal fat, is a promising pathway towards replacing fossil fuel. Ambitious decarbonization strategies for the aviation sector rely heavily on low-carbon alternative fuels [1]. A significant amount of research and development activities have been directed towards production of drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is a lower carbon substitute for fossil jet fuels produced from sustainable resources such as waste organics, agricultural residues, or non-fossil derived CO2 [2]. In accordance with a concerted global effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, SAF presents a significant opportunity to alleviate the environmental impact of aviation. In this paper, SAF is defined as a certified, drop-in, distillate fuel that satisfies ASTM jet fuel requirements, while meeting applicable sustainability standards [3]. The variety of SAF production pathways allows for the global implementation with a variety of different feedstocks, thereby reducing exposure to the fuel cost volatility associated with a single energy source [2,4]. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) anticipates biofuels reaching approximately 10 % of aviation fuel demand by 2030, growing to nearly 20 % by 2040 [5]. In the near term, modern aviation will likely rely on a combination of traditionally derived hydrocarbon fuels from petroleum crude and SAF, which makes identifying renewable resources and processes to substitute or replace conventional aviation fuel critical in the goal of achieving a sustainable aviation industry. Jet fuel is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, primarily paraffins, olefins, naphthene, and aromatics. Producing fuel with equivalent properties from sources such as biomass, lipids and FOGs (fats, oils, and grease) has progressed to pilot scale production facilities [6,7]. The production of diesel equivalent fuel from vegetable oil has been well studied and has proven to be commercially feasible, especially with green fuel subsidies [8,9]. Very little SAF is commercially available [10], and the vast majority is derived from feedstocks such as vegetable oil, animal fats, and used cooking oil. SAF, regardless of production technology, is expected to be functionally equivalent to fossil fuels and fully compatible with existing infrastructure, which is commonly called a drop-in fuel. Fuel quality is tested and certified based on ASTM International specifications. Although ASTM standards are accepted globally, countries such as UK, Canada, Russia, and China have different standard specifications for jet fuel that are similar to ASTM specifications. SAF should meet the ASTM standards for aviation turbine fuels D1655 (conventional jet fuel) and D7566 (jet range fuel with conventional and synthetic blend components) [11]. Catalytic Hydrothermolysis (CH) is the sixth pathway approved by ASTM for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2020 following Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK), Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars to Synthetic Isoparaffins (HFS-SIP), Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene with Aromatics (FT-SPK/A) and Alcohol to Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK). Among these pathways, both Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and CH utilize lipid-based feedstocks and apply hydroprocessing technologies for SAF production [12,13]. While HEFA has been well studied and analyzed for a variety of feedstocks [14,15], there is scarce information on CH conversion performances and economics on lipid-based feedstocks. There is little published literature related to large scale CH process implementation and associated technoeconomic analysis. One stochastic economic analysis of CH for aviation fuel production has been conducted previously which provided an estimate of the breakeven price (BEP) range for jet fuel based on limited data from a startup commercial operation [16]. The present study provides a detailed review of major individual unit operations, capital investment cost, and product distributions of a hypothetical state-of-the-art CH conversion facility. Based on the experimental data [17], a techno-economic analysis (TEA) model was constructed to assess the economic feasibilities of SAF production from four different lipid-based feedstocks, carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease. The TEA analysis also identified the technical and economic barriers towards commercial SAF production through CH pathway."
1,Catalytic hydrothermolysis,"1.1 Catalytic hydrothermolysis CH was developed to convert triglycerides to non-ester renewable fuels under high-pressures and temperatures in the presence of water [17]. The conversion takes place under supercritical conditions which can be improved with the presence of a catalyst. ARA's novel catalytic hydrothermal process and Chevron Lummus Global (CLG)'s hydrotreating process are combined as Biofuels ISOCONVERSION technology, which converts waste FOGs into SAF and diesel that are closely resembles petroleum-based fuels. This ASTM approved process has claimed to have advantages over other conversion processes in processing a wide range of feedstocks with high yields of drop-in, pure hydrocarbon fuels or other chemicals, while maintaining a small carbon footprint compared to petroleum products [18]. ARA CH conversion, and the combination of ARA CH refining with CLG are patented processes [19,20]. The patent for CH process states that SAF from this process contains high-density aromatic and cycloparaffin compounds, as well as bulk fuel density and volumetric energy content comparable to petroleum jet fuel [19]. The properties of SAF fuel produced through the CH process from feedstocks including soybean oil, jatropha oil, camelina oil, carinata oil and tung oil are comparable to properties of Jet A aviation turbine fuels. Jet A and Jet A-1 are kerosene grade fuels widely used by commercial airlines complying with ASTM D1655 specification [21]. A test run of ReadiJet (ARA's proprietary SAF) production from the CH process with carinata oil was reported to have produced fuel with high yields of cycloparaffin and aromatics, high density and energy content, and excellent low-temperature properties [22]. The CH is an integrated process which includes preconditioning, catalytic hydrothermolysis conversion, and post refining as major process steps as well as auxiliary processes such as anaerobic fermentation for producing hydrogen, volatile acids, and alcohols from fermentable feedstocks. The Preconditioning process includes conjugation, cyclization, and cross-linking reactions to alter the fatty acid backbones of triglycerides and are designed to improves the biofuel molecular structure and the overall process efficiencies. As described in ARA's process patent, an advantage of modifying triglycerides structurally before catalytic hydrothermolysis is that it greatly improves the chemical, physical and combustion quality of certain biofuels produced by this process, including SAF. However, there is a lack of quantitative information related to the impact of preconditioning reactions on the yield of the jet fuel in the literature. The preconditioned oil is fed into a supercritical hydrothermal reactor, where a myriad of reactions including cracking, hydrolysis, decarboxylation, dehydration, isomerization, recombination, and/or aromatization occur. Preconditioning of triglyceride feedstock reduces hydrogen consumption during post-refining by approximately 25 % compared to the direct triglyceride hydrotreating approach [17]. In the CH reactor, preconditioned or modified triglycerides react with supercritical water to undergo catalytic hydrothermolysis which converts the triglycerides into a crude mix of hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis and cyclization reactions in the aqueous media likely to help reduce hydrogen gas consumption, catalyst consumption and carbon footprint compared to other alternative fuel conversion processes [19,23]. CH conversion uses supercritical water as a solvent to break down the carbon number in lipid feedstocks and produce a crude composition which is further refined to jet range fuels [23,24]. In this process, hydrogen from water is utilized for the hydrolysis of triglycerides and for hydrocarbon cracking. Thus, the use of hydrogen from nonrenewable sources such as natural gas steam reforming is reduced which lowers the carbon intensity of the resultant fuels. From previous studies, it has been shown that the hydrolysis reaction (Scheme 1 ) can occur both as a catalytic and a non-catalytic reaction between fats and water dissolved in the fat phase at suitable temperatures and pressures [25,26]. In the CH process, it is reported that a higher percentage of C18 fatty acids remained uncracked from experiments that do not utilize a catalyst, conversely more lighter fractions were produced from experiments completed with a catalyst. The CH process results in the formation of a spectrum of straight, branched, cyclic, and aromatic molecules, with a small amount of gaseous products. Cracking is the key reaction pathway used to manipulate the carbon chain length distribution and structural variation of the resulting hydrocarbon mixture [19]. Examples of CH cracking reactions that synthesize hydrocarbon compounds such as aliphatic, aromatic, and naphthene from oleic and linolenic acid are shown in Schemes 2 and 3 [19,22]. The crude oil resulting from the CH process undergoes fractionation and post refining to produce various grades of biofuels. These processes produce a mixture of high-density aromatic, cycloparaffin, and isoparaffin hydrocarbons that, when finished by mild hydrotreating and fractionation, can be substitutes for jet fuel (JP-5, JP-8 and Jet A) or diesel (ASTM D975 and F-76 Naval Distillate) fuels [22]. Other supporting processes may be included to further improve mass and energy conversion efficiencies. Specifically, anaerobic fermentation could generate byproducts such as hydrogen (about 55–65 % of total gaseous products produced) and alkenes from triglyceride processing wastes [17,19]. Also, decarboxylation and dehydration of the aqueous phase could be carried out to convert volatile acids and alcohols to alkenes. The hydrogen and alkenes would then be used in the conversion process, reducing the consumption from other sources [17]."
2,Comparison between CH and HEFA,"1.2 Comparison between CH and HEFA HEFA and CH have been qualified under ASTM D7566 Standard Specification for the production of SAF as “Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons” using lipid feedstocks. A comparison of CH and HEFA technology is summarized in Table 1 . The HEFA processing uses hydrogenation and deoxygenation of fatty acids to remove oxygen, followed by conventional refinery processes to refine the fuel. For a typical soybean oil feedstock, the fatty acid profile of the crude is 12.8 % of the hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range and 68.1 % in the diesel range for the HEFA process [27]. A refinery could then employ cracking processes to the diesel fraction to increase the yield of jet fuel. The CH process can produce a hydrocarbon mixture with approximately 30 % selectivity toward the jet fuel range, using soybean oil feedstock without further processing [17]. However, the selectivity towards the jet range can vary with feedstock. CH crude is composed of a variety of hydrocarbons including paraffins, isoparaffins, cycloparaffins, aromatics, and organic acids. Although additional processing is still required before and after the core CH unit, the CH process produces a mixture closer to a conventional crude oil, containing a myriad of chemical constituents. Both the HEFA and CH processes use lipid feedstocks but employ different conversion pathways to produce free fatty acids (FFAs). The conversion reaction in HEFA process produce FFAs by propane cleavage of glycerides, whereas in the CH process, FFAs are produced by thermal hydrolysis [28]. The CH process includes preconditioning steps to improve biofuel molecular structure by modifying the triglycerides structurally before cracking as compared to direct cracking in conventional processing [17]. Decarboxylation is a common reaction in both processes for removing oxygen from the feedstock in the form of CO2. In addition, HEFA utilizes hydrodeoxygenation as another pathway to remove oxygen in the form of H2O [27]. The decarboxylation/hydrodeoxygenation reactions occur as the initial step of the HEFA process; but in the CH process, the decarboxylation reaction occurs simultaneously with the CH conversion reaction and also, in the additional step after conversion. The CH reactions consume less hydrogen compared to HEFA but requires higher pressure and temperature to operate. The ASTM D7566 standard allows up to 50 % blending of CH jet fuel with conventional jet fuels [13,30]."
3,Methods,The TEA presented in this paper is based on the CH pathway for producing hydrocarbons from vegetable oil or waste greases. The financial assumptions and forecasts made using this model are presented in the supporting document.
4,Feedstock analysis,"2.1 Feedstock analysis ARA has evaluated the CH process using over thirty feedstocks including carinata oil, soybean oil, jatropha oil, canola oil, peanut oil, tung oil, camelina oil, pongamia oil, brown grease, castor oil, distillers-grain corn oil, yellow grease, tall oil, shea butter, tallow/rendered fats, algal oil, as well as other plant and algal oleaginous feedstocks, with preference for highly conjugated structures (>30 %) [22]. The most frequently utilized oils include soybean, camelina, jatropha, tung, and carinata. In addition to vegetable oils, waste oils and greases are attractive feedstocks for biofuel production as they have a higher free fatty acid content and are inexpensive compared to vegetable oil. However, they are contaminated with water and sediments; thus, preprocessing is required when using these as feedstocks. ARA's hydrothermal clean-up (HCU) process has demonstrated the ability to process contaminated, low-cost feedstocks, such as brown grease, which results in lower fuel cost [31]. Currently, the majority of diesel fuel produced and consumed is petroleum-based, this volume is supplemented with diesel fuel produced from vegetable oils and FOGs. Table 2 presents crude oil price, petroleum based liquid fuel and average biodiesel consumption rates in barrels per day (bpd) and price in $/L for the five-year period between 2018 and 2022. Biodiesel is blended and used in many different concentrations from B20 which is 6 %–20 % biodiesel to B100 which is pure biodiesel. High level blends B50-B100 require special handling and equipment modifications; the usage of high-level blends or pure biodiesel further depends on equipment readiness [32]. When the price of crude oil rises, the price of petroleum-based diesel follows, reducing the cost differential with biofuels. This consequently increases demand for low cost feedstocks such as used cooking oil and trap greases, which are used to produce biodiesel. Four feedstocks were considered for this analysis: soybean oil, carinata oil, yellow grease, and brown grease. These were selected for the following reasons: non-edible feedstock and promising agronomics, oil yields and oil properties (carinata), low cost feedstocks (yellow grease, brown grease), and the largest biodiesel feedstock [36] as a baseline for comparison (soybean oil). In identifying the fuel property qualification of triglycerides blends, carinata oil was tested with ARA's CH process, which produce 100 % renewable diesel in both heavy and full boiling range blends [37]. Carinata oil (from Brassica carinata) is a non-edible oil, which can be grown in the off-season as a cover crop [38], has suitable precursors for jet fuel conversion [22,39]. Traditional breeding methods have resulted in carinata lines with improved agronomics, oil yields and oil properties, as well as improvements in the properties of the protein meal fraction remaining after oil extraction [40]. In addition, methods are available for possible genetic modification of carinata to produce seeds containing oil very high in erucic acid (C22:1) [24]. Biodiesel produced from carinata oil has been reported to have a relatively high stability allowing for longer storage times [41] and has a higher yield of hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals than C18 oils [22]. Traditional aviation fuel is composed of C9 through C13 molecules. The longer carbon chain length of carinata oil allows for more efficient conversion into aviation fuel with reduced amounts of low-value secondary products such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and naphtha. Companies like Agri soma (acquired by Nuseed) and Canterra Seeds are focusing on increasing the availability of carinata oil for conversion into drop-in biofuels [42]. Greases such as brown grease and yellow grease are low cost feedstocks compared to vegetable oils (e.g. carinata oil and soybean oil). Yellow grease is the waste cooking oil left over from fryers and industrial-sized griddles. Brown grease is another FOG feedstock that is collected in grease or waste traps. Yellow grease has a lower free fatty acid content than brown grease [43]. A U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study found that the amount of trap grease or brown grease generated annually in the United States is approximately 6.1 kg./capita [44]. A study on grease availability by the South Carolina energy office states that six commercial yellow grease collectors in 2007 collected grease from 8957 restaurants and 1148 institutions that collectively produced 7,908,564 gallons of yellow grease that year. Processed restaurant grease was sold for approximately $0.11/kg [45]. Soybean oil is edible and used in the preliminary experiments of the CH process, but it has competitive demand in the food industry. However, soybean oil remained the largest biodiesel feedstock during July 2019 with 322 million kilograms consumed for biofuel production [36], despite having a high price compared to carinata oil."
5,Process design,"2.2 Process design In the process model, the CH process is separated into three steps: preconditioning, CH conversion, and post refining. The process flow for the model is as shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2.1 Preconditioning Preconditioning includes conjugation and cyclization reactions to improve biofuel quality Fig. 2 . The conjugation process is assumed to be carried out in a stirred tank reactor at a temperature of 170 °C under atmospheric pressure for a minimum of 4 h with a carbon supported nickel (Ni/C) catalyst. The catalyst cost is included in the TEA with the quantity estimate adopted from the catalyst to oil ratio from Ref. [46]. The cyclization reactor is also a stirred tank reactor with a residence time of about 1 h at a pressure of 15 bar. The equipment costs for this step were estimated based on the Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers [47] and the Aspen Plus economic analysis tool. The preconditioning unit cost was not for greases feedstocks. Instead, a single step cleanup reactor cost is added in the model. It is assumed that yellow grease and brown grease will be procured from grease recovery facilities. 2.2.2 Conversion The catalytic hydrothermolysis reaction is the key conversion step in the process. CH reactor can be a single plug flow reactor under typical reaction conditions (Table 3 ). The CH reactor volume, flow rate, and residence time were estimated based on published experimental conditions using zinc acetate as a catalyst [17]. Catalyst cost was evaluated for the volume comprising oil and water in the reactor during the process. Individual equipment cost for this process step was adopted from Ref. [47] and the Aspen Plus economic analysis software. The operating conditions required for a CH reactor [17] were similar to those for an HTL reactor [48] as shown in Table 3; hence the cost was adopted and scaled for the model scenario. 2.2.3 Post-refining The biocrude generated from the CH reactor is hydrotreated and fractionated into various grades of renewable fuels such as diesel, SAF and gasoline [19]. Post-refining equipment includes the hydrotreating and distillation units. Some of the oxygen content in a biocrude oil could lead to undesirable chemical properties, thus a mild hydrotreatment may be required to deoxygenate the crude before fractionation [17]. A conservative assumption was made and the costs for the hydrotreatment unit were included in the economic model adopted from an HTL process for the hydrotreating unit and catalysts [48]. The separation and fractionation of the CH crude were assumed to proceed in a similar manner as in petroleum fractionation units. Steam for the distillation unit is produced using natural gas, thus the cost is part of the TEA model. The cost for the distillation was estimated and scaled to model from Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers [47]."
6,Techno-economic analysis,"2.3 Techno-economic analysis The development approach and default assumptions for the techno-economic analysis is consistent with previous TEA studies for other SAF pathways [49–52]. The CH process details and data are adapted from literature [16,17,19]. A scoping level of process information is presented in this study. The process flow, capital and project cost estimations are adaptations from literature and values from the Aspen Plus economic analysis tool, which are combined to estimate a SAF minimum selling price (MSP) using a cost benefit analysis (CBA). We assumed that the analyzed facility is an nth plant, meaning the technology is mature has been successfully deployed. In addition, we assume that the plant is operating at reported experimental, bench-scale yields. These assumptions do not account for additional costs that would be incurred for a first-of-a-kind plant, including special financing, equipment redundancies, large contingencies, and longer startup times necessary for the first few plants [48]. A subset of the controlling financial assumptions as well as the facility scale are listed in Table 4 . A cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the CH process by predicting the minimum selling price (MSP) of SAF. MSP per unit volume of SAF is defined as the price that has a net present value (NPV) of zero with a nominal financial discount rate of 12.2 %. We assume an inflation rate of 2 % following the average inflation from 1997 to 2017. 2.3.1 Cost estimations The economic feasibility of a biofuel pathway depends on the combination of capital and raw material costs, availability of raw materials as well as other operational costs. Ratio factors were used to determine outside battery limits (OSBL) costs from inside battery limits (ISBL) equipment costs. ISBL equipment is integral to a specific process while OSBL equipment support the core process and include processes like steam generation, waste water treatment and buildings [47]. Equipment scale was estimated and used to scale the cost using the exponential correlation [47,48]. This cost was unified to 2017 dollars using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index [55]. The ratio factor for a greenfield liquid processing plant were applied to ISBL equipment costs, to estimate the OSBL costs to determine the total direct costs and to estimate indirect costs which are added to direct costs to calculate the fixed capital investment. This method has been successfully deployed to complete a scoping level analysis with an estimated accuracy of ±30 % [49–52]. The total capital investment (TCI) is the sum of the fixed capital investment (FCI) and the working capital. Working capital, which is used to cover operating costs when the facility is not able to cover expenses, is assumed to be 20 % of the annual operating costs. Land cost is assumed to be 1.5 % of the TCI [56]. Capital cost for the carinata oil is provided in Table 5 . Operating costs are a combination of variable costs such as feedstock, catalysts, energy, water, natural gas and hydrogen and fixed costs which include labor, overhead, insurance, taxes, and maintenance (Table 6 ). The five-year average for 2013–2017 for industrial electricity and natural gas price was assumed to help reduce variation in energy costs [57,58]. Hydrogen cost was referred from the literature [59] as $1740/metric ton. Taxes and insurance and maintenance are assumed to be 2.5 % and 6 % of FCI, respectively [56,60]. General overhead is assumed as 60 % of labor [50] with the cost of labor adapted from Ref. [54] using [61]. 2.3.2 Feedstock cost Five year average prices (2013–2017) of soybean oil and yellow grease from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [62] were used. The brown grease price was estimated as $0.05 less than the yellow grease cost [43]. The price of carinata oil is not widely available, hence the price was calculated using a cost of carinata seed per bushel of $9.50 [39] and an oil content of 44 % [63,64]. The cost to process the oil were adapted from a camelina processing facility economic analysis [65]. The prices assumed are $701, $791, $595, and $473 per metric ton for carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"The process model was developed based on a US patent application and public information from ARA [16,17,19]. The detailed process analysis includes quantitative analysis of cost. The TEA is used to quantitatively aggregate costs and benefits. The MSP estimated allows CH process to be analyzed for the financial viability."
8,Hydrocarbon yield,"3.1 Hydrocarbon yield The yield of biofuels from lipid feedstocks and the corresponding mass balance were adopted from existing CH process literature (Table 7 ). The hydrocarbon yields are estimated by combining the feedstock to CH crude yield (85 %) with the CH crude to hydrocarbon conversion yield (72 %). An assumed product distribution for SAF, diesel and gasoline of 36.81 %, 27.94 %, 25.3 %, respectively was adopted from [17]. Decarboxylation and distillation have a reported mass loss during conversion of 15–17 %. In addition,10–15 % of the products were not collected [17]. These fractions are either a heavy fraction with a boiling point greater than 330 °C or a light fraction with a boiling point less than 75 °C. The hydrocarbon yield for carinata oil has a potential 2 wt% increase compared to soybean, canola or jatropha oils [22], resulting an estimated yield of 63 % (Table 6). For yellow grease and brown grease, the hydrocarbon yield and the product distribution were assumed to match soybean oil. In lab-scale data, additional handing may cause a 5 % mass loss, however, in industrial-scale operations, this loss could likely be minimized/eliminated with avoidance of manual handling and by incorporating a closed automated system. A study on catalytic cracking of FOGs from grease traps to diesel-like hydrocarbon fuels has shown a yield of 69.27 % [66]. It is reasonable to anticipate similar yields or higher from yellow grease and brown grease from CH process, but the lower yield was chosen as a conservative value."
9,Plant cost analysis,"3.2 Plant cost analysis TCI, annual operating costs, including feedstock, feedstock price ($/MT), and projected MSP are listed in Table 8 . Each feedstock conversion process has variations in TCI and operating costs resulting from feedstock price, yield, and preprocessing requirements. The production cost of biofuel from vegetable oil such as carinata or soybean oil includes cost for the following processing units: preconditioning, CH conversion, and post-refining. The preconditioning unit cost is not applied to waste greases. Conversion equipment cost for brown grease has an added equipment cost for a feedstock cleanup reactor to remove contaminants. Equipment cost for cleanup reactor is not applied for yellow grease, as the price used is for filtered and refined grease removing the need for cleanup costs. Yellow grease from other renderers would be cheaper, but additional costs for cleanup will need to be added. Fig. 3 presents the feedstock preparation equipment costs that differ for each scenario in the TEA. For the preconditioning process, there is no correlation explicitly defined between modifying the triglycerides structurally and SAF yield, but it has been reported in the CH process [17] that pretreating and CH of triglycerides consumes 25 % less hydrogen than the direct triglyceride hydrotreating, reducing the post refining process hydrogen consumption. From an assumed facility scale of 832 metric tons per day, this model predicts the MSP of jet fuel as $1.50, $1.32, $1.19 and $1.00/liter for carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease, respectively. The selling prices for diesel and gasoline were estimated in relation to SAF by regressing historical petroleum prices of diesel and gasoline with jet fuel prices [67]. Fig. 4 shows the cost for the non-SAF distillates, diesel, and gasoline. Details on the regressed data is presented in the supporting document. The estimated MSP with the cost contribution is shown in Fig. 5 , which includes feedstock cost, other operating costs, and capital costs. The variations in MSP of SAF for selected feedstocks are predominantly a result of differences in feedstock price and TCI. In this study, both soybean and carinata oil prices are relatively high, resulting in 41 %–44 % cost contribution from feedstock costs. The feedstock contribution for waste greases was 34 %–39 % for brown and yellow greases, respectively. TCI for all four scenarios ranges from $174 million to $196 million, which contributes 41 %–46 % to the overall SAF MSP, with the rest of the cost from other operating costs which include hydrogen consumed in the hydrotreating process, catalyst costs, and additional utility costs. CH and HEFA are ASTM approved technologies that uses common feedstock for conversion. A study on stochastic assessment of HEFA [14] has estimated that the mean MSP of SAF from yellow grease and soybean are $0.91/L ($0.66/L-$1.24/L) and $1.19/L ($0.87/L–$1.60L) respectively without incentives. These values are comparable to the MSPs of respective yellow grease and soybean oil as shown in Fig. 5. The influence of feedstock price on SAF MSP is significant and thus additional analysis for this variable was completed. The MSP of SAF was estimated using the feedstock cost from Ref. [16]. This study by McGarvey and Tyner 2018, using a stochastic approach estimated the breakeven price (BEP) range for SAF based on the startup capital investment cost obtained from ARA engineers. The study uses brown grease, yellow grease or carinata oil as the feedstock with an output of 5000 bbl./day. Table 9 presents the SAF BEP range from Ref. [16] and the predicted SAF MSP from this study. The predicted MSP for SAF aligns with the reported BEP range estimated for greenfield plant scenario, when we use the same feedstock price. Feed oil to fuel yield has substantial impact on MSP of SAF. . Fuel yields obtained for stochastic study from ARA were 73 %, 72 % and 67 % for brown grease, yellow grease and carinata respectively. In this study, fuel yields of 61 % and 63 % for the respective waste greases and carinata oil are used based on literature values as detailed in Section 3.1. The predicted MSPs from different feedstocks vary considerably depending on the fuel yields (Table 9)."
10,Sensitivity analysis,"3.3 Sensitivity analysis Single step sensitivity analysis was performed on the CH process using carinata oil and brown grease with the decision variables: equipment cost, feedstock price, SAF yield, catalyst cost, working capital, and hydrogen cost. Minima and maxima for each variable were chosen to quantify the impact on SAF MSP. Each variable is evaluated individually, meaning a single value was changed to its minimum or maximum value with all other factors held constant. The variables were changed to ±25 %, or 0.75x: x: 1.25x, where x is the value used in the model for base case. Correlations appear linear within the limit examined except for the impact of SAF yield on SAF MSP. The results for carinata oil are shown in Fig. 6 . The feedstock price and hydrocarbon yield have the largest impact on MSP; post refining equipment costs and catalyst costs are the next most impactful factors. Therefore, these four parameters are considered the key cost drivers in this model. The feedstock price, catalyst costs, post refining equipment cost, and working capital are positively correlated with SAF MSP. SAF yield has a stronger impact on the SAF MSP, but the correlation is negative. All other parameters evaluated show minimal individual contributions to SAF MSP. Although absolute numbers vary, the same CH process parameters for the other feedstocks evaluated follow a similar pattern as this sensitivity analysis. Fig. 7 demonstrates this trend by presenting the impact of the same parameters and values changes for brown grease. Reducing feedstock price could significantly decrease SAF MSP. Increasing the jet fuel production by 10 % while simultaneously decreasing the feedstock cost by 20 % will reduce the SAF MSP by 15 % from $1.32 to $1.12 per liter for carinata oil with corresponding reductions in diesel MSP from $1.34 to $1.14 and gasoline MSP from $1.22 to $1.04. Carinata production is projected to increase in the near future to meet the growing demand for lipid feedstocks with the huge requirement for feedstock in biofuel production, companies such as Agrisoma and Canterra Seeds are focusing on increasing the production of carinata globally [42]. In addition, there is interest in possible genetic modification of non-edible oil seeds with desired properties for conversion to biofuels that will increase the fuel yield [68]. Reusing low-cost feedstocks such as waste grease would be cost effective and an environmentally friendly initiative, but the availability of yellow grease and brown grease is difficult to accurately quantify because of the lack of transparency in the current collection supply chains. In addition, there is competition for waste greases that are used to produce other biofuels, animal feed and chemicals. The CH process produces 16 % more jet range fuel when compared to HEFA technology for soybean oil [17,27]. The increased SAF output could be increased by further converting the C5-C15 carbon range to the jet range fuel with an estimated 27 % of the diesel fraction from the CH process convertible. Catalytic upgrading to further crack diesel into jet range and tuning operating conditions could be considered to improve the SAF yield, but this will decrease the diesel range fuel rate from CH process, which has a marginally higher MSP. Having more selectivity towards jet fuel range will be of importance for SAF yield increase, which could contribute to IEA's SDS requirement. As expected, hydrocarbon yield has a larger impact on MSP than other parameters. It should be noted that the hydrocarbon yields shown in Figs. 6 and 7 did not account for the losses due to experimental setup and configuration which can further reduce SAF MSP. Another potential source of income besides SAF, are the light and heavy fractions which can help reduce the overall fuel distillate cost."
11,Incentives and credits for biofuel,"3.4 Incentives and credits for biofuel Stable government incentives and associated policies, both federal and state, are essential to start up initial production facilities. Credits for biofuel such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit prices and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices plays a major role in promoting biofuels, including vegetable oils and waste biodiesel/renewable diesel [69,70]. These credits, as well as those formed by the International Civil Aviation Organization's CORSIA(Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) program [71], can drastically alter the breakeven price for any biofuel producer. The California LCFS covers all fuels suitable for use in transportation in the state of California [72]. SAF fuel is recognized for LCFS credits since 2019. Countries such as United States, the members of the European Union (EU), Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, China, and South Africa have proposed various initiatives for the development and deployment of alternate fuel in the aviation industry [73,74]. As with other synthetic aviation fuel pathways, a wide range of credits may potentially apply to commercialization of the CH pathway although the exact nature of their impact on aviation fuel pathways is complex [75] and is outside the scope of our analysis."
12,Conclusions and recommendations,"This study demonstrates that CH could be a promising pathway to convert a variety of lipid feedstock sources to SAF requiring relatively low hydrogen consumption. The estimated MSP of SAF for a facility processing 832 metric ton/day input are $1.50, $1.32, $1.19 and $1.00/L for carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease, respectively. During a period of 10 years from 2008 to 2018, the price of petroleum based jet fuel has fluctuated between $0.40/L to $1.00/L with an average of $0.60/L [76]. CH derived SAF is unlikely able to directly compete with current conventional jet fuel in the current market without any incentives or credit. Based on the results from this study, a set of recommendations is provided to help advance CH towards commercialization. • Focus efforts on decreasing the price of feedstock. This may be accomplished by utilizing any waste greases first and then supplementing with purpose grown vegetable oils. A focus on a combination of increased production, increased yield per bushel, better conversion yields to fuels and second-crop farming would all help to lower prices while providing the best ecological outcome. • Upgrading the diesel fraction to increase SAF yield. Catalytic upgrading to further crack diesel to jet range could be implemented to improve the selectivity towards SAF. Incentives, which currently favour diesel, would need to favour SAF enough to overcome the marginally higher diesel prices [72]. • Reduce capital costs by implementing an alternate integration strategy. Integrating the CH process with existing petroleum infrastructure for biocrude refining process such as hydrotreating and fractionation would lower overall capital cost. In recent studies, co-processing bio-crude with petroleum crude oil at existing facilities is considered a potential method towards obtaining competitive production prices of drop-in biofuels [77,78]. Another capital cost reduction option is to establish grease clean-up within existing wastewater treatment and froth flotation infrastructure for brown grease."
