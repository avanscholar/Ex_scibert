0,Introduction,"Environmental remediation and energy generation has fuelled the demand in research on new materials utilization. In this pursuit, developing stable multifunctional materials employing cost effective synthesis is attracting attention worldwide. As of now many photo-active semiconductors including TiO2, CdSe, g-C3N4, Pt–TiO2, ZnO have been reportedly used for solar energy driven hydrogen generation and degradation of pollutants [1]. Amidst various nanostructures of these compounds, keen attention has been focused on hierarchical structures due to their high surface area, low density and high permeation [2]. Advances in this field have demonstrated that hierarchical sulfide microstructures are promising alternatives to noble metals for various photocatalytic reactions [2a]. However they suffer from poor photocatalytic stability [3,4]. Well known oxide based photocatalysts, such as ZnO and TiO2, have wider bandgap and they are active only under UV radiation while some sulfur based photocatalysts such as CdS, Bi2S3, VS4 turn out to be toxic and undergo photocorrosion [4]. ZnIn2S4, as one of the ternary metal chalcogenides with potential visible light activity, is currently being explored for various photocatalytic applications [4–8]. The bandgap of ZIS appears in the visible region (2.3 eV–2.8 eV). The distinctive morphology of ZIS hierarchical nanostructures is beneficial since it offers longer path lengths and improved absorption cross sections for incident light. Likewise, the larger specific surface area and microstructure associated with ZIS hierarchical nanostructure enhances the likelihood of active sites [4]. In addition, the open hierarchical texture of ZIS can facilitate greater access of ions to the material surface. Various sulfide materials such as NiS, Co9S8, ZnS, CdS, and In2S3 possess hierarchical flower like morphology. However they hold drawbacks such as the need for a structure directing agent, photocorrosion, poor stability etc. [9-12a] For a photocatalyst, one of the common strategies in boosting up the spectral response to visible light is it’s integration with suitable metal ions [13]. This is an effective way to escalate the photocatalytic performance through the introduction of lattice defects and variation in the bandgap energy [14]. This includes extensive study by Congwei Tan et al. [13] on the effect of Sm doping on photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 in degradation of organic dyes. Along the same lines, Sonny Bingham et al. [15] found that rare-earth metal doping enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The special electronic configuration of rare earth elements having vacant f orbitals can be beneficial in two ways: 1) introducing intermediate energy states leading to the reduction in bandgap energy and enhancing visible light absorption 2) facilitating photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants through their ability to form complexes with various Lewis bases such as amines, alcohols, aldehydes etc. using their f-orbital [1,15]. This property may also be favorably utilized for the adsorption of organic pollutants on the surface, when integrated with semiconductor photocatalyst. Neodymium being one of the rare earth elements has been reported for superior optical, electronic, magnetic and photocatalytic property. The addition of Nd3+ ions to well-known photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, ZrO, has been shown to increase the photocatalytic activity during removal of water contaminants, hydrogen production etc. [1,16–21] Nd3+ incorporation into ZIS lattice could hence be used to enhance its photoactivity and improve the chances of its utilization in environmental remediation and water splitting applications."
1,Experimental section,"An inexpensive hydrothermal method is adopted for synthesis of samples under study [22]. For the synthesis of ZnIn2S4, 1 mol of Zinc Acetate, 2 mol of Indium Nitrate and 8 mol of Thiourea are taken as precursors and dissolved in 30 ml of distilled water. The mixed solution of precursors is transferred into a 50 ml Teflon lined autoclave. The autoclave is sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 16 h and allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. The yellow precipitate obtained is washed with ethanol and distilled water several times and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. For the synthesis of Nd3+ modified ZnIn2S4, x wt% (x = 1, 2, 3) of Nd(NO3)3·6H2O is added to the precursor solution before transferring it to autoclave [22]. As obtained sample of ZnIn2S4 is henceforth labelled as ZIS whereas Nd3+ modified ZnIn2S4 (Nd3+ loading- 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 3 wt%) are labeled as ZNd1, ZNd2 and ZNd3 respectively. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are obtained from PAN analytical X’Pert Powder XRD system. ICP-OES was performed with the help of PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV using conc. Hydrochloric acid as the reagent. Carl ZEISS MA15 scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to study the morphology and elemental analysis of pure and modified ZIS. UV–Vis absorption spectrum was recorded using JASCO Model V-760. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (SPECS GmbH, Germany) is used to study the surface elemental constituents of the sample. Lifetime analysis spectrum is recorded with Jobin Yuvon Spectrofluorometer and Photoluminescence (PL) is recorded with HORIBA FL3 at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. Raman spectrum is recorded with Witec R300 using 532 nm Nd:YAG laser. Photocatalytic activity of the samples is investigated by degradation of organic dye (Methylene Blue) under natural sunlight. For the degradation experiment, 100 mg of photocatalyst is added to 100 ml of MB aqueous solution (initial concentration of MB dye C0: 50 mg/L). The suspension is then magnetically stirred under dark to bring adsorption-desorption equilibrium. The degradation of the dye is estimated by irradiating the suspension under direct sunlight and monitoring the concentration of dye at equal intervals of time using UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Photoelectrochemical properties of the material are also analyzed using Metrohm-Autolab model PGSTAT302N. Further, the photocatalytic activity of ZNd2 under visible light irradiation for H2 production through photocatalytic water splitting is also evaluated. A mixture of 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M of Na2S is used as sacrificial agent to capture photo-generated holes thereby enhancing the separation of charge carriers [23]. The ground state electronic properties of ZIS and Nd-ZIS are evaluated using ultra soft pseudopotential based on DFT [24,25] built in quantum ESSPRESSO code [26]. The GGA-PBE [27,28] exchange correlation functional is used here to analyze all the properties of ZnIn2S4 and Nd-doped ZnIn2S4. The electronic configurations of Zn: 3d10 4s2, In: 4d 10 5s 2 5p 1, S: 3s 2 3p 4 and Nd: 4f46s2 are treated explicitly as valence electrons. The optimized cut off energy is 100 Ry and the optimized Mokhorst pack k-point mess is 4∗4∗1 [29]. The Brillouin zone high symmetry k-points are used to calculate electronic properties of ZnIn2S4 and Nd-doped ZnIn2S4 [29,30]. The force and energy convergence is less than 1 meV."
2,Results & discussion,"The diffraction peaks in XRD spectra of ZNd1 and ZNd2 (Fig. 1 a,b) match well with JCPDS card no (720–773) corresponding to the hexagonal structure of ZnIn2S4 (space group of P63mc). One can identify from the figure that for 3 wt% loading of Nd3+ most of the peaks disappear. ZNd3 is hence not considered for further studies. Also, one can identify a weak diffraction peak at 2ϴ = 47.5° in ZIS which appears to become stronger in ZNd1, ZNd2, ZNd3 samples. This may be attributed to the occupation of Nd3+ ions in ZIS lattice. In order to validate the exact occupation of Nd3+ ions, a detailed DFT theoretical study has been carried out and discussed in the later section. Approximation of the structural parameters of as synthesized samples from the XRD results has been presented in Supplementary Table S1. From first principles calculations, it is observed that the Nd-incorporation enhances the structural stability of ZIS and the as calculated lattice parameters of Nd-doped ZIS are a = 3.98 Å and c = 25.14 Å. The total energy calculations of the given system also reveal that Nd prefers In site more than Zn site and that Nd-doped ZIS is energetically stable in nature. Fig. 2 a-c shows the scanning electron microscopy images of ZIS. For the pure ZIS in Fig. 2 a flower like hierarchical microsphere morphology is observed. From Fig. 2b-c it is clear that the integration of ZIS with Nd3+ does not change the morphology dramatically. The elemental mapping of sample ZNd2 (Fig. 2d-h) reveals uniform distribution of constituent elements of Zn, In, S and Nd. The elemental composition has also been verified by EDX and ICP-OES analysis. The stoichiometry approximated from both EDX and ICP-OES analysis for ZIS and ZNd2 are ZnIn1·81S3.81 and ZnIn1·01S3.93Nd0.06 respectively. UV–Vis absorption spectra of modified and unmodified ZIS samples (Fig. 3 a) shows that the absorption onset wavelength for modified samples shift to higher wavelengths. This indicates that Nd3+ incorporation does influence the visible light absorption by ZIS [31,32]. The effective bandgap energy decreases from 2.7 eV to 2.54 eV post Nd3+ incorporation. Since ZNd2 has the lowest effective band gap, it is used for further investigation and application related studies. Preliminary studies on photocatalytic activity and carrier separation ability of the samples are carried out through degradation of organic pollutant (Methylene blue dye) and photoelectrochemical measurements respectively. A schematic representation of the proposed modification of band gap and photocatalytic activity of the material is shown in Fig. 3b. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZIS integrated with Nd3+ ion can be attributed to the special electronic arrangement of Neodymium with partially filled atomic d or f shells. According to Y. Xie et al. & D. Wojcieszak et al. [19,33] the large size of Nd3+ ion causes a localized charge perturbation during substitutional doping which leads to the higher photocatalytic activity. When the material is irradiated with visible light, electrons can be excited and transited from Nd3+ 4f3 orbital upon absorbing photons from the incoming light to form Nd4+ ion. Nd4+ ion thus formed from the above mentioned self-sensitization process may react with the surrounding Nd3+ ions to form positively charged Neodymium clusters which according to the standard redox potentials E0 (Nd3+/4+) = −0.4 V, lie below the conduction bands of ZIS [19]. The electrons reaching conduction band of ZIS follows a new transition route where they get attracted towards the positively charged empty multi energy levels of Nd3+ clusters [30]. This transition requires nominal energy as compared to band-to-band transition in ZIS (2.69 eV) [34] thereby extending the lifetime of the charge carriers with more resistance towards recombination. Their presence can also facilitate a new transition from VB of ZIS to the Neodymium clusters forming a sub band gap, which correlates well with the reduction of band gap of ZIS post Nd3+ integration. Identical conclusions for the enhanced activity of Nd3+ doping were arrived upon in works reported by Li et al. Shah et al. with TiO2, suggesting that Nd3+ ions can also act as electron/hole traps increasing the lifetime of the charge carriers and improving the photocatalytic activity [35,36]. Figs. 4 and 5 show the band structure of ZIS, along with total and partial density of states respectively. We see that there exists a direct band gap at Γ (0, 0, 0) point (both CBM and VBM located at Γ point); hence ZIS is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.182 eV (Fig. 4a). The band gap value is underestimated when compared to the experimental value of 2.7 eV, but it is in good agreement with the previous theoretical prediction [37]. This underestimation of bandgap is due to the fact that DFT calculations are essentially concerned with only ground state properties of a system [38–40]. There is no significant improvement in band gap calculation after adding Hubbard parameter correction in exchange correlation functional. The reason for this discrepancy in the band gap value is clearly explained by Yuan Jue Zhang et al. [38] However, the issue can plausibly be sorted out if we consider strongly correlated Zn-d and Nd-f electrons with special exchange correlation functional. The work towards this is ongoing. The calculated band gap of Nd-ZIS is 0.114 eV (Fig. 4b) and it is evidently a direct band gap semiconductor. The bands formed due to Nd-f electrons contribute to the conduction band. This is the reason for narrowing of band gap in the parent compound. From partial density of states (PDOS) it is found that, in ZIS (Fig. 5a), the Zn-d orbital mainly contributes to the energy bands in the lowest energy region (∼6 eV). VBM is mainly composed of S-p orbital along with nominal contribution from Zn and In-d orbitals. The CBM is mainly composed of S-p and In-s orbitals. PDOS of Nd-ZIS (Fig. 5b) shows that there is no change in the VBM when compared to ZIS. However there is a large contribution from Nd-f state electrons below the CBM; forming a new band just above the Fermi level. This leads to the reduction in the band gap value of ZIS. The highest peak above the Fermi level is due to Nd-f state electrons with small contribution from In-s state electrons and the hybridization between them is also the reason for band gap narrowing in ZIS. The calculated energy band gaps of ZIS and Nd- ZIS are 0.182 eV and 0.114 eV respectively. Raman spectroscopy is an essentially useful technique to study the local structure of crystalline materials. For both ZIS and ZNd2 samples one can identify characteristic Raman bands around 123, 242, 300 cm−1 and 123, 300, 357, 488, 618 cm−1 respectively (Fig. 6 a). The Raman bands at 242 and 300 cm−1 correspond to LO1 and TO2 modes of ZnIn2S4 [41]. Anisotropy in layered chalcogenide structure is responsible for the rigid bands in the low frequency region. A strong band at 123 cm−1 represents the layered structure of ZnIn2S4 hexagonal system [44]. The peaks at 357 cm−1, 488 cm−1 and 618 cm−1 in ZNd2 corresponds to the breathing mode ν1 of Nd–O and the latter two bands correspond to the phonon vibration modes of In–O [43–45]. Photoluminescence spectra of ZIS and ZNd2 samples (Fig. 6b) reveal that Nd3+ incorporation leads to a decrease in the intensity of the peak. PL performance of the sample shows an excitonic process in which the excited electron in the conduction band first undergoes a non-radiative transition from bottom of the conduction band to different sub-bands or surface defects introduced by the integration of Nd3+. The electron then makes radiative transition from the sub-band to the valence band maximum [22,23,42]. This suggests that Nd3+ incorporation results in defects which could act as trapping centers for the charge carriers, thereby enhancing the separation [46]. The lifetime of the charge carriers were analyzed through fluorescence lifetime decay measurements under an excitation wavelength of 400 nm (Fig. 6c) and the decay curves were fitted using tri-exponential function by the equation (1) R ( t ) = A 1 e − t / τ 1 + A 2 e − t / τ 2 + A 3 e − t / τ 3 where τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 are the decay components and A 1 , A 2 , A 3 are their relative amplitudes respectively. The average lifetime (τAvg) of the charge carriers in ZIS and ZNd2 were found to be 2.42 ns and 3.12 ns which was calculated from the following equation [47,48]. (2) τ A v g = ∑ i = 1 n A i . τ i 2 ∑ i = 1 n A i . τ i An increase in life time of the charge carriers in ZNd2 when compared to ZIS proves that the introduction of Nd3+ clusters below the conduction band of ZIS facilitate prolonging the decay time of charge carriers. Initially the photo-excited electrons undergoes a non-radiative transfer from the conduction band minimum to the sub energy levels formed by Nd3+ followed by a radiative transition from sub energy levels to the valence band maximum enabling prolonged separation of charge carriers. This increased life time and reduced recombination is the most plausible reason for enhanced photocatalytic activity. To further confirm the existence of Nd3+ and to investigate the surface elemental composition, ZNd2 sample was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Zn 2p spectrum of the sample shows two distinct peaks at 1044.8 eV and 1021.75 eV corresponding to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 respectively (Fig. 7 a) [4]. The peaks observed at 452.59 eV, 444.05 eV, 443.2 eV in In 3d spectrum (Fig. 7b) are attributed to In 3d3/2, In 3d5/2 and In0 respectively [49,50]. The peak at 162.11 eV (Fig. 7c) belongs to S 2p. This reveals the presence of S in S2− state [4]. The two peaks at 975.7 eV and 996.07 eV (Fig. 7d) correspond to Nd 3d3/2 and Nd 3d5/2 respectively and reveal the existence of Nd in the 3+ state [51]. One of the simplest methods to determine photoactivity of a sample is photocatalytic degradation of common industrial dyes. Methylene blue (MB) is utilized as a model organic pollutant to identify the visible light photocatalytic activity of the as synthesized samples. Fig. 8 a-c represents the change in the concentration of MB under visible light irradiation at equal intervals of time. It is observed that the absorption of MB dye (665 nm) reduces with increase in the duration of irradiation. Among the catalysts used for degrading the pollutant, ZNd2 showed better activity with degradation percent (up to 98%) in 240 min under solar irradiation (see Fig. 8d-e). The entire photocatalytic reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) kinetic model was used to determine the rate constant of degradation reaction with the pseudo first order kinetics equation [52]. (3) ln ( C 0 C ) = k t where C 0 is the initial concentration of MB dye, C is the concentration of MB at time t and k is the pseudo-first order reaction rate constant. The rate constant k was determined by the slope of the straight line in L-H plot represented in Fig. 8e. In the present work, the rate constants of ZIS, ZNd1 and ZNd2 were estimated to be 0.525 min−1, 0.564 min−1 and 0.713 min−1 respectively. The value for ZNd2 is significantly higher than ZIS. Quenchers are employed to ascertain the dominant active species involved in the photocatalytic process. For better understanding of role of active species involved in the photocatalytic degradation process, a series of quenchers were introduced to the degradation system. Silver Nitrate (AgNO3), Isopropanol (IPA) and Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) are used as scavenger to e− (electron), OH● radical and h+ (hole) respectively. As shown in Fig. 9 a-b, the addition of AgNO3 to the system drastically suppresses the activity of the photocatalyst to 68% depicting a major contribution of electrons in the system. However, the degradation efficiency was slightly suppressed on addition of IPA and EDTA to 93% and 90% respectively suggesting that OH● radical and h+ also contribute to the redox reaction. The degradation rate constants calculated for each scavenger is represented in Fig. 9b. From the trapping experiments, it is clear that when AgNO3 is added to scavenge electrons, the amount of degradation is drastically reduced to 68% which clearly underlines the maximum contribution of electron in the degradation activity, along with small contribution from OH● radical and h+. Photoelectrochemical measurement is performed in a three necked quartz container with Pt flat mesh as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 is used as the electrolyte. The working electrode is prepared by doctor bladed coating of the sample on FTO glasses. The photocurrent was measured under illumination of Xenon light source with specifications AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. Chronoamperometry studies (Fig. 10 a) displays the photo response of the samples according to the ON and OFF states of irradiation. The rise and fall in the curve indicates the e−/h+ separation and recombination happening in the system. An average photocurrent density ∼15 μA/cm2 is noted from the chronoamperometry studies for ZNd2 (highest when compared with other samples). Photo voltage decay measurement has been proved to be a useful technique in identifying the life time of trap states [53–55]. From chronoamperometry profile, the decay curve indicates the presence of trap states. Rapid decay suggests lesser trap states and reduced trap states indicate lesser probability for recombination of charge carriers. Hence the lifetime of trap states is estimated by fitting the decay curve (Fig. 10b) with bi-exponential function through the following equation (4) Y ( t ) = A 0 + A 1 e − t τ 1 + A 2 e − t τ 2 (5) τ m = ( τ 1 × τ 2 ) / ( τ 1 + τ 2 ) Here τ m indicates mean harmonic life time of trap states which was estimated to be 230 ms, 220 ms and 200 ms for ZIS, ZNd1 and ZNd2 respectively. Fig. 10c shows linear sweep voltammogram under dark and light irradiation which also shows noteworthy photo response from the sample. Fig. 10d reveals the impedance of the sample under dark and light condition. Upon light irradiation, the radius of the impedance curve reduces when compared to dark condition pointing towards an enhanced separation of e−/h+ pair leading to photoconductivity [56–58]. Increased photoactivity of the modified samples is also observed from the water splitting experiments. A comparison of photocatalytic H2 production rate by as-prepared ZIS and ZNd2 samples and the schematic illustration of photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting are presented in Fig. 11 (a), (b). For the water splitting experiment, 50 ml of distilled water containing 5 mg of catalyst and 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M of Na2S was added to a borosilicate 100 ml reactor. Before irradiation, the reactor is sealed with rubber septum and kept for 30 min in magnetic stirring under dark to gain adsorption-desorption equilibrium followed by Nitrogen (N2) purging for 30 min for the removal of dissolved oxygen. The solution is stirred throughout the experiment under irradiation to achieve homogeneity of the suspension. The solution is irradiated with 250 W Xenon lamp 105 lux and the generated H2 gas is collected using GC syringe at regular intervals of time. The collected gas is analyzed using off-line chromatograph with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) (Shimadzu CG-2014 with molecular sieve/5 Å column) and N2 as a carrier gas (see Fig. S1). The hydrogen production activity from water in the presence of ZNd2 and hole scavenger is shown in Fig. 11. The rate of H2 evolution by ZIS is recorded to be 363.75 μmol g−1 while that of ZNd2 was 3415.85 μmol g−1. A comparison of H2 generation activities reported for various ZIS based materials has been presented in Table 1 ."
3,Conclusion,"Successful incorporation of Nd into ZnIn2S4 lattice is verified by optical, spectroscopic as well as structural analysis. Optical studies clearly show that Nd incorporation in ZnIn2S4 results in improved visible light absorption with a considerable red shift in the absorption onset and improved charge carrier separation. The potential of ZNd2 in photocurrent generation under visible light illumination is analyzed through photoelectrochemical measurements which showed an average current density ∼15 μA/cm2. The efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant methylene blue drastically improves to 98% for ZNd2. The reaction mechanism has been discussed with proposed schematic. The higher photocatalytic activity is also supported by major improvement in H2 production by ZNd2 (∼3415 μmol g−1). The superior photoresponse post Nd3+ incorporation may be attributed to reduction in bandgap, increased charge carrier life time of 3.12 ns (as inferred from life time decay studies) and decreased trap states life time of 200 ms (as observed from photoelectrochemical measurements)."
