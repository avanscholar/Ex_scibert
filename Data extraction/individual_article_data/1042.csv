0,Introduction,"With the ever increasing demand of energy, the burning of fossil fuels is inevitable and environmental pollution is a global concern. Extensive studies have been conducted in search of energy resources that are environment-friendly and renewable [1–4]. In this aspect, hydrogen is the most commendable. The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from water splitting using inexhaustible solar energy is a state-of-the-art strategy, and the use of an efficient photocatalyst is critical [5–7]. Many attempts have been made to develop high-efficiency photocatalysts, such as phase and morphology adjustment [8], doping with metal and non-metal elements [9,10], fabrication of heterojunctions [11,12] and the use of co-catalysts [13–16]. Among them, the introduction of a co-catalyst can not only suppress the recombination of charge carriers through electron trapping but also provide active sites for proton reduction. Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Au and Ag have been widely used as efficient co-catalysts for hydrogen production due to their low Fermi levels [17–21]. However, the high price and relatively rare resource of precious metals hampers their usage. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to explore alternatives that are economically commendable. Co-catalysts that are based on earth abundant materials are much cheaper [4], such as transition-metal sulfides (e.g., WS2 [22], MoS2 [23–25], NiS [26,27], CoxSy [28,29], MnS [30]), and many have showed excellent performance in a majority of photocatalytic systems. In our previous works, WS2 and MoS2 nanoplates were anchored on CdS nanorods, and there was great improvement in hydrogen production under visible light irradiation [31–33]. Recently, there were reports on the coupling of cobalt sulfide (e.g., CoS [34], CoS2 [35], Co3S4 [36], Co9S8 [28,29]) with semiconductors to enhance the separation of charge carriers for the promotion of photocatalytic activity. For example, through rational design of Z-scheme system, Tan et al. developed hierarchical CdS-supported Co9S8 nanoparticles that displayed high activity and stability in photocatalytic hydrogrn evolution (PHE). Furthermore, over CdS nanorods modified by cobalt-based co-catalysts (Co(OH)2, Co3O4, CoS, CoO), Lang et al. observed high photocatalytic activity and reported that the cobalt-containing species play a significant role in the trapping and transport of hot electrons. According to these photocatalytic systems, cobalt sulfide as a co-catalyst can strengthen the absorption of solar light, accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and offer ample active sites for reactions [37]. Hou and coworkers reported a hydrogen production efficiency of 1232 μmol·h−1 g−1 over CoS2/g-C3N4 hybrid composites [35]. Fu et al. improved the light harvesting ability of carbon quantum dots (CDs) by adding CoMo-S in the photocatalytic system [38]. Reddy and coworkers also used C@CoS2 as co-catalyst to enhance the PHE activity of CdS nanorods [37]. It is hence envisaged that similar to noble metals, cobalt sulfides may facilitate the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers at the heterojunctions. It was reported that cobalt disulfide (CoS2) with intrinsic metallic conductivity (6.7 × 103 S cm−1 at 300 K) displayed remarkable electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities [39]. Using metallic cobalt pyrite CoS2 (micro- and nanostructure) as catalysts, Matthew et al. observed good electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [40]. Using Si microwires surrounded by cobalt disulfide as photocathode for solar hydrogen evolution, Chen and coworkers found that CoS2 not only served as protective layer, but also as a co-catalyst to reduce the recombination of charge carriers [41]. In other words, CoS2 can promote the migration and separation efficiency of photoelectrons. Despite the presence of cobalt sulfide is known to be beneficial for electron transfer from semiconductors, the exact nature of charge separation at the composite interfaces is always neglected. In this work, we facilely anchored CoS2 nanoparticles on CdS nanorods by an in-situ solvothermal method, and analyzed the band gap as well as the shift direction of interfacial electrons at the CoS2/CdS heterojunction by DFT calculations. Owing to large surface area, high exposure of active sites, and effective transfer of photogenerated electrons from CdS to CoS2, the CoS2/CdS composite gave a H2 production rate of ˜58 mmol·g−1 h−1 (λ ≥ 400 nm), much higher than that of CdS or Pt/CdS."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation,"2.1 Preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of CdS nanorods CdS nanorods were prepared according to the solvothermal method described by Jiang et al. [42]. Typically, 20.23 mmol of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 60.69 mmol of CH4N2S were dissolved in ethanediamine (60 mL). Then the solution was transferred to a polyphenylene-lined autoclave of 100 mL and heated at 160 °C for 50 h. The yellow product was collected by filtration, washed with de-ionized water and ethanol for three times, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. 2.1.2 Synthesis of CoS2/CdS composites The synthetic process of CoS2/CdS composites is illustrated in Scheme 1 . Briefly, 1 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 80 mL of ethylene glycol, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min to form a pink solution. Then a certain amount of the as-prepared CdS nanorods was added with stirring in a period of 10 min. The mixture was then subject to ultrasonic treatment with stirring for 60 min. The as-generated yellow solution was transferred into a polyphenylene-lined autoclave of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and dried at 80 °C overnight. Altogether seven CoS2/CdS composites with Co:Cd molar ratio of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6 were synthesized, and are herein denoted as CC0.5, CC1, CC2, CC3, CC4, CC5, and CC6, respectively. The pure CoS2 catalyst was synthesized following the above steps but without the addition of CdS. 2.1.3 Synthesis of physically mixed CoS2-CdS composite For comparison purpose, a sample of CoS2-CdS composite was prepared by physical mixing (Co:Cd = 1:4, denoted as CC4(P)). Briefly, 1 mmol of as-prepared CoS2 powder and 4 mmol of CdS nanorods were thoroughly ground in an agate mortar for 30 min, and the collected powder was dried at 80 °C overnight. 2.1.4 Synthesis of Pt/CdS composite The Pt/CdS composite was prepared by loading 1 wt% of Pt on CdS according to the photoreduction method reported by Zhang et al. [43]. First, 50 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution containing 2 mg of Pt was prepared. Then 200 mg of CdS nanorods was added to the solution, and the mixture was allowed to stand at 25 °C for 2 h. The solution was then illuminated using a 300 W Xe lamp (with a cut-off filter to remove light with λ < 400 nm) for 2 h with stirring. Finally the yellow powder was collected, washed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol for three times, and dried at 80 °C overnight."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2000/PC, λ = 0.15406 nm, Rigaku Corporation) was employed for the characterization of crystal structure. The morphology and elemental mapping analyses were conducted over a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (Hitachi S-4800) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, accelerating voltage: 100 kV, Tecnai G2 F20). The element contents of samples were calculated according to the results of ICP-OES analysis (Varian 720). The surface composition and chemical states of elements was analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo SCIENTIFIC K-Alpha). The specific surface area (BET) of samples was obtained by using a Gemini VII 2390 instrument (Micromeritics Instrument Corp.). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Cary 100, Agilent). Photoluminescence (PL) measurement was performed on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation light: 350 nm). An electrochemical analyzer (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua) was employed to record photoelectrochemical activity, using Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as reference electrode, Pt wire as counter electrode, prepared sample (20 mg powder, 0.5 mL Nafion, 1.5 mL alcohol, and dried at 80 °C for 2 h) as working electrode, and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 0.2 M) as electrolyte. The data for the plotting of M-S curves were measured using sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M, pH = 7), and the amplitude voltage was 5 mV at a selected frequency. The final potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were translated into the standard hydrogen electrode using the below equation [44]: ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 We carried out the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation fuctional in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) and employed the empirical correction method proposed by Grimme (DFT-D2) to describe the van deer Waals (vdW) interaction. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional was adopted to investigate the band gap due to the underestimation of PBE. The energy cutoff for plane-wave basis set and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid were set as 350 eV and 3 × 3 × 1, respectively. A vacuum space of over 15 Å along the c axis was constructed to minimize the interaction between adjacent layers. The geometric structure was optimized until the convergence standard of total energy was 1.0 × 10–5 eV and the force on per atom was smaller than 0.05 eV∙Å–1."
4,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were carried out in a sealed quartz reactor (250 mL) equipped with pumping facility. The reactor top was illuminated with a 300 W Xe lamp (HSX-F300, Perfectlight, Beijing) with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 400 nm). First, 20 mg of photocatalyst was put in the reactor lumen together with an aqueous solution containing lactic acid or Na2S/Na2SO3 (50 mL, 20 vol%). Then the gases were removed using a vacuum pump, and the reaction system was kept in the dark with constant stirring for 30 min to establish adsorption-and-desorption equilibrium. The production of hydrogen was hourly monitored using a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7820A, 5A molecular sieve column) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The apparent quantum yield (A.Q.Y.) was measured upon monochromatic light irradiation according to the method reported in our previous work [31] using the following equations: A . Q . Y . = n u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % = 2 × ( n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d h y d r o g e n m o l e c u l e s ) n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of CdS, CoS2 and CoS2/CdS samples are compiled in Fig. 1 a. The peaks of CdS nanorods match well with those of hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS 41-1049) [42], while the main peaks of CoS2 nanoparticles are assignable to those of cubic CoS2 (JCPDS 41-1471) [45], suggesting that pure CdS and CoS2 were successfully prepared. As for the CoS2/CdS composites, the characteristic peaks of CdS can be detected but those of CoS2 cannot. The absence of CoS2 signal could be due to its high dispersion, low content, and/or poor crystallinity. Similar phenomena were reported in the works of Chen et al. [13] and Jiang et al. [42]. It is worth pointing out that the relative intensity of the (100) peak (2θ = 24.807°) of CdS as well as that of the composites are much higher than that of standard CdS (in the PDF card), indicating the high exposure of the CdS (100) plane. Similarly, the XRD pattern of CoS2 indicates the high exposure of the (200) plane. Furthermore, the actual composition of the CoS2/CdS composites was verified by ICP-OES analysis (Table S1, supporting information, SI†), and the genuine Co:Cd molar ratios are quite in agreement with the nominal ones. Overall, the results of XRD and ICP analyses evidence the successful fabrication of the CoS2/CdS composites. Furthermore, because there is no detection of impurity phases, it is deduced that the coupling of CoS2 with CdS has little effect on the crystallinity and phase structure of CdS. We performed XPS analysis to investigate the chemical states and composition of surface elements. The survey spectra of CdS, CoS2 and CoS2/CdS samples are displayed in Fig. 1b, which indicates the presence of Cd and S on CdS, Co and S on CoS2, and Co, Cd, S on the CoS2/CdS composites. The Co 2p spectrum of CoS2 shows deconvoluted peaks at 797.6, 793.9, 781.5, and 778.7 eV as well as two shake-up satellite peaks (Fig. 1c). The peaks at 797.6 eV and 781.5 eV are Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals of CoS2, while those at 793.9 eV and 778.7 eV are Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals of cobalt oxide [46,47]. As for CdS, it shows Cd 3d peaks at 410.8 eV and 404.1 eV (Fig. 1d), and S 2p peaks at 161.5 eV and 160.4 eV (Fig. 1e), in agreement with literature data [31,42]. Compared with the S 2p spectrum of CdS, that of CoS2 is more complicated (Fig. 1e). The CoS2 peaks at 163.2 eV and 161.9 eV are ascribable to the S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals of CoS2, which overlap strongly with those of SC species. As for the peak at 168.9 eV, it is attributable to the S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals of SO entities [38,47,48]. The XPS spectra of the hybrid CoS2/CdS samples (i.e. CC2, CC4 and CC6) are rather similar (Fig. 1f,g,h). The Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 peaks are at 411.6 eV and 404.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 1d), which are consistent with the Cd2+ signals of CdS in literature [13,31]. The Co 2p signals at 796.6 eV and 780.6 eV are assignable to Co-S of CoS2, while those at 794.0 eV and 778.9 eV) to Co-O of cobalt oxide, and the two peaks in purple color are attributed to shake-up satellites [45,47]. In Fig. 1h, the peaks at 161.1 eV and 163.0 eV are ascribed to the S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co-S bond, and the signals at 168.8 eV was caused by SO bond, which is in agreement with previous reports [29,43]. Compared to CdS, CC4 exhibits positive shift (˜0.8 eV) in Cd 3d and S 2p binding energy, while compared to CoS2, there is negative shift (˜0.8 eV) of Co 2p and S 2p binding energy, which indicate electron transfer from CdS to CoS2 [28,49,50]. Based on the XPS results, it is deduced that there are close interaction between CdS and CoS2, forming interfaces in CC2, CC4 and CC6 that act as ‘electron bridges’ to accelerate charge transfer. According to the XRD results, the most exposed surfaces of the CoS2/CdS composites are those of the CoS2 (200) and CdS (001) planes (Fig. 1a). We hence conducted the first-principles DFT simulation (Fig. 2 a and b) based on the structures of CoS2 (200) and CdS (001) surfaces: cubic phase with Pa-3 space group for CoS2 and hexagonal phase with P63mc space group for CdS. The geometric structure of CoS2/CdS is illustrated in Fig. 2c, and the lattice mismatch is no more than 2.53%. The calculated binding energy of CoS2/CdS is less than zero, which indicates that CoS2 and CdS can form a heterostructure that is thermodynamically stable. We performed first-principle calculation to explore the innate characteristics of charge transfer and separation. The Fermi levels (EF) of the exposed CdS (001) and CoS2 (200) surfaces are estimated as follows: Φ = E vac − E F Where Φ is the work function, which is calculated to be 5.17 eV and 5.23 eV, respectively, for CdS (001) and CoS2 (200) surfaces (Fig. 2d − e), and Evac is the energy of a stationary electron at the vacuum level (assumed to be 0 eV). Accordingly, the EF of CdS (001) and CoS2 (200) surfaces can be calculated to be -5.17 and -5.23 eV, respectively. The results are consistent with the work of Xu et al., which revealed that the work function (vs. vacuum level) of CdS and CoS2 was 5.18 eV and 5.49 eV, respectively [51]. It is obvious that the EF of CoS2 (200) surface is more negative than that of CdS (001) surface. Thus, when the CdS (001) and CoS2 (200) surfaces are in contact, electrons tend to migrate from CdS to CoS2 for potential equilibrium, restraining the recombination of charge carriers as a result. To further demonstrate the charge transfer at the CoS2/CdS interface, the planar-averaged differential charge density was calculated and the result is shown in Fig. S1 (SI†). The positive value represents charge accumulation, while the negative value indicates charge depletion. It is apparent that at the CoS2/CdS interface, electrons primarily transfer from the CdS layer to the CoS2 layer. As shown in Fig. 3 a and b, the SEM images of pure CdS clearly show nanorods with an average length of 800 nm. The surface of the nanorods is smooth, showing no impurity or pores [44]. On the other hands, pure CoS2 exists as microparticles approximately 1.5 μm in size (Fig. 3c and d), which are assemblies of nanoparticles. The morphology of CoS2/CdS heterostructure is displayed in Fig. 3e and f. It is clear that the CoS2 nanoparticles (about 15 nm in size) are evenly distributed on the CdS nanorods with no sight of aggregation, and hence could not be detected in XRD analysis. Furthermore, the BET surface area of CdS and CC4 is 32.7 m2 g−1 and 34.7 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S2, SI†). Despite the difference in specific surface area is not apparent, there are much more active sites on the latter due to the presence of CoS2. The TEM and HRTEM images of pristine CdS nanorods and CC4 are displayed in Fig. 4 . In consistent with the SEM results, the TEM image of Fig. 4 a clearly shows that the surface of CdS nanorods is smooth. The HRTEM image (Fig. 4b) reveals crystal lattice fringes of 0.36 nm which is assignable to the (100) lattice plane of CdS [52]. The images of CC4 in Figs. 4 c and d exhibit the presence of particles approximately 15 nm in size on the CdS nanorod, and their presence does not alter the structure of the CdS nanorod. The lattice spacings of 0.25 nm and 0.24 nm are attributed to the (210) plane of CoS2 and (102) plane of CdS, respectively. The results are in line with those of previous reports [13,53,54]. The elemental mapping (Fig. 4e − h) and EDX analysis results (Fig. S3, SI†) of CC4 further disclose homogeneous distribution of Cd, S and Co elements which confirms the high dispersion of CoS2 nanoparticles on CdS. The absorption coefficient of the composites is determined according to the following equation: α ( ω ) = ( 2 ) ω ε 1 ( ω ) 2 + ε 2 ( ω ) 2 − ε 1 ( ω ) 1 2 Where ε 1 ( ω ) and ε 2 ( ω ) are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function, respectively, and ω is defined as the function of optical frequency. As shown in Fig. 5 a, CdS has poor optical absorption and needs improvement in the 1.6 − 3.1 eV region for visible light absorption, while the absorption coefficient of CoS2 is higher than that of CdS. Upon coupling of CdS and CoS2, there is significant enhancement of light absorption. In order to disclose the energy band structure of CdS and CoS2, we carried out calculation using density functional theory (DFT). The electronic band structure of CoS2 and CdS are shown in Fig. 5b and c. It is clear that the band gap of CoS2 is 0 eV, which is in consistent with the result of Chen et al. [55]. Meanwhile, the band gap of CdS is 1.52 eV, in agreement with the calculation result of Garg et al. that planar CdS is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.60 eV [56]. The agreement indicates that our calculation adopting the PBE approach is appropriate. The outcomes (Fig. 5) predict that CoS2 has good light-harvesting ability and good photoelectron conductivity (Eg = 0 eV at the CoS2/CdS interface) at the CoS2/CdS heterojunction. It is hence theoretically confirmed that the metallic property of CoS2 is crucial in the transfer and separation of photoelectrons for photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen in water splitting. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared samples are depicted in Fig. 6 a. Pure CdS nanorods show obvious absorption in the region of 400–530 nm as previously reported [15,42], and CoS2 exhibits absorption that covers almost the entire visible light region [45]. As for the composites, they show light absorption pattern similar to that of CdS but with enhanced absorption in the 530–700 nm region, in agreement with the DFT calculation results (Fig. 5a). The phenomenon could be ascribed to the strong absorption capacity of CoS2 in visible light region and the interfacial interaction between CdS and CoS2. In addition, the band gaps of the CoS2/CdS samples can be obtained using the following equation [15]: αhv = A(hv-Eg)n/2 where α, h, v, A and Eg stand for the absorption coefficient, Planck’s constant, light frequency, proportionality constant, band gap, respectively; and n is dependent on the type of semiconductor. According to the Kubelka–Munk plots in Fig. 6b, the band gap values of CdS and CC4 are 2.38 eV and 2.37 eV, respectively, which are larger than the theoretical value (1.52 eV). It is plausibly because the former are experimental values based on bulk samples while the latter is calculated value based on a small model of layered CdS at the CoS2/CdS interface. The Mott–Schottky curves were plotted to qualitatively analyze the p–n junctions in the absence of illumination as illustrated in Fig. S4 (SI†). The C−2/F−2-E plot of CdS displays a positive slope, which is characteristic of n-type semiconductor. By obtaining the X intercept by means of extrapolation of Mott-Schottky plots (in supporting information), the flat-band potential (Vfb) vs. NHE of CdS at pH = 7.0 is roughly -0.719 V. Using the band gap of CdS (2.38 eV) estimated from the UV–vis DRS graph, the valence band of CdS is found to be +1.661 V vs. NHE at pH = 7.0. With built-in electric field at the CoS2/CdS heterojunction, the photoelectrons quickly transfer from CdS to CoS2, leading to enhanced H2 production under visible light irradiation. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CoS2/CdS composites are shown in Fig. 6 c. That of CdS shows an apparent peak at about 537 nm due to the direct recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. A lower PL signal means higher separation efficiency of photo-excited charge carriers. Apparently, the loading of CoS2 nanoparticles on the CdS nanorods results in lowering of PL intensity. Among the CoS2/CdS composites, CC4 shows the lowest PL intensity and hence is the most efficient in preventing the recombination of charge carriers. To further confirm the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers in the CoS2/CdS samples, transient photocurrent was recorded and analyzed using electrodes coated with the samples under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6d). It is clear that photocurrent could only be obtained upon light irradiation. Specifically, pure CdS nanorods is the lowest in photocurrent intensity while CC4 the highest, giving an intensity order of CdS < CC2 < CC6 < CC4. Again, the results demonstrate that the loading of CoS2 nanoparticles on CdS nanorods can efficiently enhance the transfer and separation of photoexcited electrons and holes. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light illumination was used to assess the photocatalytic performance of the CoS2/CdS composites. As illustrated in Fig. 7 a, there is no detection of H2 over CoS2 nanoparticles owing to its class nature of precious metals, while the activity of CdS is limited (3.1 mmol·g−1 h−1 after an irradiation of 3 h). Gratifyingly, all the CoS2/CdS composites show activity higher than that of CdS (Fig. 7b). Among the prepared catalysts, CC4 is the most efficient, giving a H2 production rate of 58.1 mmol·g−1 h−1, which is ca. 19 times that of CdS nanorods, four times that of CC4(P) prepared by physical mixing (14.7 mmol·g−1 h−1), and three times that of 1 wt%Pt/CdS (19.8 mmol·g−1 h−1). The results reveal that CoS2 can replace noble metals as an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic generation of hydrogen in water splitting. Among the CdS-based photocatalysts using Co-containing compounds as co-catalysts for H2 production under visible light irradiation, CC4 is moderate in activity. However, among the reported CdS photocatalysts modified by cobalt sulfides, CC4 is the highest in activity as well as apparent quantum yield (A.Q.Y., 39.6% at 400 nm) (Table S2, SI†). To evaluate the reusability of CC4, recycling experiments were performed (Fig. S5a, SI†). When lactic acid is used as sacrificial agent, there is apparent decrease in H2 production across the four cycles. Nonetheless, when Na2S/Na2SO3 (0.35 M Na2S/0.25 M Na2SO3) is used, there is no apparent loss, confirming the high stability of CC4 in alkaline solution. We employed the XRD, TEM and XPS techniques to analyze CC4 before and after reaction using either lactic acid or Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial agent. The XRD patterns suggest no change of phase structures after reaction (Fig. S6, SI†). There is no change in the Cd 3d spectra neither after reaction (Fig S7, SI†). Hence the XRD and XPS results confirm the stability of CdS nanorods. However, there is obvious loss of Co 2p signal after recycling in lactic acid solution (Fig. S7, SI†), and the depletion of Co species may result in the loss of photocatalytic activity. The loss of CoS2 nanopartices in lactic acid solution was further confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. S8a and b, SI†). In the case of using Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial agent, Co 2p signal similar to that of fresh CC4 can still be observed after use (Fig. S7, SI†). Also, uniform dispersion of CoS2 nanoparticles on CdS can be found in the TEM image of CC4 after 4 cycles of use (Fig. S8c and d, SI†). The results indicate the stability of CC4 when Na2S/Na2SO3 is adopted as sacrificial agent. Overall, CdS nanorods exhibit low activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production due to poor separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. When CoS2 nanoparticles are used as co-catalyst, the modified CdS nanorods exhibit higher hydrogen production efficiency under visible light irradiation. It is because CoS2 nanoparticles can strengthen the absorption of visible light and enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the loading of CoS2 nanoparticles with class nature of precious metals can enrich the CdS surface with sites for proton reduction. Based on the above results, a possible mechanism is proposed for HER under visible light as illustrated in Fig. 8 . Upon visible light illumination, electrons and holes are generated on the surface of CdS nanorods. Then the photoexcited charge carriers are subject to immediate separation and/or transition under the influence of internal electric field. Part of the photogenerated electrons in the CdS valence band (VB) transfer to the CdS conduction band (CB) and ulteriorly migrate to the catalyst surface, leaving holes in the VB of CdS. Finally, lactic acid molecules (or Na2S/Na2SO3) are oxidized by the VB holes and water molecules are reduced to hydrogen by the CB electrons. The presence of CoS2 nanoparticles on CdS can lower the migration resistance of photogenerated electrons for facile transit to CoS2 nanoparticles, consequently enhancing the separation of charge carriers and promoting the photocatalytic performance of CdS for visible-light-driven water splitting."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, CoS2 nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the surface of CdS nanorods using a simple in-situ solvothermal method. With the deposition of an optimal amount CoS2 nanoparticles, CdS nanorods exhibit high apparent quantum yield (39.6%, λ = 400 nm) and outstanding efficiency for H2 production (˜58.1 mmol·g−1 h−1) under visible light, much higher than that of CdS nanorods deposited with 1 wt%Pt (19.8 mmol·g−1 h−1). Based on the results of DFT calculation and characterization, it is deduced that with class nature of precious metals, cobalt disulfide acts as an effective co-catalyst that can not only efficiently enhance the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers but also offer ample surface sites for proton reduction. This article demonstrates that CoS2 is a commendable alternative to noble metals as co-catalyst for the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the findings provide a new synthetic route for the coupling of zero dimensional nanoparticles with two dimensional semiconductors."
