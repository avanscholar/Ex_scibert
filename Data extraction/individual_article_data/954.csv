0,Introduction,"Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the social development of human beings due to its use as raw materials for various chemical industries, including ammonia/methanol synthesis and refining of hydrocarbons, and as an energy carrier for chemical energy storage for fuel cell electric vehicles and other next-generation energy systems [1]. Hydrogen is produced mainly by natural gas reforming and water electrolysis. However, fossil fuels are not renewable, and the process releases greenhouse gas CO2. Sustainable hydrogen production from renewable biomass or biomass-derived substrates, such as biopyolysis oil, bioethanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, and acetic acid, is very important to mitigate energy-related and environmental issues [2–12]. Among them, hydrogen production by steam reforming ethanol (SRE) has been studied worldwide in both of industrial and academic fields and is best suited to large-scale production at specialized facilities [13–15]. SRE for hydrogen production processes contains two major serial reactions, including breakage of the C–C bond and the subsequent water-gas shift reaction. Additionally, several competitive reactions can occur during the SRE process, resulting in different undesirable by-products, such as ethylene and acetaldehyde, which follow the decomposition reaction to generate coke deposits with different structural and morphological characteristics based on reaction conditions and catalyst characters [13–16]. The concerned parallel or secondary reactions have been summarized in detail in previous studies [3,4,15]. To obtain higher H2 yield, numerous studies focusing on designing and manufacturing effective catalysts for SRE process have been reported, including Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ni, Co and Fe [13–24]. Noble metal catalysts presented superior catalytic activity in the SRE reaction given their unique capability to break the C–C bond. However, the H2 selectivity of Pt-based catalysts was higher than that of Rh-based catalysts because Pt metal active sites catalyse the WGSR and exhibit a unique ability to break the C–C bond [17,20]. However, the high cost of Pt metal catalysts restricts their large-scale industrial application. Non-noble metal based catalysts, such as Ni and Co, are the most frequently studied catalysts for steam reforming (SR) of hydrocarbons and oxygenated chemicals derived from biomass given their disruption capacity of C–C and C–H bonds [15,17,25–31]. As noted in the literature [17,29], Co-based catalysts have flexible crystalline phases, such as Co metal and CoOx species, and they are both active sites for SRE, in which the Co site could effectively induce catalytic C–C bond scission and WGSR and CoOx could react with the carbon-contained intermediate to remove carbon deposition. Nevertheless, Co metal species with extremely high oxytropism could inevitably be oxidized by oxygen-containing fragment, giving rise to the loss of active sites [4]. In addition, Co metal sites exhibit high activity for methanation [17]. Nickel-based catalysts have been used for commercial scale production of several reforming processes given their high activity and low cost [5]. Admittedly, Ni-based catalysts suffer from carbon deposits and oxidation of metallic sites or sintering. Additionally, there is a synergistic effect between the carbon deposition and sintering. The larger Ni particles due metal sintering generate higher amounts of coke, and carbon deposits with different characteristics result in the enlargement of Ni particles during SRE [32]. This phenomenon had also been reported in other SR reactions [33]. Thus, considerable efforts have been devoted to adding additives to promote the catalytic performance of nickel catalysts during SR reactions [14,17,34–40]. The additives, such as metals (Co, Cu and Fe) and metal oxides, exhibit delicate influences on the constitutive properties of Ni-based catalysts, including improved active Ni metal dispersion and metal-support interactions (MSI), optimization of surface acid sites and fabrication of oxygen vacancy. Ma HY and his colleague [26] studied the influence of La contents on Ni/Al2O3 catalytic performance for SRE and found that the meso-3LaNiAl catalyst exhibited the highest initial activity due to its highly dispersed Ni particles and abundant active surface areas. Wang YS et al. [34] and Nichele V et al. [35] investigated the effect of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts on hydrogen production from SR reactions. In these studies, the catalytic performance was obviously improved by the formation of Ni-M alloy (M is Co, Cu or Zn), which could significantly increase metal dispersion and enhance MSI. In addition, Chen MQ et al. [3] found that the MgO additive could attenuate the acid sites of Ni/Attapulgite and restrain the formation of the coke precursor ethylene, and Liu F et al. [40] revealed that the Ni-based catalysts supported on La–Ce solid solution with abundant oxygen vacancies eliminated carbon deposits from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the choice of support strongly impacts the catalytic performance of nickel catalysts in SRE reactions. Aluminium oxide is diffusely used as support of nickel catalysts during SRE processes given its unique mechanical and thermal stability [13–15,17,18]. However, Al2O3 has a modifiable crystalline structure and plentiful surface acidity, resulting in an uncontrollable Al-supported nickel catalyst structure and ethanol dehydration reaction, thereby altering the catalytic performance and forming carbon deposits [31,41]. Thus, some dopants with alkalinity and oxygen storage capacity, such as MgO, La2O3 and CeO2, are adopted to optimize and improve aluminium-based nickel catalysts. In the final analysis, all the optimizing strategies for nickel catalysts have a common goal that is to increase nickel nanoparticle dispersion and the active metal surface area and improve MSI, consequently altering the catalytic behaviour during SRE processes. Attapulgite (ATP, also called Palygorskite) is a type of mineral clay that contains long double chains of silica tetrahedron connected by Mg and Al in octahedral sites to form a nanofibre structure. Thus, ATP has a large surface area, excellent adsorption performance and high mechanical strength. Therefore, it is widely used in various catalytic reactions as a catalyst carrier, such as catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 [42], hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol [43], catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde [44], and low-temperature CO oxidation [45]. More importantly, ATP also has been used in SR reactions by our group and Hu’s team [3,5,7,34,46,47]. Their results demonstrated that ATP as carrier for load nickel species could improve metal dispersion and MSI, thereby enhancing SR reaction activity and stability. Additionally, considering the economic efficiency, the application of low-cost ATP in SRE for hydrogen production has promising potential for commercialization. In addition to additives and support materials, catalyst synthesis parameters have a significant impact on microscopic morphology of Ni-based catalysts, including metal size, reducibility and MSI [8,48–51]. Calcination is an important process for preparing nickel catalyst, and the calcination temperature (CT) greatly affects the catalyst properties and subsequently determines the catalytic performance. High CT can cause catalyst particles to sinter and thereby reduce catalytic activity but increase the interaction between support and catalyst particles and subsequently enhance stability. Furthermore, heat treatment processes can affect the properties of ATP, including particle size distribution, surface free energy, and adsorption performance [52,53]. Therefore, investigating and understanding the relationships between the properties of Ni/ATP catalyst and CT have a crucial role for maximizing its catalytic performance in SR reactions. These findings could also offer useful information for other catalytic reactions and the preparation other supported catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of CT on Ni/ATP catalytic performance of SRE reactions has not been assessed. In this study, the precursor of Ni/ATP that contained 20 wt% Ni metal was prepared via a chemical precipitation method and then calcined at different temperatures (200–900 °C, with 100 °C of interval) for 2 h to obtain required catalysts (denoting as Ni/ATP-x, x represented the CT). N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, HRTEM, H2-TPR, Raman, and FTIR results were used to study the effect of CT on the microscopic morphology of the Ni/ATP catalyst. Then, these catalysts were applied to the SRE process to investigate the relationship between catalyst CT and catalytic performance. In addition, coke formation on spent catalysts were analysed by using Raman and TG-MS."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The ATP clays were produced from Xuyi City of China and pre-treated (described in detail in our previous report [7]) before being used as a support. The Ni/ATP catalyst that contained 20 wt% Ni metal was synthesized by chemical precipitation as reported in Refs. [47] and the flow chart of synthesis process of catalysts was presented in Scheme 1 . Typically, 6.19 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved completely in 100 mL of deionized water in a 250-mL beaker to form a homogeneous aqueous solution. Then, 5.00 g of ATP was placed under intense agitation at 80 °C for 2 h to obtain a slurry. Continuously, 5 mol/L of NH3·H2O aqueous solution was added slowly into the slurry until its pH increased to 9.8 ± 0.2. The produced mixture was constantly stirred at 80 °C for 4 h and matured statically for 24 h at 80 °C. Then, the product was filtered, washed, and dried to obtain the Ni/ATP catalyst precursor. The precursor was calcined at different temperatures (200–900 °C with an interval of 100 °C) for 2 h under static air at a rate of 2.0 °C/min. The obtained products were calcined catalysts recorded as Ni/ATP-Cx (where x was the CT, such as 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900). Additionally, the reduced catalyst was produced from the reduction treatment of the corresponding calcined catalyst under 0.4 L/min of 10 vol% H2/N2 flow for 2 h at 700 °C (the heating rate was 2.0 °C/min)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The physicochemical properties and microstructures of calcined/reduced catalysts were analysed by various characterization technologies, including N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, HRTEM, H2-TPR, FTIR and Raman. The nature of carbon deposits over the spent catalyst surface was characterized by FTIR, Raman and TG-MS. Detailed characterization information was presented in our previous report ref [47] and in Support Information."
4,Evaluation of catalytic performance,"2.3 Evaluation of catalytic performance All catalytic activity tests were performed using a continuous-flow fixed-bed as reported in Ref. [47]. Specific operation conditions were introduced in Ref. [47]. The effect of CT on catalytic performance for SRE was evaluated under the following fixed conditions: the molar ratio steam to carbon (S/C) was 1.5, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 12.6 h−1 and time-on-stream (TOS) was 4 h. The stability test was performed for 60 h. In addition, the ethanol conversion (XE), H2 yield (YH2) and selectivity for carbon-containing products (Si, i represents CH4, CO2 and CO) were determined using the equations reported in our previous report [6,47]. To guarantee the reliability of experimental data, every SRE test was conducted thrice, and the mean experimental value was used to evaluate catalytic performance. The carbon balance was within approximately ±5% for all catalytic runs. Data for these catalysts activities were collected from more than three repeated tests to guarantee the dependability."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of the calcination temperature on the physicochemical properties of Ni/ATP,"3.1 Effect of the calcination temperature on the physicochemical properties of Ni/ATP 3.1.1 N2 adsorption-desorption analysis The influence of CT on textural properties of fresh Ni/ATP catalysts was studied by N2 adsorption-desorption technology, and the results were presented in Fig. 1 . All calcined Ni/ATP catalysts had VI-type isotherms coupled with typical H3-type hysteresis loops according to the IUPAC classification, and the hysteresis loops were gradually decreased with CT as shown in Fig. 1(A). This finding indicates that Ni/ATP calcined at different temperatures exhibited a typical mesoporous structure comprised of a stack of lamellar nanofibres [34,47]. In addition, the pore diameter distributions of these catalysts were concentrated upon 2–5 nm as displayed in Fig. 1(B) and there were some larger pore appearance with CT. The corresponding surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vpore) and average pore diameter (dpore) of Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts were listed in Table 1 . Upon increasing CT, the surface area and pore volume decreased, and the pore diameter was increased inch by inch. However, when CT exceeded 700 °C, the surface area was significantly reduced to 10.2 m2/g for Ni/ATP-C900 from 216.4 m2/g for Ni/ATP-C700, and the pore volume was reduced to 0.051 cm3/g from 0.402 cm3/g. These results were ascribed to the shrinkage of the crystalline structure accompanied with the collapse of the micropores to form larger pores during the calcination processes. This phenomenon had also been reported by Zhang CT et al. [8] and Tan MW et al. [51]. When the CT was greater than 700 °C, the ATP skeleton structure was destroyed, and Si/Al/Mg species located at the ATP crystal were dissolved to form magnesium/aluminium oxide and silica. 3.1.2 XRD characterization The variations in crystalline structure of calcined and reduced Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts caused by CT were detected by XRD technology. The obtained XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 2 . As presented in Fig. 2(A), when the CT was less than 700 °C, the peaks that appeared at 2θ = 8.5°, 13.7°, 16.3°, 19.8°, 24.4°, 27.8° and 34.8° were indexed to the crystalline structure of ATP (Mg5(Si, Al)8O20(OH)2(OH2)4·4H2O) [7]. The crystal phase SiO2 was also noted at 20.9°, 26.6°, 50.6°, 57.2° and 59.8° given that ATP is a type of hydrous magnesia-aluminosilicate clay mineral that contains a silica tetrahedral framework. Distinct and well-defined diffraction peaks at 37.4°, 43.3° and 62.6° assigned to the NiO species were observed in calcined Ni/ATP-Cx (x ≤ 700 °C), suggesting that nickel oxide species with very small particle diameters were below the XRD detection limitation, highly dispersed on the ATP surface with an amorphous phase formation, or interacted with the ATP framework to form Ni(Si, Mg, Al)–O species [47]. Notably, many emerged diffraction peaks were attributed to new crystal phases in calcined Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATP-C900, particularly in the later. The peaks at 16.3°, 31.4°, 33.8°, and 34.8° are attributed to the Al2O3 phase, and the peaks at 24.2°, 34.7° and 36.5° are ascribed to the characteristic peak of (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5 species [54]. The sharp and intense peaks at approximately 37.4°, 43.3° and 62.6° in calcined Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATP-C900 are ascribed to the NiO with a highly crystalline nature. These findings illustrated that CT had overt effects on the crystal phase of the Ni/ATP catalyst. As reported in Ref. [47], the nickel species could interact with Si/Al/Mg present in the ATP skeleton structure during the catalyst preparation process to form amorphous Ni(Si, Mg, Al)–O species. Therefore, the NiO phase was not observed in Ni/ATP catalysts calcined at low temperatures (≤700 °C), and the ATP crystal phases were well reserved. When the CT was greater than 700 °C, the ATP framework was destroyed, and the Si/Al/Mg species located at ATP skeleton or combined with nickel migrated and were released from the ATP matrix, resulting in the formations of new species, including SiO2, Al2O3, (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5 and NiO based on the following equation. (1) Ni(NO3)2 + Mg5(Si, Al)8O20(OH)2(OH2)4·4H2O → SiO2+ Al2O3 + (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5 + NiO For all Ni/ATP-Cx samples, after reduction at 700 °C for 2 h the crystal phase of metallic Ni was further confirmed with intense diffraction peaks at 44.3° and 51.9° corresponding to (111) and (200) planes of Nio in reduced Ni/ATP-Cx (x ≤ 700 °C) as presented in Fig. 2(B). For reduced Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATP-C900, the intensities of Nio diffraction peaks gradually decreased, while two sharp peaks at approximately 43° and 62° were observed. It has been widely accepted that the vast majority of nickel oxide species in Ni-based supports catalysts could be reduced to Nio phases at 700 °C [34,47]. Consequently, the two peaks were attributed to the NiO phase. It can be hypothesized that they were the diffraction peaks of Ni(Mg, Al)–O species based on the report of Kumagai S et al. [55]. Thus, the peaks at approximately 43° and 62° in calcined Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATP-C900 (Fig. 2(A)) may be assigned to the overlap of peaks of NiO and Ni(Mg, Al)–O species. To further reveal the effect of the reduction process over crystalline structures of Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts, the XRD patterns at 5–40° were enlarged and shown in Fig. 2(C). The crystal structure compositions of reduced samples were highly aligned with the corresponding counterpart. The Nio crystal sizes of reduced Ni/ATP-Cx were compiled in Table 1. The Nio metal size was obviously affected by CT. Ni/ATP-C900 had lowest crystal size of 10.1 nm, and Ni/ATP-600 subsequently has a small larger crystal size of 12.4 nm. 3.1.3 H2-TPR analysis H2-TPR technology was conducted to investigate the influence of CT on the reducibility of Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts and the distribution of nickel species on their surface, and the results were depicted in Fig. 3 . As reported in the literature [7,47,56–58], TPR profiles of Ni-based catalysts were significantly affected by the interaction strength between nickel species and supports, and the reduction temperature could be transferred to high temperature as the metal-support interaction intensity increased. In general, the reduction peaks at low-temperature (LT) regions (<500 °C) in TPR profiles were attributed to the reduction of isolated and free NiO species that had low interaction with supports. Peaks at high-temperature (HT) regions (>500 °C) ascribed to the reduction of Niδ+ with strong metal-support interaction or that migrated into the matrix of support form a composite nanomaterial with a spinel structure and solid solution [57]. According to TPR profiles in Fig. 3, the Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts calcined below 800 °C all presented two separate reduction peaks in the LT and HT regions, separately. Therefore, different nickel species with were present in different coordination environments in Ni/ATP catalysts. In addition, reduction peaks both at LT and HT regions shifted increasingly to high temperature with CT at 200–800 °C. This finding indicates that CT enhanced the interaction strength between nickel species and ATP. In contrast, the LT reduction peak disappeared in Ni/ATP-C900, while the HT peak was divided into two peaks at approximately 662 °C and 780 °C. This finding revealed that excessive CT caused the dramatic structure transformation demonstrated by abovementioned characterizations and subsequently caused the formation of various new species, such as Ni(Mg, Al)–O and (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5. The variation in TPR profiles also accounted for the catalyst reducibility, which was important for catalytic performance. Thus, the practical hydrogen consumption based on TPR detection is provided in Table 1. The reduction degrees of Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts were significantly impacted by CT. Among them, Ni/ATP-C600 showed the highest reduction degree of 86.1%. In this work, all catalysts were activated at 700 °C, which is lower than the required temperature for Ni/ATP-C900 to reduce all nickel species. This finding suggested that new species, such as Ni(Mg, Al)–O and (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5, improved the reduction of Ni2+, causing less available Ni sites (active sites for the SRE reaction) and lower catalytic activity than the Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst. 3.1.4 HRTEM analysis Fig. 4 presented the typical TEM images of the reduced catalysts, such as Ni/ATP-C300, Ni/ATP-C600 and Ni/ATP-C900, in which a batch of nanorods or nanofibres with the classic architecture of ATP support was observed in reduced Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 catalysts. However, the nanofibres disappeared clearly for reduced Ni/ATP-C900 catalyst, and there were many roughly circular platy grains were observed. For Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600, the black spots dispersed on ATP fibres could be assigned to nickel particles as shown in Fig. 4(A) and (B). A particle count derived from many such TEM images obtained from different scanning areas of samples confirmed the presence of nickel particles with different dispersities. The corresponding bar charts of particle size distributions were also presented in Fig. 4. The mean nickel particle sizes of Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 were 23.2 nm and 14.6 nm, respectively, which was similar to the XRD results. As shown on the right side of Fig. 4, the lattice fringes of different species formed in counterparts were also characterized by HRTEM. The expected spacing of 0.204 nm and 0.177 nm were attributed to (111) and (200) lattice planes of Ni metal. In addition, Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 displayed the interaction spacing of 0.257 nm of the (102) lattice plane of ATP and 0.334 nm of (102) lattice plane of SiO2. This finding is related to the existence of mixed crystal phases of Ni metal, ATP and SiO2 as confirmed by XRD analysis. In contrast, some new phases appeared in Ni/ATP-C900, such as (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5 species with the interaction spacing of 0.258 nm and Al2O3 species with a spacing of 0.273 nm ascribed to (200) lattice plane. Additionally, some irregular particles with darker colours appeared in the Ni/ATP-C900 sample, which could be assigned to Ni(Mg, Al)–O species with no specific lattice fringe. These results further confirmed that the surface structure of Ni/ATP-Cx was affected by CT. Excessive temperature caused the destruction of ATP fibre and the appearance of some new phases. 3.1.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis The changes of chemical composition and state of reduced Ni/ATP-Cx impacted by CT were further investigated by XPS analysis. The full XPS spectra of reduced Ni/ATP-Cx were displayed in Fig. S1. Ni/ATP catalysts were mainly composed of Mg, Si, Al, Ni, and O elements. The existence of a Ni 2p peak located at approximately 850 eV in all catalysts confirmed that Ni atoms were successfully introduced into ATP support catalysts. Moreover, the contents of the abovementioned elements on the surfaces of all reduced catalysts were analysed by XPS, and the results were presented in Table S1. Ni and Si contents almost increased monotonically with CT, while Al and Mg contents presented an opposite trend. This finding indicates that nickel species gradually migrated into the ATP matrix and interacted with the Mg/Si/Al species to build the ATP framework during the calcination process. The XPS spectra of Ni 2p in the reduced Ni/ATP-Cx are shown in Fig. 5 . The Ni 2p spectrum exhibits two contributions, namely, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, resulting from the spin-orbit splitting. The peaks at approximately 852 eV and 870 eV with approximately 18 eV of spin orbit split were attributed to Nio species on the surface of reduced catalysts. The peaks at approximately 856 eV and 874 eV with satellite peaks (Sat.) at 862 eV and 880 eV, respectively, were ascribed to Ni2+ species strongly interacting with the catalyst support [47,59]. This finding implied the coexistence of Nio and Ni2+ species in all reduced catalysts. In addition, the bonding energies (BEs) of abovementioned peaks had different shifts as CT increased. The BEs corresponding to different peaks were listed in Table 2 . Based on the findings of Kam R et al. [60], the shift in BEs provided evidence of an interaction between nickel species and ATP matrix. Obviously, the interaction mechanism between nickel species and the ATP framework in Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATPC900 was distinguished from that in other catalysts. This finding may be attributed to the transformation and destruction of crystal structure of catalyst caused by CT, resulting in the occurrence of new species, such as Ni(Mg, Al)–O and (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5 according to XRD and HRTEM results. Additionally, with increasing CT, the XPS peak area of reduced catalysts corresponding to Nio and Ni2+ species changed significantly. To further compare the influence of CT on the surface composition of nickel species, the Nio/(Nio + Ni2+) molar ratios of reduced catalysts are presented in Table 1. The Nio/(Nio + Ni2+) molar ratio showed a volcanic trend. Ni/ATP-C600 displayed the highest value of 0.327, while the value is only 0.019 for reduced Ni/ATP-C900. These circumstances further uncovered that the dispersion of nickel species on the surface of reduced catalysts depended overtly on CT, and excessive CT led to the significant decrease in Nio content on the catalyst surface, resulting from the transformation and destruction of the crystal structure of the catalyst and thus determining the catalytic activity of the catalyst for the SRE reaction. To further reveal the effect of CT on the nature of the interaction between nickel species and ATP framework, the XPS spectra of Al 2p, Si 2p and Mg 1s were also shown in Fig. 6 . Based on previous reports [47,61,62], the peak at approximately 73.2 eV in the XPS spectra of Al 2p is attributed to an Al metal phase, and the peak located at 75.4 eV is assigned to completely oxidized aluminium species (Al2O3). Therefore, the perfectly symmetric peaks at approximately 74.9 eV in Fig. 6(A) for Ni/ATP-Cx (x ≤ 700) is attributed to the Alδ+ species located at octahedral sites of the ATP skeleton. For Ni/ATP-C800 and Ni/ATP-C900, the symmetric peaks were divided into a major peak at approximately 73.7 eV and a shoulder peak at approximately 75.4 eV, indicating the change in the coordination environment of Al and appearance of some Al2O3 phases. In addition, the XPS spectra of Mg 1s (Fig. 6(C)) also had a symmetric peak at approximately 1304.3 eV that was ascribed to the Mg constituent located at the octahedral sites of the ATP skeleton, and this peak was divided into two mature peaks at 1306.6 eV and 1303.5 eV when the CT was greater than 700 °C. For the XPS spectra of Si 2p (Fig. 6(B)), the peak located at 103.2 eV assigned to Si4+ species located at the tetrahedral sites of the ATP framework was shifted to a lower BE (101.6 eV for Ni/ATP-C900) with increasing CT. The variations of XPS spectra of the catalyst components confirm that CT significantly affected the interaction between nickel species and ATP framework. 3.1.6 FTIR analysis The skeleton structures of selected catalysts with different states (calcined, reduced and spent) were also analysed by FTIR technology, and the FTIR spectra were presented in Fig. 7 . All samples exhibited a broad vibrational band in the region between 3650 and 3250 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 7(A), which was attributed to the characteristic bands of OH groups coordinated to the aluminium or magnesium atoms located at the edge of the octahedral sheet according to the literature [63,64]. Fig. 7(B) presents the FTIR spectra in the region between 1500 and 400 cm−1. For calcined catalysts, the six characteristic bands present at 1196, 1123, 1097, 1030, 1000, and 987 cm−1 in the range of 1200–950 cm−1 were assigned to the breathing vibrations of Si–O–Al/Mg, Si–O–Si and SiO4 tetrahedron [63–65]. The bands at 950 cm−1 and 452 cm−1 ascribed to the vibration of Si–OH and Si–O, respectively [66]. The breathing vibrations of Si–O–Si (SiO2) appeared at approximately 510 cm-1 and the broad band centred at 680 cm−1 was assigned to the overlapping vibrations of Si–O–Al and Si–O–Mg [64]. The band at 910 cm−1 was related to the vibration of Al–OH–Al [64,67]. Additionally, the two weak bands at 580 and 433 cm−1 were assigned to the AlO6 and MgO6 octahedron stretching vibrations, respectively [64]. Due to the complexity of the interaction between nickel species and ATP, no definite band was assigned to nickel oxide or Ni–Mg/Al/Si–O species in calcined Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600. Obviously, the FTIR spectrogram of calcined Ni/ATP-C900 was significantly different from other two catalysts. Two new bands appeared at 882 cm−1 and 843 cm−1 (as listed in Fig. 7(B)) and were assigned to stretching vibrations of the Al–O bond in Al2O3 [67], which corresponds to the appearance of the Al2O3 phase confirmed by XRD and HRTEM. In addition, the broad and week band at 680 cm−1 was resolved into two bands at 685 cm−1 and 664 cm−1, which should be attributed to the separation of Al atom (685 cm−1) at the edge of Si–O–Al and the Mg atom (664 cm−1) via the Si–O–Mg symmetric stretching vibration. This finding further confirmed that CT changed the catalyst structure and coordination environment of the Si/Al/Mg atom constituting ATP framework. After the reduction process, the FTIR spectra of reduced Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 catalysts shown in Fig. 7(B) exhibited a slight change, e.g., the band at the range of 1200–950 cm−1 was more homogeneous and symmetrical, and the appearance of the week band at 783 cm−1 may be ascribed to the vibration of Ni–O or Ni-Ni [34]. However, the FTIR peak of reduced Ni/ATP-C900 almost had no difference with that of calcination. 3.1.7 Raman analysis Raman spectroscopy is an advanced surface analysis technique for heterogeneous catalysts. The laser Raman spectra for selected calcined and reduced catalysts were shown in Fig. 8 . Based on the report by Mckeown DA et al. [65], the peaks at 130, 174, 405 and 512 cm−1 in calcined Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 catalysts belong to the Ag fundamental mode of ATP framework and are assigned to the silicate tetrahedral ring deformation, O–Mg–O bend, O–Si–O bend and MgO6 octahedral deformation, respectively. The broad peak at approximately 790 cm−1 is ascribed to Al–O, AlO4 tetrahedra and Al–O–Al linkages [68,69]. Mukhopadhyay S et al. [68] and Lazić B et al. [70] also used Raman spectroscopy to confirm that the peaks located between 250 and 550 cm−1 are related to the rotational modes of AlO6 polyhedra and translational modes of Al3+. Therefore, the peak at 278 cm−1 could be attributed to the AlO6 octahedron of ATP. In the literature [71,72], NiAl2O4 Raman bands are reported at 200, 375 and 600 cm−1, and the crystalline NiO Raman bands are mainly reported at 460 and 500 cm−1. For calcined catalysts, Raman peaks assigned to the crystalline NiO or NiAl2O4 were not found. Interestingly, the peak at 470 cm−1 appeared in calcined Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600. After high temperature calcination and reduction processes, a broad and symmetrical peak centred approximately 570 cm−1 was noted in calcined Ni/ATP-C900 and all reduced catalysts at the expense of the disappearance of Raman peaks at 470 and 512 cm−1. Under the above explanatory circumstance, it could be hypothesized that the peak at 470 cm−1 is ascribed to the nickel oxide species with a weak interaction with the ATP framework. Based on high-temperature calcination and reduction technologies, nickel interacts with ATP to form some new species, such as Ni(Mg, Al)–O and (NixMg1-x)(OH)4Si2O5, as confirmed by the abovementioned characterizations. Consequently, the peak at 570 cm−1 may be related to the appearance of new species. The Raman peaks of calcined Ni/ATP-C900 in the range of 100–600 cm−1 were significantly different from other calcined catalysts, further suggesting that the structure of the Ni/ATP catalyst was subjected to transformation and destruction. Furthermore, some Raman peaks at 150, 242 and 320 cm−1 emerged in reduced Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600, which may correspond to metal-metal bonding in the nickel metal phase derived from nickel oxides. Lai S.H. et al. [73] attributed the Raman peak at 242 cm−1 to the symmetric-stretching mode of Ni3. Due to the strong interaction of nickel species and ATP in Ni/ATP-C900 (as proven by H2-TPR), very few NiO species were reduced to Ni metal at 700 °C. Thus, Raman peaks of Ni metal at 150, 242 and 320 cm−1 were not observed in reduced Ni/ATP-C900."
7,Catalytic activity and stability for SRE,"3.2 Catalytic activity and stability for SRE 3.2.1 Effect of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of SRE The influence of calcination temperature on catalyst activity of Ni/ATP was determined under the following fixed conditions: molar ration of steam/carbon (S/C) = 1.5, WHSV = 12.6 h−1, reaction temperature = 600 °C and time on stream (TOS) = 4 h. The results were presented in Fig. 9 . The increasing calcination temperature of catalysts led to obvious changes for ethanol conversion (XE), H2 yield (YH2) and C1 product selectivity. For the Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst, higher feedstock conversion (ca. 92%, which lower than that of 94% for Ni/ATP-C200) and highest H2 yield (ca. 73%) were achieved. However, Ni/ATP-C900 catalyst presented the lowest ethanol conversion (ca. 80%) and yielded the minimum amount of hydrogen (ca. 40%). In addition, the CH4 selectivity generally presented a trend of an initial reduction followed by a subsequent increase, and the increasing trend was obvious when the CT was greater than 700 °C. The selectivity to CO exhibited a complete crosscurrent compared with CO2. As reported in the literature [3,4,13,14], many side reactions occurred during the SRE reaction and were determined by the technological parameters and catalyst structures, resulting in various dispersions for products. The reaction steps of the SRE reaction mechanism generally include dehydrogenation (Eq. (1)), decomposition (Eq. (2), Eq. (3)), methane steam reformation (MSR, Eq. (4)), water-gas shift (WGS, Eq. (5)) and coke formation reactions (Eqs. (6)–(8)). Therefore, it could be concluded that the CO2 product was mainly produced from WGS reaction, and the molar ratio of CO2/CO could be used as an indicator for WGS, which is an important reaction that yields a considerable amount hydrogen [26]. As shown in Fig. 9, the CO2/CO molar ratio presented an apparent change with CT and reached the maximum value compared with Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst. (2) CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + H2 (3) CH3CH2OH → CH4 + CO + H2 (4) CH3CHO → CO + CH4 (5) CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2 (6) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 (7) CH3CH2OH → CH2 CH2 → Coke (8) Methane cracking: CH4 → C + H2 (9) Boudouard reaction: 2CO → CO2 + C Based on the abovementioned characterizations, high-temperature calcination (at 900 °C) resulted in a sudden reduction the surface area and surface Nio content (as shown in Table 1). Ni/ATP-C600 is equipped with an increased surface area (238.3 m2/g) and the highest surface Nio content (0.327 of Nio/(Nio + Ni2+)), consequently exhibiting the highest ethanol conversion and H2 yield, the lowest CH4 selectivity, and the highest CO2/CO molar ratio. The Ni/ATP-C900 catalyst had the lowest surface area (10.2 m2/g) and surface Nio content (0.019 of Nio/(Nio + Ni2+)), so it exhibited poor catalytic performance as shown in Fig. 9. During the gas-solid heterogeneous catalytic reaction, the surface area and surface active metal (Nio) content were very important for the conversion and selectivity. The former determined active component dispersity and the adsorption of reactants, while the latter determined the transformation efficiency of intermediate species. Therefore, these results revealed that active metal Ni exhibited the unique ability to break the C–C bond and improve MSR and WGS reactions. The exposure of superficial nickel metal in supported nickel-based catalysts played a key role in the SRE process. 3.2.2 Effect of the calcined temperature on the catalytic stability of SRE Preliminary studies of short-term activity tests of Ni/ATP-Cx demonstrated that CT could change the ethanol conversion and product distributions by affecting the catalyst structure and active component dispersion. In the interest of further understanding the influence of CT on SRE, Ni/ATP-C300, Ni/ATP-C600 and Ni/ATP-C900 were screened out using 60-h durability tests at 600 °C, and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . For the Ni/ATP-C300 catalyst, the ethanol conversion and H2 yield significantly decreased together with increasing selectivity to CH4 and CO, suggesting a loss of the ability of Ni/ATP-C300 to facilitate C–C bond cleavage and catalyse MSR and WGS reactions. This conclusion was also confirmed by the decreases in CO2 selectivity and the molar ratio of CO2/CO. Slight deactivation was also observed compared with Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst. Ethanol conversion was reduced gradually from approximately 96%–79%, and the H2 yield was reduced to approximately 49% from the initial 78%. Distinctly, the diversifications of the selectivity towards C-containing products and molar ratio of CO2/CO for Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst were moderate compared with Ni/ATP-C300. This finding might be attributed to the increased interaction between the active nickel species and ATP framework as demonstrated by H2-TPR, which could maintain smaller nickel particles and achieve more “accessible” Ni active sites, as reported by Ma HY et al. [26]. These active sites could retain the abilities to fracture the C–C bond and catalyse MSR and WGS reactions. Interestingly, Ni/ATP-C900 catalyst exhibited enhanced long-term stability, but its activity was reduced compared with Ni/ATP-C900. The conversion of ethanol and H2 yield together with the selectivity of C-containing products generally remained constant throughout the 60-h study. The abovementioned characterizations, including XRD, XPS, FTIR and Raman, confirmed that new species appeared in Ni/ATP-C900 due to the interaction between nickel and ATP as prompted by CT. The appearance of new species made the catalyst exhibit a strong metal-support interaction as demonstrated by H2-TPR, which might maintain the stability of Nio species and restrain the sintering of nickel particles resulting from dynamic coalescence and/or gas phase-mediated Ostwald ripening [74,75]."
8,Effect of calcined temperature on the nature of coke deposits,"3.3 Effect of calcined temperature on the nature of coke deposits The effects of CT on the nature of carbon deposits on three selected spent catalysts (after 60 h of stability test) were also investigated by FTIR, TG-MS and Raman. The FTIR spectra of three spent catalysts were displayed in the bottom of Fig. 7. It was difficult to find strong C–H (almost at 2916 and 2848 cm−1) vibrations, which are characteristic of organic compounds [76,77]. According to the report by Waheed A et al. [76], C–C and C–O bond vibrations mainly occurred at 1080 and 1043 cm−1, respectively. Consequently, the FTIR spectra of spent catalysts at 1200-1000 cm−1 were weakened and shrank obviously compared with reduced catalysts, and this finding might be attributed to carbon deposits with high C/H ratios (that is with a higher degree of graphitization). Other stretching vibrations assigned to the characteristic structures of catalysts were also present in three spent catalysts, implying that the Ni/ATP catalyst had suitable hydrothermal stability for steam-reforming technology. To better confirm the nature of carbon deposits on the spent catalyst surface, Raman spectroscopic investigation was conducted, and the obtained spectra were presented in Fig. 11 . For all spent catalysts, two symmetrical vibrations were distinguished in the ranges of 1500–1100 cm−1 and 1700-1500 cm−1, separately. The former was designated as a D-band and is often attributed to the Eigen vibrations of CH3 groups, olefin/aromatic species and graphite-like deposits in the literature [78]. Additionally, D-bands are often related to breathing vibrations of sp2 atoms in carbon rings [77]. The latter, which is referred to as a G-band, could be attributed to the overlay of some breathing modes, e.g., CC stretching vibrations of sp2 CC bonds (near 1600 cm−1) in the conjugated olefin and aromatic species and E2g carbon-carbon in-plane vibrations (close to 1570 cm−1) of graphite-like deposits [77,78]. The findings indicated that the carbon deposits on the surface of spent catalysts exhibited similar features. Taking into account wide discussions in the literature [35,76–79], the carbon deposits formed during SRE were mainly derived from the following two routes. One route involves the oligomerization and transformation of ethylene derived from ethanol dehydration on the acidic sites of support to produce coke (Eq. (6)) derived from the conjugated olefin and aromatic species. The other route involves C-containing products, such as CH4 and CO, that undergo cracking (Eq. (7)) and Boudouard (Eq. (8)) reactions on the metal sites to generate graphitic carbon species in the form of nanotubes or C layers over the catalyst surface. In this study, all routes of coke formation might occur over Ni/ATP catalysts, while the intensities and widths of D- and G-bands differed with CT. This finding might be attributed to different amounts or crystallization degrees of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. As reported by Kumar R. et al. [80], the intensity ratio between such bands in Raman spectra was commonly used to determine imperfection in highly crystalline graphite material. Therefore, ID/IG ratios were also presented in Fig. 11, and the following order was observed: Ni/ATP-C900 > Ni/ATP-C600 > Ni/ATP-C300. This finding indicates that the crystallization degree of coke was the highest on Ni/ATP-C900 catalyst while but the lowest on Ni/ATP-C300. The highly crystalline graphite carbon over the Ni/ATP surface might be ascribed to the stronger interaction between metal and support. The strong metal-support interaction favoured the formation of perimetral active sites for CO division [81], which may promote the Boudouard reaction. Obviously, the stability of catalyst might be related to crystallization degree of carbon deposits. This notion could be attributed to the fact that the lower crystallization degree of carbon deposits was good for the formation of C layers during long-term SRE, resulting in overlap of the active metal sites of catalysts [79]. TG-MS technology was also conducted to study the nature and amount of carbon deposits over the spent catalysts surface. The corresponding profiles are shown in Fig. 12 . As presented in TG profiles (Fig. 12 (A-C)), the weight loss (at temperature range 450–600 °C) assigned to the vaporized/pyrolyzed carbon deposits exhibited the following order: Ni/ATP-C300 (20.4%) > Ni/ATP-C900 (11.6%) > Ni/ATP-C600 (10.3%). The gaseous products formed over corresponding catalysts mainly included H2O, CO and CO2, as indicated by MS signals in Fig. 12 (D-F). MS signals ascribed to H2O and CO over spent Ni/ATP-C300 and Ni/ATP-C600 were higher than that over spent Ni/ATP-C900, while the CO2 MS signal was broader and stronger than that over the other two spent catalysts. These phenomena demonstrated that the carbon deposits formed on Ni/ATP-C300 comprised more aromatic species [82], while that on Ni/ATP-C900 exhibited a higher degree of graphitization, which was consistent with the Raman results. Combined with stability tests, one could hypothesize that the carbon deposits with aromatic species were strongly attracted to the catalyst surface, leading to the loss of active sites. Thus, Ni/ATP-C300 exhibited fast inactivation, and Ni/ATP-C900 demonstrated increased stability during long-term SRE."
9,Conclusion,"A series of nanocomposite Ni/ATP-Cx catalysts (x denotes the calcination temperature) were obtained by calcining at different temperatures and evaluated for hydrogen production via the SRE reaction. Calcination temperature (CT) exhibited a prominent effect on ethanol conversion and hydrogen production, whereas the Ni/ATP-C600 catalyst presented the best catalytic capacity with approximately 92% ethanol conversion and 73% hydrogen yield under S/C = 1.5, T = 600 °C, 1 atm, TOS = 4 h, and WHSV = 12.6 h−1. The characterization results suggested that CT significantly affected the particle size, reduction degree, MSI and surface Nio content. CT was pivotal in deciding the activity and stability of Ni/ATP catalyst during SRE reaction. A high CT could destroy the textural structure and alter the crystalline structure. During the stability test, Ni/ATP-C900 with the lowest surface area and surface Nio content presented unique durability due to stronger MSI. Additionally, the nature of carbon deposits on spent catalysts was determined by CT. The carbon deposition on Ni/ATP-C300 involves various aromatic species, which easily lead to catalyst deactivation. In contrast, carbon deposition on spent Ni/ATP-C900 exhibited higher crystallization or graphitization, which was not affected by catalytic reaction stability."
