0,Introduction,"The energy consumption continues to rise with constantly increasing world economy and population. However, the ongoing energy crisis and environmental pollution have been given more attention. The development of renewable resource alternatives to fossil fuels is imminent. The bio-hydrogen, an alternative and eco-friendly fuel, has attracted an intensive interest because of its high energy content of 122 kJ/g, renewable, and non-polluting by-products generation during combustion (CO2-neutral) [1–3]. In recent years, bio-hydrogen production, focusing upon biophotolysis of water, photo and dark fermentation of organic matter, has gradually replaced hydrogen generated from fossil fuels by thermochemical processes, for it need less energy [4]. Especially, anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production is more practical than photo fermentation which requires expensive and large surface area photo bioreactors for photosynthetic bacteria to utilize solar energy [5]. Several issues have been investigated the feasibility for hydrogen production from food-competitive simple sugars such as glucose [6], sucrose [7], xylose [8] or starches [9] using anaerobic microorganism. However, it is not considered economical to commercially produce hydrogen due to high cost of these raw materials and the food crisis. Many studies have been conducted using agricultural wastes (such as corn stalk, grass silage, wheat straw) [10–12] and wastewaters (such as food processing wastewater, chemical wastewater and domestic wastewater) [13–17] as substrates for hydrogen production. Nevertheless, a pretreatment of decomposing cellulose compounds into soluble sugar is required before agricultural residues converted biologically to hydrogen, leading to a high cost and energy consumption. High-carbohydrate wastewaters show a great potential for sustainable production of hydrogen owing to the advantages of high hydrogen production rate, less energy requirement, reduction in waste management costs and carbon dioxide emissions [18]. Besides, it provides dual environmental benefits in the direction of wastewater treatment along with sustainable bioenergy generation. A techno-economic evaluation of biohydrogen production from wastewater has proven its economic feasibility, and the results showed that the optimal size of the commercial hydrogen fermenter of wastewater was 52.51 m3 according to the local price [19]. Corn starch wastewater (CSW) has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) consisting of simple sugar, starch, protein and traces of vitamin and inorganic salts. Therefore, it is proposed as an optimum feedstock for offering necessary nutrients for microbial growth and metabolism. According to statistics, more than 20 million tons of corn starch wastewater (CSW) is produced by over 600 companies in China [20,21]. Using CSW as substrate for bio-hydrogen production is an effective and attractive way of wastewater treatment and sustainable bio-energy generation [22–26]. Several kinds of CSW are produced in different stages of corn starch processing, including corn steep liquor (CSL), corn gluten water (CGW) and glucose wastewater (GW). CSL is produced in the process of corn steeping and wet-milling, which contains about 2% proteins and traces of Fe2+, Zn2+, Mg2+ and biotin. CGW, rich in proteins, is obtained from the separation process of corn starch milk by centrifugation. Then, refined starch milk is partly processed into glucose and GW is generated during this process. Different from the two kinds of nitrogen-rich wastewater above, GW has a very high viscosity and high content of glucose, but is deficient in nitrogen source. Numerous studies have been reported to produce hydrogen from various kinds of wastewater as the carbon source. However, only a few papers address fermentative production using wastewater as nitrogen source. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, rare reports are available for hydrogen production using the mixture of three kinds of wastewater. Thus, the present study investigates the feasibility of hydrogen production using a mixture of CSL and CGW as the main nitrogen source, supplemented with GW as the main carbon source. The bioconversion of wastewater to hydrogen by dark fermentation is a series of complex reactions [27]. Mixed culture could produce more various hydrolases which could utilize complex substrates present in wastewater than pure culture [28]. Therefore, two particular strains, Bacillus sp. A1 and Brevumdimonas sp. B1, were employed for hydrogen production in mixed culture system. Optimal C/N and substrate concentration to maximize H2 production from wastewater was identified. Moreover, the effect on H2 production using CSL/CGW as nitrogen source was evaluated."
1,Material and methods,
2,Microorganism,"2.1 Microorganism The strains A1 and B1 were screened and isolated from sludge, obtained from an anaerobic digestion reactor. The 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis and biophysical and biochemical tests were carried out by China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC). The results showed A1 and B1 were Bacillus cereus and Brevundimonas naejangsanensis, respectively [29,30]. Both strains A1 and B1 were facultative anaerobic, acidogenic H2 producers. Strain A1 was capable of hydrolyzing starch by secreting amylase and producing hydrogen; while strain B1 was only able to ferment glucose into hydrogen with high efficiency. The mixed culture of A1 and B1 makes them be able to utilize complex substrate in wastewater directly and produce H2 efficiently."
3,Experiment set up,"2.2 Experiment set up Batch experiments were conducted in 1.25 L bottles with 1 L reaction volume. Each reactor was filed with 0.8 L fermentation medium, and then inoculated with 100 mL A1 and 100 mL B1 seed solution. The air in the head space of each bottle was flushed with nitrogen gas to provide anaerobic condition. The reactor temperature was maintained at 35 °C, using a thermostatic bath (HH–S6, MAI KENUO, China)."
4,Seed medium and corn starch wastewater,"2.3 Seed medium and corn starch wastewater The seed medium contains beef extract (3 g/L), peptone (10 g/L), and NaCl (5 g/L). The cultivated bacteria were used for inoculation after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C. The Corn starch wastewater (CSW) was obtained from Shan Dong Rui Xing Biological and Chemical Company, China. CSW contains three kinds of wastewater: corn steep liquor (CSL), corn gluten water (CGW) and glucose wastewater (GW).The characteristics of each wastewater were examined and shown in Table 1 . CSL and CGW were acid and nitrogen-rich wastewaters, 6.3 and 6.0 of C/N ratio respectively, only slightly different leading to the use of a mixed CSL/CGW ratio of 1/1, applied in this work. However, GW has a high content of glucose (800.8 g/L) with little nitrogen source. CSL and CGW were diluted with deionized water to reach the set of C/N ratio and initial substrate loading rate with supplemented GW. The fermentative medium was sterilized for 25 min at 116 °C to remove the mixed population of microorganism in the wastewater, which could either compete with biohydrogen producers or inhibit their growth. The initial pH was adjusted to 6.5 prior to inoculation."
5,Analysis methods,"2.4 Analysis methods 2.4.1 Analysis of gas and broth Total biogas was sampled from the head space of the reactors, and the volume of total biogas produced was determined by water displacement method. The data were averages of triplicate experiments. Due to the very limited experimental error, error bars were not included in the figures to simplify the graphical presentation of the results. The proportion of hydrogen in the biogas was determined by gas chromatograph (GC-2014C,SHIMADZU, Japan), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a TDX-01 packed (3 mm inside diameter) stainless steel column (2 m × 3 mm). Argon was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Temperatures of the column oven, injection, and detector were 160, 160, and 180 °C, respectively. The cumulative hydrogen gas production was determined by using the following equation. (1) V H2 , i = V H2 , i − 1 + V w C H2 , i + V R , i C H2 , i − V R , i − 1 C H 2 , i − 1 where VH2,i and VH2,i−1 are the volumes of cumulative hydrogen gas production (mL) calculated after the ith and the previous measurement; Vw is the total gas volume measured by the water displacement method (mL); CH2,i is the concentration of H2 in the total gas measured by the water displacement method (%); VR,i and VR,i−1 are the volumes of the gas in the head space of the reactor for the ith and previous measurement (mL); CH2,i and CH2,i−1 are the concentration of H2 in the head space of the reactor for the ith and the previous measurement (%). The total sugar and soluble sugar concentrations were determined by 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid (DNS) Method, detailed in previous literature [31]. COD and NH 4 + were measured using standard methods [32]. TOC and TN were measured using an Organic Element Analyzer (TOC-V, SHIMADZU, Japan). Metal ion concentrations were detected by an Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (SpectrAA55-B, Varian, USA). Volatile fatty acids and alcohols were determined by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU, Japan), equipped with a FID using a second-order temperature-programmed method. The pH of the fermentation medium was monitored by using a pH meter with appropriate probe (MP511, SANXIN, China). 2.4.2 Date analysis Based on the results obtained in the batch texts, the hydrogen production potential, maximum hydrogen production rates and lag-phase time were determined using modified Gompertz Eq. (2). (2) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H(t) represents the cumulative volume of hydrogen production (mL/L), P is the hydrogen production potential (mL/L), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/L/h), λ is the lag-phase time (h), t is incubation time (h), and e = 2.718."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of C/N on hydrogen production from CSW,"3.1 Effects of C/N on hydrogen production from CSW The balance of nutrients was essential for the growth and metabolism of all microbes. Among these nutrients, carbon and nitrogen were critical macro-nutrients required by bacteria. Nitrogen is used to synthesize proteins, enzymes, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), while carbon acts as a source of energy. Many studies have reported that anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production depended on proper carbon to nitrogen ratio [33–35]. C/N ratios above or below the ideal could inhibit even halt the fermentation. In this research, effects of various C/N ratios (6.0, 8.0, 9.1, 10.3, and 15.2) on hydrogen production were studied under the initial substrate of 10 g/L. Fig. 1 a depicted the trends of hydrogen production with time under different C/N ratios. The highest cumulative H2 production of 1392 mL/L was achieved at a C/N ratio of 9.1 with a maximum yield of 1.83 mol H2/mol glucose consumed. However, H2 production was very low at C/N of 15.2 and 10.3 and the pH values below 3.5 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that surplus carbon source could cause the rapid acidification and influence the metabolism and growth of microorganism. The fermentative system at C/N = 6.0 was also inefficient. The hydrogen production result indicated that CSL and CGW could not be digested to hydrogen without glucose supplement owing to high nitrogen content. The considerable decrease of hydrogen production observed with lower and higher C/N ratio demonstrated that the C/N ratio was important in the biological hydrogen producing process. Low C/N ratio could lead to the accumulation of ammonia which was toxic to bacteria and probably inhibited or even halted the fermentation. Thus, the C/N ratio should be strictly controlled for effective hydrogen production. However, the optimum C/N ratio was significantly different in literature. Lin and Lay obtained the highest hydrogen yield at a C/N ratio of 47 from sucrose [34]. Kim et al. determined that a C/N ratio exceeding 20 decreased the performance of hydrogen production [33]. Kalil et al. reported C/N ratio of 70 was the best for hydrogen production by C.acetobutylicum NCIMB13357 [35]. Nevertheless, this study revealed that C/N ratio above or below 9.1 adversely affected the activity of hydrogen producing bacteria. The optimum initial C/N ratio of 9.1 was lower than that of reported studies. This difference might be caused by the high substrate utilization efficiency by the synergistic effects of two strains, which required a higher nitrogen concentration to maintain an optimum pH for hydrogen production."
8,Effects of substrate loadings on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effects of substrate loadings on hydrogen production Substrate loading played an important role during the hydrogen producing process. The previous studies have demonstrated that the strain A1 and B1 could joint act to convert substrate to hydrogen, avoiding substrate competition and growth inhibition without pre-treatment [31]. The effect of substrate loadings was studied from 10.0 to 20.0 g/L. As showed in Fig. 2 a, the maximum hydrogen production was 2166 mL/L at 15.0 g total sugar/L. With the increase in total sugar concentration from 10.0 g/L to 15.0 g/L, the cumulative hydrogen production increased. However, a substrate loading exceeding 15.0 g/L was found to severely decrease the hydrogen production. Although a high substrate loading will positively improve the biohydrogen production efficiency, substrate or product inhibitions occurred when the substrate loading exceeded a threshold [36]. Due to the complex compositions in different kinds of wastewater, the optimum substrate concentrations varied. Antonopoulou et al. showed optimum substrate concentration and maximum yield of 17.50 g/L and 0.74 mol H2/mol glucose from sweet sorghum extract, respectively [37]. Maximum hydrogen yield of 1.8 mol H2/mol glucose was observed from probiotic wastewater at the concentration of 5.0 g/L by Sivaramakrishna et al. [38]. The pH change trends of the three groups were similar: pH first decreased rapidly to reach the optimum pH for hydrogen production and then became stable at 4.5–5.2 (date not shown). However, very limited hydrogen was observed during the whole production fermentation at 20.0 g/L in Fig. 2a. This may be caused by the ammonia inhibition in wastewater. Nevertheless, there exists certain disagreement on the optimal ammonia nitrogen concentration ranged from 10 mg/L to 7000 mg/L [39–42] for hydrogen production, which may be resulted from the difference in the terms of inoculums, strains and other operational conditions. Fig. 2b showed that ammonia concentration exceeding 600 mg/L could seriously inhibit the activity of bacteria, and very limited hydrogen was produced. It is inferred that the optimal ammonia concentration may be about 300 mg/L–450 mg/L in this study. In the present study, maximum hydrogen yield of 1.88 mol H2/mol glucose consumed was obtained at the substrate loading of 10.0 g/L. Table 2 listed the experimental results for batch fermentation of different substrates by mixing culture of strain A1 and B1. Though the kinds of substrates were different, the optimum substrate concentration was the same (10 g/L). Apparently, hydrogen production using mix corn starch wastewaters exhibited an efficient H2 yield which was found to be 76.0% and 31.7% higher than that of using corn starch and cassava starch respectively. All this considered, it would be more economic and practical to generated hydrogen from corn starch wastewater than from corn starch or cassava starch. Hence, the mixture of CSL, CGW and GW was a very promising alternative feedstock for hydrogen production."
9,Effects of different nitrogen sources on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effects of different nitrogen sources on hydrogen production Nitrogen was one of the main factors influencing the bacteria productivity and total yield of hydrogen. Brosseau et al. observed that hydrogen production and cell growth occurred simultaneously [44]. If less suitable nitrogen sources were provided, microbes would be more inclined to cell growth instead of producing hydrogen. Thus, proper carbohydrates and nitrogen sources were both important to provide substrates and energy for cell growth and metabolism. Kalil et al. investigated how different nitrogen sources, including organic and inorganic sources, influenced the biomass and hydrogen production [35]. They found that using 13 g/L of yeast extract gave the highest hydrogen yield with higher productivity than other nitrogen sources. The inorganic nitrogen was inferior for hydrogen production. In this study, GW was used as carbon source to maintain the initial C/N = 9.1 and total sugar concentration of 10.0 g/L, and the effects of peptone, CSL/CGW and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as nitrogen source respectively on hydrogen production were investigated. Fig. 3 a depicted the cumulative hydrogen production curve fitted by the Gompertz equation with different nitrogen sources. The maximum hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate obtained using CSL/CGW as nitrogen source was 1824 mL/L and 165.89 mL/L/h respectively, which were 1.8 times and 20.8 times higher than that using sole peptone. However, no significant hydrogen production was observed with supplement of NH4Cl as nitrogen source. Furthermore, the pH value using CSL/CGW as nitrogen source was also higher than using peptone and NH4Cl as nitrogen source (Fig. 3b). Fang and Liu [45] demonstrated that low pH of NH4Cl increased the scheduled time of the fermentation stoppage because the final low pH inhibited cell growth, hydrogen production and glucose utilization. Thus, it was concluded that nitrogen-rich CSL/CGW containing protein could improve the cell growth of hydrogen producing bacteria and consequently increase hydrogen production. Protein could act as carbon and nitrogen source simultaneously for cell growth, its metabolites such as amino acids and ammonia, provided necessary nutrients and neutralizing pH resulting from VFA generated. The results in this study were similar to the studies of Kalil et al. [35] and Bai et al. [46]. Notably, glucose consumption of two groups (sole adding peptone and CSL/CGW) was 7.0 and 7.8 g/L (data not shown), respectively, but the corresponding hydrogen yield was 0.91 and 1.88 mol H2/mol glucose consumed, indicating that only a small amount of consumed glucose was utilized for hydrogen production when adding peptone as nitrogen source. It may because CSL/CGW contained more nutrients such as protein, inorganic salt, biotin, Fe2+ and Zn2+ compared with peptone and NH4Cl. Productions of protein digestion such as amino acids and ammonium could provide the necessary nutrients and maintain a suitable pH for hydrogen production, and trace elements were the important cofactors of hydrogenase and other enzymes, thus enhancing hydrogen production [45,47]. Hydrogen yields and Rm by mixed cultures were compared with the results found in this study in Table 3 . Various nitrogen sources such as peptone, urea and ammonia were applied in literature. The hydrogen yield obtained in the present study was comparable with other literature. Additionally, the maximum hydrogen production rate (165.89 mL/L/h) was higher as compared to other mixed culture studies [47–51]. Nitrogen source is an important factor for biohydrogen production which could affect the pH and bacterial growth, then substrate consumed ratio and biohydrogen production were affected in turn. In summary, CSL/CGW is an excellent nitrogen source for biohydrogen production."
10,Conclusions,"This study investigated the effects of CSL/CGW as nitrogen source supplied with GW on fermentative hydrogen production by mixture of two novel hydrogen-producing bacteria. The results showed that CSL/CGW containing protein, inorganic salt, biotin and Fe2+, Zn2+ was an excellent nitrogen source and nutrients with many advantages compared with peptone and NH4Cl. GW was also proven as an alternative carbon source. Maximum hydrogen efficiency (production rate of 165.89 mL/L/h and yield of 1.88 mol H2/mol glucose consumed) was achieved at the optimum initial C/N ratio of 9.1 and total sugar concentration of 10.0 g/L. This indicated that hydrogen production from mixed corn starch wastewaters was an economic and practical way for energy recovery and wastewater treatment."
