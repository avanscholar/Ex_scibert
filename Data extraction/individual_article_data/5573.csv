0,Introduction,"The Ni x M y (M = Al, Ga, Sn, In) intermetallic compounds have recently gained much attention owing to reports on their promising catalytic activity in a number of industrially viable reactions [1]. The most outstanding examples include the Ni3Al and Ni3Ga compounds, which have been found active in e.g. thermo-decomposition of methanol for production of hydrogen, critical in the development of sustainable, fuel clean economy [2,3,4]. Other remarkable examples include chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons e.g. liquid and gas phase selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, where the NiSi, Ni3Ga and Ni3Sn intermetallics show superior performance over benchmark catalysts attaining almost complete conversion (>99%) and uncompromised, relatively high selectivities (87%–89%) towards styrene [5,6,7,8,9]. The selectivity further increases up to 93%, while maintaining still high conversion rates (98%), with the Ni5Ga3 and Ni3Sn2 phases setting the bar high for the more conventionally used Pd based and Lindlar catalysts [5]. Also the Ni3In has been found partial towards the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes for the production of unsaturated alcohols important fine chemicals and commodities [10]. In principle the catalytic activity of the intermetallic compounds derives from the geometry and to a greater extent from the electronic structure realized through the “active-site isolation” concept [11,12]. Whereby the incorporation of the catalytically inactive transition element such as Al, In, Sn into the active Ni component can induce charge transfer and alter the electron band configuration, and may thus effectively modify the surface adsorption propensity and bond polarization facilitating e.g. the hydrogenation of the CO group rather than more kinetically and thermodynamically favored CC bond [10–12]. Despite initially encouraging results the widespread application of intermetallic based compounds in heterogeneous catalysis is crippled to some extent by the synthesis of fine, uniformly spread and homogenous nanocrystals. Typically the fabrication technologies dwell in the realm of laborious, often complex and costly wet chemical methods [13,14,15] requiring support and additional thermal treatment steps, which pose threat in terms of particle sintering and agglomeration and overall as such they are welcomed with limited enthusiasm. Interestingly, more recently appreciable methanol conversion rates (~98%) have been reported over bulk Ni3Al sheets produced by conventional metallurgy coupled with cold rolling and recrystallization annealing [4,16]. Conversion, selectivity, time and thermal stability of such bulk catalysts have been found susceptible to further improvement by alkali leaching, steam addition, surface pretreatment, pulverization and grain size control [17,18,19]. The catalytic properties of thin foils have been ascribed to the spontaneous activation, due to oxidation and hydroxylation, of the surface resulting in precipitation of fine Ni particles co-deposited with carbon fibers on the layered substrate of Ni–Al, Al oxides [13,20]. Similar oxide/spinel type structures have been found post mortem in Al–Cu–Fe ribbons produced by melt spinning technique, while the ribbons themselves catalyzed selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with conversion rates on the order of 57% already at 60 °C and at styerene/ethylobenzene ratio of 0.7 [21]. Also the Ni7 5Al25 ribbons obtained by the same melt spinning technique have been found suitable for catalysis in the same reaction with conversion rates of 35% already at ambient temperature [22]. These promising results have sparked further interest in the development of efficient intermetallic based catalyst produced via melt spinning technique, which is attractive from the practical point of view through its ease, scalability and restricted need for thermal annealing. In the present study we have therefore evaluated in detail the thermal behavior, phase composition, microstructure and catalytic activity for hydrogenation of phenylacetylene of Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30 and Ni70Sn30 melt-spun ribbons with aim to extend the catalytic application of intermetallic based compounds, simplify their production for catalysis and understand the macro- and microscopic origins of their unprecedented catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,"The master ingots of Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30, Ni70Sn30 (at.%) alloys were produced from pure (≤99.99%) elements by induction melting under argon atmosphere. Subsequently in order to produce ribbons around 15 g of each ingot was remelted in quartz ampoule and melt spun on a rotating copper drum (v = 20 m/s) under helium atmosphere with ejecting gas pressure of 180 mbar, see for details [22]. The as melt spun ribbons took form of fragmented, brittle flakes. Some of the ribbons were sealed in the quartz capsules under vacuum and annealed at 800 °C for 72 h followed by furnace cooling. Thermal effects accompanying heating and cooling of the ribbons were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with heating-cooling rates of 10 K/min using DSC 404 F1, Pegasus, Netzsch instrument. The phase composition and structure analysis was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were collected with a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer and an X'Celerator linear detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) and a rear graphite monochromator. The ribbons were placed on a reflectionless silicon (“zero background”) sample holder. The data obtained were analyzed using the profile fitting program FullProf [13] and utilizing a profile matching method (only unit cell, background and peak profile parameters were refined). The background intensity was approximated with a polynomial function and the peak shape was fitted with a pseudo-Voigt function. The microstructure and surface morphology of the obtained ribbons were further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) employing FEI E-SEM XL30 and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by means of FEI Tecnai G2 operating at 200 keV and equipped with high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy detector (HAADF-STEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) EDAX microanalysis. Thin foils for TEM inspection were prepared by Tenupol-5 double jet electropolisher operating at −30 °C and under 15 V. The electrolyte was made up of nitric acid and methanol (1:3 vol). The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was carried out employing a high resolution SEM (FEI Quanta 3D) equipped with a field emission gun and an EDAX Hikari camera. To avoid misindexing, which is likely to occur in multiphase materials, only phases with volume fraction higher than 5% were used for pattern detection. Hydrogenation tests were carried out in an agitated batch glass reactor with the following operating conditions: 0.1 g catalyst, isopropanol as a solvent, mixing rate - 1000 rpm, reaction time 4 h. The experiments were performed at room temperature under 5 bar H2 pressure. Prior to reaction the ribbon flakes were subjected to reducing/alkaline treatment by NaBH4 aqueous solution. A gas chromatograph (Clarus 500, PerkinElmer) with He as carrier gas (ﬂow rate 1 ml/min) was used for analysing the reaction mixture."
2,Results,"The heating and cooling behaviors of the as melt spun Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30 and Ni70Sn30 alloys evaluated by DSC are shown in Fig. 1 . The heating curve for the Ni70Ga30 displays two thermal events. The first broad exothermic peak with onset at 676 °C attains maximum at 761 °C and it is not reversible on the consecutive cooling cycle. The second peak recorded on heating is endothermic in nature with onset at 1088 °C indicating solidus line and maximum at 1203 °C corresponding to liquidus (T L ) and on the whole it may be attributed to melting. The peak appears fairly broad (~119 °C) most likely deriving from the multiphase composition, what will be confirmed later. On cooling a single and narrow exothermic peak is recorded with onset at 1165 °C and maximum at 1168 °C and it is attributed to the solidification process (T S ). The heating curve measured for the Ni70In30 alloy manifests two endothermic events retraced by the corresponding exothermic peaks on cooling. The first smaller endothermic peak with onset at 681 °C and maximum at 692 °C is followed by the larger peak with onset at 912 °C and maximum at 920 °C. The appearance of two consecutive peaks, as in the case of Ni70Ga30, may also suggest a multiphase microstructure but interestingly the peaks in this instance are much narrower relative to the Ni70Ga30 alloy. On cooling the first exothermic peak with onset at 904 °C and maximum at 909 °C is followed by the smaller peak with onset at 690 °C and maximum at 697 °C. The heating and cooling behavior of the Ni70Sn30 resemble that of its predecessor. Two endothermic peaks are distinguished on the heating cycle. The first, smaller one shows onset at 907 °C and maximum at 910 °C, whereas the subsequent peak is much larger and has an onset at 1170 °C and maximum at 1178 °C. On cooling both peaks are well retraced by the corresponding exothermic events. The first solidification peak with maximum at 1107 °C onsets at 1105 °C, while the second, smaller peak begins to take shape at 852 °C and reaches maximum at 857 °C. No additional peaks nor no abnormal temperature behavior were noticed. In consistence with DSC measurements the XRD analysis confirmed a multiphase composition of all the three alloys (Fig. 2 ). The phase identity remains unaltered but the relative volume fraction changes following heat treatment applied demonstrating the possibility of controlling the phase composition of the alloys, what is vital for catalytic applications. In the case of the Ni70Ga30 as melt-spun ribbons (Fig. 2 a) the peaks can be well indexed according to the tetragonal Ni3Ga phase (P4/mmm, no. 123). This phase was adjusted by modifying the basic cubic Ni3Ga phase ( P m 3 ‾ m , No. 221, a = 3.585 Å) due to slight tetragonal distortion. The Ni3Ga phase is found to coexist with the hexagonal Ni3Ga2 phase (P63/mmc; no. 194) with the fitted volume fraction of 5.9 ± 1.2%. Following homogenization both phases remain in the microstructure but the contribution from the Ni3Ga2 phase decreases to 0.55 ± 0.30% in favor of the Ni3Ga phase. Their lattice parameters after heat treatment show moderate changes (Table 1 ). In the case of the as melt-spun Ni70In30 ribbons the XRD patterns (Fig. 2b) were fitted with a mixture of the Ni2In and Ni3In phases. The Ni2In (hexagonal P63/mmc; no. 194) was fitted with relative volume fraction of 95.3 ± 7.1%. The amount of the Ni3In (hexagonal P63/mmc; no.194) phase was estimated at the level of 4.7 ± 2.1%. There are also visible weak additional diffuse lines that cannot be indexed in relation to any known compound in the phase diagram. After heat treatment the phase equilibrium shifted towards the Ni3In phase, whose contribution increased to 59.4 ± 6.6% at the expense of the Ni2In phase (Table 1). The XRD patterns for the as melt-spun Ni70Sn30 ribbon were indexed according to the Ni3Sn (hexagonal P63/mmc; no. 194) phase (Table 1) with the fitted amount of 69.2 ± 9.9%. The Ni3Sn coexists with the Ni3Sn2 (orthorhombic Pnma; no. 62), whose relative volume fraction is 26.3 ± 3.3%. A small amount (4.6 ± 2.4%) of orthorhombic Ni3Sn phase was also found. After heat treatment the relative contribution of the hexagonal Ni3Sn phase decreased to 58.8 ± 2.7%, while its lattice parameters remained largely unaltered (Table 1). On the contrary the amount of the Ni3Sn2 increased after annealing to 41.2 ± 2.2%. The orthorhombic Ni3Sn phase was not observed after annealing. Well in agreement with the XRD studies the TEM analysis confirmed the presence of the Ni3Ga phase within the Ni70Ga30 as melt-spun ribbons. The average chemical composition of the grains Ni - 73 at. % and Ga - 27 at.% (Fig. 3 a) corresponds to the nominal Ni70Ga30 one, while inside the grains elongated regions are enriched in Ga with average composition of Ni −66 at.% and Ga - 34 at.% corresponding to the Ni3Ga2 phase. The bright field (BF) image shown in Fig. 3 b discloses plate like, martensitic microstructure of the Ni3Ga suggesting that upon rapid cooling the Ni3Ga phase undergoes martensitic transformation. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern (SADP) displayed in the inset in Fig. 3 b can be indexed according to the Ni3Ga phase with the [011] zone axis. The high resolution (HREM) image (Fig. 3 c) brings a closer look on the fine twin plates of the Ni3Ga martensite. The plates are shown edge on with [101] K 1 plane along the [011] zone axis. The second hexagonal Ni3Ga2 phase sensed by XRD escaped the TEM analysis due to its limited amount. Fig. 3(d–f) present TEM images taken from the as melt-spun Ni70In30 ribbon. The microstructure of this ribbon appears cellular. Based on the EDX results (Fig. 3 d) it was found that the cellular matrix contains 68 at.% of Ni and 32 at.% of In, which is close to the stoichiometric Ni2In phase, while the intercellular areas are rich in Ni - 78 at.% and poorer in In - 22 at.%. The SADP taken from corresponding cellular area (Fig. 3e) is identified according to the Ni2In phase along the [11 2 ‾ 0] zone axis. Besides the main reflections, the presented SADP showed diffuse intensity distribution indicative of local short range ordering. The SADP obtained from the intercellular area rich in Ni could be indexed according to the Ni3In phase (Fig. 3 f). The TEM micrographs registered for the Ni70Sn30 as melt-spun ribbon already at first glance bear evidence for a multiphase microstructure indicated by non-uniform etching. The STEM image (Fig. 3 g) shows two types of areas that differ in contrast and morphology: light irregular regions, which contain about 65 at.% of Ni and 35 at.% of Sn, and grey phase located between them having the following chemical composition: 77 at.% Ni and 23 at.% Sn. In consistence with XRD results, these areas correspond to the Ni3Sn2 and Ni3Sn phases, respectively. The SADP corresponding to the orthorhombic Ni3Sn2 phase (with zone axis [001]) is inserted in Fig. 3 (g). It has been found that the area corresponding to the composition of the Ni3Sn phase is a mixture of two phases. The main phase is the Ni3Sn with a hexagonal structure shown in Fig. 3 (h) together with SADP with a zone axis [011]. Martensite with an orthorhombic Ni3Sn occurs between the grains of this phase (Fig. 3 i), which is verified by the SADP taken along [011] zone axis. To further evaluate chemical composition and distribution of the constituting phases, surface morphology and microstructure the SEM analysis was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . For comparison surface images of starting bulk alloys are shown together with the as melt-spun and annealed ribbons. It is found that the microstructure in all the as cast bulk intermetallics is predominantly divided in two phases differing in electron back scatter (BSE) contrast. From the elemental composition analysis performed by SEM/EDX phase assignment was conducted according to established stoichiometry (Fig. 4). In the case of the Ni70Ga30 bulk alloys the light grey phase is rich in Ga with average composition of Ni66.2Ga33.8, whereas the dark grey phase is composed of Ni72Ga28 (Fig. 4 a). The light grey phase is distributed in a dendrite like manner reflecting the dendritic type solidification. Whereas the as-melt spun ribbons equilibrate at an average composition of Ni70.8Ga29.2 and after annealing assume the stoichiometry of Ni71.6Ga28.4 (Fig. 4b and c). In the case of the bulk Ni70In30 alloys the light grey, matrix phase, is rich in In with average composition of Ni67.9In32.2, while the secondary, dark grey phase appearing in the form of fine rods and aggregating into larger colonies (inset in Fig. 4 d) is composed of Ni72.8In27.2. The average composition of the as spun ribbons is Ni68.9In31 (Fig. 4 e), which after annealing (Fig. 4 f) breaks into the dark grey phase composed of Ni73.8In26.2 and the light grey phase with average Ni66.5In33.4 composition. In the Ni70Sn30 bulk alloys (Fig. 4g) the light grey phase forms the primary solidification phase and it has the composition of Ni63.9Sn36.1, while the dark grey phase rich in Ni with average composition of Ni74.9Sn25.2 is the product of the secondary eutectic solidification. The average composition of the Ni70Sn30 as melt-spun ribbon is Ni68.8Sn31.3, while the dark contrast phase contains Ni75.4Sn24.6 and the make-up of the light grey phase is Ni63.8Sn36.2. Interestingly the light grey phase takes form of fine elongated and spherical islands. The surface morphology of the as melt spun Ni70Ga30 ribbon (Fig. 4b) is decorated with a large amount of platelets, consistent with TEM observation of martensite phase, while the Ni70In30 and Ni70Sn30 ribbons show some degree of macroscopic ordering (Fig. 4 e and h), discussed elsewhere [23]. After annealing the grain size for all ribbons (Fig. 4 c, f, i) visibly increases and its evolution is better traced with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements (Fig. 5 ). Since the grain size has been found to influence the temperature stability and activity of the Ni3Al foils in the thermo-decomposition of methanol [19] a detailed EBSD analysis was conducted to evaluate the grain size and texture of the as melt-spun and annealed ribbons. The inverse pole figure maps taken for the Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30 and Ni70Sn30 ribbons are shown in Fig. 5. Initially the average grain size after melt spinning is at a comparable level in all the ribbons and oscillates around 3–4 μm (Fig. 5 a-c). After annealing the average grain size increases reaching around 10 μm in the case of the Ni70Ga30, and 6 μm in the case of the Ni70Sn30 ribbons. Interestingly most spectacular grain growth is observed with the Ni70In30 ribbon sample, where the grain size increases circa 10 times relative to the as cast state (Fig. 5 b, e; Fig. 6 ). This effect may be traced down to the lowest homologous temperature, among the three studied compounds, which results in the most intensive grain growth and a very strong texture component developed in this sample. For illustration pole figures for all the three studied ribbons in the as melt-spun and annealed state are reproduced in Fig. 7 . A strong <100> fiber texture is a common feature of the Ni70Ga30 and Ni70In30 melt spun ribbons where on the cross-section one may frequently find a layer of small equiaxed grains at the wheel side of the ribbon, which form the floor for columnar grains typically with the <001> direction parallel to the wheel radius [24,25]. A weaker texture is observed for the Ni70Sn30, which may be attributed to a smaller grain size for this sample. Notably, high cooling rates determine a heterogeneous phase composition of the Ni70Ga30 ribbon, since a mixture of the cubic Ni3Ga and the tetragonal martensite can be observed in the as-spun state, Fig. 5a. However, heat treatment provides equilibrium conditions recovering the fully room temperature stable Ni3Ga cubic phase, Fig. 5 (d) [24,25]. Otherwise the EBSD maps show grain distribution with high concentration of high angle grain boundaries, typical for intermetallic ribbons (Fig. 5), indicative of a well crystallized structure. Some minor fraction of low angle grain boundaries may on occasion be spotted inside the grains. Also large number of twins is well visible inside the grains of the Ni70Ga30 ribbons in consistence with TEM studies. The twins result from martensitic transformation, whereas in in the case of the Ni70In30 ribbon few annealing twins may be also recognized. The catalytic activities of the ribbons were tested in the reaction of selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, the desired reaction product, which is converted to ethylobenzene on complete saturation of the unsaturated triple bond (Fig. 8 ). The ribbons were placed inside the reactor without any pulverization or pretreatment except for alkali leaching in aqueous solution of NaBH4, which has been previously found to stimulate catalyst activity [18,19]. The reaction was conducted at room temperature under 5 bar H2 pressure and it was allowed for 4 h. All the ribbons were found to catalyze the hydrogenation reaction with conversion rates and selectivities differing depending on the ribbon used (Fig. 9 ). The highest phenylacetylene conversion rates ~20% were achieved with the as melt-spun and annealed Ni70Ga30 and annealed Ni70Sn30 ribbons. Interestingly homogenization annealing heat treatment did not improve the conversion rate in the case of the Ni70Ga30, which regardless of the heat treatment attained the value close to 20%, however in the case of the Ni70Sn30 the annealing process improved the conversion by 9%. This may be associated with both alteration of phase composition as well as evolution of grain size. The lowest phenylacetylene conversion rates were attained with the Ni70In30 ribbons, which in the as melt-spun state yielded 15% and after annealing gave 13% conversion. The selectivities to styrene were fairly high on average in the close proximity to 80%, regardless of the ribbon composition (Fig. 9). Previously it has been demonstrated that the application of the pulverized as melt-spun Ni3Al ribbons resulted in conversion rates on the order of 20% [22] comparable to the best performing flakes made of Ni70Ga30 and Ni70Sn30 alloys. Further annealing of the powder elevated the conversion to 35% demonstrating the possibility of improving the conversion rates with additional pretreatments e.g. pulverization and oxidation/reduction surface pretreatment, the research on which is currently under way."
3,Discussion,
4,N70Ga30,"4.1 N70Ga30 In consistence with the phase diagram [26,27,28] the primary solidification phase in the studied Ni70Ga30 composition range is the α ' Ni3Ga phase with the solidus line at 1220 °C [27]. According to the DSC measurements (Fig. 1 a) on the as melt-spun Ni70Ga30 ribbons the first phase transition L → Ni3Ga (HT) takes place at 1169 °C, which is circa 50 °C lower compared to the equilibrium value and it is explained from the standpoint of non-equilibrium rapid quenching. The phase composition is well confirmed by XRD (Fig. 2 a) and TEM (Fig. 3 a-c) analyses, where the Ni3Ga (P4/mmm, no. 123), is found to coexist with some minor fraction (~6%) of the γ hexagonal Ni3Ga2 phase (P63/mmc; no. 194). The secondary phase Ni3Ga2 thermodynamically appears at Ga concentration above 35 at.% and it exists at high temperature, the existing amount of the Ni3Ga2 phase is conserved by rapid quenching. Following heat treatment the amount of this phase subsides tenfold (~0.6%) in consistence with the phase diagram [29,30]. The solidification microstructure in the bulk alloy (Figs. 4a & 5a) is typical for a two phase structure with the microstructural features in the range of 10 μm and above and with the primary Ni3Ga phase distributed in a dendrite like manner. Its composition as verified by EDX corresponds to Ni72Ga28, while the secondary phase with average composition of Ni66.2Ga33.8 is distributed in the interdendritic areas. The solidification microstructure undergoes profound refinement during melt spinning (Figs. 5 and 6). The average grain size is around 4 μm with the average composition of Ni70.8Ga29.2. The STEM-EDX analysis confirmed the composition in micro areas of the interdendritic phase as Ni66.2Ga33.8, whereas the dendrites are made up of Ni72.6Ga27.4 in agreement with SEM-EDX. Subsequent recoalescence upon annealing stabilizes the Ni3Ga phase and the composition of ribbons after annealing equilibrates around Ni71.6Ga28.4. Simultaneously the microstructure coarsens with grain size in the range of 10 μm. Interestingly the Ni3Ga phase appears to undergo martensitic transformation, which justifies its tetragonal structure, a phenomenon not observed in the binary Ni–Ga system subjected to conventional casting [29] but noticed in the Ni–Al system after quenching the β – phase (B2) from high temperature for compositions within the range of 35–38 at.%. In the present scenario the martensite phase develops from the Ni3Ga cubic L12 (HT) to tetragonal martensite fcc→fct. The tetragonality ratio in the as melt spun ribbons is around 0.997, and after annealing the martensitic phase dissipates and the ratio increases to 0.998. This is in part related to dissolution of the secondary Ni3Ga2, what likely alters the lattice constants. The catalytic properties of the as melt spun and annealed Ni70Ga30 ribbons are at the comparable level of around 20% phenylacetylene conversion indicating that the Ni3Ga phase is the primary agent and active phase for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and grain coarsening does not have much influence neither on selectivity nor on conversion rates."
5,Ni70In30,"4.2 Ni70In30 The first phase transition during cooling of the as melt-spun Ni70In30 ribbons (Fig. 1 b) corresponds to the solidification at 914.6 °C of the primary L→Ni2In (HT) phase, what is followed by the peritectoid transition Ni2In (HT) →Ni3In + ζ-Ni2In (LT) at 696.7 °C [31]. The DSC results are in tune with XRD and TEM evaluations, which have confirmed the presence of the Ni2In (hexagonal P63/mmc) as the main phase in the amount of ~95%, which coexists with the Ni3In (hexagonal P63/mmc). Diffuse intensity distribution accompanying the strong reflections on the SADP indicates a short range ordering that stabilized the high temperature Ni2In phase. This is well in agreement with the investigation presented by Noren et al. [32]. Annealing treatment restores the equilibrium and in consistence with the phase diagram it shifts the balance towards the Ni3In phase, whose contribution goes up to 59.4 ± 6.6%, while the amount of the Ni2In phase drops to 39.7 ± 4.7%. The solidification microstructure in the bulk alloy (Fig. 4d) is typical for a eutectic type solidification with the primary Ni2In phase with average composition of Ni67.9In32.2 and the Ni3In composed of Ni72.8In27.2. The average composition of the as spun ribbons (Fig. 4e) is Ni68.9In31. Following annealing (Fig. 4f) the microstructure is heterogeneous consisting of the Ni3In - Ni73.8In26.2 and the Ni2In - Ni66.5In33.4 phases, whose contributions, based on image analysis, is in line with XRD measurements. Melt-spinning induces profound microstructure refinement with grain size on average around 4 μm. The solidification behavior takes form of cellular growth (Fig. 5b) with the primary Ni2In phase distributed within the grains with composition of Ni71.6In28.4 and the Ni3In enriched in Ni - Ni83.8In16.2 distributed on the grain boundaries. This indicates solute trapping. After annealing the grain size in Ni–In ribbons increases the most spectacularly among the three studied ribbons. This phenomenon may be justified by the low melting point of the Ni70In30 ribbons, which when expressed as the ratio of the annealing temperature to the melting temperature ( T a n l . T L ) is equal to 0.86, while for the Ni70Ga30 and the Ni70Sn30 ribbons it comes to 0.67 and 0.68, respectively. The catalytic activity is moderate (~15%) and slightly decreases after annealing suggesting that the more active phase chemically selective for hydrogenation of pehnyloacetylene is the Ni2In phase."
6,Ni70Sn30,"4.3 Ni70Sn30 The solidification behavior of the bulk Ni70Sn30 alloys is also of eutectic type (Fig. 4g) preceded by crystallization of the primary Ni3Sn2 phase [33,34]. The solidification event for the as melt-spun Ni70Sn30 ribbon registered at 1110.3 °C (Fig. 1c) corresponds to the crystallization of the L→Ni3Sn (HT) + Ni3Sn2 (HT) phases followed by the eutectoid decomposition Ni3Sn (HT) → Ni3Sn (LT) + Ni3Sn2 (HT) taking place at 856.6 °C. The following phases were identified by XRD and TEM investigation: hexagonal Ni3Sn (LT) and orthorhombic Ni3Sn2 (LT) low temperature stable phases and metastable orthorhombic Ni3Sn (β-Cu3Ti type structure), see Figs. 2 and 3. The Ni3Sn2 (LT) phase is formed from the Ni3Sn2 (HT) during cooling of the ribbon at a temperature of about 500 °C. The cubic Ni3Sn (HT) phase with BiF3-type structure was not observed, as could be expected from phase diagram presented in [35]. Detailed research conducted by Schmitterer et al. [36] showed that this phase cannot be quenched and instead of it the Ni3Sn (LT) phase formed at low cooling rates or metastable orthorhombic Ni3Sn at cooling rates above 200 °C/s. Pak et al. [37] found, that a metastable Ni3Sn phase is a result of martensitic transformation of cubic Ni3Sn (HT) on quenching at a rate of 2000 °C/s. Despite the small contribution of this phase in the tested ribbon, its morphology and structure was observed in the TEM studies (Fig. 3 i). After annealing both low temperature Ni3Sn and Ni3Sn2 stable phases were identified (the amount of the Ni3Sn2 increased at the expense of Ni3Sn), while the metastable Ni3Sn disappeared. The grain refinement upon solidification produces grain size in the range of 3 μm, which increases two fold by application of heat treatment. Interestingly unlike in the case of two previously discussed ribbons the catalytic activity is boosted by heat treatment suggesting that Ni3Sn2 phase is more active for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. Overall it was demonstrated that melt spinning technique is a potent tool for production of active catalysts in the form of ribbons based on Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30, Ni70Sn30 intermetallics for phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The as melt-spun ribbons show a multiphase microstructure, which is tailorable through simple heat treatments. The catalytic activity can be further improved by surface treatment, which altogether attracts further interest and warrants continued investigation."
7,Conclusions,"The Ni70Ga30, Ni70In30, Ni70Sn30 ribbons were manufactured by melt spinning technique. The as melt spun ribbons showed a multiphase microstructure, which is prone to alteration by heat treatment at 800 °C. The average grain size in the as melt spun ribbons was circa 3–4 μm and it increases after heat treatment the most (10 × ) in the Ni70In30, which is ascribed to a low melting point in that ribbon. All the studied ribbons are found active for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with conversion rates around 20% at room temperature and after 4 h reaction time. Further improvement of catalytic activity is expected with surface pretreatment, pulverization and higher temperature. Altogether the as melt spun ribbons present an attractive alternative to cold rolled and annealed ribbons and to nanocrystalline intermetallics for application in a range of chemical reactions."
