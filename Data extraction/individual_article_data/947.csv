0,Introduction,"The need of renewable energy resources with unlimited supply, as well as little or no impact on the environment has driven the research activities in this field at the least in the past decade [1]. Actually, a great attention has been paid by researchers to the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier and to the definition of new processes for its production without the use of fossil fuels [2]. Among the various technologies, water photosplitting and photoreforming have been proposed as two possible methods to convert solar energy into chemical one [3,4]. These two processes are very similar and can be distinguished for the use of sacrificial organic species (alcohols and organic acids) during photoreforming. These species promptly react with positive holes and oxidizes, thus allowing photogenerated electrons to attack proton ions [5]. It is interesting to observe that the organic species could be also represented by organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) [6,7] whose removal from water streams (industrial or municipal) could be necessary. In this case, a combination between wastewater treatments and hydrogen production could be obtained [8]. At least in principle, photocatalytic reforming of organic species appears to be a process that can easily produce hydrogen [9,10]. Indeed, after the absorption of a proper radiation, photogenerated holes and electrons can react with the organic compound (sacrificial agent) and proton ions, respectively. Among the photocatalysts used for both hydrogen production and organics oxidation, nanocrystalline (mesoporous) TiO2 has been demonstrated to be a more effective ones [38,39]. However, if titanium dioxide, in pure anatase or rutile form, is adopted to this aim in presence of UV–visible solar radiation, the results are invariably poor in terms of both energy-conversion efficiency and hydrogen generation rate [5]. A twofold explanation is generally reported for these results: (i) a fast photogenerated holes–electrons recombination reaction; (ii) a limited capability of titanium dioxide to absorb radiation over an extended field, because of its wide band gap (3.2eV and 3.0eV for anatase and rutile, respectively). To overcome these drawbacks, the approaches followed by researchers seek to dope TiO2 particles with chemical species that may (i) limit the occurrence of the recombination reaction and/or (ii) widen the absorption edge of titanium dioxide to the visible spectrum. The addition of noble metals, such as Ag, Au, Pd and Pt, to the solid oxide is one of the most studied strategies causing the formation of a heterojuction between the metal and the solid photocatalyst. This heterojunction allows the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 conduction band to the Fermi level of the metal, thus preventing hole–electron recombination [11–13]. On the other hand, the inclusion in the catalyst of a specific dye is a largely studied approach to enhance the absorption of the visible radiation [14]. Recently, systems based on titanium dioxide on which a copper species was deposited or formed as a co-catalyst were proposed to be promising catalysts for photoreforming. In particular, metal Cu, CuO, Cu2O, Cu(OH)2, and CuS, alone or in presence of a second co-catalyst have been proposed and tested to prepare copper-TiO2 based photocatalysts [5]. The choice of copper is motivated by its cheapness and abundance in Earth's crust [15]. It is reported that the doping of TiO2 with copper species can effectively lower the band gap of TiO2 by generating either structural defects into its framework, or active trap centers for electrons, due to heterojunction phenomena, thus limiting charge recombination [16–18]. Different techniques, such as hydrothermal/solvothermal processes, impregnation, precipitation, electrodeposition, and sol–gel method, have been so far adopted to include copper species on TiO2 catalysts [5]. It is interesting to observe that only few examples of in situ photodeposition technique have so far been reported in the literature of TiO2 doping with copper [19–21]. Moreover, it is important to stress that each of these studies focused on a specific sacrificial agent. This study aimed at investigating the use of copper-TiO2-based photocatalysts prepared by in situ photodeposition techniques in photoreforming processes for hydrogen generation. In addition, many different oxygenated organic substrates were tested to evaluate and compare effects of substrate structure on hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All organic compounds used as sacrificial agents, TiO2 Aeroxide P25 (average partiche size: 21nm, specific surface area: 50±15m2 g−1) and cupric sulfate pentahydrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Doubly glass–distilled water was used throughout this study."
3,Hydrogen production device,"2.2 Hydrogen production device Photocatalytic runs were carried out in an annular glass batch reactor (300mL) thermostated at 25°C and covered with a layer of aluminum foil. On the top of the reactor, an inlet was allowed to feed reactants and nitrogen gas, and an outlet was used to collect liquid and gaseous samples at varying reaction times. The reactor was endowed with a high-pressure mercury vapor lamp by Helios Italquartz (power input: 125W) and equipped with a magnetic stirrer."
4,Photocatalytic experiments procedure and catalyst recovery,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments procedure and catalyst recovery For each run a fixed amount of TiO2-P25 (50÷500mgL−1) was initially suspended in an unbuffered aqueous solution containing the sacrificial species chosen for the experiment. In order to avoid the undesired reaction between dissolved oxygen and photogenerated electrons, before starting the photocatalytic experiment, a nitrogen stream was bubbled into the solution for 30min. After this period, cupric sulfate pentahydrate was quickly added to the mixture ([Cu(II)]o =0.8mM). Additional experimental runs were also carried out without addition of copper(II) sulfate or adding Cu2O used as copper precursor and regulating the pH of the suspension at 2.8 with sulfuric acid. Moreover, throughout the photocatalytic runs, nitrogen was continuously fed at a flow rate of 0.3Lmin−1 in order to prevent the presence of air into the reactor. At different reaction times, gaseous samples were collected by means of Tedlar gas sampling bags and injected into the gas-chromatograph to record the rate of hydrogen generation before adding cupric ions into the system. After adding cupric ions, further gaseous samples were collected and analyzed at regular intervals to evaluate the additional hydrogen production with respect to the generation due to bare TiO2-P25. The liquid samples, collected at different reaction times were quickly filtered on regenerated cellulose filters (pore diameter 0.20μm, Scharlau) and the filtrates were used to measure total dissolved copper concentration. During the entire run, the irradiances emerging from the reactor in the ranges 312–400nm and 400–1100nm were recorded. At the end of the run, the suspension was allowed to settle overnight under inert atmosphere producing two distinct layers: aqueous solution on the top and Cu-modified TiO2 particles deposited on the bottom. After removal of most part of the aqueous solution by decanting it, the remaining part was then evaporated by means of a gentle inert flow."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen concentration was measured by a gas-chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a HP-PLOT Molesieve 5A column (Agilent) and a TCD detector using argon as carried gas. The concentration of cupric and cuprous ions in solution was measured by means of a colorimetric method using an analytical kit (Macherey-Nagel) based on oxalic acid bis-cyclohexylidene hydrazide (cuprizone). A UV/vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100 UV–vis Agilent) was employed for the measurements at a wavelength of 585nm. The pH of the solution was monitored by means of an Orion 420p pH-meter (Thermo). The irradiances emerging from the reactor were measured by means of a UV–vis radiometer (Delta Ohm HD 2102.1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of copper-modified TiO2-P25 catalyst were recorded by a PANalytical diffractometer with a nickel filter and Cu Kα radiation. Diffuse Reflectance UV–vis (DRUV) measurements were performed to establish the optical band gap by using a Jasco spectrophotometer and BaSO4 as a reference. The optical absorption was measured in the 190–850nm wavelengths range. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments were carried out by means of X-band (9GHz) Bruker Elexys E-500 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), equipped with a super-high sensitivity probe head. Solid samples were transferred to flame-sealed glass capillaries which, in turn, were coaxially inserted in a standard 4mm quartz sample tube. Measurements were performed at room temperature. The instrumental settings were as follows: sweep width, 1500 G; resolution, 1024 points; modulation frequency, 100kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G. 128 scans were accumulated to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Raman spectra were achieved using a Horiba XploRA Raman microscope system with a 100× objective (NA 1.4, Olympus). The laser source was a frequency doubled Nd:YAG-solid state laser (λ =532nm, 12mW maximum laser power at the sample). The calibration of the system was performed against the Stokes Raman signal of pure Si at 520cm−1 using a silicon wafer."
6,Results,"Fig. 1 a-d show data recorded during a typical photoreforming run for hydrogen generation using bare TiO2-P25 and Cu-modified TiO2-P25. The addition of cupric ions to the reacting system results into their rapid disappearance from the solution (data not shown) and a prompt increase (Fig. 1a, from point (1) to (2)) in hydrogen generation rate with respect to the value measured in presence of bare TiO2-P25. At larger time hydrogen production rate decreases until it approaches a plateau (Fig. 1a, point (3)). A contemporary decrease in both pH (Fig. 1b), which reduces from an initial value of 6.4–2.9, and irradiances (Fig. 1c and d) – measured on the external wall of the reactor – is observed after copper addition into the solution. In particular, it is important to stress that the irradiance values recorded in both the UV and the visible range decrease within 30min of reaction time, thus indicating a higher absorption capability of the resulting solid catalyst with respect to TiO2-P25 catalyst initially charged into the reactor. A marked change in color of the liquid samples withdrawn from the reactor is recorded from white typical of TiO2 particles to purple mainly (for further information see Table 1 and the Supplementary material, Fig. S1), thus indicating that some chemical transformations occur during this interval. To achieve additional information about the system behavior, the lamp was switched off after 120min of reaction and, after checking that hydrogen production was stopped, it was again switched on (point (4)). The analyses of the gaseous samples collected after this procedure indicate that hydrogen production rate immediately achieves a value equal to that of previously observed plateau (point (5)). No occurrence of any overshoot other than that recorded at the beginning of the photocatalytic run ((1)→(3)) is observed, thus outlining that probably its presence is strictly related to the photodeposition of some copper species on TiO2 particles. The run was repeated twice, demonstrating good reproducibility of the results (data not reported). The investigations were successively extended to evaluate the effects of varying Cu-modified TiO2-P25 catalyst load, keeping constant the Cu(II)/TiO2 mass ratio (10wt%). Fig. 2 a and b shows the hydrogen generation rate corresponding to the plateau obtained at different catalyst loads along with the irradiance values. Consistently with heterogeneous catalytic processes, hydrogen generation rate increases almost linearly for low increments of catalyst load; further additions of TiO2 amount to the reacting solution firstly result no more useful and successively appear detrimental for the process itself (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows that the irradiance values collected in the UV and the visible range sharply reduce increasing the TiO2 load between 50mgL−1 and 250mgL−1. On the other hand, the decreasing trend of irradiances in both ranges appears to slightly abate for further increases in catalyst load. An attempt to understand if this approach to hydrogen production through organic photoreforming can be of general use prompted us to investigate the system behavior using different sacrificial substrates. A large group of organic species was tested under the experimental conditions described for the run whose results are given in Fig. 1. Table 1 reports all the collected data for each run with a different chemical species: a behavior similar to that indicated in Fig. 1 is recorded in terms of hydrogen generation rate, irradiance, pH and cupric ion concentration against time (data not shown). As a general comment to the data reported, it is possible to state that the proposed system works as a catalyst for hydrogen generation, starting from a great many different organic species. Nevertheless, the observed rates varied from 5.50μmolmin−1 for glycerol to 0.55μmolmin−1 for benzyl and isopropyl alcohols and zero for acetic acid only. It is noteworthy to stress that, even if acetic acid, benzyl and isopropyl alcohols are used as sacrificial agent, a reduction of cupric ions is observed, although no hydrogen production is recorded (Table 1)."
7,Discussion,"According to Tung [22], it is possible to explain the data reported in Fig. 1 by assuming that, upon irradiation of TiO2 particles, the photogenerated charge carriers make possible in the very early stages of the process: • The reduction of cupric ions to cuprous one or to zero-valent copper by photogenerated electrons (1), along with proton reduction to form hydrogen atom: (1) C u ( I I ) + e C B − → C u ( I ) + e C B − → C u ( 0 ) • The oxidation of the sacrificial organic species by photogenerated positive holes (2): (2) S a d s + h V B + → S o x + H + Even though this view seems to be highly reasonable, it is necessary to go further into details of the process and define the oxidation state of copper species formed during the photocatalytic process. Firstly, the increase in the visible-light absorption during the first stage of the process is consistent with the reduction of cupric ions to cuprous oxide, which is almost insoluble in water and could precipitate even in acidic pH conditions [20,23]. Cuprous oxide, a p-type semiconductor, is reported to have a band gap of about 2.0–2.2eV [24]: this value is smaller than TiO2 (3.0–3.2eV) and could properly justify the increase in absorption of the visible radiation. Moreover, the precipitation of cuprous oxide can be partially responsible for the decrease in pH. To explain the decrement of pH, it is worth noticing that two proton ions are generated from the oxidation of the organic species (3), and two additional proton ions derive from the formation of Cu2O (4) through the reaction between cupric ions and photogenerated electrons [25]: (3) − C H 2 O H + 2 h V B + → − C H O + 2 H + (4) 2 C u ( I I ) + 2 e C B − + H 2 O → C u 2 O + + 2 H + On these basis, a direct evidence for the presence of cuprous oxide in the system was investigated. Fig. 3 a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra for some selected samples recovered at the end of the photoreforming runs. In particular, the samples analyzed can be classified as reported below: i Cu-modified TiO2-P25 recovered after a typical photoreforming run in presence of cupric ions and TiO2-P25. ii Cu2O-TiO2-P25 resulting from a photoreforming run carried out by adding Cu2O to a TiO2-P25 suspension. iii TiO2-P25 and Cu2O composed of bare P25 titanium dioxide and pure cuprous oxide, respectively. The sharp basal absorption edge located at about 416nm in bare TiO2-P25 is consistent with the pristine bandgap of P25 (3.2eV) [26], whereas pure Cu2O shows a broad absorption band in the visible spectral range, starting from about 430nm. Fig. 3a indicates that Cu-modified TiO2-P25 and Cu2O-TiO2-P25 have similar absorption spectra and both the samples absorb at higher wavelengths (λ >400nm) with respect to bare TiO2-P25 sample. Moreover, from a careful investigation of the DRUV spectra in the wavelength range of 520–580nm, where signals belonging to plasmon resonance of copper nanoparticles fall [27,28], a large absorption band may be observed for both the copper-based-titanium dioxide catalysts. These data clarify that in the first stage of the process, during which Cu-modified TiO2-P25 forms, the light absorption behavior of the solid suspended in the reactor drastically change, assuming a relevant character in the visible range. The intensity measured in UV–visible spectra is also expressed as the value of the Kubelka–Munk function F(R). Fig. 3b shows the energy gap values calculated by linearization of Tauc plot of (F(R) hv)1/2 versus photon energy (hv). The red shift of the absorption edge from 386nm (for the TiO2-P25) to 431nm (for Cu2O-TiO2-P25) is consistent with an energy band gap of about 2.6eV. However, the last value does not totally agree with that reported in the literature for Cu2O (2.2eV). The results collected raised some doubts about the nature of the species formed on TiO2-P25 surface. Therefore, to collect clearer indications on these species, Raman spectra (Fig. 4 a), EPR analysis (Fig. 4b) and XRD patterns (Fig. 4c) were planned and carried out on some catalyst samples recovered during experimental runs using methanol as sacrificial agent. The Raman spectrum of Cu-modified TiO2-P25 is characterized by an intense peak at 148cm−1 and three short peaks at 400cm−1, 520cm−1 and 640cm−1,. which corresponds to the active modes of bare TiO2-P25. Actually, the typical peak of Cu2O corresponding to the second-order overtone at 219cm−1 [29] is not observed in the spectrum of the catalyst formed in situ. Fig. 4b shows EPR spectra on Cu-modified TiO2-P25 and Cu2O-TiO2-P25 samples. As a reference, the EPR spectrum of the TiO2 Degussa P25 in presence of cupric ions before irradiation is reported, showing the typical signal of Cu(II)/TiO2 system [30]. For both the catalysts no paramagnetic signals are detectable, thus clearly confirming the absence of Cu2+ species adsorbed on the TiO2-P25 catalyst surface. On the other hand, comparing to each other the XRD spectra shown in Fig. 4c, for the samples collected after the photocatalytic processes it is possible to distinguish the presence of two peaks at 2Θ values 43°3′ and 50°5′, which exactly match those of zero-valent copper, whereas no peaks due to Cu2O are observed. Conversely, the peaks related to the occurrence of Cu2O are present and no signals ascribed to zero-valent copper are found in the XRD spectrum of a sample obtained by adding Cu2O to a P25 suspension without UV irradiation. It is clear that Raman and XRD results do not support the formation of Cu2O on TiO2 surface, but only the presence of zero-valent copper particles. However, it is noteworthy to stress that both these techniques have a low sensitivity with respect to Cu2O and that it could be unrevealed when present at small concentration. Since no other possibilities to remove this doubt were available, the discussion which follows is based on the sole certain indication collected during catalyst characterization of the presence of zero-valent copper particles. Therefore, a different explanation with respect to that proposed above for the absorption in the visible range must be sought. To this purpose, the crystallite size of zero-valent copper (D) was calculated using XRD data and the Scherrer's equation ( D = k λ β cos Θ ) where k is a constant (0.94 for spherical particles), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (0.154nm), ß is the line width at half maximum intensity of the peak, and θ is the angle of diffraction (21°6′). The mean size of particles estimated from the Scherrer's formulas is close to 30nm, thus indicating the formation of zero-valent copper nanoparticles in the first stage of the photocatalytic process. The results collected are of particular importance since it is known that copper nanoparticles, along with those of other metals such as Au, Ag, and Pt, are capable to give rise to a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), absorbing visible light and generating charge carriers [19,31]. The above reported data (Fig. 1a) also indicate that the deposition of zero-valent Cu on the TiO2-P25 surface leads to a beneficial effect on hydrogen generation rate. As a matter of fact, hydrogen generation rate firstly increases to reach a maximum value, and then showed slightly decreases approaching a plateau value higher than that measured when bare TiO2-P25 is present in the system (Fig. 1a). A possible explanation for this behavior follows by considering the absorption properties of zero-valent copper nanoparticles. Indeed, Cu nanoparticles, unlike titanium dioxide, are capable of absorbing radiation over 400nm thus generating excited electrons which are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 (anatase or rutile phase), where they can be captured by protons (Scheme 1 ). The possibility of this transfer from the metal particle to the semiconductor band reduces the recombination reaction between photogenerated electrons and holes in TiO2. It is worth noticing that, it is possible to explain the decrease in pH recorded during the runs even if the formation of zero-valent copper particles upon reduction of cupric ions is considered. Indeed, as reported in Reaction (1), in order to obtain two moles of zero-valent copper from two moles of cupric ions it is necessary to have four moles of electrons. As a result, Reaction (2) proves that the consumption of four positive holes is required, resulting in the generation of four hydrogen ions. Therefore, once more, for each reduced mole of cupric ion two moles of hydrogen ions form. According to previous investigations [32,22], when participating to a photocatalytic process each organic substrate may behave either as a species “strongly adsorbed” on the catalyst surface or as a “weakly adsorbed” species. With reference to these situations, two mechanisms are generally reported [33,34] substantially different in the reaction through which the substrate oxidizes. Indeed, for “strongly adsorbed” compounds the oxidation proceeds essentially through a direct reaction of the organic species with surface positive holes (Reaction (2)). On the other hand, as stated above, photogenerated electrons may be captured at the very beginning of the process by either cupric and cuprous ions (Reaction (1)), and successively by protons resulting into hydrogen generation (Reaction (5)): (5) H + + e C B − → H • For “weakly adsorbed” species, the oxidation proceeds through the interaction between the organic compound dissolved in the solution and surface-bound hydroxyl radicals which form as a result of a trapping process of the holes on the surface of TiO2 (Reactions (6) and (7)): (6) > TiOH + h V B + → { > TiOH • } + (7) { > TiOH • } + + S → > TiOH + S o x + H + Moreover, surface-bound hydroxyl radicals are also capable to react with photogenerated electrons giving rise to an overall fast recombination (Reaction (8)), which makes the occurrence of Reaction (5) negligible: (8) { > TiOH • } + + e C B − → > TiOH Although no literature indications can be found on the behavior of the organic species adopted in the present study as probe molecules, it is reasonable to consider small molecules capable of strongly adsorbing on the TiO2 surface. This is the case of molecules such as methanol, ethanol, formic acid, and those having more than one single functional group such as 1,2-ethandiol, glycerol, and glucose. On the other hand, it could be supposed that bulky species with a single OH group (e.g., isopropyl and benzyl alcohols) only weakly adsorb on the TiO2 surface, thus Reactions (6–8) are preferred. When acetic acid is used as sacrificial agent, no hydrogen production is observed. This apparently “anomalous” result may be explained on the basis of the photo-Kolbe mechanism [35]. This mechanism takes into account, as first step, the decarboxylation of the organic acid through hole oxidation, as indicated in Reaction (9): (9) R C H 2 C O O H + h V B + → R C H 2 • + C O 2 + H + After Reaction (9), under deaerated conditions, carbon centered radicals react with photogenerated electron (Reaction (10)), thus preventing the formation of hydrogen [36,37], or give at a lower extent a cross termination (Reaction (11)): (10) R C H 2 • + e C B − + H + → R C H 3 (11) 2 R C H 2 • → R C H 2 C H 2 R"
8,Conclusions,"The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from different oxygenated organic species (mostly alcohols and carboxylic acids) through the adoption of copper-modified TiO2-P25 catalysts was studied in the present work. The photocatalysts were prepared in situ by means of a photodeposition procedure. Various measurements done during the experiments (i.e., intensity of radiation emerging from the reactor) and on the recovered photocatalyst (i.e., DRUV, XRD and Raman analysis) support the deposition on TiO2 surface of Cu nanoparticles with particle size of about 30nm. Due to a plasmon resonance phenomenon, the photodeposition of Cu nanoparticles drastically changes the absorption properties of the solid with respect to those of titanium dioxide initially charged in the photoreactor. Experimental results indicate that, for the most part of the organic species adopted as sacrificial agents, the hydrogen production rates were appreciably higher (e.g., 5.5μmole of H2/minutes for glycerol) than that observed for bare P25 (e.g., 2.1μmole of H2/minutes for glycerol). In presence of benzyl alcohol, 2-propanol and acetic acid, no additional formation of hydrogen is observed, although each analysis done during the experiments confirm the reduction of cupric ions to zero-valent copper. To explain this behavior, a consistent mechanism was proposed. The mechanism is based on a different oxidation capability of the organic species related to their tendency to adsorb on the catalyst surface. When the species strongly adsorb, beneficial effects are observed in terms of an additional hydrogen generation with respect to bare titanium dioxide. Indeed, a negligible proton reduction occurs in the case of a weak adsorption by the organic species."
