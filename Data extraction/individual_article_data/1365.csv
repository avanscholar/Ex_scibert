0,Introduction,"Gold catalysts are generally prepared by bottom-up approaches, which consist in controlled reduction of a gold precursor to suitably sized metal nanoparticles. The complex may be grafted on a powder support, prior to reduction, via e.g. terminal -OH groups of the typical inorganic oxides used in heterogeneous catalysis [1] or via organic functions pre-grafted onto the inorganic support [2]. This can be performed in solution [1,2] or in the solid-state, using the solid grinding method [3–7] in which the precursor is physically mixed with the support in the absence of any solvent. In this case, the support acts as a stabilizer for Au NP. Additional protecting agents may be used to limit the growth of Au NP during reduction, including polymers (steric effect) [8], strongly interacting organic molecules (electronic effect) [9], or ligands of metal complexes, such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) for example [10]. Commonly used reducing agents for gold catalysts include sodium borohydride, air and hydrogen. When gold is associated to titania, photoreduction is also an option which is commonly used in the synthesis of gold-containing photocatalysts. While sodium borohydride and photoreduction are efficient at room temperature, reduction with air or hydrogen most often requires thermal activation. Solid mixtures of a gold precursor and a powder support are thus thermally treated to achieve reduction of the gold complex to Au0. By doing so, protecting agents [11], stabilizing moieties [12] and other surface functions [13] are decomposed and the Au NP surface is freed, at least to a certain extent. Finally, this thermal treatment generates a so-called ‘metal-support interaction’ which often triggers or boosts catalytic and photocatalytic activity. Hence, gold-containing nanocomposites dedicated to catalytic and photocatalytic applications are most generally submitted to such thermal treatment. The latter is generally performed in air, as gold oxides are not thermally stable [14]. Calcination thus allows both oxidizing the gold precursor and reducing the resulting AuIII and AuI oxides to Au0 NP in one pot. Air is also a convenient medium for thermal treatment due to its wide availability. Air however favors sintering of Au NP, especially in the presence of chlorine ions [15]. The oxidative degradation of HAuCl4 (or the grafted -AuCl4 complex) for example results in large Au NP (10–20nm), if no treatment to remove chlorine is applied prior to calcination [16]. Most gold atoms are thus contained within the particle and not accessible for catalysis. In addition to being economically unattractive, these catalysts are also purely inactive in structure-sensitive reactions, such as the oxidation of CO or H2. On the other hand, treatments under hydrogen have been shown to limit sintering of Au NP in the presence of Cl− [17], maximize gold dispersions over oxide supports (i.e. the ratio of catalytically operative vs. inoperative gold atoms), and thus produce more efficient catalysts. Hydrogen also leads to more reduced Au/TiO2 and Au/CeO2 catalysts, which have proven to be more active in e.g. CO oxidation [18] or in the wet air oxidation of carboxylic acids [19]. Here we consider a photocatalytic application of gold-titania nanocomposites, namely the production of hydrogen from water (H2O→ H2 +½O2 [20–22]). It is performed in the presence of low amount of methanol (<1vol.%), used as sacrificial agent. More specifically, methanol enhances hydrogen production, by avoiding the back-reaction (H2 +½O2 → H2O) to occur (O2 trap [22]) and by limiting electron-hole recombination (hole trap [23,24]). In this reaction, photons absorption, charge carriers (electrons and holes) generation and water oxidation is ensured by the light-activated titania semiconductor. The addition of Au NP may lead to three kinds of phenomena [25]. First, the so-called ‘plasmonic or Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) effect’ [26–28] is expected to make Au/TiO2 composites more active than TiO2 under solar light irradiation, extending the range of photon absorption from the UV to the visible light range [29,30]. Second, the intimate contact between Au NP and TiO2 is known to act as an electron trap, driving the photogenerated electrons toward Au NP and thus enhancing the charge carriers separation [31]. Third, Au NP play an important role as co-catalyst [23,26,32,33] for the reduction of H+ into H2. In a seminal work Bamwenda et al., the UV-based photocatalytic activity of the Au/TiO2 composite was clearly shown to be markedly impacted by the preparation method [20]. However, only liquid phase HAuCl4-based techniques have been used for the preparation of the Au/TiO2 nanocomposites tested in solar energy conversion to hydrogen. In particular, the solventless solid grinding (SG) method has never been evaluated. Yet SG is a straight-forward method for the synthesis of supported metal [3–7] and oxide [34] NP, as well as for synthesis of alloys [35,36] and mixed oxides [37]. It has been used on a few occasions to prepare supported Au NP on e.g. titano-silicalite-1 (TS-1), coordination polymers or cellulose, i.e. poorly functionalized supports, which are quite challenging in terms of loading and particle size control [38]. Here, we show that efficient Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for solar light-induced hydrogen production from water may be prepared from solventless mechanical mixtures of AuPPh3Cl and TiO2-P25 (Evonik Industries), provided an appropriate thermal treatment is applied. In particular, we discuss the critical impact of the atmosphere of this activation step, which has otherwise been found irrelevant when associated to other preparation methods or when using UV as the photon source [20]. We further consider the combined effect of gold loading and gold particle size, i.e. the density of metal particles, on both the overall activity of the composite and the Au-normalized activity, which highlights efficient noble metal utilization."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and syntheses,"2.1 Materials and syntheses Chloro-(triphenylphosphine) gold (I) (AuPPh3Cl) (≥99.9% trace metals basis) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Titania P25 was purchased from Evonik Industries. All chemicals were used without further purification. Au/TiO2 nanocomposites are prepared by solid grinding. Titania (500mg) and AuPPh3Cl (1.5–63.5mg) are mechanically mixed with a pestle in an agate mortar during 10min at about 22°C. The amount of gold precursor is adjusted in order to tune Au/TiO2 ratios (which are referred to as “gold loadings” in the following) from 0.1wt.% to 5.0wt.%. The resulting white powders are then thermally treated at 200°C for 4h (ramp of 10°/min), under air or hydrogen, as is commonly performed for syntheses involving the AuPPh3Cl complex [10,12,39,40]. Activation at 200°C has also proven suitable for Au/TiO2 photocatalysts designed for visible light-induced water splitting [41]. It is noted that this temperature is higher than that usually applied to solid grinding samples derived from the highly volatile dimethyl gold (III) acetylacetonate [Me2Au(acac)] compound (∼120°C) [3–6]. The resulting materials are denoted XAu/TiO2-P25[atm], where X stands for the gold loading in wt.% and atm stands for the atmosphere of the heat treatment (air or H2)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Diffuse-reflectance UV–Visible (UV–vis.) absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950UV/Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. For clarity of the results, diffuse reflectance Rd spectra were converted in Kubelka-Munk unit according to F(R)=(1− Rd )2/2Rd . Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a TOPCON 002B microscope working at 200kV accelerating voltage and equipped with a probe corrector for spherical aberrations, giving a point-to-point resolution of 0.18nm. The sample is dispersed by ultrasound in an ethanol solution for 5min. A drop of the solution is subsequently deposited on copper covered with a holey carbon membrane for observation. Statistical Au NP size distributions are obtained on bright field images using populations of 105–125 nanoparticles and the ImageJ software [42]. The distributions should be taken with some caution given the poor contrast between TiO2 and Au and the low Au loading, which most likely favors the count of the largest NP. Hence, average Au NP sizes might be slightly overestimated and the population of Au NP<10nm underestimated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a D8-Advance diffractometer equipped with a LynxEye detector and operated at 40kV and 40mA, in a θ–2θ mode using the K α radiation of Cu at 1.5418Å. The datasets are acquired in stepscan mode over the 2θ range 25–46°, using a step interval of 0.013 and a counting time of 189s per step. Samples are deposited on a round-shaped glass plate. Average size of the gold crystallites is determined using the Scherrer formula on the full widths at half-maximum of the Au(111) and (200) reflections at 2θ =38.2 and 44.3°, respectively. Average size of the titania crystallites is determined using the Scherrer formula from the full width at half-maximum of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ =25.3°. Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA Instrument Q5000IR. The sample was placed in a platinum crucible and heated from room temperature to 900°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 under air flow at 100cm3 min−1. Specific surface areas were obtained via the Brunauer, Emett and Teller (BET) and t-plot methods. The surface area measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Asap 2420 porosimeter using N2 as adsorbent at liquid nitrogen temperature. Materials were outgassed at 150°C for 5h prior to analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) spectrometer equipped with a VSW Class WA hemispherical electron analyzer. A dual anode Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV) was used as incident radiation. Survey and high resolution spectra were recorded in constant pass energy mode (90 and 22eV, respectively). The binding energies were calibrated based on the Ti 2p peak at 459.3eV [43], assuming that the pinning of the Fermi level (and the position of the Ti 2p peak) is the same in P25 and the composites. The % surface content of all elements was calculated by using the core level peaks, normalized to the photoemission cross-section and assuming a homogeneous distribution arrangement model."
4,Photocatalytic study,"2.3 Photocatalytic study The photocatalytic efficiency of the materials towards hydrogen production was tested in a similar set-up as previously described [22], using a Quartz reactor with an internal and illuminated surface of 750cm2. This reactor was filled with 1L of Milli-Q water and equipped with a jacketed plunging quartz tube containing a 150W CERAMIC-Metal-Halide Lamp (solar light simulation) with a low UV-A content and a large part in the visible light range [22,44]. The generated photon flux is about 12.5mWcm−2, including 1.06% of UV light [45]. This tube was cooled by circulating water at 15°C through the external jacket, in order to avoid heating of the aqueous media. Each test was carried out with 200mg of catalyst, an amount that has been optimized towards the geometry of the reactor under a 100mLmin−1 nitrogen flow and mechanical stirring at 700rpm. Prior to any experiment, residual oxygen was removed by nitrogen flushing (500mLmin−1, 30min). The photocatalytic tests were performed using water as hydrogen source. Methanol (from 0.1 to 1vol.%) was systematically added as sacrificial agent to avoid O2 formation and thus to enhance hydrogen production, although a few μmol of hydrogen per hour per gram of photocatalyst were readily produced over the most active materials in the absence of methanol. Reaction products were analyzed on-line every 100s by thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) on a Gaz Analyser R-3000 SRA Instruments micro-gas chromatograph. Hydrogen productions were calculated and compared after stabilization of the activity, i.e. after at least one hour of steady-state conversion. Hydrogen production rates are defined as the number of mole of hydrogen per hour per gram of composite (μmolH2 h−1 g−1). Au-normalized hydrogen production (molH2molAu −1 h−1, i.e. h−1), also referred to as hydrogen production turnover, is defined as the number of mole of hydrogen produced per mole of gold per hour. They are calculated from the hydrogen production rates by taking into account the total amount of gold contained within the Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites. All the experiments were performed under the same conditions. Error bars on the values correspond to the standard deviations measured upon repeating the tests on fresh portions of a single synthesis batch, of about 10%. For activity under visible light (λ >400nm), Nigrosin (Acid Black 2, >99.99%, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in the cooling water jacket surrounding the plunging lamp (0.1gL−1) in order to filter UV light. In these experiments, the emitted photon flux is about 5mWcm−2, including 0.14% of UV light and the water/methanol ratio used is 99/1v/v. For recycling /stability studies, the photocatalysts were filtered off the water/methanol mixture, washed with deionised water (500mL), dried (air, 110°C, 16h), cooled down to 22°C, weighed and reintroduced in a fresh water batch."
5,Results,
6,Synthesis and characterization of Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites The mechanical mixture of the white TiO2-P25 powder and the white AuPPh3Cl crystals leads to a white powder, whatever the amount of AuPPh3Cl introduced. This suggests that, in the absence of any further treatment, gold has not changed oxidation state (+I) upon mixing with TiO2. Subsequent heat treatment in air or in hydrogen however induces coloration of the powder (Fig. 1 ). The pink to purple color is typical of the presence of gold nanoparticles, which exhibit plasmon resonance in the visible range, as shown by UV–vis. spectroscopy (Fig. 2 ). The color deepens with increasing Au loading, indicating the presence of more particles in the mixture. It is interesting that, at a given Au loading, and especially at the lower loadings (0.1–1wt.%), air (Fig.1a) and hydrogen (Fig.1b) do not lead to the same colors. This is consistent with the fact that oxidative and reductive atmospheres do not lead to the same interaction between Au NP and the support [18,19]. For example, it has been proposed that hydrogen may partially reduce titania at the temperature used for heat treatment (i.e. 200°C) in the presence of Au NP [18], changing the chemical nature of the Au/TiO2 interface/heterojunction. Taking into account the nature of the gold precursor used here, it is possible that carbon (from the carbon-rich ligand) and other deposits, which will be discussed below, also affect the colors. Fig. 2 shows diffuse reflectance UV–vis. spectra obtained over selected Au/TiO2-P25[air] and Au/TiO2-P25[H2] nanocomposites. The absorbance relative to the surface plasmon resonance of Au NP is clearly visible in all spectra. The position of the peak is consistent with those found in other studies of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, i.e. between 550 [28] and 570nm [46]. It is characteristic of Au NP in interaction with an anatase-rich titania [8,47,48]. It is interesting that, regardless of the activation atmosphere, the SPR band of the most loaded photocatalyst is located at the shortest wavelength (ca. 555nm). A blue-shift in the plasmon position with the increase in metal loading has been observed before in AuNi/TiO2 photocatalysts [49]. In the event of Au NP size increase, the SPR is expected to red-shift [48]. Hence, no significant change in Au NP size is expected amongst each series; the blue-shift observed at the highest loading suggests that the refractive index of the composite, surrounding gold nanoparticles, is lowered [47], which may be attributed to the presence of carbon and other deposits, as evidenced by XPS (see below). Besides, the intensity of the SPR band is only mildly affected by the variation in gold loading, especially for the Au/TiO2-P25[air] series (Fig.2a). A non-monotonous increase in the intensity of the SPR band with the gold loading has already been observed [46]. It is generally indicative of polydispersity of size. The similarities between intensities of the SPR feature of the air and the hydrogen series at a given gold loading (with the exception of 0.1Au/TiO2-P25) suggest that the size distributions of Au NP are similar in both sample series. This is confirmed by TEM studies (Fig. 3 ), which show the presence of rather large Au NP (darker spots) amongst titania crystallites (lighter grey). The size of titania fits well with the known dimensions of the P25 mixture, i.e. 25nm anatase and 50nm rutile particles. Au NP size distributions show that most diameters are in the 10–35nm range for both the air- and-hydrogen treated composites, ranging from 8 to 85nm for the air-treated sample and from 10 to 60nm for the H2-treated sample. Average Au NP sizes of 23±12nm and 21±10nm are found for 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 2.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2], respectively. We thus conclude that the PPh3 ligand of the gold precursor, which has been shown to electronically and geometrically stabilize Au NP in solution and allow a strict particle-size control (<10nm) after deposition on silica [10,39], struggles to provide control over the growth of Au NP in the solid-state in a titania matrix. Besides, neither the atmosphere of the activation step, nor the gold loading, appears to have a significant impact on Au NP size distributions. This is further confirmed by XRD (Fig. 4 ). XRD patterns of 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] clearly shows intense peaks at 2θ =38.2 and 44.3°, which are attributed to Au (111) and Au (200) reflections, respectively. Using the Debye-Scherrer formula, average sizes of 24.7 and 23.8nm (on (111) and (200) respectively) are calculated for gold crystallites in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air]. Similarly, average sizes of 25.0 and 25.5nm are calculated for gold crystallites in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2]. Averaging both values for each sample, the size of gold crystallites appears to be 24.3 and 25.3nm in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2], respectively. Hence, not only is this average size close to that found by TEM in 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 2.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2], but it is again very similar for the air-treated and H2-treated samples. Besides, both XRD patterns are virtually indistinguishable, showing that the atmosphere of the activation step has no impact on the structure of the composite. Finally, both patterns show the typical diffraction lines of P25 (anatase-rich mixture with rutile) and an average size of 25nm is found by applying the Scherrer formula to the (101) anatase reflection at 2θ =25.3°, which is fully consistent with the size of anatase crystallites found in P25. Hence, the P25 structure is not modified during gold incorporation by solid grinding. This is confirmed by XPS (Fig. 5 ). Ti 2p core level electrons indeed exhibit one single binding energy, which is similar in all samples and which is thus attributed to lattice Ti(IV) in titania. It is set at 459.3eV [43] and used as reference for the binding energy scale. O 1s core level electrons appear at 530.5±1eV in all the samples (Table 1 ), which is consistent with lattice oxygen of titania [O2−, 43]. However, three other contributions may be found at 532.0±0.1, 533.2±0.1 and 534.3±0.3eV by deconvoluating the O 1s signal, which may all be attributed to titania surface species, namely surface hydroxyl groups, adsorbed water, and adsorbed carbonated compounds (including CO2), respectively [43], which will be discussed below. Au 4f core level electrons appear at 83.9eV and 84.1eV in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2], respectively (Table 1), showing that gold is in the metallic state [8], which is consistent with the 20–25nm Au NP found by TEM and XRD. No Au (I) or Au (III) species is detected. Hence, it is assumed that all Au (I) species initially contained in the AuPPh3Cl complex have been reduced to Au0, and that Au NP contain all the gold initially mixed with TiO2-P25. Besides, no Au δ − species can be fitted, which suggests that small nanometric Au NP (<5nm) exhibiting size-dependent surface core level shifts or undergoing electron transfer from titania [8] are either completely absent from the samples or present in only a small number. In fact, the particularly low Au/Ti ratios (compared to the theoretical value of 0.02 derived from the actual gold loading of the composites) are fully consistent with the size of Au NP found by TEM (Fig. 3) and XRD (Fig. 4). Concerning the chemical composition of the 5.0Au/TiO2-P25 photocatalysts surface, XPS data show the presence of a significant amount of phosphorous, chlorine and carbon elements (Table 1). These are attributed to the presence of residues of the ligands of the AuPPh3Cl precursor. It shows that decomposition of the gold complex is incomplete whether the thermal treatment is performed in air or in hydrogen. This is confirmed by TGA (Fig.6 a,b). The weight loss observed over unactivated 0.5Au/TiO2-P25 indeed shows a total weight loss of about 2.7%, consisting of dehydration and dehydroxylation phenomena for about 2wt.% [50] and a marked weight loss of about 0.7% between 350 and 450°C, which is consistent with the combustion of PPh3 trapped in the composite [44]. After air-treatment, the total weight loss decreases to 1.9%, indicating that partial dehydration and dehydroxylation have occurred. Besides, the weight loss attributed to PPh3 also decreases, but only by about 30%. Residues of the PPh3 moiety thus clearly persist after the thermal treatment used (200°C). However, the degradation of the complex appears much more advanced in air than in hydrogen. The P/Au, Cl/Au and C/Ti surface atomic ratios obtained by XPS (Table 1), as well as the carbonaceous contribution to the O1s signal (Fig.5d), are indeed significantly higher in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] than in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] (Fig.5c), showing that the hydrogen-treated material contains a larger quantity of these elements, than the air-treated composite. On the other hand, the Au/Ti ratio is higher in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] than in 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2]. Given the similarities in Au NP size (Figs. 2–4), this suggests that the extra-heteroelements contained within the reduced sample, and in particular the carbonaceous deposits, may mask part of the Au NP present at the TiO2 surface. The PPh3 moiety may indeed stay at the vicinity of Au NP [51], which is in agreement with the binding energy found for P 2p core level electrons (133.7±0.1, Table 1). This value is indeed close to that of phosphate species (PO4 2−); it is typical of a phosphorous atom in connection to highly electrophilic elements, such as oxygen and gold (electronegativity of 3.44 and 2.54 respectively), suggesting that the P deposits are in close interaction with both Au NP and the oxygenated titania surface. Besides, the carbonaceous deposits at the origin of the C signal correlate with the higher binding energy contribution to the O 1s signal, which is consistent with carbonated compounds in interaction with the titania surface. Furthermore, binding energies of Cl 2p core level electrons (199.5±0.01eV, Table 1) are consistent with Cl deposits at both metal surfaces [52] and hydrated surfaces [53], as well as with Cl ions in an environment similar to that of the AuPPh3Cl complex [54]. Finally, surface areas of 43 and 58 (±5) m2g−1 are measured for 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air], respectively, while surface areas of 30 and 90 (±5) are measured for 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[H2] and 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2], respectively. Considering the surface area of P25 (50±5m2 g−1) and the fact that the average pore diameter (43±2nm) is similar in all samples (Fig.6c), the extra surface and pore volume found in the highly loaded hydrogen-treated sample is attributed to the presence of light carbonaceous deposits, in agreement with XPS data, and in particular with the lower Au/Ti surface ratio found for this sample (Table 1). Hence, series of Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites can be efficiently prepared by mechanically mixing the yet poorly volatile AuPPh3Cl complex and titania P25 and by applying a subsequent thermal treatment. Although several methods are reported for the deposition of size-controlled Au NP over titania [8,50,55–56], SG has two main advantages over the solution-based bottom-up strategies. First, it is fast: gram quantities can be obtained in a very short time due to the absence of solvent and of the related time-consuming steps of liquid-solid separation, washing and drying. And second, it is efficient, as 100% of the gold initially present as precursor is incorporated in the final composite. As a result, the Au content can be tuned straight-forwardly by adjusting the amount of AuPPh3Cl in the initial AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mixture, since all the gold present in the mixture is included in the final material, whatever the initial AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 ratio. This is another major advantage over solution-based strategies, in which change in the initial concentration of the gold precursor may affect yields of deposition and thus final loading of the composite [12,16]."
7,Photocatalytic activity of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures treated in air,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures treated in air The Au/TiO2-P25 composites treated in air all exhibit photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from low alcohol water-methanol mixtures. The fact that TiO2-P25 alone does not exhibit any measurable activity under the conditions used confirms the presence of nanosized gold in close vicinity to titania crystallites, acting as promoter. Fig. 7 shows the influence of the gold loading of Au/TiO2-P25[air] nanocomposites on the amount of hydrogen evolved from water. It can be seen that, whatever the amount of methanol present, increasing the gold loading from 0.1 to 0.5wt.% nearly doubles the activity of the composite. Nearly 500μmol H2 are produced per hour per gram of 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] in the presence of 1vol.% methanol. Increasing the loading of gold to 1.0wt.% results in a mild decrease of the photocatalytic activity of about 8%. Further increasing the amount of gold present in the composite leads to a continuous decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the composite. 20% of the activity is lost by using 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air]. This can be attributed to decreased charge separation enhancement and reduced charge carrier mobility resulting from the formation of Schottky barriers at the more numerous interfaces with metal nanoparticles [23] and to the fact that the reduced photon flux absorption by TiO2, due to absorption of part of the light by more numerous Au NP, may become limiting. Hence, 0.5wt.% appears as the optimal loading of gold for efficiently splitting water and maximizing hydrogen production under the conditions used. This value was recently found optimal for Au/TiO2-P25 prepared by THPC reduction [57] and for high surface area Au/TiO2 composites, based on sol-gel titania [44]. The latter composites however exhibited lower hydrogen productions under the present conditions of test. For example, 0.1Au/TiO2-P25[air] is twice more active than 0.1Au/TiO2-sol-gel [200], comparing the activities in the presence of 1vol.% of the methanol sacrificial agent [44]. The optimal loading of 0.5wt.% is smaller than those usually found for Au/TiO2 composites prepared by other methods, e.g. deposition-precipitation [46,58], anionic exchange [22] or photodeposition [20,28], and for other Au/TiO2-based photocatalysts [59], which are in the range of 1–2wt.% or more. Hence, solid grinding appears as an economically attractive method for the preparation of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, saving not only on solvents and purification steps, but also on noble metal utilization."
8,Photocatalytic activity of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures treated in hydrogen,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures treated in hydrogen Just like the Au/TiO2-P25 composites treated in air, the composites treated in hydrogen all exhibit photocatalytic activity for the water splitting reaction in the presence of low amount of methanol (Fig. 8 ). This confirms that solid grinding is a suitable method for the production of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. However, the overall hydrogen production is somewhat lower than for the composites treated in air, reaching a maximum of 380μmolh−1 g−1, in the presence of 1vol.% methanol. The optimal hydrogen production is achieved at the loading of 2.0wt.%. Hence, when the composites are treated in hydrogen, four times more gold is needed to get an optimal hydrogen production. 70% of hydrogen production is lost by increasing the gold loading to 5.0wt.% and over 50% is lost by decreasing the gold loading to 0.1wt.%. The productions achieved by 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[H2] and 1.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] are only 15% lower than the optimal value. Nevertheless, 2.0wt.% appears as the optimal loading. Such loading was also found optimal for Au/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by anionic exchange [22] and deposition-precipitation [58] and for graphene-supported Au/TiO2 photocatalysts [59]."
9,"Reproducibility, recycling and visible light activity of 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air]","3.4 Reproducibility, recycling and visible light activity of 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] The best photocatalyst of the series, 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air], has been studied in more details. Three batches of this material have been prepared. All three materials lead to similar values of hydrogen production rates, comprised between 415 and 500μmolh−1 g−1 (Fig. 9 ), which highlights the reproducibility of the synthesis. Besides, the third batch of 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] has been successfully reused twice in the photocatalytic reaction, with only marginal loss of hydrogen production (Fig. 9). Values in the range 385–430μmolh−1 g−1 are found in the three cycles, which is typical of the standard deviation observed by testing two fresh portions of a single synthesis batch. 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] is thus found stable under the photocatalytic conditions used. Finally, 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] shows some activity under visible light. A hydrogen production rate of 55±5μmolh−1 g−1 is observed over the material after filtration of the UV wavelengths. This visible light activity is however consistent with the residual amount of UV in the photon flux and/or with the low amount of rutile, but a plasmonic effect cannot be excluded."
10,Discussion,"Hence, despite the relatively large size of Au NP found in the heat-treated mechanical mixtures of AuPPh3Cl and TiO2-P25, all the composites display photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from low alcohol water-methanol mixtures, whatever the atmosphere of the thermal treatment. Large particle have already been found useful in Au/TiO2-based photocatalytic processes [60,61]. This makes solid grinding an interesting alternative for the preparation of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, from both an economical and an environmental point of view. Besides, most of the mass-specific H2 production rates achieved are over 300μmolh−1 g−1, a benchmark recently set under solar light by a Au/TiO2-P25 photocatalyst prepared by photodeposition (yet using a larger, hence more favorable, methanol/water ratio) [62]. 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] in particular displays the highest hydrogen production rates of the study, namely 500μmolh−1 g−1 and 55μmolh−1 g−1 under solar and visible illumination respectively. However, it must be mentioned that those values are not directly comparable, knowing that the emitted photon flux is much lower in the visible irradiation than in the solar irradiation. It is noted that, apart from hydrogen, no gas-phase (checked during the photocatalytic test) or liquid-phase intermediates (checked at the end of the test) are detected. Only traces of CO2, which can be attributed to the photo-oxidation of methanol, are present. This suggests that no (photo)degradation of the composite (and more specifically of the organic residues that it contains) occurs in the suspension. Besides, although the pH has not been controlled during the photocatalytic tests, its measurement before illumination (pH=6.2) and after the reaction (pH=6.5) shows only a slight increase and is fully consistent with the isoelectric point of the Au-modified TiO2 materials."
11,Influence of the activation atmosphere on the photocatalytic efficiency of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures,"4.1 Influence of the activation atmosphere on the photocatalytic efficiency of AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures Unlike what has been reported with other preparation methods, other gold precursors and using UV as photon source [20], the solar light activity of the SG-derived composites is strongly dependent on the activation atmosphere. In this regard, air appears much more efficient than hydrogen. Indeed, whatever the gold loading, Au/TiO2-P25[air] (Fig. 7) are more active than Au/TiO2-P25[H2] (Fig. 8). The lower photocatalytic activity of the hydrogen-treated nanocomposites can be explained by the presence of a larger amount of heteroatoms, as evidenced by XPS (Table 1), in the form of organic deposits, as supported by TGA (Fig.6b) and nitrogen physisorption (Fig.6c) experiments. These may indeed mask part of Au NP (Table 1) and hence block part of the co-catalyst effect. In addition, they may disturb the Au-TiO2 interface and act as recombination centers for the photogenerated electrons and holes on the titania surface. On the counterpart, the less hindered interface between Au NP and TiO2 and the more accessible Au NP in Au/TiO2-P25[air] would contribute to the higher activity of the air-treated composites. Although reduction of titania is generally observed at higher temperatures [63], local reduction of the Au-TiO2-P25[H2] interface cannot however be fully excluded: it has indeed been suggested that hydrogen may cause partial reduction of titania in the presence of Au NP [18], as gold is known to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen at mild temperature [64]. It is thus possible that Au/TiO2-P25[H2] composites are locally reduced, at the vicinity of Au NP, and that their photocatalytic activity is limited by the oxygen vacancies generated within the titania component by the hydrogen treatment. Oxygen vacancies and the associated Ti3+ species have indeed been proposed to act as recombination centers for photoinduced electrons and holes [65]. When present, they may thus contribute, in addition to the P, Cl and C heteroatoms, to the systematically lower photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2-P25[H2] compared to Au/TiO2-P25[air]. Hence, mechanical mixtures of AuPPh3Cl and TiO2-P25 are activated much more efficiently in air than in hydrogen, whatever the gold loading. However, the maxima of hydrogen production are achieved at different gold loadings in each series, i.e. 0.5wt.% for Au/TiO2-P25[air] and 2.0wt.% for Au/TiO2-P25[H2]. The extra gold needed to reach optimal activity in the reduced samples may come from the fact that part of the gold is hindered by the ligand residues. It is interesting that the maxima in water splitting activity correspond to positions of the SPR which are higher than the typical Au/anatase heterojunction at 550nm. SPR maxima are indeed located at ∼560nm for 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] and ∼570nm for 2.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] (Fig. 2), which suggests that the Au-TiO2 interface indeed has a determining role, as was recently highlighted [62], and that a strong interaction between gold and titania is beneficial. The hydrogen production gained by treating the mechanical mixtures in air rather than in hydrogen also depends on the gold loading. It ranges from 70 to 290μmolh−1 g−1 (Fig.10 a). 0.1Au/TiO2-P25, 0.5Au/TiO2-P25 and 1.0Au/TiO2-P25 all produce about 50% more hydrogen when treated in air rather than in hydrogen (Fig.10b). On the other hand, 2.0Au/TiO2-P25 produces only 20% more hydrogen, while 5.0Au/TiO2-P25 yields over 3 times more hydrogen, after an air, rather than a hydrogen, treatment. The largest difference and ratio occur for the highest gold loading of 5.0wt.%. 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] indeed displays a particularly low photocatalytic activity (about 120μmolh−1 g−1 in the presence of 1vol.% methanol) compared to the other gold loadings. It can be speculated that, if increasing the loading has indeed no significant impact on the average Au NP size (Figs. 2–4, Section 3.1), introducing more gold in the composite increases the number of gold particles, i.e. the density of Au NP dispersed over titania. The highly loaded composites thus contain a large population of Au NP, resulting in a larger TiO2/Au interface where charge recombination can be favored and predominate over the co-catalyst function. This may account for the mildly limited (−20%) photocatalytic activity of 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[air] (Fig. 7). In addition, the photocatalytic activity of 5.0Au/TiO2-P25[H2] would also be significantly inhibited (−70%, Fig. 8) by the extra amount of heteroatoms and carbon deposits present at the surface (Table 1, Figs.5dand6c), as well as a possible small amount of oxygen vacancies and associated Ti3+ centers, which would require advanced surface characterization to be detected [66,67]. The smallest difference and ratio between activation in air or in hydrogen is displayed by 2.0Au/TiO2-P25. This may be consistent with the fact that 2wt.% is often found as the optimal gold loading for Au/TiO2 water splitting photocatalysts [22,58,59], whatever the preparation method, gold precursor or titania used. The physical reasons for this are beyond the scope of this study; it would most probably require a highly detailed study of model composites. Nevertheless, the superiority of the air-treated over the hydrogen-treated Au/TiO2 photocatalysts emphasizes the specific suitability of gold for promoting the photocatalytic activity of titania in water splitting with solar light: indeed, no use of reducing agent is actually needed to produce Au NP and titania may thus retain its fully oxidized, fully active state."
12,Economical and mechanistic consideration on the efficiency of Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites prepared by solid grinding,"4.2 Economical and mechanistic consideration on the efficiency of Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites prepared by solid grinding Considering that gold is the scarcest element i.e. the most expensive part of the composite, the efficiency of the heat-treated AuPPh3Cl/TiO2-P25 mechanical mixtures may also be considered in terms of noble metal utilization (Fig. 11 ). In this regard, 0.1Au/TiO2-P25[air] appears as the most economically attractive nanocomposite, as it exhibits the highest hydrogen production per mole of precious metal (54h−1). Increasing the gold loading results in a continuous decrease in this value. A similar trend is observed for Au/TiO2-P25[H2], with a lower productivity reaching a maximum of 35h−1 with 0.1Au/TiO2-P25[H2]. Such dependency of Au-normalized hydrogen production on the gold loading of the photocatalyst has recently been reported for Au/TiO2-P25 composites prepared by photodeposition [23]. It shows that the additional gold introduced in composites with loading higher than 0.1wt.% is not fully operational. More precisely, the Au-normalized H2 production decreases by 63% when the Au loading is increased to 0.3wt.% (Fig. 11), although the overall hydrogen production increases (Fig. 7). It raises the question of considering even lower loadings of Au/TiO2 composites: would lower Au/Ti ratios be even more productive? Ultra low loaded gold catalysts have already proven useful in a number of catalytic reactions, such as the oxidation of CO [68–70], the water-gas shift reaction [71] and other oxidation reactions [72]. The higher productivity of the composite with the lowest gold loading also raises a question about how the extra gold contained within the other composites can be made active. It supports the idea that the ability for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water is indeed determined by the location of the co-catalyst on the titania surface, e.g. on the different polymorphs present (anatase vs. rutile) [73] and on the specific sites (facets, corners and edges) of a given polymorph [32], and more generally by such surface coverage. This should be taken into account when optimizing the design of gold (or other metal)-containing titania photocatalysts for splitting water with solar light. In this regard, a Au/TiO2 photocatalyst might be best described by the density of Au NP within the composite, in addition to the gold loading and Au NP size. Correlation between Au NP size and photocatalytic activity is still unclear [74–77], which so far makes the absolute determination of the Au NP size less relevant than for studies of so-called structure-sensitive reactions, such as Au-catalyzed CO oxidation [55]. For example, Au/TiO2-P25 nanocomposites containing 4nm Au NP (prepared by sonication-assisted NaBH4 reduction of HAuCl4 [44,45]) produce, under similar conditions, only slightly higher hydrogen amounts than the solid grinding-derived nanocomposites containing 23nm Au NP, despite the much larger metallic surface available. Hydrogen production rates of 690 and 890μmolh−1 g−1 are indeed found for the former series (with 0.3% and 0.5% Au loading respectively), instead of 320 and 500μmolh−1 g−1 for the latter (with 0.3% and 0.5% Au loading respectively, Fig. 7). However, the gold loading appears much more relevant. Composites containing similarly sized Au NP have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different H2 production turnovers [23]. The Au loadings in the two photocatalysts in question however differ by a five fold. Hence the more loaded and less active photocatalyst contains 5 times more Au NP. Hence, the interparticle distance, which is known to play a role in the charge carrier mobility (and also in Surface Plasmon Resonance properties, if any), is significantly reduced. If indeed Au NP act as recombination centers, the probability for charge recombination subsequently increases in the more loaded composite. The activity normalized by the amount of gold within the sample thus likely decreases because charge recombination becomes limiting over promotion of the H+ reduction step. Similarly, in the present study, increasing the loading of our photocatalysts has resulted in increasing the density of Au NP at the limited TiO2 surface available (50m2/g). This increase in Au NP density with increasing loading should be common to all methods of preparation involving a certain extent of size control. The actual Au NP density achieved at a given loading however will depend on the surface area of the titania support. In this regard, it should be mentioned that Au/TiO2 composites based on higher surface area titania (e.g. TiO2-solgel, 117m2 g−1 [44]) display much more stable Au-normalized H2 productions for Au loadings up to 0.3 and even 0.5wt.% (Fig. 11). Only 14% and 25% of the activity of 0.1Au/TiO2-sol-gel is indeed lost by increasing the gold loading to 0.3 and 0.5wt.%, respectively. The significant decrease in Au-normalized H2 production observed over Au/TiO2-P25 for the 0.3wt.% Au loading (−63%, Fig. 11) occurs only for the 1.0wt.% loading in the Au/TiO2-sol-gel series (−80%) and is concomitant with the decrease in the overall hydrogen production [44]. Such type of trend has also been observed by increasing the amount of catalyst in Au-catalyzed radical reactions [78], in which Au NP catalyze both the propagation and the termination step (radical recombination). Hence, more productive gold may be accommodated on the higher surface area titania, which makes calculations of the respective Au NP densities for the both Au/TiO2-P25[air] and Au/TiO2-sol-gel composite series quite relevant. By considering (1) a typical cubo-octahedral shape of Au NP, (2) an average value of 23nm for Au NP diameter (based on TEM and XRD characterization) and (3) the P25 surface area (which is a good approximation of the measured surface of the air-treated Au/TiO2-P25 composites, see Section 3.1), densities of 0.17, 0.50, 0.84, 1.68, 3.37, 8.42 AuNP/μm2 may be calculated for the 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 Au/TiO2-P25[air] composites. Similar calculations applied to sol-gel titania-based composites (Au NP 30nm, TiO2-sol-gel 117m2/g [44]) give densities of 0.03, 0.10, 0.16, 0.33 Au NP/μm2 for 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 Au/TiO2-sol-gel[200] [44], respectively. The Au NP density threshold, i.e. the maximum Au NP density ensuring the highest Au-normalized H2 productions over solid grinding-derived Au/TiO2 composites, is thus interestingly similar for both the Au/TiO2-P25 and the Au/TiO2-sol-gel series, i.e. 0.17 and 0.16 AuNP/μm2, respectively. This purely theoretical average value of optimal density appears to be quite low. It is reminiscent of the optimal loadings for metal-catalyzed processes involving reverse spillover phenomena which are rate-determining [79]. Hence, it may be argued that the diffusion/migration towards Au NP of hydrogen atoms resulting from the reduction of H+ to H on TiO2 [49,57] could be the limiting step of the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water/methanol mixtures under solar light (Fig. 12 ). Recent calculations indeed show that, at low hydrogen coverage, the presence of metal nanoparticles on a hydroxylated surface, such as TiO2 [80], promotes the reverse spillover of hydrogen atoms, i.e. their migration from the support to the metal nanoparticle [81]."
13,Conclusion,"Photocatalytically active Au/TiO2-P25 composites are successfully and straight-forwardly prepared from mechanical mixtures of AuPPh3Cl and titania P25. Their activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production from water-rich water-methanol mixtures using artificial solar light depends on the atmosphere of the thermal treatment applied to reduce gold within the composite. Air appears as a much more suitable activation atmosphere than hydrogen, due to the more efficient degradation of the gold complex and, consequently, a potentially more effective Au/TiO2 interface. On the other hand, the hydrogen-treated composites suffer from the presence of a large amount of heteroatoms and organic deposits which may (1) mask part of the co-catalyst (Au NP) surface, (2) disrupt the interface between the co-catalyst and the photocatalyst (titania) and (3) act as surface recombination centers for photoinduced electrons and holes. In addition, one may not exclude the formation of oxygen vacancies and associated Ti3+ species generated by the possible local reduction of the Au-TiO2 interface, as already observed in the literature. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the suitability of the solid grinding method, and of the AuPPh3Cl gold complex, for the synthesis of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, with major advantages over solution-based strategies, in terms of time and reagents efficiency. In particular, 0.5Au/TiO2-P25[air] appears as the most active photocatalyst of the study, which represents a significant gain in terms of noble metal utilization compared to the 2wt.% Au/TiO2 benchmarks. Finally, this work draws some guidelines for the design of more efficient Au/TiO2 solar light photocatalysts for the water splitting reaction, highlighting the importance of the density of Au NP over titania. Further improvement of the present systems may readily be expected from further deprotection of the Au NP co-catalyst and further clearance of the Au-TiO2 interface, i.e. by increasing the calcination temperature and completing degradation of the AuPPh3Cl gold (I) complex."
