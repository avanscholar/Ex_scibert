0,Introduction,"In view of the gradual increase of fossil fuel consumption and environmental pollution, the development of sustainable and clean energy derived from lignocellulosic biomass becomes more and more important [1,2]. Levulinic acid (LA), one of the top 12 potential bio-based platform chemicals, can be produced from the dehydration of hexose in acidic aqueous solution or the hydrolysis/alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol (FA) derived from the hydrogenation of pentose [3,4]. Because of the reaction activity of unsaturated acetyl group (CH3CO‒) and carboxyl group (−COOH) in the molecular structure, LA can be directly converted into γ-valerolactone (GVL) and levulinate esters (LE) through hydrogenation and esterification reaction, respectively [3,5–9]. Furthermore, LA and LE including methyl levulinate (ML) [10,11], ethyl levulinate (EL) [10,12,13] and butyl levulinate (BL) [14,15] have been widely applied to produce 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) [16], 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) [17–19], valeric esters [20], valeric acid [21], etc. via the GVL intermediate [22–25]. Therefore, LA and LE play an important role in connecting renewable lignocellulosic biomass with biofuels and biochemical. Generally speaking, the cascade reaction involving in the transformation of LA and LE to GVL is regarded as a typical bifunctional catalytic process, that the metal-catalyzed hydrogenation step and the acid-catalyzed dehydration (or dealcoholization) and lactonization step [26–28]. At present, five categories of acid supports have been reported, including oxides (ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2 etc.), molecular sieves (ZrMCM-41, SnO2/SBA-15, H-β, HZSM-5, H-MFI, etc.), Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives (UiO-66-SO3H, zirconium-cyanuric acid coordination polymer (Zr-CA), MIL-101(Cr), MOF derived carbon, etc.), Acid functionalized carbons (ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), benzenesulfonic acid-functionalized reduced grapheme oxide (rCO)) and Acidic resins (DOWEX 50WX2-100, sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) resin, Amberlyst-70, etc.) [28–32]. The acidity type (Lewis and Brønsted acidity) and intensity of these supports have a large effect on the catalytic activity and GVL selectivity. In order to reduce the catalyst cost and operability, metallic oxides are regarded as much promising catalyst support for industrial application. However, compared to the SnO2/SBA-15 which has both Lewis (L) and Brønsted (B) acidity, the transition metal oxides, specifically, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SnO2, which only exhibited Lewis acidity was not suitable to improve the GVL yield [29]. Therefore, the oxide support with lower cost, higher accessibility and more importantly, suitable Lewis/Brønsted ratio is the basics for developing bifunctional catalysts. In recent years, Palygorskite (PAL, or Attapulgite as it often called), with a theoretical formula of Mg5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4·4H2O and fibrous structure, has been widely applied in heterogeneous catalysis as a catalyst or catalyst support [33–39]. PAL can be effectively modified to own higher surface area and pore volume through acid activation. The surface acidity can also be adjusted to obtain coexisting Brønsted and Lewis acidity sites which are generated from the structural hydroxyl groups in the layer structure of PAL and exposed Al3+, respectively [40]. Accordingly, the acid-activated PAL has been applied in different acid-catalyzed fields [37,39,41,42]. Except for the specific textures and surface acidity of PAL, the intrinsic SiO2 and Al2O3 contribute to adjust the interactions between metals and support, thus improving the dispersion of active metals and enhancing the catalytic activity. In our previous work, the acid-activated PAL (H+-PAL) supported NiCoB amorphous alloy catalysts showed excellent hydrogenation activity and stability for furfural (FUR) conversion into furfuryl alcohol (FA) [43]. The best catalyst (20%NiCoB/H+-PAL) showed an increase of 3.9 % in FUR conversion and 8.2 % in FA selectivity after six cycles due to the newly generated CoNi alloy active site. But as far as we know, the acid-activated PAL has not been applied in BL hydrogenation. In addition to the acidity of catalyst support, the metal loads, particle sizes as well as the dispersion of hydrogenation active metal are also very important control parameters in order to obtain a higher GVL yield. The precious metals, such as Ru, Rh, Pt, Ir, Au-Pd, etc. have displayed superior catalytic activity in FUR and BL hydrogenation reaction [44–47]. As a popular substitute for precious metals, the Ni-based, Cu-based or Ni-Cu-based catalysts have been extensively used due to low cost and high availability [48–59]. A hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlcs) derived Cu-based catalyst achieved high GVL yield of 91 % from LA at 200 °C under 7.0 MPa H2 after 10 h [60]. Another magnetic and recyclable Ni4.59Cu1Mg1.58Al1.96Fe0.70 catalyst with HTlcs structure could yield 98.1 % of GVL from LA through the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction using methanol as the H-donor at 142 °C after 3 h [61]. Furthermore, some oxides were also applied to support active metals to improve the catalyst activity and stability. The Al2O3 supported bimetallic Cu-Ni catalyst (10Cu-5Ni/Al2O3) had the highest activity for CTH of EL to GVL, providing a 97 % yield of GVL in 12 h at 150 °C [10], and another 10Cu-10Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed a higher 2-methylfuran yield of 92 % from the CTH reaction of FUR with formic acid as a hydrogen donor [48]. The ZrO2-Al2O3 composite supported Cu catalyst, which possesses ternary active sites (metal active sites Cu°, oxygen deficiencies derived from ZrO2, and acidic Al2O3), displayed superior catalytic activity and excellent recycling stability for GVL synthesis from LA at low temperature due to the intimate synergies of these ternary active sites [62]. In a word, the bifunctional Ni-Cu-based catalysts including an acid support is a promising candidate for the cascade conversion reaction of LA and LE. In our previous work, in order to reduce the catalyst usage and reaction time, a highly active, low-cost and magnetic CuNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst was applied for BL hydrogenation to GVL [15]. The best catalyst Cu0.5Ni1Co3B (3 wt% relative to BL) showed the highest GVL yield of 89.5 % with BL conversion of 99.7 % at 200 °C under 3.0 MPa. Nevertheless, there still exist some drawbacks of the previous catalyst such as harsh reaction conditions, low catalyst stability and partial loss of B species due to the lower surface area of Cu0.5Ni1Co3B amorphous alloy. The successful solution of these disadvantages of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst will provide a high-efficiency and environmental friendly catalyst for industrial application in lignocellulosic biomass conversion. Therefore, the CuNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst was strongly expected to be loaded on a support with high surface area and suitable acidity to further improve the reaction efficiency of BL hydrogenation to GVL. Herein, Cu modified Ni1Co1B amorphous alloy catalysts with different Cu addition content were firstly prepared by chemical reduction method and evaluated through BL hydrogenation reaction to obtain the optimal CuNiCoB hydrogenation active site. H+-PAL was applied to load CuNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst to enhance the activity and stability. Moreover, several third metals promoted H+-PAL supported CuNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst were also prepared, characterized and tested for the BL hydrogenation reaction. The influences of the reaction conditions, the stability and recyclability of the catalysts were investigated."

The H+-PAL was prepared according to the previous procedure with the acid concentration of 21 wt% [63]. All reagents were used without any further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Ni1Co1B amorphous alloy catalyst with Ni/Co molar ratio of 1/1, CuB catalyst and Cu modified Ni1Co1B catalyst with Cu/Ni molar ratio of x/1 (denoted as CuxNi1Co1B) were prepared by the chemical reduction method [64]. The following study results showed that Cu0.5Ni1Co1B is the optimized Cu0.5Ni1Co1B hydrogenation active site. The H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst with a loading content of 20 wt% (named as Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL) was prepared by the impregnation-reduction method. Typically, 10 g H+-PAL powder (>100 mesh) was equivalent-volume impregnated with an aqueous solution of 1.43 g CuCl2·2H2O, 3.98 g NiCl2·6H2O and 3.98 g CoCl2·6H2O under vacuum for 24 h at room temperature. It was then dried at 120 °C for 1 h, and then dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The obtained precursor powder (>100 mesh) was reduced by dropwise adding 77.3 mL 2.0 M NaBH4 aqueous solution containing 0.2 M NaOH with vigorous stirring in an ice-water bath under consecutive nitrogen flow. After stirring for 3.0 h, the resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water several times until neutral, followed by washing with absolute ethyl alcohol three times to remove the residual water and water-soluble impurities. Finally, the obtained catalyst was kept in absolute ethyl alcohol for future use. Those different metal (M = Mo, La, Zn, Fe, Ce and Zr) promoted Cu0.5NiCoB/H+-PAL catalysts (named as Cu0.25M0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL) with Cu/M/Ni/Co molar ratio of 0.25/0.25/1/1 and loading content of 20 wt% were also prepared according to the above procedure by dissolving their metal salt together with chloride of Cu, Ni and Co."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The ASIQMO002-2 analyzer (Quantachrome, US) was used to determine the surface area (SBET), total pore volume (Vp), and average pore diameter (Dp) of the catalysts by adsorption and desorption of nitrogen at −196 °C. Before performing the measurement, the samples were degassed at 80 °C for 6 h to remove impurities. The D/max-RA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) was applied to detect the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts using Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA on a 2θ range of 5–80 °. The Hitachi S-4800 high resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the morphology of catalysts at 2.0 kV and 10 μA. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of catalysts were performed on a Model JEM-2100 F microscope (JEOL, Japan) [43]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, US) with the monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486 eV) X-ray resource to determine the surface atomic ratios and valence states of elements of the catalysts. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C 1s spectrum (BE of 284.6 eV) [65]. Hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) and Ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) of catalysts was carried out on a DAS-7000 multifunctional dynamic adsorption instrument (Hunan Huasi Instrument Co. Ltd., China) from 50 to 800 °C. The desorbed hydrogen and ammonia was recorded by a thermal conduct detector (TCD). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of pyridine adsorption technique was performed on a TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, US). The sample (6～15 mg) circle sheet was prepared by tableting at pressure of 15 MPa. Before adsorption, the samples were heated at 350 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove water adsorbed on the surface, and then cooled to 100 °C. Afterwards, the samples were exposed to 1 mL of liquid pyridine for 15 min. The IR spectra were recorded at 100 °C after evacuation for 15 min."
5,Catalytic tests and product analysis,"2.4 Catalytic tests and product analysis The BL hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a 100 mL YZPR-100 (M) stainless steel autoclave equipped with an electrical heating jacket and a mechanical stirrer. Before reaction, the catalyst was dried at room temperature under vacuum for 1 h, and then levigated and sieved to > 100 mesh. In a typical catalytic test, BL (1 mL, 0.974 g, 5.66 mmol), catalyst powder (0.0292 g Cu0.5Ni1Co1B or 0.1461 g Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL) and cyclohexane (24 mL) were added into the reactor and uniformly mixed. After removing the air in the reactor by repetitively filling N2 four times and H2 three times, the reactor was filled with an initial hydrogen pressure of 3.0 MPa and was heated to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. After reaction for 3 h under a stirring rate of 800 rpm, the product and catalyst were seperated by a magnet. The spent catalyst was washed by cyclohexane for three times and absolute ethyl alcohol for three times, subsequently was stored in absolute ethyl alcohol for next use. The liquid products were qualitatively analyzed by a TRACE 1300-ISQ gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, US) equipped with an Agilent HP-5 MS column (5% phenyl methyl silox, 30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm). Helium (99.999 %) was used as the carrier gas. The column temperature was programmed from 50 °C to 250 °C at 10 °C/min and held for 10 min. The chemical compositions were identified through a mass spectral library (NIST 2014). The quantitative analysis of liquid product was carried out on a GC 9900 gas chromatograph (Jiafen, Beijing in China; Column: FFAP, 30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The analysis conditions were as follows: N2 flow (30 mL/min) as a carrier gas, injector temperature 230 °C, detector temperature 250 °C, and oven temperature programmed from 70 to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated in accordance with Deng et al.[12]. The turnover frequency (TOF) of BL hydrogenation to GVL was calculated according to the Eq. (1) as reported in our previous work [43]: (1) TOF= n × C ×6.02× 10 23 × S N × t Here n is the molar amount of BL used in the reaction feedstock, C the BL conversion, S the selectivity to GVL, N the number of surface Cu, Mo, Ni and Co atoms, t the reaction time, and 6.02 × 1023 the Avogadro’s number. The unit of TOF is per hour (h−1). N was calculated by the Eq. (2) [66]: (2) N = S M s with S M = 6 ρ × d M , here SM is the surface area of Cu(M)NiCoB alloy, ρ the density of Cu(M)NiCoB alloy, dM the statistical particle size of Cu(M)NiCoB alloy obtained from HRTEM, s the surface area of 6.5 × 10−20 m2 single Ni [67] or Co atom [68], 6.8 × 10−20 m2 single Cu atom [69] and 5.8 × 10−20 m2 single Mo atom calculated by the Mo atomic radius."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogenation active site screening,"3.1 Hydrogenation active site screening The screening of the hydrogenation active site for the conversion of BL to GVL is vitally important for developing the (metal/solid acid) bifunctional catalysts. Cyclohexane (CH), which has some advantages including well BL solubility, low cost and toxicity, was used as the reaction solvent for BL hydrogenation and determined as the optimum solvent in the following section. When Ni1Co1B catalyst was applied to BL hydrogenation reaction, a lower BL conversion of 40.8 % but a higher GVL selectivity of 86.4 % was obtained (Table 1 , entry 1). NiCoB amorphous alloy catalysts are high-effective for the hydrogenation conversion of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [64,70,71]. The isolated Co-B active sites showed better hydrogenation activity of the CO bond on the carbonyl group of the furfural molecule than the isolated Ni-B active sites which have been proved in our previous study [64], in contrast, the isolated Ni-B active sites showed higher activity of the CC bond on the furan ring. In the BL molecule, the ester group (R − COO − R´) owns high steric hindrance and weak polarity which lead to more difficult conversion of ester group than aldehyde (−CHO) and ketone (R − CO − R) groups [15]. This is the cause for lower BL conversion over Ni1Co1B catalyst. Compared to Ni1Co1B catalyst, the BL conversion and GVL selectivity showed a decrease by 12.9 % and 6.3 % over Cu0.1Ni1Co1B catalyst, respectively (Table 1, entry 2). With the increase of Cu content in CuxNi1Co1B catalysts, the highest BL conversion of 72.1 % was obtained over the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst (Table 1, entry 4), indicating that the incorporation of suitable Cu into NiCoB amorphous alloy evidently promoted the conversion of BL. However, when the Cu content increased to Cu/Ni/Co ratio of 2/1/1, a little GVL yield of 15.2 % was showed at BL conversion of 21.2 % (Table 1, entry 6). For the CuB catalyst, the BL only achieved 2.7 % conversion but the highest GVL selectivity of 99.5 % was achieved, which confirmed that the concomitant crystalline Cu and Cu2O in the CuB catalyst (Fig. S1, Supporting Information) is beneficial to produce GVL. According to the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. S2A, Supporting Information), the textural properties of these CuxNi1Co1B catalysts and CuB catalyst were obtained (Table S1, Supporting Information). The introduction of Cu into NiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst increased the SBET and VP, implying that the amorphous alloy structure of NiCoB catalyst was affected by the generation of metallic Cu phase with an increasing particle size (Table S1, Supporting Information) in these CuxNi1Co1B catalysts as shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, observing the pore size distribution (PSD) curves of these CuxNiCoB and CuB catalysts (Fig. S2B, Supporting Information), more mesopores at 3.8 nm and 10∼100 nm were generated in these CuxNiCoB catalysts with the increase of Cu content. However, there is hardly mesopores at 3.8 nm in the CuB catalyst which has the maximum mesopores at 10∼100 nm. Therefore, the crystal structure and textural properties of CuxNi1Co1B catalyst are important factors for improving BL hydrogenation performances. For the optimum catalyst Cu0.5Ni1Co1B, the CuNiCoB amorphous alloy hydrogenation active site generated from well-dispersed Cu doped Ni1Co1B amorphous alloy has more plane defect (Fig. S3, Supporting Information), which promoted the transformation of reaction intermediate to GVL, thus playing decisive role on adjusting the formation of GVL."
8,Metal/solid acid bifunctional catalysts screening,"3.2 Metal/solid acid bifunctional catalysts screening In order to further improve the BL hydrogenation activity of the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst, H+-PAL was used as a carrier to load and disperse it, and different metals were introduced to adjust the selectivity of BL hydrogenation products. As shown in Table 2 , the BL conversion over all H+-PAL supported catalysts increased obviously. The TOF for GVL formation over Cu0.5Ni1Co1B, Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalysts was also calculated in Table 2. It’s evident that the TOF was improved. Since there is no new active phase in these catalysts except for different peak intensity of metallic Cu (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), this can be ascribed to the improvement of the dispersion of Cu(M)NiCoB active site [22,43]. However, the GVL selectivity shows different extent of decrease over those H+-PAL supported catalysts due to further transformation of GVL into n-Pentyl alcohol (n-PeOH) and 1,4-PDO (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). The Cu0.25Fe0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst showed the highest n-PeOH selectivity of 3.9 %. n-PeOH can be produced from the dehydration and over-hydrogenation of 1,4-PDO, which has been reported in a SBA-15 supported Cu-Fe catalyst due to the formation CuFeO2 Lewis acid site [12]. The Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst showed the highest 1,4-PDO selectivity of 2.7 %. 1,4-PDO is an important monomer for producing biodegradable polyesters and a raw material for the synthesis of many other chemicals and fuels [12]. In a Mo-modified Ru/Activated Carbon catalyst, LA was converted into 1,4-PDO with a high yield of 96.7 mol% due to the outstanding hydrogenation ability of Mo on the CO bond in either carbonyl or carboxyl group [16]. Therefore, the interaction between H+-PAL and Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy is beneficial for improving the dispersion of Cu(Mo)NiCoB active site, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and their synergistic effect for adjusting the BL hydrogenation products distribution. The Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst was chose to optimize the BL hydrogenation reaction conditions and catalytic performances."
9,Effect of reaction solvent on BL hydrogenation,"3.3 Effect of reaction solvent on BL hydrogenation The effect of reaction solvent on BL conversion over Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst was investigated. As shown in Table 3 , when using methanol as solvent, the lowest BL conversion of 37.6 % was obtained with a higher GVL selectivity of 96.4 %. Ethanol and n-propanol achieved the obvious increase of BL conversion to 95.0 % and 88.9 %, respectively, but brought the decrease of GVL selectivity to 82.7 % and 63.0 %. Therefore, the lower alcohols are not suitable for the BL hydrogenation reaction due to the strong polarity. In pure water, 80.5 % conversion of BL and a low yield of GVL of 44.8 % were obtained, which increased to 95.5 and 65.5 % in 50 vol% cyclohexane/water biphasic solvent and reached the highest GVL yield of 96.3 % in pure cyclohexane. Similarly, GVL yield of 85.4 and 88.4 % are obtained in the n-hexane and 1, 4-dioxane solvent, respectively. The difference of GVL yield can be ascribed to the different concentration of H2 dissolved in the solvent. In addition, the usage of alkanes also promoted the formation of 1,4-PDO. The stronger adsorption of oxygen-containing groups of BL and the promotion of hydrogen activation on H+-PAL support in alkane solvents are crucial factors for the highest GVL yield obtained in cyclohexane solvent [12]."
10,Characterization of the samples,"3.4 Characterization of the samples In order to clarify the structure-catalytic properties relationship of the H+-PAL supported Cu(M)NiCoB catalysts, N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, H2-TPD, NH3-TPD and Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectra of pyridine adsorption were applied to detect them. From the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms as shown in Fig. 1 (A), H+-PAL has the largest hysteresis loop which generated from the capillary condensation of liquid nitrogen in mesopores/macropores. The Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst showed the smallest hysteresis loop due to the flake structure of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy. By contrast, the H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts showed an obvious increase in N2 adsorption, indicating they have much higher BET surface area and pore volume (Table S1, Supporting Information). From the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution patterns in Fig. 1(B), the mesopores/macropores are concomitant in H+-PAL and Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst, of which one class is located at ～3.8 nm and the other is centered at ～17.3 nm and ～56.9 nm, respectively. This is why the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst showed a higher average pore size but a sharply lower total pore volume than H+-PAL (Table S1, Supporting Information). Compared to the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst, the H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts showed more mesopores/macropores which is beneficial for the adsorption of BL molecule. XRD patterns of H+-PAL, Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst and H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts are shown in Fig. 1(C). H+-PAL shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of Palygorskite (JCPDS No. 31-0783) and Quartz (JCPDS No. 46-1045) [33]. The Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst exhibits two broad peaks at 2θ ≈ 25° and 45° which are attributed to the amorphous boron oxides and typical amorphous alloy structure, respectively [64]. A sharp peak at 43.4° assigned to metallic Cu (Cu°) (JCPDS No. 04-0836) is displayed, implying that partial of Cu precursor was reduced to metallic Cu. H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts showed similar XRD patterns where the broad peak of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy is not evident due to high dispersion. From the calculated crystalline size of metallic Cu by Scherer equation (Table S1, Supporting Information), the dispersion of metallic Cu and CuNiCoB amorphous alloy was improved by introducing Mo. The FE-SEM observation as shown in Fig. 1(D) provided further evidence. The agglomeration of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy nanosheets with fuzzier boundary can be observed on the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst. After loading on H+-PAL, the dispersion of Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy is effectively improved due to the enhanced interaction between H+-PAL and Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy [72], especially for the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst. The above results demonstrated the Mo doping effect as a structural promoter on reducing particle size and increasing metal dispersion. To further investigate the effect of H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts on the chemical state of metal species, XPS analysis was carried out as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Co 2p and B 1 s. For Ni 2p, the peaks at binding energy (BE) of 856.0 ± 0.2 and 873.7 ± 0.3 eV are assigned to oxidized nickle (Ni2+) in Ni2+2p3/2/ Ni2+2p1/2 level, accompanying with two satellite peaks around 861.8 ± 0.2 and 879.8 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Another group of weak peaks at BE of 853.2 ± 0.2 eV is assigned to metallic nickle (Ni°) in Ni°2p3/2 level [73]. For Co 2p, the oxidized cobalt (Co2+) in Co2+2p3/2/Co2+2p1/2 level are observed corresponding to the BE of 781.2 ± 0.2 and 797.1 ± 0.4 eV, respectively, accompanying with their satellite peaks [15]. Meanwhile, the weak peaks at BE of 778.0 ± 0.2 eV are ascribed to metallic cobalt (Co°) in Co°2p3/2 level [74]. In addition, the peaks around 188.4 ± 0.6 and 192.2 ± 0.3 eV are ascribed to the elemental boron (Be) and the oxidized boron (Bo), respectively [73]. The BE of Be over the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst shifted positively by 1.2 eV in comparison with the standard BE of the pure B (187.1 eV), indicating the transferring of partial electrons from B to Cu, Ni and Co in the CuNiCoB amorphous alloy which can promote the formation of electron-enriched Cu, Ni and Co but electron-deficient B [75]. Notably, the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst showed higher surface concentration but lower BE value of Ni, Co and B than H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts. This is a cue for the improvement of the dispersion of Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy on H+-PAL that have been verified by XRD and SEM characterization (Fig. 1). Cu 2p spectra and Cu LMM Auger spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . In Cu 2p spectra, two groups of peaks at BE of 932.0 ± 0.3 and 953.0 ± 0.4 eV are corresponded to Cu°/Cu+2p3/2 and Cu°/Cu+2p1/2 [10], respectively, which can be further identified from the Auger spectra where the unsupported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst showed the highest surface concentration of Cu° while H+-PAL supported Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalyst owned the highest surface concentration of Cu+. Meanwhile, the introduction of Mo did not obviously change the BE of Ni 2p and Co 2p but lead to the BE decrease of Cu°/Cu+, indicating the electron transferring between Cu and Ni1Co1B was suppressed. Therefore, Mo also acted as an electronic promoter that promoting the formation and increasing the fraction of Cu+ species. In order to reveal the catalytic hydrogenation active sites, H2-TPD of Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts was performed, as shown in Fig. 4(A). A broad H2 desorption peak at 329 °C companying with a weak shoulder peak at 184 °C appeared on the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst, which is assigned to the CuNiCoB amorphous alloy and surface Cu0/Cu+ hydrogenation active sites, respectively. H+-PAL supported Cu(Mo)NiCoB catalysts showed more H2 adsorption sites and much higher H2 desorption concentration. Consequently, H2 could be more easily adsorbed over H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts during the process of BL hydrogenation, thus increasing the BL conversion (Table 2). Because of higher dispersion of CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy and Cu0/Cu+ species as determined by XRD, SEM and XPS characterizations, the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst displayed higher H2 adsorption ability which enhanced the further hydrogenation conversion of GVL to generate n-PeOH and 1,4-PDO (Table 2). The NH3-TPD spectra of Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst and H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 (B). The desorbed NH3 molecules at higher temperatures (≥ 150 °C) were attributed to acid site-bound NH3. A weak and broad NH3-TPD peak at 50−200 °C accompanying with a higher peak at 349 °C are observed over the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst, indicating the presence of some weakly acid sites derived from the nano-scale copper particles which catalyze BL conversion into GVL (Table 2). For H+-PAL supported catalysts, a group of higher abundance of weakly desorption peaks at about 100 and 208 °C are attributed to the physically adsorbed and hydrogen-bound NH3 by H+-PAL and the Lewis acid site derived from the exposed Al3+ in the layer structure of H+-PAL, respectively [76,77]. Another group of intermediate desorption peaks at 300−500 °C is assigned to the nano-scale copper particles and the Bronsted (B) acid site generated from the structural hydroxyl group in the layer structure of H+-PAL. Therefore, the enhancement in the acidity of H+-PAL supported catalysts is due to the additional acid sites provided by H+-PAL support, thus providing the acid sites for the further conversion of GVL (Table 2). The FTIR spectra of pyridine desorption of H+-PAL, Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 (the inset reflects the assigned acid amount). The characteristic band at 1447 cm−1 on the curve of H+-PAL was attributed to Lewis acid sites. The weak band appearing at 1547 cm−1 was corresponded to the adsorption of pyridine on the Brønsted acid sites. The medium-strength band at 1491 cm-1 was associated with both types of acid sites [12]. Another band appeared at 1597 cm-1 which was related to the desorption of hydrogen-bonded pyridine [12]. Since the H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts was black, just almost half weight of H+-PAL was used when preparing the catalyst circle sheet by high pressure of 15 MPa to transmit infrared light. As a result, the adsorption of pyridine molecule by the structural hydroxyl group of H+-PAL was limited. Furthermore, the secondary activation of H+-PAL during the chemical reduction process of H+-PAL supported catalysts by BH4 − might lead to the decrease of structural hydroxyl [43]. Consequently, the B acid sites did not be detected on the H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts. However, the concentration of L acid sites increased from 0.0394 mmol/g to 0.0706 and 0.1002 mmol/g, respectively. It can be concluded that the loading and high dispersion of Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy promoted the increase of L acid sites concentration. The higher concentration of L acid sites in Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst derived from the doping effect of Mo is beneficial for improving catalytic activity [29]."
11,BL hydrogenation reaction conditions optimization,"3.5 BL hydrogenation reaction conditions optimization The catalyst dosage and reaction temperature have a large effect on reaction rate. Thus, the BL hydrogenation reaction conditions optimization over the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst was carried out at different catalyst loading (the mass of CuMoNiCoB active site of catalyst divided by the mass of BL, ranging from 1 to 10 wt%) (Fig. 6 a) and different reaction temperature (ranging from 120 to 240 °C) (Fig. 6b). With the increase of catalyst loading from 1 to 3 wt%, the BL conversion increased significantly in the range of 74.5–94.7%, and then showed gradually increase to the maxima of 100 % when the catalyst loading reaches to 7 wt%. The increase of catalyst loading leaded to the gradual decrease of GVL selectivity ranging from 83.9–53.2%, on the contrary, the selectivity for n-PeOH and 1,4-PDO showed gradually increase to 2% and 5.9 %, respectively [78]. From the above results, it was evident that the synthetic effect between CuMoNiCoB hydrogenation site and L/B acid sites promoted BL conversion and GVL hydrogenation to n-PeOH and 1,4-PDO. The effect of reaction temperature on BL hydrogenation performances at the catalyst loading of 3 wt% is shown in Fig. 6b. When the reaction was conducted at a lower temperature (120 °C), only 7.3 % conversion of BL with a GVL selectivity of 64.5 % was achieved. The BL conversion obviously increased to 94.2 % when the reaction temperature increased to 140 °C and reached to 100 % at 220 °C. With the increase of reaction temperature, the selectivity of GVL and 1,4-PDO increased until the maxima of 78.1 % and 3.3 % was obtained at 200 °C, respectively. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 240 °C led to the decrease of the selectivity of GVL and 1,4-PDO to 50 % and 0.3 %, respectively. The selectivity of n-PeOH continuously increased from 0.7 to 6.4 %. GVL can be hydrogenated to produce 1,4-PDO which can be further transformed into dehydrated and over-hydrogenated byproducts n-PeOH [12,18]. Therefore, increasing reaction temperature promoted the cascade conversion of BL to n-PeOH [12]. The optimum reaction temperature for BL hydrogenation to GVL over H+-PAL supported Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalyst is 200 °C. The effect of reaction time on BL hydrogenation performances over Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts were investigated as shown in Fig. 7 . All catalysts achieved quick conversion of BL because of outstanding hydrogenation activity of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy. After reaction for 0.5 h, the BL conversion is 94.2 %, 96 % and 99.8 %, respectively. Prolonging the reaction time achieved the entire conversion of BL in only 1 h over the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst. The GVL selectivity increased firstly and reached the maxima of 74.3 and 80.8 % over H+-PAL supported catalysts, respectively. However, further increasing the reaction time leaded to the obvious decrease of GVL selectivity but promoted the selectivity of 1,4-PDO and n-PeOH, which was correlated to that GVL could be further hydrogenated to 1,4-PDO and n-PeOH as mentioned above. These results indicated that the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst is an efficient metal/acid bifunctional catalyst for one-pot catalytic conversion of BL to 1,4-PDO through the GVL intermediate under suitable reaction conditions. In order to figure out the composition, morphology and structure changes of the catalyst during the hydrogenation reaction, the used H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts after reaction for 6 h were collected and characterized. As shown in Fig. 8 , the uniformly-dispersed spherical particles were observed on the HRTEM images of the fresh H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts. The bright dots over the diffraction loop on the inserted SAED image indicated the formation of single crystal which is assigned to metallic Cu companying with CuNiCoB amorphous alloy (Fig. 1C). After reaction, some agglomeration appeared on the surface of H+-PAL rod crystal over the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst. Though the concentration of B element showed a decrease (Table S2, Supporting Information), the diffraction loop of CuNiCoB amorphous alloy still can be observed due to the strong interaction between CuNiCoB hydrogenation active site and H+-PAL support. Since the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst owned higher dispersion of CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy as shown in XRD, SEM and XPS results (Figs. 1–3), the morphology did not show negative agglomeration. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 9 ) of fresh and used H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts, carbon deposition was generated on the used Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst, which is not beneficial for maintaining the catalytic stability.[29] Because of the higher ratio of Lewis/Brønsted acid site of the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst (Fig. 5), the formation of carbon deposition was effectively avoided. In addition, the XRD peak intensity of metallic Cu of used catalysts showed an increase than fresh catalysts, implying more metallic Cu was generated. XPS detection of the fresh and used H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts were also conducted (Fig. 10 ). The characteristic peaks intensity of Ni2+ and Co2+ species for the used Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst was similar with that of fresh catalyst, but the BE slightly shifted to lower values. However, for the used Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst, the peaks intensity and BE of Ni2+ and Co2+ species obviously declined. For Cu 2p spectra, the characteristic peaks intensity of Cu+/Cu° showed evident increase. This is a cue for the in-situ reduction of Cu2+ into Cu+/Cu° in the external H2 during the liquid-phase BL hydrogenation process [79], thus affecting the interaction between H+-PAL and Cu(Mo)NiCoB amorphous alloy site. According to the ICP results of the fresh and used catalysts including Cu0.5Ni1Co1B, Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL (Table S2, Supporting Information), the leaching of Cu was effectively improved by the loading of Cu(M)NiCoB amorphous alloy on H+-PAL, especially for the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst which did not bring a change for the total content of CuMoNiCoB bulk composition. This is a successful solution for the loss of B species in the previous unsupported Cu0.5Ni1Co3B catalyst [15]. Due to the doping effect of Mo, the interaction between Cu hydrogenation active species and H+-PAL support and higher ratio of Lewis/Brønsted acid site, the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst displayed prominent catalytic activity and stability for the sequential reaction of hydrogenation saturation of CO bond in acetyl group, dealcoholization and lactonization of BL molecule to form GVL."
12,Reaction pathway,"3.6 Reaction pathway Based on the discussion mentioned above and previous research [21,79], a plausible reaction pathway for the BL hydrogenation over the bifunctional Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst was proposed (Fig. 11 ). The BL conversion involves several steps that depend on various factors such as the type and concentration of the acidic sites, the metallic sites available for hydrogenation, the solvent polarity, and the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, time, and catalyst-to-feed ratio) [13,14,21]. In the case of the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst, the carbonyl group of BL is first adsorbed on the acid sites in the H+-PAL support, and then hydrogenated over the CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy and Cu2O/Cu sites to form butyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (BHP) intermediate. Subsequently, BHP rapidly undergoes lactonization to form GVL via dealcoholization over the acid sites. The carbonyl groups of GVL are adsorbed and reduced on the CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy and Cu2O/Cu sites, and the resulting 2-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofuran is further converted to 4-hydroxypentanal (HPN) through ring-opening isomerization [79]. Finally, the carbonyl groups of HPN are hydrogenated to generate 1,4-PDO on the CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy and Cu2O/Cu sites. In addition, 1,4-PDO is dehydrated and hydrogenated to form by-product n-PeOH [17]."
13,Catalyst recycling test,"3.7 Catalyst recycling test The catalyst recycle test for BL hydrogenation over H+-PAL supported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B and Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B catalysts was performed under the following reaction condition: BL 5.66 mmol, CH 24 mL, catalyst 0.146 g, 200 °C, H2 3 MPa, 800 rpm, 3 h. After each run, the used catalyst was effectively separated from the mixed solution by a magnet (Fig. S6, Supporting Information), washed with absolute ethyl alcohol and then applied in the next run. As can be seen from Fig. 12 , the BL conversion is all above 98 % in five cycles, especially for the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst which keeps 100 % unchanged. However, the GVL yield showed decrease from 78.9%–64.5% due to some agglomeration of CuNiCoB active site and the formation of carbon deposition (Fig. 9). It is surprisingly that the GVL yield over the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst increased gradually to 95.7 % in the fifth run. In the furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol over our developed H+-PAL supported Ni1Co1B catalyst, the yield of furfuryl alcohol also showed a slight decrease in the first and second run but start to increase after the third run [43]. The specific self-regeneration ability of H+-PAL supported Ni1Co1B catalyst is due to the active site transformation from NiCoB amorphous alloy to Co-Ni alloy with high dispersion. However, the phase transformation of CuMoNiCoB active site did not be observed in the XRD pattern of the used catalyst after reaction for 6 h (Fig. 9). Therefore, the increase of GVL yield over the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst might be due to the synergistic effect of several aspects, that include but not limited to Mo doping effect, higher concentration of L acid sites and suitable metal-support interaction [29]. Comparing the GVL production ability from BL hydrogenation, the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL presented comparable hydrogenation efficiency with other catalysts in short reaction time and low catalyst dosage (Table S3, Supporting Information). Particularly, the more outstanding recyclability were achieved over the Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst than the typical Ru/C catalyst which showed a significant decrease in the activity of recycled Ru/C from 95 % to 83 % after 4th reuse [80]. According to above measurements, magnetic Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst could be an efficient candidate for catalytic conversion of BL into GVL."
14,Conclusions,"In this study, a series of CuxNi1Co1B amorphous alloy catalysts were developed through chemical reduction method to obtain the hydrogenation active site for BL hydrogenation to GVL. The optimal composition was manipulated as Cu0.5Ni1Co1B with moderate textures and more plane defect derived from the concomitant CuNiCoB amorphous alloy and highly-dispersed metallic Cu. Cu species acted as the key active site for improving BL hydrogenation activity. Different metal-doped Cu0.5Ni1Co1B was supported on H+-PAL to further enhance the BL hydrogenation activity. The Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst showed the highest GVL yield of 96.3 % with BL conversion of 99.7 % in the best cyclohexane solvent at 200 °C, 3.0 MPa H2 for 3 h. When Mo was doped into the Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst, the GVL yield showed gradually increase to 95.7 % with BL conversion of 100 % after five times run. The high activity and self-regeneration ability can be attributed to the Mo doping effect and the synthetic effect between Cu hydrogenation active species and H+-PAL support. The doping effect of Mo on the structure and microscopic properties of the catalysts was studied by various characterization methods. The results indicated that Mo can act as a structural promoter to improve the dispersion of metallic Cu and CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy, and can also be used as an electronic modifier to promote the formation and increase the fraction of Cu+ species by restricting the electron transferring. In addition, more Lewis acid sites was generated by Mo doping to enhance the adsorption of carbonyl groups for improving BL conversion and the deep conversion of GVL to form 1,4-PDO and n-PeOH. On the basis of characterization and catalytic performances testing, the synergistic effect between CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy and Cu2O/Cu hydrogenation sites and Lewis/Brønsted acid site of H+-PAL support is crucial factors to produce GVL from BL hydrogenation over self-regenerated Cu0.25Mo0.25Ni1Co1B/H+-PAL catalyst. The low-cost, high-activity, easily magnetic separation, environmental friendly features and the most important point of self-generation character gifted H+-PAL supported CuMoNiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst a potential as promising candidate for producing high value-added chemicals from levulinic compound mediated biomass transformations."
