0,Introduction,"When fossil fuels are burned in coal-fired power plants or automobiles, carbon dioxide and other pollutants are generated. Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes global warming due to the greenhouse effect. Thus, as a clean and sustainable source of energy in the future, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels because it produces water instead of greenhouse gases when combusted [1]. Also, hydrogen has a high-energy yield (122kJg−1), which is about 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels and can be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells [2,3]. Hydrogen can be generated in a number of ways, such as electrochemical processes, thermochemical processes, photochemical processes, photocatalytic processes or photoelectrochemical processes [4,5]. However, these processes require electricity derived from fossil fuel combustion so that they are energy intensive and expensive. Biohydrogen production is potentially attractive, especially if organic waste could be used as a raw material. Many studies have reported on the groundwork for creating renewable biohydrogen production systems through either photosynthesis [6–8] or fermentation [9–11]. Hydrogen production by fermentative bacteria is technically simpler than by photosynthetic bacteria. Also, the fermentation process could generate hydrogen from refuse or organic wastes [1,12]. The generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) amounts to 48,499tonnes per day in Korea, of which 23.2% is food waste from restaurants, dinning halls, markets and households [13]. Food waste is the main source of decay, odour and leachate in collection and transportation due to its high volatile solids (85–95%) and moisture content (75–85%). Most food waste has been landfilled together with other wastes, resulting in various problems such as odour emanation, vermin attraction, toxic gas emission and groundwater contamination. Interest in anaerobic treatment has, therefore, increased for the efficient management of food waste because it has advantages of volume reduction and energy recovery. Hydrogen recovery from food waste has a potential to enhance the economic feasibility of waste treatment than methane recovery. Anaerobic bacteria use organic substances as the sole source of electrons and energy, converting them into hydrogen. The reactions involved in hydrogen production (Eqs. (1) and (2)) are rapid and do not require solar radiation, making them useful for treating large quantities of wastewater. (1) Glucose+2H2O→2acetate+2CO2 +4H2 ΔG =−184.2kJ (2) Glucose→butyrate+2CO2 +2H2 ΔG =−257.1kJ Since they cannot utilize light energy, the decomposition of organic substrates is incomplete and organic acids remain. Nevertheless, these reactions are still suitable as an initial step of hydrogen production from waste, which is followed by methanogenesis. A two-stage process is a rational configuration because it provides the preferred environments for acidogenic hydrogenesis and methanogenesis in two separate spaces. In this study, the BIOCELL process was newly devised as an ideal method for energy recovery from food waste as shown in Fig. 1 . The BIOCELL process consisted of two main parts: three leaching-bed reactors for acidogenic hydrogenesis and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for methanogenesis. Feedstock for this experiment was food waste collected from a dining hall. The composition of grains, vegetables and meats in the waste was 65.5, 26.2 and 8.3%, respectively. Three leaching-bed reactors for hydrogen recovery were operated in a rotation mode with a 2-day interval between degradation stages. It was reported that hydrogen-producing bacteria, i.e., Clostridium sp., could switch from the H2- and acid-producing phase to the alcohol-producing phase depending on the environmental conditions of H2 fermentation, because they formed volatile fatty acids (VFA) during the exponential growth phase but alcohol during the late growth phase [2,12]. Thus, the UASB reactor converted VFA and alcohol generated from the leaching-bed reactors to methane. Each leaching-bed reactor was operated in a sequential batch mode. Seed sludge was inoculated into the reactor after boiling for 15min to harvest anaerobic spore-forming bacteria, i.e., Clostridium sp., for hydrogen recovery [2,14]. After 6h of acclimation, dilution water was provided to the leaching-bed reactor in order to transfer generated VFA and alcohol to the UASB reactor. Dilution rate (D; d−1) is equivalent to Q (flowrate of dilution water; L/d) divided by V (effective reactor volume; L). The proper control of D (4.5→2.3d−1), depending on the state of the fermentation, could make environmental conditions favorable to microbial growth in the fermentation [14,15]. The different sizes of shaded portion in the leaching-bed reactor (Fig. 1) indicated the volume reduction of food waste according to the degradation stages. Hydrogen fermentation of 6 days was reasonable considering operation time and efficiency [15], which was followed by post-treatment of 2 days. The residues were dewatered in the leaching-bed reactor for 6h and then 15L/min of air was introduced through the bottom of the reactor for 42h. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of the UASB reactor treating wastewater with VFA and alcohol generated during hydrogen fermentation of food waste. Although several studies were conducted on anaerobic treatment of wastewater with VFA [16–18] or wastewater with alcohol [19–21], the results obtained from this study are expected to provide some valuable information toward the development of the innovative two-stage process, BIOCELL, for converting food waste to hydrogen and methane."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge Partially granulated sludge was stored at a temperature of 37±1°C for 2 months after it was obtained from a full-scale anaerobic plant treating brewery wastewater. About 8.2L of this partially granulated sludge was used to seed the UASB reactor. The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration and total suspended solids (TSS) concentration of the seed sludge were 7.5, 102.6 and 167.3g/L, respectively."
3,Feed wastewater,"2.2 Feed wastewater Wastewater generated during hydrogen fermentation of food waste was continuously fed into the UASB reactor with a peristaltic pump. As shown in Table 1 , the feed wastewater had a soluble COD of 3.104mg/L, which consisted of VFA (1.891mg COD/L) and alcohol (1.213mg COD/L). The percentage of formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate and lactate in VFA was 1.5, 17.2, 6.4, 49.5, 16.8, 1.7 and 6.9%, respectively, while the percentage of ethanol, propanol and butanol in alcohol was 88.7, 3.8 and 7.5%, respectively. The pH was about 6.7, and the alkalinity was about 2.158mg/L as CaCO3."
4,Experimental set-up,"2.3 Experimental set-up The UASB reactor used in this study was 40.0L in working volume (lower part: 790mm high×200mm inside diameter (i.d.); upper part: 400mm high×220mm i.d.). Five sampling ports were installed along 150mm height intervals from the bottom. At the upper part of the reactor, there was a gas–liquid–solid (GLS) separator. The reactor was operated at a temperature of 37±1°C."
5,COD loading rate,"2.4 COD loading rate The initial loading rate of the reactor was 0.8g COD/Ld, which corresponded to 3.88d of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The loading rate was increased stepwise by reducing HRT, when the COD removal efficiency exceeded 95% and the methane production rate was consistent (within 5%) during 2 weeks of operation. The COD removal efficiency was calculated from the soluble COD in the effluent and the total COD in the wastewater."
6,Specific methanogenic activity (SMA),"2.5 Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) The specific methanogenic activity analysis was performed in duplicates in serum vials (125mL) based on the reported method [22,23] adapted from Owen et al. [24]. Sludge samples were taken for the SMA analysis on day 140, when the reactor was operated at 6.0g COD/Ld with over 96% COD removal efficiency and without detectable VFA in the effluent. The methanogenic activity of the granule (100mg VSS) was measured for a specific substrate (2000mg COD/L). In this study, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, lactate, ethanol, propanol, butanol and original substrate (feed wastewater) were used individually as the substrate."
7,Microbial examination and the particle size distribution,"2.6 Microbial examination and the particle size distribution The microbial examination was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The instruments and the sample preparation procedures were the same as reported previously [25]. At the end of this study, the sludge particles were sequentially separated using six stainless steel sieves (US Mesh No. 10, 14, 18, 35, 60 and 140 with corresponding sieve openings of 2.00, 1.41, 1.00, 0.50, 0.25 and 0.105mm). The sludge samples for the particle size distribution were taken from the second port from the bottom of the reactor."
8,Analytical procedures,"2.7 Analytical procedures VFA was analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, SpectraSYSTEM P2000) equipped with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector and a 300m×7.8mm Aminex HPX-97H column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. H2SO4 of 0.005M was used as a mobile phase at a flowrate of 0.6mL/min. Alcohol was determined by a HPLC (DX-600 Bio-LC system) equipped with an ED50A electrochemical detector and a 250m×4mm CarboPac PA10 column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. Deinoized water was used as the mobile phase at a flowrate of 0.6mL/min. Gas production was determined using a wet gas meter. For biogas composition analyses, a gas chromatograph (GowMac series 580) was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m×2mm i.d. stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100mesh). The temperatures of injector, detector and column were kept at 80, 90 and 50°C, respectively. COD and TKN were measured using the closed reflux, titrimetric method and the Kjeldahl method, respectively [26]. PO4–P was analyzed by an ion chromatograph (Dionex DX-120). Parameters such as TSS, VSS, pH and alkalinity of the effluent were determined according to standard methods [26]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,COD removal efficiency,"3.1 COD removal efficiency Fig. 2 illustrates (a) the COD removal efficiency, (b) the biogas production rate, (c) HRT and (d) the COD loading rate of the UASB reactor treating wastewater with VFA and alcohol throughout the study. As HRT decreased from 3.88 to 0.18d, the COD loading rate increased stepwise from the initial 0.8g COD/Ld to 16.8g COD/Ld. In the first 235 days, the COD removal efficiency was consistently over 96% up to HRT of 0.24d, which corresponded to the loading rate of 12.9g COD/Ld and a food-to-microorganism (F/M) ratio of 0.61g COD/g VSSd. The pH of the effluent was 7.6–7.8, as compared to pH 6.7–6.9 in the wastewater. The biogas production rate increased parallel to COD loading rates and reached the maximum of 216.0L/d at 12.9g COD/Ld. The experimental biogas production rate was compared to the theoretical value as shown in Fig. 2(b), which was calculated as: CODremoved (gCOD/d)×the conversion efficiency of CODremoved to CH4 ×0.3974L CH4/(g COD)/CH4 content of biogas. The maximum COD loading rate (12.9g COD/Ld) was comparable to the maximum VFA-converting activity of 14.0g COD/Ld in a UASB reactor fed with synthetic VFA wastewater [18] and the maximum ethanol-converting activity of 6.8g COD/Ld in a UASB reactor fed with synthetic ethanol wastewater [21]. Beyond this loading rate, the efficiency decreased as the loading rate increased. COD removal efficiency was drastically reduced to about 73% at 0.20d HRT (15.3g COD/Ld), and to about 56% at 0.18d HRT (16.8g COD/Ld). Fig. 3 shows methane production rate, residual VFA, residual alcohol and VSS concentration in the effluent at various loading rates. The methane content of the biogas was measured to be 73–78%. The methane production rate increased linearly with COD loading rates, until reaching the maximum value of 4.1L/Ld at 12.9g COD/Ld. Up to the COD loading rates of 12.9g/Ld, the effluent had less than 40mg COD/L of acetate, 55mg COD/L of propionate, 30mg COD/L of ethanol and negligible quantities of formate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, lactate, propanol and butanol. VSS concentration was maintained below 95mg/L. On the other hand, the residual acetate, propionate and ethanol increased sharply to the levels of 227, 297 and 152mg COD/L, respectively, at 15.3g COD/Ld and further to 378, 514 and 231mg COD/L, respectively, at 16.8g COD/Ld. The VSS concentration in the effluent also increased sharply to 255mg/L at 15.3g COD/Ld, and to 393mg/L at 16.8g COD/Ld. This indicated that the decrease of COD removal efficiency was due to sludge flotation and washout in the reactor, which resulted from short HRT of less than 0.24d (5.8h). Overloading in the reactor led to the increase of primarily propionate, acetate and ethanol in the effluent with some accumulation of reduced products including propanol and valerate. The propionate concentration was highest in the effluent, indicating that the conversion of propionate to acetate was the rate-limiting step. The persistence of propionate has been found in other upset or overloaded digesters [27]. Propanol formation increased when propionate was present at high concentrations in the reactor, and its formation coincided with utilization of propionate when propionate oxidation was energetically unfavorable [28]. The occurrence of reduced compounds like propanol and valerate in the effluent reflects the excess of reducing equivalents occurring in the overloaded reactors. Similar observation occurred in another study using ethanol [19]. Meanwhile, the concentrations of residual butyrate and caproate were the lowest among VFA in the effluent. This indicated that even-numbered carbon fatty acids were degraded more easily than odd-numbered ones, and that their degradation to acetate was not a rate-limiting step. The accumulation of residual acetate was caused by the degradation of other fatty acids to acetate and the oxidation of ethanol to acetate. Residual acetate was not quickly converted to methane, due to excessive washout of methanogens."
11,COD balance and sludge yield,"3.2 COD balance and sludge yield Fig. 4 illustrates that the specific methane production rate (SMPR) increased linearly with the specific substrate utilization rate (SSUR) with a slope of 0.93, until reaching the maximum of 0.55g methane COD/g VSSd at the SSUR of 0.59g COD/g VSSd. The SMPR means the methanogenic activity of the granules under the specific operating conditions of the reactor. Since each gram of methane was equivalent to 4g of COD, the SMPR for the biomass could be estimated from the methane production rate and the total biomass in the reactor [29,30]. The slope indicated that of all the COD removed, 93% was converted to methane and the rest 7% was presumably converted to biomass. Since the biomass in the reactor was measured to have a COD/VSS ratio of 1.36, the sludge yield was estimated to be 0.051g VSS/g COD (=0.07/1.36), which was comparable to the yield values on acetate (0.040–0.054g VSS/g COD), propionate (0.042–0.051g VSS/g COD), butyrate (0.047g VSS/g COD) [31], and long-chain fatty acids (0.04–0.11g VSS/g COD) [32]."
12,Specific methanogenic activity,"3.3 Specific methanogenic activity Table 2 summarizes the SMA of the granules measured in serum vials using six different substrates, i.e., formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, lactate, ethanol, propanol, butanol and original substrate (wastewater). The SMA is an indicator for evaluating the methanogenic activity of the biomass under a condition in which the supply of substrate is not a limiting factor. Corresponding studies on the SMA of UASB granules treating various types of wastewater were also shown for comparison. Each gram of the VFA-degrading granules was capable of producing 0.62, 0.70, 0.59, 1.01, 0.72, 0.78, 0.92, 0.64, 0.61 and 0.71g of methane COD per day from formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, ethanol, propanol, butanol and original substrate, respectively. This indicated that the VFA-degrading activity of granule was the highest for butyrate, and the lowest for propionate. This is consistent with the observation that, at loading rates over 15.3g COD/Ld, high residual propionate was found in the effluent while there was little residual butyrate."
13,Microstructure and particle size distribution of granules,"3.4 Microstructure and particle size distribution of granules As shown in Fig. 5 , SEM observations demonstrated that typical granules were composed of Methanosaeta-like bamboo-shaped rods, which had a width of 0.6–0.8μm and a length of 5.3–6.9μm. It is well known that the predominance of Methanosaeta in granular sludge is the most essential for the establishment of a high-performance UASB process. Methanosaeta is an acetoclastic bacterium using acetate solely as substrate. With a very low half-rate constant of 30mg COD/L, Methanosaeta outcompetes other methanogenic bacteria when the acetate concentration is low, as in the mixed liquor of the UASB reactor and in the interior of the granule [35]. The syntrophic association between acetogens (cocci) and methanogens (rods) allowed the rapid removal of hydrogen, which would otherwise hinder the propionate degradation. Layered microstructure was reported for granules treating wastewater of sucrose [36] and brewery [37], but granules from this study did not exhibit any patterned structure. The microorganisms were distributed throughout the entire granule. The dry weight percent for different size ranges of granular sludge is shown in Table 3 . The original seed sludge had 71.8% of particles smaller than 1.4mm. At the end of this study, 67.9% of the sludge particles were larger than 1.4mm in the UASB reactor. This indicated that partially granulated sludge could maintain the original structure of granular sludge and continue to gain size in the UASB reactor fed with wastewater containing VFA and alcohol generated during hydrogen fermentation of food waste."
14,Conclusions,"The following conclusions were drawn regarding the UASB treatment of wastewater with VFA and alcohol generated during hydrogen fermentation of food waste: (1) The UASB process consistently removed over 96% of COD from wastewater containing VFA and alcohol up to the loading rates of 12.9g COD/Ld. The methane production rate increased to 4.1L/Ld. The COD removal efficiency deteriorated at loading rates over 15.3g COD/Ld, due to sludge flotation and washout in the reactor, which resulted from short HRT of less than 0.24d (5.8h). At these loading rates, high residual propionate was found in the effluent, indicating that propionate degradation was a rate-limiting step. (2) Each gram of VFA-degrading granules in the reactor was capable of converting a daily maximum of 0.55g of COD to methane at the specific substrate utilization rate of 0.59g COD/g VSSd. Of all the COD removed, 93% was converted to methane and the rest presumably to biomass with an average sludge yield of 0.051g VSS/g COD. (3) The SMA using formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, ethanol, propanol, butanol and original substrate, individually, as substrate were 0.62, 0.70, 0.59, 1.01, 0.72, 0.78, 0.92, 0.64, 0.61 and 0.71g methane COD/g VSSd, respectively. This indicated that the SMA of granule was the highest for butyrate, and the lowest for propionate. (4) Typical granules were composed of Methanosaeta-like bamboo-shaped rods. The size distribution of sludge particles indicated that partially granulated sludge could maintain the original structure of granular sludge and continue to gain size in the UASB reactor treating wastewater generated during hydrogen fermentation of food waste."
