0,Introduction,"Fermentative production of H2 (e.g., dark fermentation) from biomass or carbohydrate-based substrates by microorganisms is a ubiquitous, natural phenomenon under anoxic or anaerobic conditions. For instance, microbial conversion of glucose to H2 is thermodynamically favorable with a Gibbs free energy ( Δ G 0 ) of - 206 kJ mol - 1 [1]. A wide variety of bacteria utilize the reducing power generated during degradation of carbon substrates to produce H2 by disposing of reducing equivalents from primary metabolism [1]. Dark fermentation generally results in a higher hydrogen production rate than photo fermentation and is able to produce H2 day and night without the demand of light energy [2]. Thus, dark fermentation has great potential in practical applications and seems to be a promising way for sustainable H2 production [3]. However, the metabolites produced from dark fermentation (e.g., volatile fatty acids and alcohols) require further treatment or utilization [4]. Continuous processes for fermentative H2 production can be divided into two major categories; namely, suspended systems and immobilized systems [5]. Suspended systems allow better mass transfer between microorganisms and substrates, but have difficulty in maintaining a sufficient amount of H2-producing bacterial population in the bioreactor under high hydraulic pressure (or low hydraulic retention time; HRT) as washout of the biomass usually occurs at a low HRT [6]. As a result, many research efforts [4,5,7–23] were made on enhancing biomass retention by using physical or biological immobilization approaches. Three types of immobilized-cell systems have been applied in biohydrogen production, including surface attachment [5,7,9,12,16], self-flocculation [18–23], and gel entrapment [10,13–15] approaches, among which the surface attachment approach was most frequently used for dark H2 fermentation. Activated carbon (AC) was the most common matrix for cell growth and biofilm attachment for H2 production [7,12], while fibrous support matrix [5,16,17] and cellulosic matrix [9] were also used. These matrixes are readily available and easy to handle, but the biofilms were usually not firmly bound on the surface of carrier supports and easily fall off due to shear force or hydraulic pressure. In contrast, cell entrapment allows higher biomass content of H2-producing bacteria in the reactors and creates a local anaerobic environment, which is well suited to oxygen-sensitive fermentative H2 production. Moreover, the entrapped-cell system can be stably operated at a high dilution rate or low HRT without suffering cell wash-out. Hence, the H2 production rate could be enhanced via elevation of organic loading rates [5,11,21–23]. However, the immobilized beads often face a strong challenge in maintaining desired mechanical and biological stability during long-term operation. To date, there are few reports describing the use of cell-entrapment approaches for H2 fermentation [10,13–15]. Cell immobilization approaches (mostly fixed-film or granular-sludge systems) have been applied to produce H2 continuously in fixed-bed (or packed-bed) bioreactors [7,9,12,16,17,21,24], granular-sludge bed bioreactors (e.g., CIGSB) [19,20,22,23], trickling biofilter reactors (TBR) [5], and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) [25,26]. Although fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) possess favorable characteristics for the production of gaseous products, like H2, they have not been widely applied for fermentative H2 production [14,27]. In this study, we utilized a modified FBR, called draft tube fluidized bed (DTFBR), for hydrogen production. Anaerobic sludge immobilized by a novel silicone gel (SC) entrapment approach was used as the biocatalyst in DTFBR, converting sucrose substrate for continuous H2 production. The DTFBR was designed and operated under different substrate (sucrose) concentrations (5–40g COD/l), HRT (2.2–8.9h) and thermal treatment temperatures (50–80°C) to assess the H2-producing ability under different operating conditions. Reproducibility of continuous H2 operations was also examined to evaluate the stability and feasibility of using the SC-immobilized cells in practical H2-producing processes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,H 2 -producing sludge,"2.1 H 2 -producing sludge The anaerobic sludge was obtained from Li-Ming Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant in Taichung, Taiwan. The pH, volatile suspended solid (VSS) and total solid (TS) concentration of the sludge were 6.8, 33.3 and 65.1g/l, respectively. The H2 productivity of the seed sludge was enhanced by thermal treatment at 100°C for 1h to inhibit the methanogenic activity in the sludge. The thermally treated sludge was used for cell immobilization."
3,Medium composition,"2.2 Medium composition The medium used for H2 fermentation consisted of sucrose as the sole carbon substrate (initial sucrose concentration; C So = 5 – 40 g COD/l) [6] and sufficient inorganic supplements [28], including (mg/l) NH 4 HCO 3 , 5240; NaHCO 3 , 6720; K 2 HPO 4 , 125; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100; MnSO 4 · 6 H 2 O , 15; FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 25; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 5; and CoCl 2 · 5 H 2 O , 0.125. Sucrose was chosen as the target carbon substrate because it is a very common substrate for dark H2 fermentation and also leads to excellent H2 productivity [6,7,12–15,22,23,25]. Except for experiments investigating the effect of sucrose concentration, the C So in the medium was 20g COD/l."
4,Immobilization of H 2 -producing sludge,"2.3 Immobilization of H 2 -producing sludge Hydrogen-producing sludge was mixed with AC powder (Union Chemical Works Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan) [15] at a volume (ml) to weight (g) ratio of 10:1. The sludge/activated carbon slurry was then mixed with silicone gel (SC) (weight to weight ratio = 1 : 10 ). The final mixture was then extruded to produce SC-immobilized sludge, which was disc shaped with a height, diameter, and density of 0.2, 0.3cm, and 1.14g/cm3, respectively (Fig. 1 a). The formulation and procedures for preparing the immobilized sludge are detailed in our recent work [15]. The biomass content in the immobilized sludge was ca. 3.75g VSS/kg SC matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (Figs. 1b and c) shows that rod-like bacteria predominantly covered the surface and interior portion of the immobilized disc."
5,Setup and operation of DTFBR for H 2 production,"2.4 Setup and operation of DTFBR for H 2 production Schematic description of the DTFBR is shown in Fig. 2 . The bioreactor was composed of a main column that was 120cm in height, 8cm in diameter and had a total working volume of 8L (including a 4L buffer tank). A high height to diameter ( H / D ) ratio ( H / D = 15 ) was designed to minimize the liquid recycle rate needed for efficient circulation of the immobilized beads inside the DTFBR reactor. The draft tube, with a height and diameter of 90 and 3.6cm, respectively, was built annularly inside the main column. The nozzle with a diameter of 0.6cm was placed on the bottom of the bioreactor, where the medium was fed into the DTFBR reactor containing SC-immobilized cells. The effluent of the bioreactor was introduced into a gas–liquid separator (Fig. 2), where the biogas and soluble products were collected separately. A stainless-steel screen was installed on the top of the reactor to avoid overflow of the immobilized beads (Fig. 2). The composition of gas products (H2 and CO2) and soluble metabolites (volatile fatty acids and alcohols) produced during H2 fermentation was monitored as a function of time. The quantity of the biogas produced was recorded with a volumetric gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25°C and 1atm. The pH and the utilization of sucrose were also determined. An appropriate amount of the SC-immobilized cells were placed in the DTFBR reactor to reach a solid volume of 10% (v/v) (total weight of ca. 912g) (Fig. 2). The temperature of the DTFBR was controlled at 40°C and the liquid recycle rate was set at 6l/min to maintain the circulation of SC-immobilized particles in the fluidized bed. The main purpose of liquid recycling was to assist separation of the biogas from SC-immobilized particles. Otherwise, the bubbles attached to the immobilized particles would make the particles float and cover the liquid surface on the top of the bioreactor, resulting in inefficient and unstable H2 fermentation or even a reactor shut-down. The three-phase DTFBR reactor was operated at a batch mode for 48h to activate the immobilized cells before it was subsequently switched to a continuous mode at a designated HRT. The reactor was then started up at a HRT of 8.9h by feeding fresh medium containing a sucrose concentration of 5–40g COD/l. After reaching steady-state operation (for more than 5 days), the HRT was shifted down stepwise from 8.9 to 2.2h. When the H2-producing activity in the cultures declined during long-term operations, the thermal treatment was performed to restore the H2 performance. The thermal treatment was carried out in a batch mode (the influent and effluent were switched off), as the temperature was rapidly elevated to a designated temperature (50, 60, 70, and 80°C), which was maintained for 1h. After that, the temperature was cooled down naturally to 40°C, and the reactor was switched back to a continuous mode."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Hydrogen was detected by gas chromatography (Shimazu GC-14A) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carrier gas used was argon and the column was packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, Waters Corp., USA). The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by a Shimazu GC-14A using a flame ionization detector (FID). The temperatures at glass column and injection were 145 and 175°C, respectively. The carrier gas was N2 and the packing material was FON (containing polyethylene glycol and 2-nitroterephthalic acid). The sucrose concentration in the effluent was also determined according to Standard Methods [29]. In preparing samples for SEM analysis, the immobilized cells were treated with glutaraldehyde (2.5%) for 3h and were dehydrated by acetone (50–100%) for 30min. The pretreated samples were coated with Au via vapor deposition (Model IB-2, Eiko, Japan). The coated sample was then introduced to the SEM machine (Hitachi S3000, Japan) for analysis."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Improving H 2 production efficiency with the design of DTFBR,"3.1 Improving H 2 production efficiency with the design of DTFBR In our recent work, H2-producing anaerobic sludge was entrapped using several cell immobilization approaches to produce H2 efficiently under various bioreactor operations, including batch bioreactors [13,15], continuous stirred tank bioreactor [30], and fluidized bed reactor (FBR) [14]. Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) [15] and SC [30] have good mechanical strength and were suitable matrices for immobilization of H2-producing sludge, allowing efficient and stable H2 production. However, while using SC-immobilized cells in a FBR for H2 production [14], biogas formation around the beads forced them to float (Fig. 3 ) and the immobilized cells eventually accumulated towards the liquid surface on the top of the bioreactor during long-term operations (Fig. 4 a), resulting in inefficient and unstable hydrogen fermentation or even a reactor shut-down. To solve this floating problem, a DTFBR was substituted for the FBR and the schematic representation of DTFBR is shown in Fig. 4b-1. The DTFBR system was designed to allow efficient separation of the biogas from SC-immobilized particles. In DTFBR, the particles moving towards the top of the reactor were forced to move down into the draft tube by the bulk/local circulating liquid flow (Figs. 4b-2 and b-3). This resulted in easier biogas detachment from the immobilized beads and biogas bubbles assembled and coalesced near the bottom draft tube region and the annular region, respectively (Fig. 4b-4). During the operation, it was also observed that the slug flow formed in the annular region (Figs. 2 and 4b-4), while only a small portion of particles floated on the top of the DTFBR reactor. The foregoing discussion shows that the DTFBR reactor containing SC-immobilized cells seems to be successful and feasible for continuous fermentative H2 production."
9,Effect of thermal treatment on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of thermal treatment on hydrogen production The DTFBR reactor was fed with sucrose-based synthetic medium (containing 20g COD/l of sucrose) and started up at HRT = 8.9 h. After start-up for 1–2 days, the DTFBR started to produce biogas and the H2 content was over 40%. Steady-state operation was achieved within 2–3 days with a volumetric H2 production rate of 0.585 ± 0.013 l / h / l and a H2 yield of 4.08 ± 0.20 mol H 2 / mol sucrose. When the HRT was shifted down from 8.9 to 6h, the H2 content in biogas drastically decreased to 6.2–20.9% before thermal treatment was applied (Table 1 ). Since the feeding medium was not sterilized, this decrease could be due to the contamination of non-H2-producing bacterial populations, which assimilated sucrose to form CO2, but did not produce H2. To improve the H2-producing performance, the culture was subjected to thermal treatment at four different temperatures (i.e., 50, 60, 70, 80°C). The idea was to inactivate the vegetative bacterial population (presumably, non-H2 producers) and select for H2-producing spore-forming bacteria (e.g., Clostridial species) [2], which are resistant to elevated temperatures. Also, it is of interest to identify the optimal thermal treatment temperature for the recovery of H2-producing performance. Thermal treatment is often applied to increase the H2 productivity of seed sludge used for dark H2 fermentation, as the treatment could inhibit or terminate methanogenic activity in the culture, enabling a successful start-up of a H2-producing bioreactor [4,5,31,32]. As shown in Table 1, thermal treatment at 50 and 60°C seemed to be ineffective in restoring the H2-producing performance. Although the H2 content in biogas increased from 16.5–20.3% to 30.1–33.8%, the H2 production rate and H2 yield did not increase notably (Table 1). Meanwhile, this slight enhancement in H2 production only lasted for 13.4 and 21.5h, respectively, before the H2 production performance dropped to near or below the original level. In contrast, thermal treatment at a higher temperature (i.e., 70 and 80°C) allowed a significant increase in H2 content in biogas, H2 yield, and H2 production rate, which were up to 44.6–43.7%, 3.79–3.93mol H2/mol sucrose, and 0.82–0.79l/h/l, respectively (Table 1). This high H2-producing performance can be maintained for over 4–5 days. Thus, thermal treatment at 70 or 80°C seemed to be very effective in eliminating the competition of non-H2 producers for the substrate and possibly allowed rapid re-establishment of efficient H2-producing population. This finding is similar to our previous work, as the thermal treatment approach was also found effective in recovering the H2 production efficiency of various bioreactors during long-term operations [7,14]."
10,Reproducibility of hydrogen production in DTFBR,"3.3 Reproducibility of hydrogen production in DTFBR The mechanical strength and H2-producing stability of the immobilized cells play an important role in a successful operation of the H2-producing bioreactors. In this study, the DTFBR was carried out at progressively reduced HRT (namely, HRT = 8.9 , 6 , 3 , and 2.2h) in two or three independent repeated runs to examine the stability and reproducibility of the immobilized cells. The results from triplicate operations (Table 2 ) were quite similar, as the deviation between the runs was within 5%. This clearly indicates that the DTFBR bioreactor containing SC-immobilized cells had a high reproducibility and stability in terms of H2 production. Table 2 also shows that with an influent sucrose concentration of 20g COD/l, the steady-state H2-production rate ( v H 2 ) increased ca. 1.4–1.9 fold with a decrease in HRT from 8.9 to 3h, while operation at HRT = 3 and 2.2h attained similar v H 2 . The H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) was also within 2.62–4.28mol H2/mol sucrose at HRT = 8.9 – 3 h , while it dropped to 1.9mol H2/mol sucrose at HRT = 2.2 h . In contrast to v H 2 and Y H 2 , the H2 content in biogas ( C H 2 ) and sucrose conversion ( X s ) were relatively invariant with regard to HRT. The C H 2 value essentially maintained at 40–44%. Meanwhile, the mean X s was 92–99%, suggesting stable and efficient utilization of the carbon substrate by the H2-producing culture at all runs."
11,Effects of sucrose concentration and HRT on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effects of sucrose concentration and HRT on hydrogen production For the four sucrose concentrations ( C s ) examined (5–40g COD/l), the volumetric H2 production rate ( v H 2 ) increased 1.9–2.2 fold when HRT decreased from 8.9 to 2.2h (Fig. 5 and Table 3 ), while operating at a HRT of 3 and 2.2h gave similar v H 2 values for all the C s used. The dependence of specific H2 production rate ( v s , H 2 ) on HRT was quite similar to that observed for v H 2 (Table 3). On the other hand, when the HRT was fixed, increasing C s from 5 to 40g COD/l resulted in a 7.0–10.9 and 1.7–3.4 increase in v H 2 and v s , H 2 , respectively (Table 3). The maximum v H 2 was 2.27 ± 0.13 l / h / l (i.e., 54.5l/d/l or 2.23mol/d/l) for C s = 40 g COD/l and HRT = 2.2 h . Apparently, both substrate concentration ( C s ) and HRT strongly affected the H2 production rate. Therefore, it would be of great interest to know how the kinetics of H2 production in the DTFBR system correlated with the combined effect of C s and HRT, representing by the organic loading rate (OLR; OLR = C s × HRT ). As indicated in Figs. 6 a and b, both volumetric ( v H 2 ) and specific ( v s , H 2 ) H2 production rates increased initially with OLR, while the increases slowed down when the OLR reached a higher value. The dependence of v H 2 and v s , H 2 on OLR seemed to behave like Monod-type models (Eqs. (1) and (2)), which were able to describe the trends pretty well (Figs. 6a and b), as indicated by a r 2 value of 0.90–0.94. (1) v H 2 = v H 2 , max OLR K v , OLR + OLR , (2) v s , H 2 = v s , H 2 , max OLR K vs , OLR + OLR . The estimated maximum volumetric H2 production rate ( v H 2 , max ) and maximum specific H2 production rate ( v s , H 2 , max ) was 5.237 and 0.852l/h/g-VSS, respectively, while the Monod (half-saturation) constant for v H 2 ( K v , OLR ) and v s , H 2 ( K vs , OLR ) was 23.1 and 3.61g COD/h/l, respectively. These results suggest that there exists an optimal organic loading rate for achieving the best H2 production rate in our DTFBR system no matter what sucrose concentration and HRT were used. The H2 content in the biogas was essentially within the range of 39–47% (Table 3) during the steady-state operations. Relatively stable H2 content seems to suggest that the H2-producing culture had high operation stability regardless of changes in substrate concentration and HRT. The H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) in general decreased as the HRT decreased. The Y H 2 values were within the range of 2.68–4.98mol H2/mol sucrose for HRT > 3 h , but the Y H 2 considerably decreased at a shorter HRT of 2.2h, especially for the runs with C s = 5 – 40 g COD/l (Table 3). The H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) reached a higher level of 2.92–4.98mol H2/mol sucrose when sucrose concentration was increased to 40g COD/l. The highest yield of 4.98mol H2/mol sucrose is relatively high when compared to comparable studies [23,30,33]. Unlike H2 production rates, H2 yield did not have a universal trend against the organic loading rate. As shown in Fig. 6c, the H2 yield tended to increase with OLR for higher HRT ( HRT = 6 and 8.9h), but was nearly independent of OLR for lower HRT ( HRT = 2.2 and 3h). Therefore, achieving an optimal H2 yield in this system cannot consider the organic loading rate alone, as the HRT or substrate concentration should also be taken into account."
12,Soluble metabolites and carbon substrate conversion,"3.5 Soluble metabolites and carbon substrate conversion The DTFBR system, in general, achieved a high sucrose conversion of over 92.7% except for the runs at a high C s (40g COD/l) (Table 3). This indicates efficient utilization of the carbon substrate by the H2-producing bacterial populations in the system. The lower sucrose conversion at C s = 40 g COD/l may be due to operation at a high organic loading rate (or a high food to microorganism ( F / M ) ratio) that exceeded the maximum capacity those H2 producers were able to handle efficiently. The formation of soluble microbial products (SMPs) tended to increase with the increase in sucrose concentration (Table 4 ). The major soluble metabolites during H2 fermentation were butyric acid (HBu) and acetic acid (HAc), accounting for 62–73% and 17–23% of total SMP, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, production of propionic acid (HPr) and ethanol, which are considered unfavorable metabolites for H2 production [4,34,35], was relatively insignificant (less than 19% of SMP). It has been shown that production of ethanol (EtOH) consumes more electrons from metabolic reducing power, thereby being unfavorable to H2 production [36]. Meanwhile, H2 may be directly utilized for the formation of propionic acid (Eq. (3)), which should be avoided for an efficient H2 production [4,35] (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O . The HBu/HAc ( B / A ) ratio, often used as a performance indicator for dark H2 fermentation, was within the range of 2.9–4.3. These ratios are within the range of favorable B / A ratios obtained from other dark H2 fermentation studies using carbohydrates as the substrate [5,7,12,18,23,31]. Inspection of the composition of the soluble metabolites obtained from this work suggests that the cultures carried out metabolic pathways in favor of H2 production, as the soluble metabolites were predominantly HBu and HAc (combined as 81–90% of SMP). Again, this indicates that the DTFBR system is an effective H2-producing bioprocess."
13,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated an efficient, stable and reproducible H2-producing system by using an innovative draft tube fluidized bed reactor (DTFBR) containing SC-immobilized cells as the biocatalyst. Thermal treatment at a temperature of 70–80°C was shown to be effective in recovering H2 production performance during prolonged operations with a non-sterilized feed. Both sucrose concentration and HRT affected the H2 production performance, while the H2 production rates had a Monod-type correlation with the organic loading rate. The DTFBR system attained a maximum volumetric and specific H2 production rate of 2.27l/h/l (i.e., 2.23mol H2/l/d) and 0.777l/h/g-VSS, respectively. The optimal H2 yield was 4.98mol H2/mol sucrose, which is higher than that obtained in most dark fermentation systems. The butyrate/acetate-dominating metabolite composition indicates that the DTFBR system contained efficient H2-producing bacterial community. The features of excellent H2-producing performance and stable/reproducing operation suggest that the DTFBR system could be a feasible approach for continuous H2 production in practice."
